1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,720
Can I ask you something?

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,440
I just wanna hug you.

3
00:00:09,640 --> 00:00:10,320
What are you doing?

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,360
Hey! Mark! Mark! Mark!

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,560
Kit didn’t get hurt much.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,920
Let me keep my first kiss for the one I love.

7
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:21,840
If he turns you off,

8
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,320
I'll get him.

9
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,760
What's wrong with you?

10
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,520
Rushing me out here.

11
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,880
Look at your face.

12
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,520
What happened

13
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,800
Another enemy shows up.

14
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,880
Thanu's trying to get close to you,

15
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,680
and then Padbok keeps staring at you.

16
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,920
It's time for you to accept me as your boyfriend now.

17
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,880
Jerk.

18
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,600
You wanna get me because you're scared if I might go out with someone else?

19
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,760
You just don't wanna be a loser, right?

20
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
It's because I don’t wanna lose you.

21
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,720
Where are you gonna take me?

22
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,000
Anywhere but here.

23
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,920
Don't ever come here again,

24
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:25,000
I'll be the one who goes to see you.

25
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,520
The Engineer Faculty will be restricted area for you, Kamjornkit.

26
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,240
Effective immediately from now on.

27
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,000
Are these supplies for your new guy, Wayu?

28
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,400
When will you and Sansab stop forcing me to get a new boyfriend?

29
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,960
Koh and Jack are enough to get on my nerves.

30
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,240
Just choose one.

31
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,960
Once you found someone to take care of you, I can freely go with Kit.

32
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,880
I can take care of myself.

33
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,120
I'm not a child.

34
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,840
And again.

35
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,200
If I can’t stop thinking about my ex,

36
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,200
then I can’t start with anyone else.

37
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,280
And how are you gonna…

38
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:57,120
stop thinking about that ex?

39
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,080
It might be when…

40
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,240
he doesn't love me anymore.

41
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,000
Let me get hurt once again

42
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,440
and then I'm gonna move on.

43
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,440
Well. What about you and Kit? How is it now?

44
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,480
Does he give up to you?

45
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,880
Not even a little.

46
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,080
Why do I have to like a tough guy like him?

47
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,200
So stop hitting on him.

48
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,200
No.

49
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,720
Then stop complaining

50
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,560
and continue putting effort into him, understood?

51
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,120
You still think I'm not trying hard enough?

52
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,000
Being a pester.

53
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,760
Being a bodyguard.

54
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
Touching him whenever I can.

55
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:53,280
Already got kissed on both cheeks and on the lips.

56
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,360
No need to tell me all the details.

57
00:06:58,159 --> 00:07:02,280
I just wonder how lucky you are still alive

58
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
from taking so much advantage of Kit.

59
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,000
Oh!

60
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,560
How can I forget? my cupid!

61
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,920
The one and only who gave me a chance to kiss Kit's cheek for the first time.

62
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,720
Everything I have today is thanks to your brother.

63
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,800
Hey!

64
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,120
Super!

65
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,760
My brother?

66
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,520
Yes.

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,440
You mean…

68
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Sansab?

69
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
That's correct!

70
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,040
Trust me. I won't disappoint you.

71
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,400
Um.

72
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,680
That's right.

73
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,000
My brother, Sab won't disappoint you for sure.

74
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:09,800
Oh. I forgot. This is Klui, my classmate.

75
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,640
I got him particularly for this mission.

76
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:17,360
Classmate?

77
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,480
I heard he called you as his brother, was that right?

78
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,280
I asked to be his sidekick, sir.

79
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,880
Don't worry.

80
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,240
I'm gonna train you in everything I know.

81
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,320
Show Mark what you've got, my brother Klui.

82
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,640
Sure!

83
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,720
Hey…

84
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,360
After I did some research about Kit.

85
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,400
By the time of his birth he must be smart

86
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,240
witty,

87
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,400
thoughtful

88
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,600
and decisive.

89
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,400
Being respected by everyone he meets.

90
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,280
Even by….

91
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,920
Animals

92
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,480
Whoa! That's exactly true!

93
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,960
Even those dogs at his faculty still respect him.

94
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,640
I guarantee you.

95
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,880
Speaking about love,

96
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,920
He's tough, hard to love and a close-lipped person.

97
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,480
If he agrees to be in a relationship with someone,

98
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,640
that guy must be serious and persistent.

99
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:24,480
Those people who just come by and flirt around him,

100
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,440
never get their chance

101
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,680
The only way to win his heart is…

102
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,800
is…

103
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,840
If it's that hard,

104
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,440
so I just jump him and make him mine.

105
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,600
Hey!

106
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,080
Well.

107
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,800
That will be easy for you, Mark.

108
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,160
Easy your ass! What a silly!

109
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,600
You're gonna get him ditched.

110
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,080
That's true.

111
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,880
Who'll dare to be that jackass to Kit.

112
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,680
If I fail,

113
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,920
not only my head will be cut off,

114
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,200
but also something else….

115
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,120
It's gonna be crazy.

116
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,400
Well, here…

117
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:11,200
Pretend that you didn't hear anything Mark.

118
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,880
I have another idea. I'm telling you, it's super.

119
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,560
It's called…

120
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,720
How to let the world remember you by love confession.

121
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,080
MKLM, Mark Kit Love Mission

122
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,560
What's that?

123
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,480
Impress him with a wonderful love confession. Make it big.

124
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,360
Fire works, parades, formations, transform letters. Bring them all bro!

125
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,000
So romantic.

126
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,160
That sounds good,

127
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,280
but if it isn’t great like you said, there's no turning back.

128
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,840
Yeah,

129
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,560
Not only no turning back.

130
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,560
But no hope.

131
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,360
No love.

132
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,240
No chance.

133
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,760
Nothing at all.

134
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,240
Klui! Don’t you learn?

135
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:56,400
If you can’t say something good so don't say a thing.

136
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:02,000
Okay. Let's talk about the plan.

137
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,200
First thing that you need to do is….

138
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,080
Hello Mark.

139
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,720
Phai, order whatever you want.

140
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:20,320
I already ordered for Kit.

141
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,560
Why you talk to him so politely,

142
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,160
How about me?

143
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Well.

144
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,600
Your brother's name is Wayu, not Kamjornkit like Phai's

145
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:33,000
Hey.

146
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:36,960
Why were you busy every holiday when I asked you out for a date.

147
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,080
but when it's about Wayu, you just show up.

148
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:43,280
Let's see if you were being ditched,

149
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,800
having a broken heart

150
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,200
or couldn’t contact your lover for a year.

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,680
Wanna try?

152
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,440
Have mercy to Mark please, Kit.

153
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:54,680
Please

154
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,320
Thank you everyone for today.

155
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,760
As you guys know,

156
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,000
Yu still can't get over Pha.

157
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,520
Even now there are good guys like Koh and Jack try hitting on him.

158
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,280
As his brother.

159
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,200
I wanna see him move on.

160
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,120
So I have some ideas for you to vote.

161
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,080
How?

162
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,760
I will tell you one by one.

163
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:29,640
First.

164
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,000
I'm gonna tell Koh and Jack

165
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,960
ask him to be a boyfriend.

166
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,160
If Wayu accepts to be a boyfriend with any one of them,

167
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,280
consider the mission accomplished.

168
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:42,440
Um…

169
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,240
But what if he won't choose any of them?

170
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,600
If he won't, then we go for plan B.

171
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,840
Which is let him break both Koh's and Jack's heart

172
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:58,480
and then try matching him with a new guy.

173
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,600
This time we're gonna find the most popular one.

174
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,480
Actually I've already got one.

175
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,520
Who, Sab?

176
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:11,360
That handsome guy that Yu mistook for Pha.

177
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,800
His name's… name's… name's

178
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,320
Can’t recall his name.

179
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,000
He is Kit's senior,

180
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,400
He's familiar but I can't remember.

181
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,120
It's… It's on the tip of my tongue.

182
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,200
He's Thanu,

183
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,680
studying Doctor and used to be a Collegue Beau.

184
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,320
His profile is almost the same with Pha.

185
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,720
Amongst those ones who're trying to flirt with Yu,

186
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,160
he's the most promising, more than Koh and Jack together.

187
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't think this plan's gonna work.

188
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,120
No matter how similar he is,

189
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,680
but for love,

190
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,400
no one can replace anyone.

191
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,400
Do you have any other plan?

192
00:13:58,320 --> 00:13:59,360
Yes, I have.

193
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,040
The last one, digging at the root.

194
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,480
The reason Yu still can't get over him is,

195
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,320
because he was dumped out of the blue.

196
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,120
If he can make up with Pha

197
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,440
and find out what Pha's reason was.

198
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,560
Then reconsider the feeling once more.

199
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,320
Let them clear the air if there's a chance to return.

200
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,560
So everyone can move on.

201
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,360
I agree with you.

202
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,440
If they dont clear themselves with each other, Yu won't get over it.

203
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,720
Because he always hopes that Pha's gonna come back.

204
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,360
This is the best plan.

205
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,280
But it's impossible.

206
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,520
How can we find him from nowhere?

207
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,760
But if you have to choose one, which one do you choose?

208
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,760
What's plan A again?

209
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,000
Plan A is…

210
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,760
So I just….

211
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
bring Wayu to the meeting point, is that all?

212
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:28,960
Yes, sir.

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,120
Then let us prepare those stuffs for surprising.

214
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:37,920
Once we get the exact date and time, I will let you know.

215
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,560
So…

216
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,400
the meeting is over for today.

217
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:51,560
Let's do it everyone! Yeah!

218
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,560
Good job you guys.

219
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,840
I thought you wouldn't join us.

220
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,240
There's no choice.

221
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,960
I just wanna make Wayu feel better.

222
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
If we don't do this with someone like him,

223
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,880
he'll never accept his feeling.

224
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:17,600
Well,

225
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,160
I've never seen anyone be so frank about their feelings like Mark.

226
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,680
Are you gonna change side?

227
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,400
I just respect Mark.

228
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,200
For others who try flirting with you,

229
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,240
just my little bluff can threaten them away.

230
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,640
But Mark, he's the real man. Never give up.

231
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
Don't you feel something for him?

232
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,800
Did he offer you a bribe?

233
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,640
What!...

234
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,840
What do you think I am?

235
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:53,480
Now I can tell you which one's crushing on who.

236
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,840
If you can tell…

237
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,720
so it means you already had a crush on someone, right?

238
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,680
Who? Tell me now.

239
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,480
How do you think like that? No!

240
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,640
Not at all, really.

241
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,520
There.

242
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,359
There. Why do you look away?

243
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,079
I didn't see you just a little while.

244
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:23,440
You grow up and have love life now, Phai.

245
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,480
Kit, it's your call.

246
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,800
Pick up for me and tell that I'm showering.

247
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,000
Hello Kit. Are you at your dorm?

248
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I'm gonna call you on and return your lecture.

249
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,480
I'm Kit's brother, sir. He's showering.

250
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,400
It's okay, so I'll leave it with you for Kit.

251
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,600
I'll get there in 15 minutes.

252
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,680
Okay sir.

253
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:15,240
In 15 minutes? Hope Kit'll finish showering in time.

254
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:40,040
Whoa.

255
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,320
So on time, Thanu.

256
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,960
I thought I have to go down waiting for you.

257
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,600
Sorry for the urgent.

258
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I remember that your exam is next week.

259
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,040
So I return it with all my comments.

260
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,400
Ah. Keep it for the exam.

261
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,200
Thanks sir.

262
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,760
That's good so I can go over it with your comments again.

263
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,000
I'm sorry that

264
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,520
I'm the reason why you had to fight with Padbok.

265
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,440
Don't worry. It's not your fault.

266
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,640
Also we're all good now.

267
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,800
I won't bother you now,

268
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,240
since I heard that your brother is with you.

269
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,960
Bye.

270
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,760
Not bother at all, Thanu.

271
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,800
Please get inside and relax.

272
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,280
We always stay up until late.

273
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:48,240
Kit, I want cotton… bud.

274
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,840
Just heard his voice.

275
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:07,880
How clumsy of me.

276
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,560
Sorry Kit. I dropped your lectures.

277
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:56,800
It's alright.

278
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,680
I put them in such a mess and suppose to arrange them later.

279
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,760
And…

280
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,400
these lectures, did you do by yourself?

281
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:09,440
I got them from my seniors and friends.

282
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,520
They were mixed by many subjects.

283
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:15,480
You can read them if you want.

284
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,800
I don't think I will, they are too much.

285
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,880
Well, Jack. Koh.

286
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,720
Why did you guys buy the same doll?

287
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,440
Koh!

288
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,880
Did you copy me?

289
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,800
Who's copying who?

290
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,560
You don't have your own idea, right? That's why you copied me.

291
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,640
I was born before you,

292
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:11,440
I bought it first.

293
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,880
Even born later you can buy it first.

294
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,120
I actually gave it to Yu before you.

295
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,920
What! But I'm sure I got it first.

296
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,240
I'm the first.

297
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:24,520
I told you about these guys, great minds think alike.

298
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,760
Well, I believe you.

299
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,000
But you see, they are fighting now. Help me stop them.

300
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,720
Wait. Let me handle them.

301
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,880
What're you gonna do?

302
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,880
I bought it since last 2 weeks.

303
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:39,000
I got it for a month.

304
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,000
Sir!

305
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:46,000
Today, let's shake hands with each other like a man for a good friendship.

306
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,200
Please.

307
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
If anyone be a good lad,

308
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,880
I'll give him a kiss on Wayu's cheek as a reward.

309
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,840
Come on.

310
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,360
Okay!

311
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:59,760
Okay, here we go.

312
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:10,680
Welcome again to the battle to win Wayu's heart.

313
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:15,640
We're still on a mission with our lovely same old Wayu

314
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,120
and the two challengers, Jack - Engineer

315
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,640
and Koh - Dentistry.

316
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:28,120
Now, we shall see who’s the one to give the most impressive answer.

317
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:32,800
Here, the question from Wayu is…

318
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,360
Jack and Koh,

319
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,480
What's the reason that makes you like me?

320
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,280
Okay, now you hear the question.

321
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,080
Then listen to our rules.

322
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:49,080
The first one who can answer, is the fastest who raise his hand.

323
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:51,600
Keep your hands in your pockets please.

324
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,320
Alright!

325
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,040
Once I count to one,

326
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:56,600
the first one who raise his hand will answer first.

327
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,920
Ready?

328
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,000
Okay!

329
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,520
Three!

330
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,400
Two!

331
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,560
Jack…

332
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,760
Wait until I count to one please.

333
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,280
Three.

334
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:09,960
Two.

335
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,120
One. Raise the hand!

336
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,640
Ahhhh…

337
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,200
Koh is the first one who can answer.

338
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,440
So brilliant to be the fastest one!

339
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,080
and the answer of Koh is…

340
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,160
I saw you since you were with Pharawee.

341
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:29,600
I just think you're cute.

342
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:31,000
But one day.

343
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:34,000
I saw you sad, broken down like that…

344
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,400
I wanna protect you,

345
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:37,160
take care of you and don't let you sad again.

346
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:43,400
My affection started from that day.

347
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,680
What's happen, Jack?

348
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:49,960
Don't tell me that you are so into my story.

349
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,400
Into your ass!

350
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,040
I'm only into Wayu, Jerk!

351
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,040
Alright!

352
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,400
How about your answer, Jack?

353
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,520
Why do you like my friend?

354
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:08,960
I like when you smile.

355
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,680
Every time when I get mad, your smile can blow it away.

356
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,280
If I could own this smile,

357
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:23,040
I promise to make you smile like this every day.

358
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,600
And what are you smile for, Koh!?

359
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:34,720
Well, born to be Wayu is so hot!

360
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Even you cry or smile,

361
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,760
there always have someone fall in love.

362
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,920
Then what will you say, Wayu?

363
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,400
Which one you like?

364
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,640
A person who's whenever I laugh or cry...

365
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,360
happy

366
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,800
or sad.

367
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,120
Whatever happens,

368
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,440
will always support each other forever.

369
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,360
Alright.

370
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,040
You've already listened to Wayu's answer.

371
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:20,560
You can see that Jack and Koh are each half of Wayu's answer.

372
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,280
If they're merged, it must be perfect.

373
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:27,600
So you guys, Do you interest to unite together as one?

374
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,000
- No!
- No!

375
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,960
Pug face likes him, even he kneels down and begs,

376
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,800
I'll never accept his love.

377
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,960
A guy like you. I'll never love you too.

378
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,160
Who's gonna love you, jerk?

379
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:39,120
That's why I can't love you.

380
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,040
Do I look like I love you?

381
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:42,480
I won't buy you too!

382
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,560
Have you ever look at your face in the mirror?

383
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,760
How about you?

384
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:48,160
It looks like they're picking a fight.

385
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,920
I need to end the live now. See you next time.

386
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,720
I guarantee that there will be a surprise for you next time.

387
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,800
Byebye.

388
00:26:58,520 --> 00:26:59,040
Whoa!

389
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,640
I won't love you for sure.

390
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,440
Jack! Koh!

391
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,800
Sit down.

392
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,640
Calm down, please.

393
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:06,720
Listen to my plan first.

394
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,360
If Kit watchs our live today.

395
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:13,520
It's gonna be perfect for our surprise plan.

396
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:19,280
Make him aware that you guys are begging for love from Wayu.

397
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,920
Understood?

398
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,560
I have to thank you guys very much.

399
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,640
Once I end up with Kit,

400
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,960
I will arrange everything for you.

401
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:32,600
But now,

402
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,760
me and Yu will gotta go.

403
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:37,080
So smooth!

404
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,640
I remember you said that the reward is kissing on Wayu's cheek.

405
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:43,080
I'm not involved.

406
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,040
Mark said it himself.

407
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,200
Then you shoud kiss his cheek for that.

408
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,320
Nope! Wayu.

409
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,480
If I have to kiss Mark, I better kiss Koh.

410
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:56,400
Jack, do you feel anything for me?

411
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,680
You!

412
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,920
Why don't both of you open your mind for each other?

413
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,560
You guys may get a new relationship.

414
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,600
I can be your captain supporting the ship.

415
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,840
Which one do you wanna name it?

416
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,640
Koh-Jack or Jack-Koh?

417
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,960
It's must be Jack-Koh!

418
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,160
No! Koh-Jack!

419
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:13,600
I'm your senior, kid!

420
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,920
Whoa! But I'll lead you, because I'm the smartest.

421
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:17,600
I'll leave you guys here to disscuss about it,

422
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,000
Me and Yu're gonna go now.

423
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,920
Good luck and thanks for today sir.

424
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,360
But I'm smarter than you, My name should come first.

425
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,640
So, Koh-Jack.

426
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,680
It's must be Jack-Koh!

427
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,480
Koh-Jack.

428
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,400
Hey! Mark! Get back here!

429
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,440
Wayu!

430
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,280
Mark!

431
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,040
Wayu!

432
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,760
Always support each other forever.

433
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,160
Who're you chatting with?

434
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,160
Friend.

435
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,720
If friend so why're you try to hide something?

436
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,920
It's my personal chat.

437
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,040
Then why are you mad?

438
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:57,400
or that friend you said is…

439
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,800
is…

440
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,600
Someone who you wanna flirt with.

441
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:07,920
It's not that.

442
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:09,560
Yes, it must be.

443
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:14,000
Tell him that … you are occupied.

444
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,720
I marked you here.

445
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,080
It's gone already, sorry.

446
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
That's too long ago.

447
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,920
Ah!

448
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:25,320
Then guess that I have to extend it.

449
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,000
Why do you wear glasses?

450
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,840
Avoid me to kiss you?

451
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,400
Being with someone like you,

452
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,000
I have to protect myself.

453
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,240
What's wrong with me?

454
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,200
I was even the one who took your first kiss.

455
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,680
You returned me a kiss on second

456
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,400
and I kissed you here on third.

457
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:08,720
Then the fourth kiss…

458
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,400
When was it?

459
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,600
Oh!

460
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:16,400
I kissed you on the day you got hurt.

461
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:20,120
See, I'm innocent! There were the reasons for them.

462
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,320
Be careful who you blame,

463
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,040
you might need to pay me with the kiss.

464
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,800
I don't need details and stop being close too much.

465
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,760
You never speak your mind.

466
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:45,720
I know you like me.

467
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,720
Where do you get that ego?

468
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:51,160
If you don't like me

469
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,920
then how comes we get four kisses now.

470
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,400
Hey. Stop talking about…

471
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,280
You're cute with glasses,

472
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,240
but I wanna see you clearly.

473
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,920
Clear enough.

474
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,400
I won't do anything to you today,

475
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,920
because I wish that

476
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,080
once we get our fifth kiss,

477
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,480
I would be your boyfriend already.

478
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,160
You think you could collect my kisses and then get me as your boyfriend?

479
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,080
I guess five times are not enough.

480
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,280
It should be around a hundred.

481
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:29,920
Just end it here with four.

482
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,840
Wait for it!

483
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:36,360
I'm gonna make you admit that you like me.

484
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,920
Nonsense.

485
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,720
Glasses…

486
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,720
If I return it,

487
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,720
will you talk to me nicely?

488
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:52,560
Let's go.

489
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:53,160
Hey.

490
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,600
How about those surprise stuff for Wayu?

491
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,320
Wayu. Wayu. Wayu.

492
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm not Wayu who you miss everyday.

493
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,360
Wayu is Wayu and you are you.

494
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,520
What are you comparing for?

495
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,960
Not only bias, but you're still chatting with someone else.

496
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:46,240
Kit…

497
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:49,320
Why do you worry who I'm chatting with?

498
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,840
I just don't want you to be shaken with someone else.

499
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,800
Stop being paranoid.

500
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,720
I don't have anyone but you.

501
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,440
So can I assume it myself that…

502
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,440
Just straight to the point.

503
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,280
How are you guys working on Wayu's surprise now?

504
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,440
I assigned Jack, Koh and the team already.

505
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
Everything will be ready on Friday's afternoon at the activities area.

506
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,720
Friday… this Friday?

507
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,120
Isn't it too soon?

508
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,680
The sooner the better for getting closer.

509
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,480
Friday's afternoon.

510
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,880
Friday's afternoon, would you bring Wayu to me?

511
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,000
I don't have much time. Please don’t tell him where I am.

512
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,280
It's not the time for him to see me. Can you help me Kit?

513
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,320
I just wanna see his face once.

514
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:12,679
Why must it be that day?

515
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:38,360
Guys, let's take a break and get some vitamins.

516
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:40,480
For your refreshment.

517
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,480
Yeah.

518
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah.

519
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:51,560
Well, when it was about group work, you always used me.

520
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,000
Not being concentrated like this.

521
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,520
Come on, it's because tomorrow is the most important day of my life.

522
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,840
Mark.

523
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:03,960
Let me tell you...

524
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,280
about surprise things…

525
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,040
Their result can be success or failure.

526
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:13,200
I only want you to reserve for your disappointment.

527
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,440
Just prepare yourself, okay?

528
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:17,760
I know.

529
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,040
But my sense tells me that It’s gonna be great this time.

530
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,040
Mark.

531
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:29,600
Who do you think is more difficult between Yu and Kit?

532
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,400
Of course Kit.

533
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,720
It's not true.

534
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,720
Koh told me yesterday that he asked Yu for a dinner.

535
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:41,160
He kept waiting for an hour but Yu still didn't show up.

536
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,680
Yeah,

537
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,680
Jack complained about it too. So they both failed?

538
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,760
You are so mean, Yu.

539
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,400
I didn't wanna go.

540
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,640
Why I have to? A single man like me have a right to choose.

541
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:02,120
Those two, they didn't fail.

542
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:07,200
Please know that they went to eat with each other eventually.

543
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,800
Well, we might as well…

544
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,440
Huh!

545
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,400
Huh!

546
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,360
Klui!

547
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:36,360
Jack and Koh, since they waited until late.

548
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,280
So they decided to have a dinner together.

549
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:38,840
Aow!

550
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:40,320
Isn't it the same?

551
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,200
Noo! Get this!

552
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,560
What's happening with them?

553
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,920
Did they start eating each other?

554
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,600
Shipping them now?

555
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,080
Speaking of them,

556
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,880
if they were to end up together,

557
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:54,440
it's because of you for being their cupid.

558
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:03,640
Sandee.

559
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,680
Did you remember when we talked about destiny.

560
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,560
Of course yes. What are you up to?

561
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,200
Well…

562
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,000
You believe in destiny now, right?

563
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,520
It might be just an accident.

564
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,240
They call accident if you face with it a few times.

565
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,520
But if it's destiny,

566
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,640
it'll keep coming back to you.

567
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,800
And in the end,

568
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,520
you're gonna believe it.

569
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,640
May be you're right.

570
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,440
If it isn't the right time...

571
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:01,960
Even how hard we try but we won't find our soulmate.

572
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:07,120
You might be defined to get that kind of destiny.

573
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,000
Friday's afternoon, would you bring Wayu to me?

574
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,760
I don't have much time. Please don’t tell him where I am.

575
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,520
It's not the time for him to see me. Can you help me Kit?

576
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,160
I just wanna see his face once.

577
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,560
Why does it has to be that day?

578
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:39,640
Friday?

579
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:40,800
This Friday?

580
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,840
Is it too fast?

581
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:48,400
The faster the better for getting closure.

582
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:12,240
You guys ready?

583
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,880
Ready!

584
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,880
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Kit's here. Stand by.

585
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,920
Kit, what's going on? You called me for….

586
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,520
Wayu, come with me.

587
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:27,160
Wait.

588
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,760
Kit, where will you go?

589
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,560
You call me here, don't you?

590
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:33,160
Go with me now. There's no time.

591
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:34,800
Hey, wait Kit.

592
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,160
I think… now,

593
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:41,360
We should probably wait here. Am I right?

594
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:42,520
Wayu,

595
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,640
I'm sorry to ask you now

596
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,760
Have you totally forgotten about Pha

597
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:49,400
Hey, Kit. Look at that!

598
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,040
Kit look!

599
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:09,760
Kit,

600
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,920
I have know Mark for more than ten years.

601
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:17,520
Even if he's such a jerk, playful but always getting on someone's nerve

602
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,440
but I know that he really likes you.

603
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:25,360
And I also know that

604
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,560
he surely won't make you sad.

605
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,360
I hope you're gonna give my friend a chance.

606
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,120
Do you know?

607
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,720
Since the first day you were mad at me.

608
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,240
I couldn’t stop thinking about you.

609
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:02,800
Wipe your eyes and know that I'm your senior.

610
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,760
Okay sir, Kit.

611
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,120
I wanna see your face every day.

612
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,240
Sometimes I wanna see when you get mad.

613
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,520
Don't ever let me see your face again! Such a…. Jackass!

614
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,320
Sometimes I wanna make you laugh.

615
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:33,240
Gosh! Will you gonna kiss?

616
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,400
Every time when I'm with you.

617
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,080
My feeling keeps growing up.

618
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,000
More and more clearly.

619
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:01,840
I like you.

620
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,560
Like when you're being yourself.

621
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:07,840
Like how straightforward and tough person you are.

622
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,320
Like everything about you, Kit.

623
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:18,040
Here in front of my best friend.

624
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:22,880
I swear that I'll do my best to take care of you.

625
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,120
Kit.

626
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,080
Will you be my boyfriend?

627
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:48,400
Kit…?

628
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,560
Mark, listen.

629
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,440
This is not the right time.

630
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:58,480
But why?

631
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,480
Let's talk later.

632
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,680
Now let me go deal with this important thing.

633
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,880
That thing... it's more important than us?

634
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:17,640
I'll get back soon, then we'll talk about it.

635
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,160
I'll explain to you later, come with me now.

636
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,760
Wait, Kit! Where are you taking me?

637
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:48,240
Are you going to change the status to be "in a relationship with"

638
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,760
or are you gonna follow him to the booking restaurant?

639
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,800
Of course that we need to move to the restaurant first, Sab.

640
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,720
You see, Kit's ahead of us already.

641
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,720
I guess he must be so happy until get hungry.

642
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,720
Not even aware that he's dragging the wrong one.

643
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,960
His boyfriend is here!

644
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:11,520
Kit. Kit!

645
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,160
Where are you taking me?

646
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,560
Kit.

647
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,360
Why did you leave Mark like that?

648
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,560
Kit, let me go.

649
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,240
I'll go back to Mark.

650
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:24,000
Come with me Wayu.

651
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,880
It's now or never.

652
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,080
I don't really know if I can get to him again.

653
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,200
You mean…

654
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,000
Pha?

655
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,080
Wayu.

656
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,640
That's Pha's car.

657
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,880
Hello Pha, Where are you?

658
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:14,720
You can't go anywhere. You must stay and talk to Wayu first.

659
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:18,720
Pha, Do you hear me?

660
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:24,880
Where are you? I come to see you now.

661
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:27,000
Pha.

662
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,720
I wanna see you.

663
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,080
Please come to me.

664
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,760
Pha... Say something to me, please.

665
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,840
Just let me hear your voice for a word.

666
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,240
Pha, can you hear me?

667
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:03,600
It's me your Wayu.

668
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,920
You can't do to him like this, Pha!

669
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,400
Pick up!

670
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,680
Pha…

671
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:50,520
Kit…

672
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:56,120
Why is he doing this to me?

673
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,400
He doesn't wanna see me.

674
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:03,200
He doesn't love me anymore right?

675
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:07,720
Kit. Tell me.

676
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:10,000
Why is he doing this to me?

677
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:19,360
He doesn't love me anymore.

678
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,440
Don't worry.

679
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,960
I'll talk to him.

680
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,400
Have some rest.

681
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,320
Wayu.

682
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,880
Give me a call if you need.

683
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:04,720
Kit.

684
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:07,840
I'm…

685
00:51:07,840 --> 00:51:09,360
sorry.

686
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,200
I didn't expect that you'll get angry.

687
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:15,400
Because you chose this plan yourself.

688
00:51:16,840 --> 00:51:17,560
Kit.

689
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,520
It's my fault too.

690
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,160
That's alright.

691
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,640
But where is Mark?

692
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:27,320
Did you eat anything?

693
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,480
Let's get straight to the point.

694
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:43,240
I waited for you here all day long.

695
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,120
I brought Wayu to Pha.

696
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:55,040
It's only today that those two guys got a chance to see each other.

697
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,880
Is their matter so important to you ?

698
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,400
How about me?

699
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,000
Can you tell me how  important am I to you, Kit?

700
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:17,840
Don’t compare. It's not the same.

701
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:22,960
I kept thinking about

702
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,200
why do you always choose to go with someone else.

703
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:33,240
It's because I've never been in your sight.

704
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,240
But it doesn't matter.

705
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:43,320
I don't wanna hear about them anymore.

706
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:48,960
Just answer me what I asked.

707
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,800
This isn't the right time to answer you.

708
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:56,920
Then when is it?

709
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,320
How long are you going to let me love you alone?

710
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:17,480
Can't you be my boyfriend, P'Kit?

711
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:30,960
This is not really the right time, Mark.

712
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,880
Then when will it come?

713
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:41,200
I did everything.

714
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,040
Until there's nothing left.

715
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:48,400
You still don't choose me.

716
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:52,840
Mark, give me a chance.

717
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,800
I think it's enough.

718
00:54:59,600 --> 00:55:02,040
I won't bother you anymore.

719
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,280
I'm gonna give up

720
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,600
and disappear from you.

721
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,920
You don’t need to do anything.

722
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,800
I will be the one who goes.

723
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,560
Pha.

724
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,800
If you hurt, say it.

725
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:58,960
Express your feelings. Is it that hard?

726
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,200
Pha. Finally, you come back to me.

727
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,000
I'm... not ready to meet Thanu.

728
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:15,920
Shady.

729
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,680
Please, don't give up on me.

730
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,680
Hey Kad, what're you doing?

731
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:30,400
Look at this.

732
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,720
ZEED SIM

733
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:34,320
