1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:02,800
I hope you can find the one you’re looking for soon.

2
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:06,960
Those pictures

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,120
that we saw are our future?

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,720
You know

5
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:19,520
every minute we spend together is very valuable to me.

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,120
Don't you want to sleep over with me tonight?

7
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,560
Good night.

8
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,280
I’m very happy.

9
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,760
I was so glad

10
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,120
to get the blessing

11
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,560
that we’ll hold our hands

12
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,480
and grow old together.

13
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,720
When I cruised with you today,

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,800
no one has ever made me feel like this before.

15
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,680
We only just started.

16
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,880
I promise that I’ll make you even happier than today.

17
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,440
What do I have to do to also make you happy?

18
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,600
Being my good boy is just enough.

19
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,880
Thank you for letting me take care of you.

20
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,120
We’re together,

21
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,640
we should be happy together.

22
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
Don’t you want anything from me at all?

23
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,520
Why are you so kind tonight?

24
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,000
Is this the real you?

25
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:05,040
Do you still feel hot?

26
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,280
I’ll bring you some cold water.

27
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:10,320
You’re so boring!

28
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,920
Why are you mad? Did I do anything wrong?

29
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,680
You still don’t get it, silly?!

30
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,880
You can’t change your mind.

31
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,440
I won’t stop this time.

32
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:46,920
Then, don’t stop.

33
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,200
P’Kit?

34
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,080
P’Kit?

35
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:31,680
P’Kit?

36
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:36,880
P’Kit?

37
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,800
You told me not to stop,

38
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:46,040
but why did you stop yourself?

39
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,960
Ran out of battery?

40
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,080
Even when you're sleeping,

41
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,050
I won’t stop.

42
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:01,600
I really won’t stop.

43
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:36,000
I will not stop.

44
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,280
Not that I wanted to stop.

45
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,680
when you're this cute when you’re drunk.

46
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,120
It’s even harder for me especially

47
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,000
You know,

48
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,600
I often play dirty jokes on you,

49
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,680
it’s only because I want to make you happy.

50
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,080
Please wake up.

51
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,760
Please.

52
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,560
I want to make you know

53
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,600
how much I love you.

54
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,320
Uhh.

55
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,400
Just cuddling is fine.

56
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,160
From now on...

57
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,000
every liquor and alcohol

58
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,560
already banned from Mr. Kamjornkij.

59
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Do you understand?

60
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,600
You promised me now.

61
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:04,040
Why is Mark's watch here?

62
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,440
Aww, P'Kit.

63
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,440
You woke up?

64
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,880
Let me clear things up with you about last night.

65
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,960
What do you mean?

66
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,800
Last night….

67
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,000
I thought I was good at it,

68
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,760
but I can’t even compare myself to you.

69
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,080
Why? What did I do?

70
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
If you can’t get up,

71
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,120
I’ll take care of you.

72
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:14,360
Because last night you were so cute, my baby.

73
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:16,320
Stop saying vaguely.

74
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,680
What did I do?

75
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,280
You really can’t remember?

76
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,640
Don’t ask me "what”.

77
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:34,520
You’d better ask...

78
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,400
“how many times”.

79
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,080
Liar! I’m not that kind of person.

80
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,400
I really underestimated you.

81
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,720
I didn’t expect a nerd like you,

82
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:50,120
in bed, would be so…

83
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,560
Enough!

84
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,640
I don’t want to know.

85
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,840
Well. Since we now belong to each other,

86
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,920
I want to give you my important thing.

87
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
For an Engineering student,

88
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,200
this thing is precious.

89
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,640
I sweated blood to earn it.

90
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
But for me,

91
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,560
to get you as my boyfriend is way harder.

92
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:02,920
Have you ever heard of this?

93
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,800
Heart at gear.

94
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
Gear is heart.

95
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:08,440
Gear with who.

96
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,000
Heart with him.

97
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,600
I want to give you my heart.

98
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,040
Don’t take it off.

99
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:54,000
I want my heart to be with you at all times.

100
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,240
Um.

101
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,320
I’ll take the best care of  your heart.

102
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,080
I had them tailored

103
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,080
so they match just like the watch you gave me.

104
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,440
You copied me.

105
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,600
Let’s say you and I are of the same mind.

106
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,720
P’Kit.

107
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,720
Hmm?

108
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,400
Did you forget something?

109
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,080
Imprint your heart on my gear, too.

110
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,080
I gave you mine.

111
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,920
Keep it well.

112
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,280
I promise that I’ll take good care of it.

113
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,119
I’ll ask you again.

114
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,079
You must answer me seriously.

115
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:10,520
Okay.

116
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,520
Last night.

117
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
So, how many times did we do it?

118
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:24,560
You exaggerated! I won’t buy it.

119
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,760
Do you want me to prove it?

120
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:29,760
I’m still up for it.

121
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,560
You're up for it, huh? Huh! Up for it?!

122
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,520
Oops! Ouch!

123
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,280
Still fine? How about now?

124
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,560
It hurts!

125
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,720
Don’t sit on the blanket!

126
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,840
P’Kit… Why aren’t you wearing pants?

127
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,880
No matter who you have in your heart.

128
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,960
My feelings are still the same.

129
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,360
Would you let me keep loving you, P’Thanu?

130
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,360
I’m sorry, Phai.

131
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,160
It’s all my fault.

132
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,120
Why are you sitting here alone?

133
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:51,200
You look lifeless lately.

134
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,720
Something’s bothering you?

135
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:58,120
Sandee.

136
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:02,080
Do you think people can change their thoughts?

137
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,040
Why do you want to change?

138
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,720
I want to define my own life

139
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,240
and not let it depend just on destiny.

140
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,400
Basically, I just don’t wanna be heartbroken because of someone else.

141
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:20,640
You told me that you half believe in destiny,

142
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,880
but now your belief has changed?

143
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,240
What did you see?

144
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,200
I can’t tell you if people can change their own destiny.

145
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,200
But if you need any help,

146
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:39,400
just tell me.

147
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,240
I’ll try.

148
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,840
Maybe I can change it.

149
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,520
Thanks a lot for your advice.

150
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Um.

151
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,600
Hey, Phai. Sandee.

152
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,600
Aw.

153
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,680
Our seniors will take us for a tour of their dormitories tomorrow.

154
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,680
Are you interested?

155
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,360
Sure. I am thinking about it, too.

156
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,760
Sandee, will you join us?

157
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,400
I’m not sure if my parents will allow me to stay in a dorm.

158
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,320
But just taking a look shouldn’t hurt.

159
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,040
Um.

160
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,320
But I’ll have to excuse myself.

161
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,640
I’ve already stayed in a dorm since I moved here from Chiangmai.

162
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,200
I don’t want to move again.

163
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
Really! We got to be in the same faculty.

164
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,880
I thought that we'd stay together.

165
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,080
Being buddies, like me and my brother.

166
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:30,920
Good, right?

167
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,320
Who told you that I’ll stay with you?

168
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,680
Aow! Can I stay with you? Please brother...

169
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,720
It’s okay. I’ll ask Pok.

170
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,080
He’s probably practicing swimming by now.

171
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,320
I heard that he made it to the final round.

172
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,640
Don’t be a third wheel, Phai.

173
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:49,520
You should let him alone with Tong.

174
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,400
Pok is alright.

175
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:59,880
But Tong seems to not let it happen that easily.

176
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,480
Okay.

177
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,000
I think we should use our “wrap them up” plan

178
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,400
with Pok and Tong. Isn’t it good, P’Sab?

179
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,360
What’s got into you?

180
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,480
Give him a lesson, Klui. tryout!

181
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,760
Let’s see, who will win?

182
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,120
It’s me.

183
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,680
It must be me.

184
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,480
I’m better than you.

185
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,040
I’m better than you.

186
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,280
But I’m the best.

187
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:24,160
Start the battle!

188
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,960
I’ll decide who'll go through to the next round.

189
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,960
Go.

190
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,560
I was shot into my heart.

191
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,680
It’d be too late if you let me down.

192
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:37,920
Would you help? Give me love to make my heart beats again

193
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,280
You shot into my heart.

194
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,360
I’ll die if you let me down.

195
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,200
Please help me.

196
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,120
I win! I win!

197
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,600
Hey, wait!

198
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:45,200
I win.

199
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,640
If you maintain this performance,

200
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:59,240
the gold medal won’t be beyond your reach

201
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,240
on the final round the day after tomorrow.

202
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:02,720
Okay, sir.

203
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,040
It’s enough for today.

204
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,560
See you tomorrow and don’t be late.

205
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:16,760
Sure, sir

206
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,200
Are you waiting for me?

207
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
Um.

208
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,800
Are you free tomorrow afternoon?

209
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,280
You said that you’ll treat me to dinner,

210
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,640
I’ve decided where we should go.

211
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,280
I’m available.

212
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,560
Actually I planned to survey the dorms with Phai and friends.

213
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,680
But it’s alright since you’re more important.

214
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,440
The restaurant is quite far though.

215
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:01,800
You okay, right?

216
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,120
Um, It’s fine.

217
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,560
I’ll just skip the afternoon training.

218
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,240
Hey! Is that okay?

219
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,400
Your final round is coming up on the day after tomorrow.

220
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,800
You know when my competition is as well?

221
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,920
I’m sure.

222
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,440
I’ll win.

223
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,520
Since I’ve been doing this,

224
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:24,440
this year I’m in my most top form.

225
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,200
I absolutely won’t miss the gold medal.

226
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
Um.

227
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,600
See you tomorrow then.

228
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,120
I’ll send you the location.

229
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
Okay.

230
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,200
Wait, Tong.

231
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,320
Well…

232
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,120
Shall we go back together?

233
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,160
Do we go the same way?

234
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,720
Um.

235
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,320
But you didn’t know where my house is yet.

236
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,400
Let me drop you off once

237
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
then I could memorize it.

238
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,360
How long will you take a shower?

239
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:08,280
I’ll wait if you won’t take long.

240
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,880
I’ll do it quickly.

241
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,680
Welcome everyone to my dorm.

242
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:54,320
It’s the most luxurious and located in the best location amongst the others.

243
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,440
Although I haven't been here a while lately.

244
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,440
Haven't been for a while?,

245
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,480
then where have you been?

246
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,480
Well…

247
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,400
He has been in a mosquito net on the lawn around here.

248
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,440
You have a lawn? Since when?

249
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,680
Well… We’re thinking of

250
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,200
“P’Kit hand on his room to Phai”

251
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,920
or “I hand on mine to Sansab”

252
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:23,480
since we’re sharing the same room now.

253
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:25,480
Shut up, Mark!

254
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,880
You should return your dorm and move to mine,

255
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,680
then deposit your future rental fee as our savings account.

256
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,560
Well.

257
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,440
Let's open our joint account now

258
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,520
at the Government Savings Bank.

259
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,080
Who told you that I’d move in with you?

260
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,480
Don’t spread the fake news!

261
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,800
So, should we go to his room

262
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,960
or the Government Savings Bank?

263
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,440
Okay. Let’s go to his room.

264
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,320
Let’s go.

265
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,240
(Mark's room)

266
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,600
Come in.

267
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,560
Oho! You have a bathtub, too!

268
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:04,720
Your bathroom’s so awesome!

269
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,880
(Kit's room)

270
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,000
Check this out!

271
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,320
(Wayu's room)

272
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,640
Keep it now.

273
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
Is this yours, P’Yu?

274
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,960
Just keep it!

275
00:28:06,040 --> 00:28:07,640
As far as we saw,

276
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,040
my favorite is P’Mark’s room

277
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,720
Such a pity that there’s none available.

278
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,240
That’s normal since this semester hasn’t finished yet.

279
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:17,760
If there’s someone moving out, I’ll let you know right away.

280
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,600
Count me in, please.

281
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,880
You’re such a parasite, Klui.

282
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,280
I told you wherever you go,

283
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,000
I’ll follow you, P’Sab.

284
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,720
I’m your buddy.

285
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,640
Is there anyone else interested in this dorm?

286
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,840
If not,

287
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,360
I’ll reserve one.

288
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,960
But you said your parents might not allow you to stay in the dorm?

289
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,280
Well...

290
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I saw P’Wayu’s dorm and I like it.

291
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,600
So I think I’m gonna ask my parents about it.

292
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:48,720
Also, there’ll be a lot of activities in the Comm. Arts.

293
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,280
It’s true.

294
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,040
There’re a lot of activities in the first year.

295
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,280
As your second-year senior,

296
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,520
I suggest you join all of them,

297
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,560
especially the traditional freshmen activity.

298
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
It’s the best!

299
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,880
Well, since we’re here,

300
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
Listen.

301
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,600
Is there anyone interested in seeing how the seniors prepare for the freshmen day?

302
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,160
Me!

303
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,920
Are you sure, Mark?

304
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,360
It’ll spoil their excitement.

305
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,800
That’s alright.

306
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,240
They’re only preparing the venue,

307
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,520
there’s no rehearsal today.

308
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,840
If our 3rd year senior said so.

309
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,560
It means...

310
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,960
okay!

311
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,680
Yeah!

312
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,080
You look more excited than those kids though.

313
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,960
Well, sure.

314
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:33,040
I’m turning to be a second year senior.

315
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,360
I’ll leave out my necktie and wear a normal uniform like yours.

316
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:40,880
So everyone will stop saying you seduce a younger one.

317
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,600
You’ve been asking for it.

318
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
Learn this kids,

319
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,640
don’t dare with your senior…

320
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,680
partner

321
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,320
Left.

322
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,720
A little more to the left.

323
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,040
To the right

324
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,960
A bit more to the right.

325
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,320
Left or right? Make up your mind.

326
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,560
I think it’s already perfect.

327
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,040
Perfect for you, you said?

328
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,640
It’s okay now.

329
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,160
So, you change your faculty to Communication Arts now, Jiw?

330
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,600
You’re babbling.

331
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,800
You see that I’m just helping in the public area.

332
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:32,800
Public area?

333
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,240
The sign says Nitede (Comm. Arts) like that.

334
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:38,480
Just leave it.

335
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,600
I’d better help too.

336
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,720
Good view over here.

337
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,320
Do you need any help, Alice?

338
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,680
It’s alright, P’Jack.

339
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,200
She has me helping already.

340
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,080
Um.

341
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,080
Of course, P’Jack.

342
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,520
Please help me paint this one.

343
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,360
Sure.

344
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,040
This one, right?

345
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:03,600
Yes.

346
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,040
Okay.

347
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:08,760
Well, would you help me on this, too?

348
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,520
Certainly.

349
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:10,560
This one,

350
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,760
and this one…

351
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,280
this…

352
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,280
and this one, too.

353
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Would you?

354
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,520
Sure.

355
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,440
Thank you, P’Jack.

356
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,400
I need to check something over there.

357
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:24,800
Thanks again.

358
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,240
Where’re you going, Alice?

359
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,320
Alice.

360
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,000
She’s gone now.

361
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:31,920
Only you and me here.

362
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,400
Hey, Koh!

363
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,760
If you want to give up on Wayu,

364
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,520
then don’t aim for my new target.

365
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,120
What right do you have to stop me?

366
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,800
Finders keepers!

367
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,560
Wayu isn’t open

368
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,360
so I’ll have to aim for the next station.

369
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:59,080
Are you seriously going to be of the same mind as me, Koh?

370
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:16,080
I just remember that I have something to do.

371
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,280
Excuse me.

372
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,680
Hey, Koh!

373
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,080
You can’t leave me like this!

374
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,520
My arms will definitely come off of my body painting these.

375
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,560
We finished checking out the dorms and will stop by at the activity area.

376
00:32:39,560 --> 00:32:43,440
- We finished checking out the dorms and will stop by at the activity area.
- See you there.

377
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,080
Jack.

378
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,040
Do you also come to help here, Thanu?

379
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,440
I’m here for something.

380
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,080
How’s Padbok?

381
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,720
As far as I can see,

382
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,720
he seems alright.

383
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:05,760
Don’t think too much about that day

384
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,040
If I were you

385
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,360
and saw like that...

386
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,880
I’d do the same.

387
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:11,880
I understand.

388
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,080
Thanks for understanding.

389
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,160
Admit it.

390
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:24,000
You also have some feelings for Wayu.

391
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,720
Otherwise, you wouldn’t be so mad

392
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,280
and punched Padbok like that.

393
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:41,120
Um.

394
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,280
Look.

395
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,040
What do you think?

396
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:51,680
It looks super massive right, P’Kit?

397
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,240
Get over here, soon-to-be Nitede freshmen.

398
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,360
I’ll take you guys to meet with your seniors.

399
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,639
Follow me.

400
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,320
Come on.

401
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,320
Hello, sir.

402
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,400
You go with me, Phai.

403
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,000
I’ll take you to your faculty’s booth.

404
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,360
Okay.

405
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,080
I’ll go to my Medicine faculty then.

406
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,080
See you later.

407
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,520
Look!

408
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,639
Oho!

409
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,600
Who's the kid that  Wayu brings?

410
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:47,000
I brought our soon-to-be freshmen to meet with his seniors.

411
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:48,040
Introduce yourself.

412
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:49,960
Hello, sir.

413
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,120
My name’s Phai.

414
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,280
I’ll look forward to your guidance.

415
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,760
You’re so cute, Nong Phai.

416
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,880
Are you going to be our new Beau?

417
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,280
Look at this face, this eyebrows.

418
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,680
He’ll be our next Beau for sure.

419
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:06,920
Train him well, okay.

420
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,440
Nong Wayu.

421
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,360
P’Jack.

422
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,720
I’ll be back.

423
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,480
Do you need any help?

424
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,560
That’s alright, Nong Phai.

425
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:20,280
How can I ask for your help when this is for the freshmen?

426
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:23,840
You should hang around to survey the college area

427
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,200
or our faculty building.

428
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,360
It’s not far from here.

429
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:28,720
That way.

430
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:31,800
Oh, okay sir.

431
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:35,600
Hey, I brought our tag.

432
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,760
Hurry guys.

433
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,680
Oops, sorry.

434
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,920
Put it here.

435
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,920
P’Jack.

436
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,080
Thank you for helping me separate P’Padbok and P’Thanu on that day.

437
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,120
if I didn’t have you,

438
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,960
it would be a big deal.

439
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,600
I’m done with you guys now.

440
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,000
That’s alright.

441
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,640
I have to thank you for Padbok,

442
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,760
that you care for him.

443
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,440
I knew who was the real one you care for.

444
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,440
You don’t get my joke.

445
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,800
I’m really sad.

446
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,280
P’Koh’s coming to you.

447
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,680
You better go.

448
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,040
No.

449
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:40,680
I wanna wait and see what kind of plan Thanu used,

450
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:45,520
to snatch you from me.

451
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,880
Would you let me love you, P’Thanu?

452
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:15,160
I might have gotten you wrong with P’Pha previously.

453
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:17,680
But trust me...

454
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,040
All I see now is...

455
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,560
P’Thanu.

456
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,240
I just finished surveying the dorms with my friends.

457
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,240
Then, P’Kit brought us here to see the location for freshmen day.

458
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,920
This place...

459
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,200
looks familiar to me like I saw it before.

460
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,680
It’s the same place we saw.

461
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,360
Those visions that we saw,

462
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:03,240
do you think they will happen to us?

463
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:06,280
If they’re our future,

464
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,640
they might happen.

465
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,040
You saw them too, right?

466
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,720
That our future...

467
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,480
might not be only us...

468
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,720
No matter who you have in your heart…

469
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:33,360
My feelings will still be the same.

470
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,960
Would you let me love you, P’Thanu?

471
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,560
I’ll try not to let it happen.

472
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,040
I won’t let anyone be sad

473
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,200
because of me.

474
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,400
We will never run away from it, right?

475
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,520
What do you mean, Phai?

476
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,480
Do you mean...

477
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:23,600
destiny...

478
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,520
or fate?

479
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:36,240
I mean anything that is joking on us.

480
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,960
Love is to find someone who’ ll make you understand the meaning of it.

481
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,000
Yes, P’Kit.

482
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,000
I’m just hanging around.

483
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,680
I’ll get back to the activities area now.

484
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:25,960
Yes.

485
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:33,000
I have to go now.

486
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,600
Don’t think over it too much.

487
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,320
It’s not certain that what we saw is going to be our destiny or fate.

488
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:46,680
It might be nothing or just a dream.

489
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,240
They might not happen in our real life.

490
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,480
I want to take you somewhere.

491
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,240
Would you go with me?

492
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:17,040
Hello, everyone.

493
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,720
Hello.

494
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,480
They’re freshmen.

495
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
From Nitede you know.

496
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,160
Whoa! Come here.

497
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,600
Get over here and dance.

498
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:31,000
My friend, he’s so good at dancing.

499
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,960
Being in Nitede, you need to be confident.

500
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:34,800
Get over here.

501
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:35,840
Go go go.

502
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,400
They’ll show you how to dance.

503
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,480
What’s your name?

504
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,120
I’m Sandee..

505
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:41,320
How about you?

506
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,080
I’m Klui.

507
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:44,240
But P'Mark.

508
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,720
Well, since you’re here, Mark.

509
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,760
Get over here and dance.

510
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,480
You stand at the center

511
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,880
Ah! let’s start.

512
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:55,880
Ready!

513
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:57,320
Watch me.

514
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,440
Ready!

515
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:00,040
Three! Four!

516
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,840
Hip Hip.

517
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,280
Hip hippo.

518
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,560
Oh ho so big.

519
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,280
Shambling.

520
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,160
La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la.

521
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,360
Hip Hip.

522
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:13,400
Hip hippo.

523
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,600
Oh ho so big.

524
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,920
Shambling. Shambling.

525
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:20,080
La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la.

526
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:21,960
Whoa! Such a babysitter!

527
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,000
Who dares to say that turning to be a second year student is an elder.

528
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,440
Shambling. Shambling.

529
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:31,480
La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la.

530
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,240
Oh, Phai. You’re here?

531
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,560
P’Kit

532
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,240
I spent too much time talking to P’Jack and have no idea where Phai is.

533
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,240
I just talked to him.

534
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:47,600
He said he’s around here.

535
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:48,640
He’s coming soon.

536
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,200
I’m so relieved.

537
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,520
I thought I lost him already.

538
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,760
P’Thanu too.

539
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:59,160
He said he’s coming.

540
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:01,120
But there’s no sign of him yet.

541
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:02,120


542
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,480
This is beautiful.

543
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
Do you recognise this place?

544
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,560
Yes.

545
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:25,440
I was standing here in that picture.

546
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:30,800
And I was here.

547
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,240
Since we’re here together now.

548
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,080
Do you think this is the picture we saw in our head?

549
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,360
Now we know where it is.

550
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:52,920
If we don’t want it to happen,

551
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:54,880
we just won’t be there

552
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,960
and don't do the things we saw.

553
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,480
I…

554
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,000
I gotta go.

555
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:08,600
P’Kit has been waiting.

556
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,680
Phai…

557
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,880
What’s the matter?

558
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,960
Something got into my eye.

559
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,960
Stop.

560
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:20,720
Don’t rub it.

561
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,320
I’ll look for you.

562
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:44,720
Keep blinking.

563
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:48,640
Close your eyes.

564
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:51,360
And open your eyes again.

565
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,840
It’s okay now.

566
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:12,720
Well.

567
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,840
I gotta go.

568
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,680
Sorry. We can’t go with you.

569
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,800
We need to be here to help them.

570
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,960
Have fun.

571
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,400
Keep working.

572
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:52,240
I’m rooting for you.

573
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,920
I’ll keep practicing until I dance flawlessly.

574
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,200
You’ll see.

575
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,880
Just go already.

576
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,840
Bye.

577
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,000
- Where are you?
- Where are you now, P’Thanu?

578
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,800
- Where are you?
- Where are you now, P’Thanu?
- Did you arrive?

579
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:47,400
You’re good at cutting, right?

580
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,440
Wanna try cutting someone out?

581
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:52,800
You cut it.

582
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,280
Cutting who, P’Kit?

583
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,000
Joking.

584
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,400
P’Thanu.

585
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,080
You haven’t been here for so long.

586
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,240
Have you got lost?

587
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:06,520
Yu has been looking for you so that his neck turns around.

588
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,720
Mark.

589
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,960
Kit.

590
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,560
Can you help me with something?

591
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:19,160
I want to keep distance with Wayu for a while.

592
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,600
P’Thanu,

593
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,360
Can I ask you why?

594
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,360
I feel like...

595
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:32,200
I’m not good enough.

596
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:35,160
Are you overthinking?

597
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,880
Aren’t you giving up too soon?

598
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:42,120
You knew that Yu can get over P’Pha because of you.

599
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,480
Aren’t you afraid that you’re hurting him again?

600
00:48:46,680 --> 00:48:49,040
I have to keep the distance

601
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,520
because I don’t want him to get hurt more.

602
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,000
Is this your solution?

603
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,480
If you don’t want my friend to hurt more,

604
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:00,200
you should make yourself be good enough for him,

605
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,320
not leave him like this.

606
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:03,640
Mark.

607
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:04,640
Enough.

608
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:09,960
P’Thanu.

609
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,720
To compare you with other people who’re trying to hit on Wayu,

610
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:19,080
I can only see that you’re the best choice

611
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,760
and he seems to like you better than anyone else.

612
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:31,160
But you and him are still not together.

613
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,040
I can’t stop you, if you decided.

614
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,960
P’Thanu,

615
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,840
Can I ask you one more question?

616
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,240
Besides Wayu,

617
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:54,800
you aren’t interested in anyone else, are you?

618
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:59,640
I’m not doing this because of someone else.

619
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,440
It’s only for his own good.

620
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,600
Okay.

621
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:13,200
If you decide to fall back,

622
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,960
we'll respect your decision.

623
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:20,040
Thanks for understanding.

624
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,320
He was really leading him on.

625
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:46,360
Nong Wayu.

626
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:49,040
I got a new game for you.

627
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,840
Do you want me to install it?

628
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,440
Maybe later, P’Koh?

629
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,200
But it’s so fun.

630
00:50:56,200 --> 00:50:58,240
If you start today, you’ll get triple points.

631
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:03,680
You’re here, Koh?

632
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:07,920
You tricked me to paint all by myself.

633
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,680
You go finish the rest now!

634
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:10,680
I can’t, P’Jack.

635
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,760
I have to install this game for Nong Wayu first.

636
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,200
P’Jack,

637
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:15,840
I’ll leave P’Koh with you then.

638
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,840
Thanks.

639
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,920
You come with me now!

640
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,240
Go finish it!

641
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:29,360
Where is P’Thanu?

642
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,520
He’s gone.

643
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:37,200
He has just arrived.

644
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,160
Where did he go?

645
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:44,000
He said his drawing class was rescheduled earlier.

646
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,640
So he had to hurry.

647
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,680
Really?

648
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,760
Can’t he just wait for me a bit?

649
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,840
Tong.

650
00:52:58,640 --> 00:52:59,840
Tong.

651
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:04,480
Pok’s still waiting for you.

652
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:07,040
What are you doing?

653
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,280
You guys are supposed to meet.

654
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,080
Why are you avoiding him?

655
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,960
I’ll tell you later.

656
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:18,960
Galae...

657
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,240
Is there someone with him right now?

658
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:23,840
No.

659
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:25,720
I saw him sitting there alone.

660
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:33,880
Can you check on him in 10 minutes?

661
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:39,880
What are you guys playing?

662
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:42,240
So, why have to meet.

663
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,200
So confusing.

664
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,240
Hey.

665
00:53:59,240 --> 00:54:00,120
He’s gone.

666
00:54:01,340 --> 00:54:02,340
I think...

667
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,280
He must have left.

668
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:06,920
He left?

669
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:09,240
I didn’t see him at the table.

670
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:10,360
He must have gone back.

671
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,200
Excuse me.

672
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,120
Can you call a security guard?

673
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,640
There’re teenagers fighting in the restroom.

674
00:54:21,040 --> 00:54:22,800
What happened?

675
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,040
Pok!

676
00:54:45,480 --> 00:54:46,480
Pok.

677
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:48,840
Hang in there!

678
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,080
Galae, get an ambulance!

679
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,600
Don’t.

680
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:55,040
I...

681
00:54:56,040 --> 00:54:58,840
I don’t want to be cut off from the athlete quota

682
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,160
because of this.

683
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,400
Hey, but...

684
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,880
Galae!

685
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,840
Let’s take Pok out of here before the guard comes.

686
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,560
Careful.

687
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,320
Where does it hurt?

688
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:16,320
This arm.

689
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,760
Careful.

690
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,680
Let’s go.

691
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,920
What happen?

692
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:26,920
What do we do?

693
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:28,480
He doesn’t seem so well.

694
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:37,240
Let me call an ambulance.

695
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:39,080
Tong, please.

696
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:41,640
Can you hear me, Tong?

697
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:43,000
Tong?

698
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,240
Hush now.

699
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,680
Let me think.

700
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:39,760
You woke up?

701
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,040
Hey.

702
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,480
You can’t go anywhere.

703
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,080
What time is it now?

704
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,280
I have to go for the game.

705
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,320
You can’t go like this.

706
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:02,760
You’ve got wounds everywhere.

707
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:04,880
Everyone will know that you got in a quarrel with someone.

708
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,960
Step back. I’ll go.

709
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:08,720
Pok!

710
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:09,970
Pok!

711
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,800
You won’t make it.

712
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:18,640
It’s too late now.

713
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,080
The game is over.

714
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:37,960
Careful.

715
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:49,240
What did I do to you?

716
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:55,280
Why did you fool me?

717
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,080
Why do you hate me so much?

718
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:03,480
Pok.

719
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:07,640
I’m...

720
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,040
When they were beating me up,

721
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:19,720
You know what they said?

722
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:22,560
They told...

723
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,360
If I wanna know why I have to face this.

724
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:27,400
Let's ask “Tongtrai”.

725
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,360
Pok…

726
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:41,720
I’m sorry.

727
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:45,080
If I knew that it would turn out this way.

728
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,760
I...

729
00:58:48,440 --> 00:58:50,440
I wouldn’t do it.

730
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:56,000
You admit it now?

731
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,520
Pok…

732
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,320
Go away.

733
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,880
Leave me alone.

734
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,120
Isn’t it too late to help me now?

735
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,280
Where are you going?

736
01:01:07,480 --> 01:01:09,160
Bathroom.

737
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:14,560
Do you need any help?

738
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,480
Don’t.

739
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,240
Before you blame me.

740
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,560
You should better heal yourself first.

741
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:27,320
I’ll make up for my mistake

742
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,280
until you are satisfied.

743
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,840
Hello, coach.

744
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,480
I’m sorry sir.

745
01:01:52,760 --> 01:01:56,320
I suddenly got sick, so I didn’t let you know beforehand.

746
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,360
What happened to your face?

747
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:00,960
Uhh…

748
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,520
It was an accident, sir.

749
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:09,040
Such a pity, that game would be the good end for your youth tournament.

750
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,480
However, it has been done anyway, we can’t do anything now.

751
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,560
Just think as if you gave a chance to newcomers then.

752
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,440
P’Pok.

753
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:19,640
Hello.

754
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:22,160
Where have you been?

755
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,560
I was sick.

756
01:02:25,120 --> 01:02:26,840
Congratulations, Daniel.

757
01:02:26,840 --> 01:02:29,080
Thanks for winning the championship for our school.

758
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:32,160
Whoa. You would do much better.

759
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:53,000
Are you sure it was him?

760
01:02:53,800 --> 01:02:55,000
I’m sure.

761
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:56,960
It was him.

762
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,520
There was only one who used the locker on that day.

763
01:03:43,360 --> 01:03:44,160
But...

764
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,800
why did he do that?

765
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:51,880
Do what I say. If you don’t want to be exposed.
The president cheated on the exam.

766
01:04:12,360 --> 01:04:13,520
Hey!

767
01:04:15,320 --> 01:04:17,640
Why do you have to be so mad at Tong?

768
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,280
If he hadn't helped you that day, you’d have been worse off.

769
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:26,400
Do you think a kiss after a kick will make amends for what he did?.

770
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:27,680
Let me go.

771
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:29,320
I’ll go clear up with him.

772
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,240
Tong!

773
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,200
Where are you going?

774
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:44,960
In case you don’t want to see my face.

775
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:48,600
I don’t really,

776
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:50,880
but you said...

777
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:53,840
after I recover,

778
01:04:53,840 --> 01:04:55,400
you will make it up.

779
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,800
Tell me what you want me to do.

780
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:04,000
Find me a dorm

781
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,920
that is safe enough

782
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,880
so that I won’t be attacked again.

783
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:12,440
Well,

784
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:14,400
I’ll try.

785
01:05:14,760 --> 01:05:17,680
But if you tend to pick up a fight like this,

786
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,640
there won’t be any safe place for you.

787
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:27,920
I won’t take it by myself again anymore.

788
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:31,720
If I got beaten, you would be too.

789
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,200
What do you mean?

790
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:40,840
We are going to stay in the same room.

791
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:46,600
Are you sure?

792
01:05:47,640 --> 01:05:50,760
You hate me so much that you don’t even want to see my face

793
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:53,960
but you’ll get up to see me every morning?

794
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,600
I’m sure.

795
01:06:01,680 --> 01:06:03,200
Whatever.

796
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:05,600
Then don’t change your mind later.

797
01:06:53,200 --> 01:06:54,360
I bought it for you.

798
01:06:57,720 --> 01:06:58,880
Thanks.

799
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:01,280
Who are you waiting for?

800
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:02,320
P’Thanu?

801
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:10,640
Well, he probably has to talk to the professor all day.

802
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:16,040
Should we find somewhere to sit?

803
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:17,400
Mark is coming.

804
01:07:25,360 --> 01:07:30,600
I'm... a bit busy.

805
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:32,840
I've been quite stressed out lately.

806
01:07:43,120 --> 01:07:45,320
Nong Wayu.

807
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:46,720
There’s a new game cafe just opened.

808
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,200
Wanna go?

809
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,520
Mission complete!

810
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:42,680
Come over here.

811
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:47,640
Ready?

812
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:50,080
Hip Hip.

813
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,279
Hip-hippo.

814
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:52,720
Oh ho so big.

815
01:08:52,720 --> 01:08:55,479
Shambling. Shambling.

816
01:08:55,479 --> 01:08:58,319
La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la La-lun-la.

817
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:06,040
Here.

818
01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,800
Be respectful!

819
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:14,080
Thanks.

820
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:17,000
This one’s for you.

821
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:24,080
Thanks a lot for the cooperation.

822
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,840
It’s like in spy movies.

823
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:33,960
Don’t you feel guilty about Wayu?

824
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:38,840
I would hate you so much if we were him.

825
01:09:40,240 --> 01:09:42,279
If you want to hate anyone.

826
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,920
Go, hate him.

827
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:49,640
Thanks for helping.

828
01:09:51,660 --> 01:09:53,720
What’s wrong with you, Thanu?

829
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,000
Why are you avoiding him?

830
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:57,120
Are you guys mad at each other?

831
01:09:59,290 --> 01:10:00,760
If I were him,

832
01:10:00,760 --> 01:10:02,800
I would be mad even more.

833
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:05,480
Why don’t you just talk to him?

834
01:10:06,210 --> 01:10:09,600
It's probably better to let him be mad at me now.

835
01:10:44,580 --> 01:10:46,360
Why are you avoiding me?

836
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,200
You don’t have anything to say to me at all?

837
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:02,360
It doesn’t matter.

838
01:11:04,310 --> 01:11:07,000
I just want to tell you that...

839
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:10,200
if you don’t want to see me anymore,

840
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:13,000
you can just tell me.

841
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:16,240
You don’t need to avoid me.

842
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:18,960
Wait, Wayu.

843
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:47,080
Let's make a deal.

844
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:49,360
We'll live as a friend.

845
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:52,440
No matter what happen...

846
01:11:53,260 --> 01:11:54,720
Do not cross the line.

847
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:03,320
185 P'Wayu.

848
01:12:04,000 --> 01:12:05,080
P'Thanu.

849
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,960
Phai is my peer mentee.

850
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:21,320
I told you already, right!?

851
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:22,520
Why didn't you clean the room

852
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,000
before everyone came tour!

853
01:12:24,280 --> 01:12:26,280
I'm really sorry.

854
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:28,280
I will not do it again.

855
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:32,720
Angry?

856
01:12:34,810 --> 01:12:35,800
Do you?

857
01:12:39,580 --> 01:12:41,080
Please don't be angry.

858
01:12:41,250 --> 01:12:42,480
I promise.

859
01:12:42,710 --> 01:12:44,080
I will not do it again.

860
01:12:45,610 --> 01:12:46,800
Okay.

861
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,520
You're not angry with me, right?
