1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:02,440
I promise.

2
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:04,160
No matter what happens,

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,240
we'll get through it together.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,120
Before we stay together, we need to make a deal first.

5
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:11,120
We only stay together as friends

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,720
and won’t cross each other's line, no matter what.

7
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,600
I’ve decided.

8
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:21,080
The one I want beside me is Wayu.

9
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,400
It wasn’t P’Pha.

10
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,040
But it was you...

11
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
Who saved me...

12
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,200
last year…

13
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,520
when I fell off.

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,600
Was it really you?

15
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,480
I remembered saving a kid,

16
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,079
but I didn’t really get to see his face clearly.

17
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,000
I left him to Pharawee.

18
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,360
Because Padbok needed me.

19
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,600
Why?

20
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,840
Why didn’t P’Pha tell me in the first place?

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,240
Otherwise…

22
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:17,120
And what just happened?

23
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,360
When we were about to kiss…

24
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,000
I saw a flashback.

25
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,160
Did you see it, too?

26
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,480
I’m not sure.

27
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,920
It seemed impossible.

28
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,680
But it already happened.

29
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:48,560
And why did we see the same pictures?

30
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,120
Do you believe that it could be….

31
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,120
our destiny?

32
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,920
I’d been believing

33
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,520
that destiny brought P’Pha and me together.

34
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,000
That's why he was there.

35
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,200
That’s why I…

36
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,760
It’s not too late.

37
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,000
We now get the opportunity to be together.

38
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,520
Please give me a chance, Wayu.

39
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,840
Let me fix it.

40
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,000
Stop crying,

41
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,040
my baby.

42
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,520
You said you regretted that we met too late.

43
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,360
In fact, we didn't…

44
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,200
We just got lost and missed each other.

45
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:17,440
I promise that I’ll never let us lose each other again.

46
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,240
I’ll always hold your hands.

47
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,920
No matter what happens,

48
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,520
please don’t ever let my hands go.

49
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:31,360
Love is to find someone who makes you understand the meaning of it...

50
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,880
About what we saw in our head,

51
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,480
I want you to forget it.

52
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,920
Still love… even how much it hurts.

53
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,240
Sandee,

54
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,480
I need your help with something.

55
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,720
Still love… even how much it hurts.

56
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,120
Hello, Kit.

57
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,920
I came to pick up Phai, but he didn't answer my call.

58
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,280
P'Thanu.

59
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,920
He’s been staying at my dorm since yesterday.

60
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,720
He was probably doing the activity and didn’t hear it.

61
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,320
I apologize for him for wasting your time.

62
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,800
Is he better?

63
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,960
He still hasn't fully recovered

64
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,160
but got much better now.

65
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,040
Phai,

66
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,120
why didn’t you rest at home?

67
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,320
You won’t recover.

68
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,480
I’m a lot better.

69
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
So, I came to help them prepare for the activity.

70
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,560
You hardly got to rest.

71
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,040
Are you sure you’re not forcing yourself?

72
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,400
Are you concerned about the wrong person?

73
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,680
Aren’t you supposed to worry about the tall handsome guy

74
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,240
and driving the black car?

75
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,680
I am, for both of them.

76
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,880
Phai is P’Kit’s brother

77
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,680
and also my junior buddy.

78
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,440
I need to take care of him well.

79
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
Thanks, P’Wayu.

80
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,720
It’s good that you’re okay.

81
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,560
Thank you so much for saving P’Thanu.

82
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,800
Otherwise, he would’ve been worse.

83
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:06,840
Yes.

84
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,960
By the way, why were you there that day?

85
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,800
Weren’t you supposed to be in a class?

86
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:16,840
Yeah,

87
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,120
I was wondering, too.

88
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,680
You said you sensed something bad

89
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,480
and then you got the accident that afternoon.

90
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,320
Your sense was so accurate, Phai.

91
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,360
What was it about?

92
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,680
Well...

93
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,080
That day…

94
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,800
Phai said he felt like a bad thing was going to happen to his close one.

95
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,400
So, he rushed to see P’Kit.

96
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,360
Yes. But I met P’Thanu first.

97
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:49,400
See it as driving off bad luck away then.

98
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,520
Are you guys hungry?

99
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,160
Have these for now

100
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:58,360
and I’ll treat you for lunch.

101
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,760
Whoa! This is a lot!

102
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,480
Keep some for yourself.

103
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,760
I’ll order lunch for you.

104
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Thanks.

105
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
It’s a lot.

106
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
Don’t worry. I can get more later.

107
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,560
Phai, give it to me.

108
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,760
If you keep doing it,

109
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,480
your shoulder won’t heal.

110
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,040
Give me.

111
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
I’ll ask my friend to help.

112
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,520
But...

113
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:29,920
It’s alright.

114
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,920
We can do it while reading.

115
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,120
I’ll help you.

116
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,560
Don't worry.

117
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,840
Get well soon, Phai.

118
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,520
Okay.

119
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,000
Keep working. Don’t be a freeloader.

120
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,840
Whoa! P’Wayu’s so cute and also kind.

121
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
He deserved to be our faculty’s Beau.

122
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:56,200
Is he interested in adopting another junior buddy?

123
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,480
It’ll be too much for him.

124
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,400
One is enough.

125
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,160
What are you doing?

126
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,640
You're still hurt. Stop it.

127
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,600
Ah! Ah! Stop.

128
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,560
You ate it all up. Was it enough?

129
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Yes.

130
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,160
Oh. Just in time, P’Thanu.

131
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
Can you give my buddy a lift home?

132
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,960
He hasn’t healed yet, but he keeps working.

133
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,800
Of course.

134
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:44,480
Will Kit know that his brother is being stolen?

135
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,080
He can take my brother, Sab.

136
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,560
So, he can help me train him

137
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,480
to behave like Nong Phai.

138
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:58,880
Go back to rest.

139
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,720
Don’t worry about it.

140
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,720
My friends are taking care of it now.

141
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,120
Thank you, P’Wayu.

142
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,840
You said so.

143
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,040
Take care of my little brother for me.

144
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,080
Yes, sir.

145
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,120
Let’s go.

146
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,200
P’Thanu...

147
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,480
Do you have some time?

148
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,520
I want to take you somewhere.

149
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
Can you come with me?

150
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,000
You’re here too, Phai?

151
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,040
Hello.

152
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,200
Hello.

153
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,880
You and Sandee are visiting me at the same time!

154
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,440
Would you like something to eat?

155
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,640
My treat to congratulate you as a freshman.

156
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,800
Thank you.

157
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,440
I’ll bring you a lot of customers then.

158
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,200
Do you know my regular customer too?

159
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,920
You must’ve known him during your internship?

160
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,560
Anyway, be my guest.

161
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:43,040
This was my favorite corner.

162
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,160
It was mine, too.

163
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,880
What a coincidence again.

164
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,400
From the definition of love,

165
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,880
the drawing

166
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,560
and those pictures we saw together...

167
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,480
It's unbelievable.

168
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,800
A friend of mine once told me

169
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:07,319
that destiny is basically a series of coincidences.

170
00:17:08,680 --> 00:17:09,520
Phai...

171
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,560
I know that

172
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,280
P’Wayu and you are so close.

173
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,520
And you worry that our destiny might hurt P’Wayu, don’t you?

174
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,760
What’s supposed to happen between you and me will never happen for real

175
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,880
because I want to see you both happy together.

176
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,600
But the pictures we saw

177
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,760
and the sign you sensed about me...

178
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:04,680
Um.

179
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:07,680
Let’s do it again.

180
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:09,080
Do it…?

181
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:10,960
What are you thinking of?

182
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,920
Let's try again

183
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,320
if I’m the one you’re looking for.

184
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
Um.

185
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,000
I want to know too.

186
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:45,720
Close your eyes and pick one up.

187
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,080
If you get your own definition again,

188
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:16,720
you and I must admit our fate.

189
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,800
Sacrifice to make your loved one happy.

190
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,520
Sacrifice to make your loved one happy.

191
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,680
You see. It was just a coincidence.

192
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,600
We gave it too much thought.

193
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,960
You don’t need to worry anymore.

194
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,280
Thank you Phai.

195
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,160
You still have time if you want to go back to pick up P’Wayu now.

196
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:24,000
I’ll go back with Sandee.

197
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,120
You should go, P’Thanu.

198
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,680
Let me know if you need me for anything.

199
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,920
Don’t worry at all.

200
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,040
See you around.

201
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,320
So, he’s your destiny?

202
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,720
Not anymore.

203
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,200
Sacrifice to make your loved one happy.

204
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,840
Sacrifice to make your loved one happy.

205
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,560
Sacrifice to make your loved one happy.

206
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,200
Are you sure about this?

207
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,360
You finally figured out your own definition of love.

208
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,800
Why do you think that it’s my definition?

209
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:54,400
It’s what you’re doing now.

210
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,560
If only you could change destiny that easily.

211
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,400
Something has already been written.

212
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,000
No matter how hard you try to change it, you cannot.

213
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,120
At least,

214
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,360
I feel relieved that I made my choice

215
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,200
to make everyone happy.

216
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,200
What about you?

217
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,040
Are you happy?

218
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:41,400
Get over it. Let it be a happy ending.

219
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:46,880
Anyway, how was the freshmen activity at Com. Arts?

220
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,400


221
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,640
Go take a shower. I’ll put them away.

222
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,440
It’s so late.

223
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:57,080
Your class is early tomorrow.

224
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,400
It’s alright.

225
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:00,960
I’ll do it.

226
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,720
Pok,

227
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:08,840
Pok!

228
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,640
Are you okay?

229
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,960
If it's too much for you,

230
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,760
you should say no.

231
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,440
They won’t accept me if I do.

232
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,600
What if your body can’t take it?

233
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,600
Early morning class,

234
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:38,400
late night activity,

235
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,840
practice schedule

236
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,960
and also preparing for Beau & Belle contest.

237
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,760
You’d better take a rest at night...

238
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:48,560
It’s not your concern!

239
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,240
I can handle it.

240
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,200
Alright, gorgeous!

241
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:03,120
Let’s practice the walk...

242
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:06,680
for the opening of the Faculties Belle & Beau, presented by Viva Plus.

243
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:09,400
Okay. If you’re ready,

244
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,800
let’s have a look at our model.

245
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,040
Let’s go!

246
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,160
P’Mark is very handsome!!!

247
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:51,240
Look at his eyes, Look!

248
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,640
So handsome!

249
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:58,080
So, this is the blocking.

250
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,600
You guys understand?

251
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,360
I don’t quite get it!

252
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,080
I’ll get you some drinks.

253
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,720
It’s okay.

254
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
Are you tired?

255
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,640
Imagine if P’Kit’s here.

256
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,320
Speaking of the devil.

257
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,200
Hello, P’Kit.

258
00:27:40,680 --> 00:27:41,800
Excuse me.

259
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,120
Everyone!

260
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,320
I’d like to introduce P’Kit, Third year from Medicine.

261
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,080
He’s my beloved

262
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,080
and respected boyfriend.

263
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,040
The owner of my gear

264
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,880
and heart.

265
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,800
Of course!

266
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,880
So this is the reason you called me here?

267
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,360
You just want to show me off to them?

268
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:58,320
What’s the score for my sincerity?

269
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,600
Why so low?

270
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,920
When will I be your real boyfriend if you keep flunking me?

271
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,040
How dare you ask for the score?

272
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,760
I haven’t punished you for fooling me last time.

273
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,040
What was it?

274
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,480
Ohh…

275
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,080
You mean this.

276
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,840
Hey, stop!

277
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,240
Stop acting like a child. You're a sophomore now.

278
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:39,560
But this sophomore still loves you persistently.

279
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,040
Okay?

280
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,280
Sports Science’s freshman activities are always so tough.

281
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,400
They say the last day is the worst.

282
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:15,800
I’ve heard too. Last year, they slept over the yard.

283
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,160
Hurry!

284
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:25,400
Faster!

285
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,480
Ten more!

286
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,120
Faster,

287
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:38,160
Faster!

288
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,880
Sorry for bothering you this late. We just took him home.

289
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,320
Thanks.

290
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,280
Pok. Behave!

291
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,120
Since the swimming pool,

292
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,520
have you given anyone your first kiss?

293
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,000
What if I have?

294
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,160
Who?

295
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:28,800
Who’s that person?

296
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,720
You’re too drunk!

297
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,480
So you can kiss anyone now?

298
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,600
Yes, except ones I hate.

299
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,920
I don’t buy any words from a person who betrayed his friend.

300
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,280
Let me go!

301
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,040
You go stay somewhere else tonight.

302
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,760
Anywhere but not here.

303
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:48,960
You ask me to stay and chase me away whenever you want?

304
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,880
Good… I don’t owe you anymore.

305
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,840
I’ll take my stuff when you’re not around.

306
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,880
So, we don’t have to see each other anymore.

307
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,120
Damn it!

308
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,920
I did it for your own good.

309
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Go! Before I can’t control myself.

310
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,200
I warned you.

311
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,200
If you stay,

312
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:54,280
I can’t guarantee.

313
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Go on.

314
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,720
You need my help?

315
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,600
I can help you.

316
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:15,840
I know you’ve always wanted to do this.

317
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,440
Since when we almost kissed.

318
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,600
Stop talking!

319
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,199
Go on…

320
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,320
Do whatever,

321
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:39,639
but not kiss.

322
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:42,120
Why we can't kiss?

323
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,719
We’re not in love.

324
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:51,239
Why would we kiss?

325
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,440
Can you do it?

326
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,920
Are you challenging me?

327
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,920
What if I want to kiss you now?

328
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,200
If you do it,

329
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,440
know that

330
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,720
I'm not willing.

331
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,080
You said not kiss,

332
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,560
you only meant, on your lips?

333
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,680
What’re you doing?

334
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,320
Don’t you remember

335
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,640
what you said last night?

336
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:36,560
You knew the reason why I said that.

337
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,640
For whatever reason,

338
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,760
you shouldn’t chase me away like that.

339
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,920
Forgive my foul mouth.

340
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,440
Don’t be mad.

341
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,560
Please stay.

342
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,160
I want us to stay together.

343
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,400
If you really want me to stay, don't ever say that again.

344
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,880
Okay, deal.

345
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:09,960
I'll never say it again.

346
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,680
Well…

347
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,840
What happened last night,

348
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,880
will that never happen again either?

349
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:30,960
What do you mean?

350
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,400
About that,

351
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,040
I can’t promise you that it’ll never happen again.

352
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,400
Just forget about it.

353
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,040
How can I?

354
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,120
Still hurt?

355
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,000
I’m sorry

356
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,920
if I was too rough with you.

357
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,400
If you don’t want to hurt me,

358
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,360
then don’t do it again.

359
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,960
I’ll toss it.

360
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:27,320
So you can’t complain that I mess up the room.

361
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,010
Come on.

362
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,600
Are you hurt?

363
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,440
Let me take care of you. Stay still.

364
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,000
Stay still and don't move.

365
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:16,560
What about…

366
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,960
the freshmen Beau & Belle contest?

367
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,520
I’ll skip it.

368
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,000
You've got so many bruises.

369
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,840
I'll make it up to you.

370
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,240
If you want to misbehave, just do it alone.

371
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,750
Hey.

372
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,560
Lie down, you can’t even get up.

373
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,040
I’m tired,

374
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,680
I can’t carry you back home today.

375
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:42,400
Hello. Welcome back everyone to the battle of the Beau once again.

376
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:45,080
We’re still on the mission to win Wayu’s heart.

377
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:49,240
But today, we’ve got a newcomer!

378
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,800
Which is…

379
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,160
P’Thanu, 2018 University Beau!

380
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,040
Let me interview you a bit.

381
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,800
Since you are the last to join,

382
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,480
What's your strategy for hitting on Nong Wayu?

383
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,960
I’ve never done anything like this before.

384
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,480
This will be my first time

385
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,000
and I’ll do my best.

386
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:14,960
I’m telling you, PJack and P’Koh have been trying for a year,

387
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,840
they didn’t even get to hold his hand.

388
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,880
Alright! P’Jack and P’Koh, you guys get ready for it!

389
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:25,520
Because this newcomer showed up with his Fast & Furious Mustang!

390
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,640
Everyone!

391
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:31,280
Let’s cheer him up for his first try.

392
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:32,800
Stay tuned!

393
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:41,840
Your boyfriend, gives me headache again.

394
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:43,920
P’Thanu too.

395
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:47,680
Never thought he would do such a silly thing like this.

396
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:50,840
People can do stupid things when they’re in love.

397
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,360
You’re with them too?!

398
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:58,480
Look!

399
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,120
All he has is the Mustang.

400
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:08,240
He’s got nothing else to compete with me.

401
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,360
For me?

402
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,480
Wait.

403
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:20,160
But you have mustard.

404
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,160
Whoa!

405
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:26,680
Do you have something with me?

406
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:28,800
Just eat it!

407
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:31,040
DAMN IT!

408
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,720
This is the subject for your research. Which…

409
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,360
Whose is this for…

410
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:58,000
Wayu, second-year of Science

411
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,400
I’ll retain it.

412
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,600
You can’t sir.

413
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:20,080
Are you allergic to pollen or to love, sir?

414
00:45:22,320 --> 00:45:23,360
It’s my jealousy. Duh!

415
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,960
Someone buy one for him, please.

416
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,560
Our subject today is bouquet... oops! no! Biochemistry.

417
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:43,760
Let's start over again.

418
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:59,640
Begin again.

419
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:16,320
Begin again.

420
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:35,560
Have a good day.

421
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:36,920
Have a nice day.

422
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:16,000
Keep working.

423
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:26,040
Be good in class. Have a good day.

424
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,040
What’re you doing?

425
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,760
Didn’t your dad tell you someone bought a big lot of Viva Plus to give away?

426
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,720
I never knew he would be such a sugar daddy.

427
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,880
He’s telling it to your dad, competitors and the world.

428
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,360
Here.

429
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,520
Keep it. For your very special one.

430
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,800
Thanks, Wayu.

431
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,760
Thank you so much, Wayu.

#TakecareyourloveByVivaPlus

443
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,800
Why does it have to be in my class?

444
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,760
Whose this again? Isn't it too much?

445
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:42,840
Wayu, second-year Science.

446
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:13,560
Aren’t you driving me to the dorm?

447
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:16,760
I will.

448
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,960
Look where we are now.

449
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:45,360
I was sitting there.

450
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:48,160
And I was there.

451
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,440
And I fell down like this.

452
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,480
That was dangerous?

453
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,840
What if I missed?

454
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:19,760
We’d just fall together.

455
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,920
With you beside me,

456
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,880
I’m not afraid of anything.

457
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,640
Don’t make me worried.

458
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,560
What’s wrong?

459
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:53,920
It must be when I jumped.

460
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,440
I got cramps.

461
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:03,040
You wanna ride on my back?

462
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,120
I’m pretty heavy. Can you take it?

463
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,040
If not,

464
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:12,760
we’ll just fall together.

465
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:34,400
Hold on tight.

466
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:00,520
Your pants got dirty.

467
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:04,960
Don’t wipe.

468
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,240
I’ll wash it out.

469
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:32,080
I’ll help.

470
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:01,720
What were you doing?

471
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,520
You mess with me?

472
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,880
Silly.

473
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:30,840
Look, you got all wet.

474
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,760
You won’t stop, do you?

475
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:53,000
Thank you for having been looking after me.

476
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,480
We can’t change our past

477
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,760
but we can create our future.

478
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:05,600
Let me make it up for the time that we missed with each other.

479
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:10,520
I can take care of you too.

480
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:28,120
Always and forever your prince.

481
00:58:28,360 --> 00:58:31,160
Does this mean that P’Kit and P’Mark are staying together now?

482
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:33,520
Don’t you feel possessive of him at all?

483
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:37,680
Why do I have to? There’s more people loving my brother.

484
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,600
It’s good to be with someone you love.

485
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,520
It’s not always the case.

486
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:50,040
Where’s Tong, Pok?

487
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,800
He was going to come but...

488
00:58:56,040 --> 00:58:57,240
Can I ask?

489
00:58:57,880 --> 00:58:59,640
What did you guys fight about that day?

490
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:05,560
Just a misunderstanding.

491
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,960
Doing bad things to help others,

492
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:09,840
even with good intentions,

493
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,320
is still wrong.

494
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,480
What did he do wrong?

495
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,440
He’s aware of it.

496
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,120
And he has paid for it.

497
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:23,800
I got over it.

498
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,800
It’s up to Tong now if he'll forgive me.

499
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:36,560
Why are you being vague?

500
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:38,600
What was it actually about?

501
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,600
Come on, Pok! Just leave it to them.

502
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:52,320
Not only being a good advisor,

503
00:59:52,320 --> 00:59:54,720
but also a fair judge too, Sandee.

504
00:59:56,160 --> 01:00:00,160
I just wanted to make things right.

505
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,280
Where do I put this?

506
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:11,120
Just put in the drawer.

507
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:48,840
It’s lunch time. Let’s eat and continue doing it later.

508
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,600
Yeah. My treat.

509
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:52,240
Really?!

510
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,120
Go!

511
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:03,440
Hey, Sandee.

512
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:05,720
Come on.

513
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:06,880
Okay.

514
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:07,640
Follow me.

515
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:26,320
Thanks Mark.

516
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,920
Thought I’d had broken it.

517
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,480
As if a kid is getting candies.

518
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,880
Should I announce the winner for the competition?

519
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:37,240
It’s obvious who won your heart.

520
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:41,440
Hey.

521
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,920
P’Kit and I agree that he would never break your heart.

522
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,240
So we won’t have to fix you anymore.

523
01:01:48,880 --> 01:01:49,480
Hey!

524
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:52,600
It’s not easy to fix a heart like this music box.

525
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:59,720
But I believe that he would look after your feelings his best.

526
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,640
It’s finally your time to be happy, Yu.

527
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,920
Don’t play too hard.

528
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:08,960
If you let him get too crazy in love and he jumps you,

529
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,600
I can’t help.

530
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:13,600
Mark!

531
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:18,360
Try it.

532
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:20,400
It works as before.

533
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:28,600
It can’t be.

534
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,840
I promise

535
01:04:12,840 --> 01:04:16,280
that I’ll never let us lose each other again.

536
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:45,840
Okay alright don’t forget what I told you.

537
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,960
You guys must do your best.

538
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,880
Smile is the best makeup to put on your face.

539
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:52,400
Smile from your heart.

540
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:56,080
And don’t forget to be cheerful as expected of freshmen.

541
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:57,160
Yes.

542
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:02,760
You have a lot of support.

543
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:07,080
I’m gonna roll call now.

544
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:09,120
Starting from…

545
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,040
Arts faculty.

546
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:11,960
Okay.

547
01:05:12,360 --> 01:05:13,480
Com. Arts.

548
01:05:14,120 --> 01:05:15,160
Checked.

549
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:16,280
Medicine.

550
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:17,800
Checked.

551
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:19,120
Science.

552
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:20,920
Good job.

553
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:21,920
Agriculture.

554
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:23,960
Checked.

555
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:25,160
So, everyone’s here.

556
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,920
Sandee,

557
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:39,960
did you see a drawing that looks like me the day you helped me move?

558
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,720
Why? Was it lost?

559
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:43,960
Yes.

560
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:45,600
Let me know if you see it.

561
01:05:45,600 --> 01:05:47,520
Not sure where it lost.

562
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,760
If it belongs to you,

563
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,040
it’ll come back.

564
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:03,720
I just wanted to make things right.

565
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,600
P’Thanu,

566
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:07,560
can we have dinner together today?

567
01:07:07,560 --> 01:07:11,000
I wanna talk to you about something.

568
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:12,720
Wayu,

569
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:15,600
did I do anything to upset you?

570
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:21,800
Let’s just talk that time.

571
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:50,720
Right. Joining us today, our senior Beaus & Belles.

572
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:57,320
Let’s have an ice breaker activity for us to get closer.

573
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:00,080
We’re going to do a buddy game!

574
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:07,400
Picking a draw is a bit old fashioned now.

575
01:08:07,400 --> 01:08:11,960
We’ll do something more creative.

576
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:16,080
Instead, we’re going to do the blind touch test.

577
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,000
So you get a chance to pick your own buddy!

578
01:08:20,160 --> 01:08:23,439
Well! You’re wondering how?

579
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,439
You guys seem confused?

580
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:31,560
It’s okay, we’ll show you how.

581
01:08:31,560 --> 01:08:32,880
If you’re ready,

582
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,040
please clap your hands and welcome our most handsome guy from the team!

583
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:45,080
Watch your steps.

584
01:08:47,399 --> 01:08:49,840
May I have some volunteers?

585
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:51,960
Come up over, please.

586
01:08:53,439 --> 01:08:55,359
Come on!

587
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,040
Don’t be shy.

588
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:08,319
Excuse me.

589
01:09:34,600 --> 01:09:40,359
I’m not sure if this Miss Belle or… the Beast?

590
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:43,399
Ouch! Taojiew!

591
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,680
Let me go!

592
01:09:47,279 --> 01:09:49,600
Let me kiss him as punishment!

593
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:51,720
Let’s go.

594
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:32,480
I choose this one.

595
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,280
Unchosen ones, step out please.

596
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,360
Why is this junior so cute?

597
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,000
What do you study?

598
01:10:46,360 --> 01:10:48,480
Why haven’t I seen you before?

599
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:55,120
You can’t flirt with this one, Mark!

600
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,560
This one is mine.

601
01:10:58,080 --> 01:10:59,240
You cannot.

602
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:06,720
It’s too late to stop me now.

603
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:12,000
Since he’s already had my gear and heart for so long.

604
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:14,280
Whoa!!!

605
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:24,040
One, two, three! Woo Hoo!!

606
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:31,960
Why the hell did I have to embarrass myself with that?

607
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:34,240
Ah! Ah!

608
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:41,320
watch your language or I’ll punish you, Nong Kit!

609
01:11:45,400 --> 01:11:48,160
Alright, Nong Kit?

610
01:11:48,160 --> 01:11:49,720
Aren’t you ashamed?

611
01:11:50,120 --> 01:11:51,120
I am not!

612
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,960
Why do I have to be?

613
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:55,840
Nong Kit.

614
01:11:59,680 --> 01:12:00,120
Pok.

615
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:01,720
Tong’s here.

616
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:07,400
I’m actually here, Pok!

617
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,680
What! You can’t remember your Tong?

618
01:12:15,520 --> 01:12:16,480
Pok!

619
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:31,480
I pick this one.

620
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:43,320
Three, two, one!

621
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:46,680
Woo Hoo!

622
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:50,360
Don’t forget the rules.

623
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,600
If you don’t take care of your buddy well,

624
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:54,480
you can be replaced anytime.

625
01:12:54,840 --> 01:12:56,800
Let's see.

626
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:18,320
Watch your steps, cutie pie.

627
01:13:18,560 --> 01:13:20,360
Volunteers, please.

628
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:29,160
Wow! so many! You’re super hot!

629
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:35,320
Let’s begin!

630
01:13:42,560 --> 01:13:45,520
Is it this one?

631
01:13:45,880 --> 01:13:46,920
Not this one.

632
01:13:46,920 --> 01:13:49,440
No, no.

633
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:55,120
Is it?

634
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:57,800
Still not.

635
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:38,480
I’m back, Wayu.

636
01:15:41,200 --> 01:15:42,240
P’Pha...

637
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:13,160
Hey,

638
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:14,000
Bank!

639
01:16:16,760 --> 01:16:19,080
Bank, why didn’t you avoid the sun?

640
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:20,200
You’ll get dull skin.

641
01:16:20,440 --> 01:16:22,240
Don’t worry. I have this.

642
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,840
I take BKC V Plus everyday.

643
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:27,160
It promotes both health and good skin.

644
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:28,880
Everything at once.

645
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:29,920
Whoa!

646
01:16:30,280 --> 01:16:31,360
It does have everything!

647
01:16:31,360 --> 01:16:35,600
Both cordyceps extracts and collagens. And vitamin C as well!

648
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,440
Of course!

649
01:16:36,840 --> 01:16:37,600
Isn’t it cool!

650
01:16:38,720 --> 01:16:39,800
Can I have it then?

651
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:42,080
Wait! this is mine.

652
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:43,400
Can I have it?

653
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:44,800
You already have many.

654
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:45,800
You buy your own.

655
01:16:46,120 --> 01:16:48,760
This Chinese New Year, don’t forget to give your beloved ones BKC V Plus

656
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:52,160
for their good health and skin.
