1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,560
Let me ask you, P’Padbok.

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,600
Who’s actually betraying his friend’s trust.

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,200
Don’t say anything if you don’t know!

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,200
Stop already, Padbok!

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,240
If we’re going to be boyfriends,

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,640
I should be the one who asks you.

7
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:14,320
Hmm...

8
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,030
Then…

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:19,520
Will you be my boyfriend?

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:22,360
Let’s start our time together.

11
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:36,480
It’s not like what I pictured.

12
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,520
Are you fooling me?

13
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,760
I’ve scheduled my study plan.

14
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:44,760
Unlike you, wasting your time on dirty stuff.

15
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,360
Remember. If I don’t allow it, you can’t do anything.

16
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,060
You can’t do anything.

17
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,120
You’re so mean.

18
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,440
Just come over if you’re sleepy.

19
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,440
You can scooch closer.

20
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,920
The bed’s too small.

21
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,120
I should have let you sleep on the floor.

22
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,200
I’m a sleep-cuddler.

23
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,000
Oops!

24
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,760
I’m also a sleep-elbower.

25
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:55,440
Hey!

26
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:58,840
Then let me sleep with you every night.

27
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,200
I’ll help you fix it.

28
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:03,600
Mark!

29
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,520
We’re dating now. You don’t think that...

30
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,000
I’ll stop at kissing you, right?

31
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,280
What are you doing?

32
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,880
I told you.

33
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,520
If I don’t allow it, you can’t.

34
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:59,480
Why are you taking off your clothes?

35
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,720
You don’t allow me to take yours off,

36
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:05,360
so I'll take mine off.

37
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,760
Hey, stop! I don’t want to see it.

38
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Are you sure you don’t?

39
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,600
I don’t!

40
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,920
Then stop me if you can.

41
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,360
Are you challenging me?

42
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,280
P’Kit.

43
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,520
Stop you?

44
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
Not if you have to stop me first.

45
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,080
P’Kit.

46
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,080
Do you still dare challenge me?

47
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,880
No. Please.

48
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
I give up.

49
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:05,720
I’m giving in to you now.

50
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,120
You wouldn’t have been in trouble if you were tame.

51
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
I’m warning you. If you bother me again,

52
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,400
I can’t guarantee what will happen.

53
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,560
Smells nice.

54
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,440
Talking in your sleep?

55
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,280
If not,

56
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,000
who’s your boyfriend?

57
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:41,919
Mark.

58
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,760
Mark who?

59
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
Mark, Engineering.

60
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,920
Handsome?

61
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,760
No.

62
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,240
Hmm.

63
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,600
I’m offended.

64
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,800
Nonetheless, you still love him?

65
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,360
Very much.

66
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,480
I love you more.

67
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:32,080
Goodnight, my baby.

68
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:25,680
Hey,

69
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,440
I have good news.

70
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,560
What is it?

71
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,240
Wayu’s new boyfriend opening?

72
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,440
No.

73
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,720
It’s about Sab.

74
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:37,440
Huh.

75
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:41,000
Don’t tell me, it’s Sab’s opening.

76
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:42,920
Damn you.

77
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,000
Stop already.

78
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,120
It’s not that.

79
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,920
It’s his opening as a Communication Art’s Freshman.

80
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,240
Hey.

81
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,240
The result is out?

82
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,080
Did he get it here?

83
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,120
I knew he’d make it. So, you don’t have to worry about him anymore.

84
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,080
Of course. I rooted for him so hard.

85
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,560
Right, P’Kit told me that Phai got it too.

86
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,800
Science faculty, just like you.

87
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,240
It’s what it is. Only cute ones are accepted into my faculty.

88
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
What should I get for him?

89
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,800
Help me think.

90
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,640
Treat him a nice meal?

91
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,680
I’m in too.

92
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:30,960
I haven’t returned his favor and his friends’ for the painting of umbrella love confession.

93
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,680
Good idea.

94
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,520
All of his friends also got seats at our University.

95
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,000
Okay. Deal. You can tell them.

96
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:49,080
Oh.

97
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,800
And ask them how many people.

98
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,760
So, I can book a restaurant.

99
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,080
A fancy dinner sponsored by P’Mark.

100
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Or should we do a dinner cruise?

101
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,640
I’ll get tickets for everyone with my GSP Money.

102
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,120
You can arrange it.

103
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,920
So, there’ll be Sansab

104
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:09,120
Klui

105
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,640
Sandee

106
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,160
Phai

107
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:14,080
P’Kit, you

108
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,160
and me.

109
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,520
You book it for eight then.

110
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,240
Eight? How?

111
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,760
I only counted seven people.

112
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,720
Or the extra seat is for that one and only.

113
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,240
Shoooot phew!

114
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,680
Well, I don’t know if he’ll make it. I’ll ask him.

115
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,040
What position will he be there for, Nong Wayu?

116
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:43,120
As Sab’s soon-to-be brother-in-law?

117
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,000
You’re crazy.

118
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,040
He’ll join us as a senior.

119
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:51,680
Phai is P’Kit’s little brother.

120
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,720
P’Kit is P’Thanu’s junior.

121
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:59,760
So the senior of Phai’s big brother is there to congratulate him.

122
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
So,

123
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,960
Sab is your little brother.

124
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:08,320
I’m your best friend. P’Jack is my senior.

125
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:17,080
Let’s add P’Jack as his brother’s best friend’s senior.

126
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,960
Is that ok?

127
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,920
Why the heck will you invite P’Jack?

128
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,880
Double standard!

129
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,240
You’ll invite P’Thanu but not P’Jack.

130
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,960
What does it mean? I’m a bit confused.

131
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,480
Alright, then. You can book as many as you want.

132
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,560
I’ll go get something to eat.

133
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,560
Wait.

134
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
Seriously,

135
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,640
did you fall for P’Thanu?

136
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,840
It’s too soon to say that.

137
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,400
I don’t want to rush it.

138
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,920
It’s already good as it is.

139
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,360
I know you and P’Kit worry about me

140
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:10,440
and want me to start over with someone.

141
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,520
But with P’Thanu,

142
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,240
I still don’t know how it’ll come out.

143
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:19,960
I just want to keep learning about him more.

144
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,920
I don’t want to expect anything yet.

145
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:29,520
It’s been so long since I’ve seen you smile.

146
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,560
If your heart gets broken again,

147
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:35,520
I won’t console you.

148
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:37,000
I’ll aggravate you instead!

149
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,800
Ooh, so scary.  I’m scared.

150
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,120
Dramatic!

151
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,640
Hey,

152
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Yu.

153
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,840
I was saving that one for last.

154
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,240
Don’t you have money to buy your own!?

155
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:05,880
Strike the fort. Do it.

156
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,400
Hey, Phai. Did P’Kit message you?

157
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,880
Yes, I’m replying to his message.

158
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,040
Is P’Mark taking us to Chao Phraya river cruise?

159
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,120
Will there be enough space for all of us?

160
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
Do I have to put on a life jacket?

161
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,440
And what if we fall out of the boat?

162
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,760
Klui!

163
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,240
We’re going for a fancy dinner on a cruise ship,

164
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:31,720
not the flatboat you used when Bangkok was flooded!

165
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,440
Hang on tight, bro! We’re flying over the water!

166
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,720
That’s a long-tailed boat! What the hell?

167
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
Row row row your boat. Gently down the stream.

168
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,280
Merrily merrily, merrily, merrily.

169
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:52,400
Paddles out, prepare to paddle.

170
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,000
Go row to a man who had a crush on his friend.

171
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,800
Hey,

172
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:58,360
come back. Let me kick your ass!

173
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,280
Pok,

174
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,400
he’s just preparing it for the freshmen activity.

175
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,080
Don’t get alarmed.

176
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,920
You might as well join my matchmaker team. Interested?

177
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,880
You never learned right, Sab? The surprise for P’Kit last time?

178
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,080
It wasn’t easy for P’Mark and P’Kit to get back together.

179
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,160
Anyway, they’re so in love today.

180
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,560
Think about it. If we don’t do anything.

181
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,520
How long will Pok have to be stuck in the friend zone, huh?

182
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:34,120
What friend zone? You guys!

183
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
Everyone knows it, Shark Pok.

184
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,880
To come out of the friend zone, you’ll need help.

185
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,160
Come with us on the cruise

186
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:49,760
and we’ll take care of the rest for you.

187
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:54,640
Romantic atmosphere plus our help.

188
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:58,120
Trust me.

189
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,120
Come with us, Pok.

190
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,520
P’Kit knows you’re my best friend

191
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,800
and you also got into the university.

192
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,079
So, you’re also his junior too.

193
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:06,040
Um.

194
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,160
Go! Go! Let’s go!

195
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,440
I got in with the athlete quota.

196
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,920
So, I have to start practicing hard from now on.

197
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,280
You guys go.

198
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,760
Are you sure?

199
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,839
You can’t change your mind later.

200
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,760
Are you sure?

201
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,240
Mr. President.

202
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,080
Mr. President.

203
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,960
And the committees. Please come over here.

204
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,320
Just in time.

205
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,000
You still owe us the fee.

206
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,120
Do you prefer paying by cash or transfer?

207
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,800
P’Sab, you shouldn’t have called the treasurer.

208
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,960
Do it for me.

209
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,960
Here

210
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:06,720
This one.

211
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,000
Good.

212
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,880
Why did you call us by the way?

213
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,160
We are having a celebration party for ones who got into the same University.

214
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,120
You should come.

215
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,920
We won’t miss it.

216
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,520
Hey, Galae,

217
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:33,880
come with us. My brother’s studying Science, the same faculty that you got in.

218
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,600
That’s nice.

219
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,680
So, I can ask him what to prepare.

220
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,440
When is it? Don’t tell me this Friday.

221
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,680
Yes, this Friday.

222
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,000
I already planned to celebrate with the band. That’s a bummer.

223
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,640
That’s fine, Galae.

224
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:56,080
Our gang does celebrate quite often. Get yourself ready for it.

225
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,080
Ho! You greedy!

226
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,200
Are you interested,Tong?

227
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:06,160
My brother’s in Medicine. In case you have any questions, you can ask him.

228
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,920
Um. Thanks for asking

229
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,760
but I have tutoring.

230
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,840
You guys go.

231
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,960
Ho! Tong can’t make it. Pok also can’t make it.

232
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,680
Not that you guys are having a private celebration together?

233
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,120
No, we aren’t.

234
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,800
Is that so?

235
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,920
No. I said no.

236
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,120
Hmmm.

237
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,520
Okay, we gotta go. See you at the gym.

238
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,360
Hmm.

239
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,400
See you.

240
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,520
See you then.

241
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,000
Congrats for getting into Medicine!

242
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,280
Same to you for getting into Sport Science.

243
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:17,400
We should see each other around the University.

244
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,080
If I didn’t have your help,

245
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:25,080
I wouldn’t have passed the exam and made it this far.

246
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,240
I want to repay you.

247
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,800
How about I treat you to a meal?

248
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,720
Um. Do you mean to go with Phai and Sab?

249
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,280
Well…

250
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:47,320
It’ll be only us, actually.

251
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,960
Um…

252
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,920
Okay. Let me know when.

253
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:30,240
The shower room is free now. Will you take a shower?

254
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:37,280
Okay.

255
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,920
Excuse me then.

256
00:21:42,040 --> 00:21:43,160
Um.

257
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,920
Do what I say, if you don’t want to be exposed.
The president cheated on the exam.

258
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,680
You always keep your car nice and clean.

259
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,520
Unlike Mark.

260
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:15,840
But he probably got better now because I told P’Kit.

261
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,040
Everytime I complained,

262
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:19,960
he’d pretend not to hear it.

263
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,680
But when it was P’Kit, he didn’t dare.

264
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,600
It’s so satisfying.

265
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,160
P’Thanu,

266
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:39,920
I take it back. I found an untidy thing.

267
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,600
I’ll take care of it.

268
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:54,560
Love is to find someone who’ ll make you understand the meaning of it.

269
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,440
It’s my definition of love.

270
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,240
Definition of love?

271
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,360
The jar at the cafe near the university?

272
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,600
Yes.

273
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:12,360
How do you know?

274
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,760
I know.

275
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:16,600
I often go there.

276
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,840
I wrote it too, the definition of love.

277
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:26,440
What did you write?

278
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,440
No matter how much it hurts, I still love it.

279
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,800
That’s how I defined it in the past.

280
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,840
But I see it differently now.

281
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:57,440
I used it as an excuse to keep letting myself hurt.

282
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,240
Love shouldn’t be like that.

283
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:10,760
And what’s your definition of love right now?

284
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,560
To love, is all that matters...

285
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:30,640
Even if it’s only one-sided love,

286
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,360
I’m just happy to get to love someone.

287
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:09,000
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have been nosy.

288
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,280
It’s alright.

289
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:13,600
Good that you found it.

290
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,840
I thought I lost it.

291
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,000
You didn’t lose it.

292
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,880
You just haven’t found it yet.

293
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,560
Thanks, Wayu,

294
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:26,440
for helping me find it.

295
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,720
Hello, P’ Thanu, P’Yu!

296
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:34,440
We’ve met before. You remember me?

297
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,280
Hello, P’ Thanu, P’Yu!

298
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,560
Ehh…

299
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,920
Did we just interrupt your eye contact game?

300
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,520
Klui!

301
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:45,920
Shut up!

302
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:48,480
Or I’ll let you swim to the boat!

303
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:53,360
P’Thanu and P’Yu, they are...

304
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,200
Senior and junior at the university!

305
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,800
Ohh.

306
00:26:55,800 --> 00:27:00,480
Yes... Senior and junior.

307
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,600
Come on. Let’s go. We’ve already bothered him enough.

308
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,040
Go, go.

309
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,960
What does this mean, sir?

310
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:29,240
You got pretty good ones.

311
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:31,000
Thank you.

312
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,400
P’ Kit, let’s go tie them and make a wish.

313
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,920
Since when can you read Mandarin?

314
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,960
I asked the officer.

315
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:56,640
Your blessing and mine are matching. Should we tie them next to each other?

316
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,480
Tell me the meaning first.

317
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,640
I’ll hold your hands.

318
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,600
We’ll grow old together.

319
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
If I get old and not handsome,

320
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,000
You can’t let go of my hands. Ok?

321
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:15,880
Umm.

322
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:21,440
I won’t. I’ll always be with you.

323
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:25,040
Then, let’s do it.

324
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:00,320
Let’s go pay respect to Goddess Mazu and get blessed for love.

325
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,280
Phai.

326
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,000
Let’s check out the other shop.

327
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:53,280
You like it?

328
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,680
No. Not really.

329
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,840
Ehh...

330
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,560
I mean it’s nice

331
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,840
but I’m not sure where I’d place it.

332
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,360
Let’s look at other shops.

333
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:16,960
Did you buy it?

334
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,760
You should keep it. It has a bow sign.

335
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,760
I bought it for you

336
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,080
Thank you, P’Thanu,

337
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,280
for having been looking after me.

338
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,120
Wayu

339
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,040
I have something to tell you.

340
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,520
Previously

341
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:17,840
the reason I was here was that Pharawee asked me to take care of you.

342
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,639
P’Pha?

343
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,239
What’s it got to do with him?

344
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,320
Pha didn’t want you to be sad all by yourself.

345
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:42,360
This means the whole time you’ve been caring to me is because of P’Pha?

346
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,199
I didn’t realize that

347
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,400
you were only doing your job.

348
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,240
Anyway, it’s alright.

349
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,000
I’ve got over him. I won’t have to bother you anymore.

350
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,400
Wait, Wayu.

351
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,600
Listen to me first. Don’t be mad.

352
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,200
Yes, it was like that before.

353
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:19,680
But right now,

354
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:26,200
I’m not doing it because I have to. I follow my feelings.

355
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,800
I want to know

356
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:41,240
if you still see the shadow of Parawee in me these days...

357
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,400
P’Pha… you came back to me.

358
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:58,520
You really came back to me. You’re back.

359
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,120
Earlier,

360
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,080
I did mistake you with P’Pha.

361
00:36:21,360 --> 00:36:30,720
But believe me, the only one I can see now is you, P’Thanu.

362
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,800
I believe you.

363
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:59,280
I didn’t get to return it to you.

364
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:05,560
I hope you find the one you’re looking for soon.

365
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,000
Hey!

366
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,760
The ship has arrived.

367
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,560
It’s time.

368
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Let’s go.

369
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,720
Where are you guys? I don’t see anyone.

370
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,840
Excuse me, where is Café?

371
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,200
The café is right there.

372
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,640
Thank you.

373
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:36,000
Sorry, sorry.

374
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,320
Sorry.

375
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,640
It belongs to me, sir.

376
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:45,600
Thank you.

377
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,920
Wait a minute.

378
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,200
No matter who you have in your heart,

379
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,760
my feelings for you are still the same.

380
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:19,280
Can I just keep loving you?

381
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:15,320
I'm sorry, Phai. It’s my fault.

382
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:34,320
What just happened?

383
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,720
Did you see it like I did?

384
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,560
It felt like an electric shock,

385
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:49,400
and those visions... How’s it possible?

386
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:55,000
Phai.

387
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,760
P’Thanu.

388
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:36,800
The ship is leaving soon. Where is Phai?

389
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:39,960
He said he got lost and went too far.

390
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,720
He probably won’t make it.

391
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:46,600
I’ll go look for him. You guys go first.

392
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,360
Yu.

393
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,800
Where’s P’Thanu? Didn’t you say you’d get here together?

394
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,160
I thought he was following.

395
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,440
Not sure since when I lost him.

396
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,400
Hello?

397
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:17,560
It’s alright.

398
00:44:18,320 --> 00:44:19,920
I’ll see you next time, then.

399
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,040
P’Thanu went to get something in the car.

400
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,520
He won’t get here in time.

401
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:35,400
Wait a second.

402
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:39,360
They’re both on the riverbank.

403
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:41,720
How about this?

404
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:44,000
if you worry about Phai

405
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:49,720
we might have to ask P’Thanu for a favor to give him a lift.

406
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,680
But they don’t know each other. I don’t want to bother P’Thanu.

407
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,080
They’re going to, this time.

408
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,800
May I have your phone. I’ll take care of it.

409
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,640
Kit’s brother?

410
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,240
Of course, I can. No worries.

411
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,280
I can. No worries.

412
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:37,400
I had no idea you’d be P’Kit’s senior at the Medicine’s.

413
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:41,560
I just knew you’re Kit’s brother too.

414
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,120
Are you the person who called P’ Kit

415
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:48,320
before returning his stuff at the dorm, right?

416
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:53,760
So, you are the one who answered the phone that day?

417
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:42,920
Have you ever seen any strange visions like that before?

418
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,800
Never. And you?

419
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:48,960
Neither have I.

420
00:46:51,880 --> 00:46:56,840
Can you repeat how it happened?

421
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,560
When our hands touched, it felt strange

422
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:07,000
and then I got those pictures in my head.

423
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,040
Should we try it again?

424
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:11,040
I didn't see anything.

425
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,040
How about you?

426
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,280
How about this?

427
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,200
Do you see it?

428
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:19,120
What do you think it is?

429
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:28,880
You and I just met today. How was that possible?

430
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:32,720
If what we saw never happened before,

431
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,280
then…

432
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:39,760
the closest explanation is....

433
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:44,280
They are the pictures of our future?

434
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:51,840
No. It can’t be. That’s impossible.

435
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,720
Or was it just an unexplainable coincidence?

436
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,440
It will never happen for real.

437
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,560
Do you believe in destiny?

438
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:45,800
Do you?

439
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:51,360
Do you believe in soulmates?

440
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:56,640
If we see that person,

441
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:58,320
we’ll know it. Until that day,

442
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,520
Let’s see if you’ll believe in destiny.

443
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,560
I must be a little confused.

444
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:09,960
I apologize if I said some weird things.

445
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,160
I understand.

446
00:51:14,080 --> 00:51:17,880
Let’s rest here till you feel better.

447
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:19,760
Yes.

448
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:45,800
Ahmm…

449
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:49,160
As your host tonight.

450
00:51:49,160 --> 00:51:51,360
Are you a host?

451
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,200
I thought you were a groom.

452
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,960
I wanted to if only my bride allowed me

453
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,440
Ahhhh.

454
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:05,960
Thank you to our honorary guests for coming to our celebration.

455
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,160
the ceremony has finished.

456
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:14,920
Next, it’s time for the after party. Let’s enjoy it until we drop…

457
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,400
Ehh. I’m sorry, P’Kit. I just got carried away.

458
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:32,560
Sab! Stop distracting me. I’ll kick you out of the ship.

459
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:35,440
P’Kit, he’ll kick me out.

460
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:40,160
You snitch! And you just tell the right person.

461
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,160
You really are Wayu’s brother!

462
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,480
Firstly,

463
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:48,840
l want to say congratulations to you all,

464
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,960
for getting the seats in the faculty that you wish for.

465
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,560
I really admire your hard work.

466
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,760
More fun experiences are waiting for you.

467
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,200
If you have any problems, you can talk to us anytime. Okay?

468
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:07,120
Now, we officially become seniors and juniors.

469
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:15,400
Right! Cheers to our soon-to-be freshmen of our University!

470
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:19,560
Cheers! Let’s drink!

471
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:26,360
Ho! Why do we have only this punch for celebration?!

472
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:33,240
What did you expect, Sab? Be a good kid.

473
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,960
Well, we’re not kids anymore.

474
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,840
We’ll be University students in a few weeks.

475
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:42,840
Can I have something to wake me up a little?

476
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,560
Then wait until it’s time.

477
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:48,720
No more negotiating!

478
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,160
Yes, sir!

479
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:54,960
Let’s go, Klui! Go get some “good kid” food to eat.

480
00:54:12,360 --> 00:54:13,040
P’Kit,

481
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:15,600
I’ll bring you something to eat.

482
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:55,960
P’Kit

483
00:54:56,320 --> 00:55:02,320
Won’t you take a photo? I made it just for you. Look, it’s a heart!

484
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:08,160
Anyone can make it. Just easily put two prawns together.

485
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:13,440
It’s not about easy or not. It’s about whom I made it for.

486
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,120
Um. Whom do you mean to make it for?

487
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:16,280
For you.

488
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:19,080
Take a picture.

489
00:55:21,640 --> 00:55:23,240
Take it for me. My hands are tired.

490
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,040
Why won’t you do it?

491
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:36,800
Here!

492
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,640
Hey!

493
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,280
What?

494
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:43,640
The food, not me!

495
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,000
Then you hold the plate.

496
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Pleaseee...

497
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:48,320
You’re embarrassing me.

498
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:49,880
No need to care.

499
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:53,800
Okay? Smile...

500
00:55:58,200 --> 00:55:59,840
Smile more. Smile...

501
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,920
Enough.

502
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:05,080
Yes, yes!

503
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:07,560
I’ll delete them.

504
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:10,480
So cute.

505
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,120
Send them to me.

506
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,960
No!

507
00:56:26,520 --> 00:56:27,280
P’Kit.

508
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:28,280
Hmm?

509
00:56:29,120 --> 00:56:30,960
Let’s look at the view at the front.

510
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:32,520
Okay.

511
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,000
I’ll be right back.

512
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:35,960
Yes.

513
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,440
Are you cold?

514
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:07,800
Why?

515
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,320
Will you take off your shirt to cover me?

516
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:12,120
Is that what you want?

517
00:57:12,120 --> 00:57:14,120
Last time I took my shirt off

518
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:17,160
and you so freaked out.

519
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,800
You have such good memories for these sorts of things.

520
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,000
I remember everything about you.

521
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,120
You know?

522
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:38,600
Every minute we spend together is very valuable to me.

523
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:45,320
P’Kit.

524
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,160
Would you dance with me, please?

525
00:58:49,480 --> 00:58:52,320
Is this party for our juniors or what else?

526
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,320
Will you dance with me?

527
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:58,120
No, it’s embarrassing.

528
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:00,080
Are you shy?

529
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,440
Me? Shy?

530
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,920
That's more like my guy.

531
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:11,200
How was my performance today?

532
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,040
Good enough to regain my score?

533
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:18,680
You have to let me pass.

534
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,320
I can’t wait to officially be your boyfriend.

535
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:26,320
Wait until you finish your 3-month probation.

536
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:28,920
I’ve been doing such good work

537
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,520
and you still keep me as your trainee boyfriend?

538
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,760
Keep complaining.

539
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:38,960
Don’t you really want to dance with me?

540
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:07,520
Are we here just to witness their love, Sab?

541
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,320
Are they going to give us the wedding souvenir?

542
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:05,640
Look! your face is so red.

543
01:02:07,280 --> 01:02:10,640
I’ve never seen you have a seafood allergy before.

544
01:02:11,720 --> 01:02:16,840
I might have eaten the toxic one.

545
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,440
Sorry, Mark. I need to take him home now.

546
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,360
Um.

547
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,600
Get better soon, Sab. Keep me updated, okay?

548
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:34,120
Who else wants a ride?

549
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:35,680
Me.

550
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:37,880
Let’s go.

551
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:40,040
See you then.

552
01:02:40,040 --> 01:02:40,520
Um.

553
01:02:42,680 --> 01:02:44,320
Take care.

554
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,160
Hey, are you alright?

555
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,600
I’m fine.

556
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:55,840
See you then.

557
01:02:57,720 --> 01:02:58,920
Goodbye

558
01:03:10,000 --> 01:03:12,480
Well, we should get back too.

559
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,320
Are you alright, P’Kit?

560
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,040
Just a little dizzy.

561
01:03:25,120 --> 01:03:27,640
Don’t know if Phai got home by now.

562
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:31,440
He’ll be fine. He’s in P’Thanu’s hands.

563
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,160
You don’t have to worry at all.

564
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,720
Let’s go.

565
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:40,640
Hey.

566
01:03:42,440 --> 01:03:43,360
I can walk.

567
01:03:44,480 --> 01:03:46,120
Hmm!

568
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,600
Don’t you remember our blessing that we have to hold each other's hands

569
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,800
and grow old together?

570
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:53,840
Um.

571
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,600
Thank you for the lift.

572
01:04:18,080 --> 01:04:22,880
Where’s the love definition jar that was at the cafe before?

573
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:25,440
It’s with me.

574
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:30,200
We accidently took it with us on our last day of internship.

575
01:04:30,200 --> 01:04:32,480
Sandee asked me to keep it.

576
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,680
Is there anything about it?

577
01:04:44,880 --> 01:04:47,680
I want to return it to you, Phai.

578
01:04:47,680 --> 01:04:49,680
Please put it in that jar.

579
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,840
You are the one who wrote it. I think you should keep it.

580
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:05,000
It wasn’t mine since the day I put it in the jar.

581
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,200
It got back to me because of you.

582
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:28,840
If so,

583
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:32,640
I should return your drawing too.

584
01:05:33,480 --> 01:05:36,560
How did you know that it’s my drawing?

585
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:38,760
And how did you have it?

586
01:05:41,080 --> 01:05:44,480
It got mixed up with the lectures you returned to P’Kit

587
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:46,200
and I accidently saw it.

588
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:52,680
It seems that a lot of coincidences happened between the two of us.

589
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:55,840
You can give it back to me later.

590
01:05:55,840 --> 01:05:59,160
We should get to see each other around.

591
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,120
I gotta go.

592
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:14,200
Have a safe drive home.

593
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,400
Love is to find someone who’ll make you understand the meaning of it.

594
01:06:57,880 --> 01:07:00,680
Love is to find someone who’ll make you understand the meaning of it.

595
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:40,360
Did you get home yet?

596
01:07:47,280 --> 01:07:50,800
I hope you find the one you’re looking for soon, P’Thanu.

597
01:07:52,480 --> 01:07:53,960
It belongs to me, sir.

598
01:07:56,960 --> 01:07:57,960
Phai.

599
01:07:58,640 --> 01:07:59,840
P’Thanu.

600
01:08:41,080 --> 01:08:43,399
P’Kit. Did you drink?

601
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:47,359
It’s Sab.

602
01:08:47,359 --> 01:08:49,760
No idea when he switched his glass with mine.

603
01:08:49,760 --> 01:08:51,359
He just couldn’t drink anymore.

604
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:57,240
So, it wasn’t an allergy!

605
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,960
He’s just tricky like his name, Sab!

606
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:14,120
That’s why you seem to be in a good mood tonight.

607
01:09:15,680 --> 01:09:17,359
Do you want me to punish him?

608
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:19,800
He dared tease my baby.

609
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:27,640
Help me carry my stuff up.

610
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:32,399
Sure.

611
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:43,350
P'Kit

612
01:09:43,720 --> 01:09:45,000
Walk carefully.

613
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,479
Are you okay?

614
01:10:04,840 --> 01:10:06,600
You’re a lightweight.

615
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,600
If anyone gives you any drinks again,

616
01:10:08,600 --> 01:10:12,080
pass it to me. I’ll get drunk for you.

617
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:15,160
It’s so hot.

618
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:24,920
Do you want to take shower?

619
01:10:24,920 --> 01:10:26,560
I’ll bring your pajamas.

620
01:10:27,920 --> 01:10:30,160
I told you it’s hot.

621
01:10:30,160 --> 01:10:32,600
Don’t you see I’m so sweaty?

622
01:10:36,160 --> 01:10:40,720
Well… I’m starting to feel it too.

623
01:10:44,880 --> 01:10:47,600
Where? Where do you feel hot?

624
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:53,480
You don’t wanna know.

625
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,760
I should go now.

626
01:10:57,760 --> 01:11:00,440
I’ll come again tomorrow.

627
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:06,280
Don’t you want to stay with me?

628
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:11,320
You asked me to stay,

629
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:13,520
then how can I leave you?

630
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,480
Are you okay?

631
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:35,200
Let me help.

632
01:11:38,360 --> 01:11:39,640
Go lie down.

633
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,360
Goodnight.

634
01:12:24,920 --> 01:12:26,680
I’m very happy.

635
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:33,080
I was so glad to get the blessing that

636
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:38,400
we’ll hold our hands and grow old together.

637
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:43,880
When I cruised with you today,

638
01:12:44,720 --> 01:12:47,520
no one has ever made me feel like this before.

639
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:58,120
We only just started.

640
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:04,000
I promise that I’ll make you even happier than today.

641
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:09,040
What do I have to do to also make you happy?

642
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,520
You just being my good boy is enough.

643
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:19,920
Thank you for letting me take care of you.

644
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:27,360
We’re together, we should be happy together.

645
01:13:28,440 --> 01:13:31,320
Don’t you want anything from me at all?

646
01:13:32,520 --> 01:13:34,800
Why are you so kind tonight?

647
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:36,920
Is this the real you?

648
01:13:37,560 --> 01:13:40,720
Do you still feel hot? I’ll bring you some cold water.

649
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:44,160
You’re so boring!

650
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:48,840
Why are you mad? Did I do anything wrong?

651
01:13:58,440 --> 01:14:00,160
You still don’t get it, silly?!

652
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:14,640
You can’t change your mind. I won’t stop this time.

653
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,840
Then, don’t stop.

654
01:15:36,180 --> 01:15:38,580
Never thought a nerd like you....

655
01:15:38,580 --> 01:15:40,920
when you're on the bed, you will...

656
01:15:41,650 --> 01:15:42,650
Enough!

657
01:15:43,560 --> 01:15:45,440
Get away from me.

658
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:47,320
Don't mess with me.

659
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:53,600
The pictures that we saw...

660
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,160
Do you think...

661
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,280
Is it gonna be real?

662
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,720
I want to be apart from Wayu for a while.

663
01:16:16,210 --> 01:16:18,170
Why you look so tired today?

664
01:16:21,880 --> 01:16:23,060
Take this!

665
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:25,440
Let's take the BKC V-PLUS.

666
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,730
Thank you, bro.

667
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,330
That's what I'm looking for.

668
01:16:29,840 --> 01:16:30,760
No problem.

669
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,120
