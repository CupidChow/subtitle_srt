[Episode 3]

4
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,630
Why is she here?

5
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:44,630
Did she sleepwalk?

6
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,620
Su Qiao.

7
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:08,650
Su Qiao!

8
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:13,030
Wake up. This is my bed.

9
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,080
Su Qiao.

10
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,290
Su Qiao.

11
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:10,840
Su Qiao!

12
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:29,170
Ah!

13
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:35,940
I just need the cassette player.

14
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:37,079
I'm almost deaf.

15
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,150
Why am I here?

16
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:41,470
What did you do to me?

17
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,690
Last night,

18
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,190
you came to my bed

19
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,350
and held me in your arms.

20
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:50,290
I couldn't even push you away.

21
00:03:51,890 --> 00:03:52,870
I want to ask

22
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,730
what you want to do to me.

23
00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:00,920
You said

24
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,060
I slept with you in my arms all night?

25
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,460
Remember now?

26
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,530
Su Qiao.

27
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,620
Open the door.

28
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,380
No!

29
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,410
You're deceiving yourself.

30
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,209
You'll be there for the rest of your life,

31
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,230
until you die!

32
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,829
So no one would know about this.

33
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,250
Why are you making trouble so early in the morning?

34
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,650
You can choose

35
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,540
either Lin Zilu or me!

36
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,480
Enough.

37
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,750
Last night,

38
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:35,140
Zilu slept in the living room because of you.

39
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:37,040
Can you stop messing around today?

40
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,990
I don't care!

41
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:40,930
Just stay in your room for the rest of your life!

42
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:57,920
Are you looking for trouble?

43
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,770
This piece of meat looks nice.

44
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,850
I just want to eat it.

45
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,170
You're crazy.

46
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,250
Is Chinese BBQ pork delicious?

47
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,320
Su Qiao!

48
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,520
You're so mean!

49
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:26,630
You ate it yourself.

50
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,060
What do you want?

51
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,320
You want to hit me?

52
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,140
I'm so scared.

53
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,060
I bought that pork the day before yesterday.

54
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,110
It's not Chinese BBQ pork.

55
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:46,370
Zilu, it's your dad's call.

56
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:48,850
Hey.

57
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,270
Brother Lin.

58
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:50,980
What?

59
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:51,820
Yes.

60
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,500
Zilu is good here.

61
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,300
Zilu

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,990
is a good...

Hello, Uncle Lin.

I'm Su Qiao.

65
00:05:58,300 --> 00:05:59,340
You don't know

66
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,500
how he treated me these days.

67
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,580
Let me tell you.

68
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,940
He's a bully!

69
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,270
Su Qiao,

70
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,700
don't tell the truth!

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,500
No, no.

72
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,660
Don't tell the...

73
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,260
Don't...

74
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:11,580
No.

75
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,300
No, no.

76
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:13,250
Don't talk nonsense!

77
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,140
Uncle Lin.

78
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:17,810
He always bullied me these days.

79
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,070
He made me fall into a mud pit,

80
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:19,980
lose a pig,

81
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,050
and waste food.

82
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:21,780
Don't worry.

83
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,730
Let him work for you

84
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,980
to compensate for your loss.

85
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,330
Uncle Lin, say it again.

86
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,600
You can use him as a laborer as you want.

87
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,330
He should suffer more.

88
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,290
Otherwise, he can only be picky.

89
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,300
Uncle Lin said

90
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,340
you should help do more work.

91
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,020
Nice try.

92
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,190
Hey!

93
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:43,750
What?

94
00:06:44,409 --> 00:06:45,610
You want me

95
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:47,130
to confirm it with your dad again?

96
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:34,409
If you have any work to do,

97
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,800
just ask Zilu for help.

98
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:36,800
Just order him around.

00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,690
Just order him around.

102
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,900
If you have any work to do,

103
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,340
just ask Zilu for help.

104
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,440
Just order him around.

105
00:07:48,330 --> 00:07:49,290
I won't give it to you.

106
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,380
Come on.

107
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,920
Give it to me.

00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,820
You're a grown man.

142
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,460
You know nothing.

143
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,760

Grandpa!

145
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:25,890
Wow.

146
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,170
You're here to send packages again?

147
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,990
Yes.

Six in total.

149
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,350
Two for each family.

150
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,260
That much?

151
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
It will cost you a lot in terms of postage.

152
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,700
They can buy these in the city.

153
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,620
Their taste is different from what they buy outside.

154
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,780
They've been eating it since childhood.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,370
I planted them myself.

156
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,200
Yes.

157
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,500
Your second daughter sent you a parcel.

158
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,250
Take it back.

159
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:47,200
She's wasting money again.

160
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,840
I'm in good health.

Remember to ask Dafei

164
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,440
to fix it.

165
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,660
Is it broken again?

166
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:58,300
Yeah.

167
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:58,730
OK.

168
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,180
I'll ask someone to fix it later.

169
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:00,890
As usual,

170
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:01,590
put it on the account.

171
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,980
Thank you.

172
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:05,290
See you tomorrow.

173
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:18,930
What's wrong?

174
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:20,830
His children are not at home?

175
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:21,990
Yes.

176
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:24,050
There are many old people stuck in this kind of situation in the village.

177
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:25,760
Their children are always away from home.

178
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,990
My uncle and I

179
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,140
help them

180
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,150
collect packages.

181
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,670
And you don't know

182
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,940
my uncle and I taught

183
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,020
the old people in the village

184
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,900
how to send messages via WeChat

185
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,940
and pay online.

186
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,080
More importantly,

187
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:41,430
we can make some money.

188
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:50,060
[Yue]

189
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,340
I don't even care.

190
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,700
I stayed up late for shooting these days.

191
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,530
I was too busy to call you.

192
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,450
How have you been?

193
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:06,820
What's going on?

194
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,300
Stop pretending like that.

195
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,470
You posted landscape pictures in your Moment every day.

196
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,080
Were you tired of hiking with the producer on your back?

197
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:13,780
Whom will you apple-polish for a certain character

198
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,840
this time?

199
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,370
Isn't one producer enough?

200
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:19,950
By the way,

201
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,350
I have something to tell you.

202
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,000
Yu He has made a song.

203
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,380
He's popular

204
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,580
on the Internet.

205
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,490
He has so many notifications to deal with.

206
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:31,670
Please congratulate Yu He for me.

207
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,810
What do you mean?

208
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:36,140
Are you really going to quit?

209
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,100
Just because of what happened?

210
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:43,970
Yue,

211
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,160
if it were you,

212
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:48,030
wouldn't you make such a decision?

213
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,440
I...

214
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,460
If it were me,

215
00:11:58,540 --> 00:11:59,490
I would...

216
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,360
From morning to night,

217
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,350
I would beg for the director's support,

218
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,830
and tell him with tears in my eyes

219
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,120
to give me a role.

220
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,320
To be honest,

221
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,550
your creativity

222
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:09,630
is as good as Yu He.

223
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,280
It's a pity to give up.

224
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:13,520
I still hope you can come back.

225
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,010
Let me think it through.

226
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,400
Are you the superstar they talked about?

227
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:28,650
No.

228
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:31,410
Just as I think.

229
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,310
How could a celebrity on TV

230
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:34,530
come here?

231
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,000
Besides,

232
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,520
you're just an ordinary person.

233
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,430
How could you be a superstar?

234
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,030
Your clothes are dirty.

235
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:47,400
Do your parents know?

236
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:49,450
Have you finished your homework?

237
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,790
Did you finish your exam?

238
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,530
What's your ranking?

239
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,680
Ah!

240
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,370
Uncle.

241
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,060
What's wrong, Uncle?

242
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,560
My tricycle overturned.

243
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,170
Qiao.

244
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,160
My tricycle overturned.

245
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,260
Overturned?

246
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,700
Did you get hurt?

247
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,500
I'm fine.

248
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,830
I just fell off.

249
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:17,740
That's good.

250
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:18,790
Hey.

251
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:20,450
Is the tricycle okay?

252
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:21,780
The control might have been broken.

253
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,040
I need to fix it.

254
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,080
So you have to go today yourself.

255
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,170
No!

256
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,570
You promised to go before.

257
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,270
My tricycle overturned.

258
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:30,290
I have to fix it.

259
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,420
And I even fell off.

260
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,700
Don't you care about me?

261
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,160
Fine.

262
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:37,950
Part-timer.

263
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,220
Come with me.

264
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,240
What for?

265
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,090
To collect debts.

266
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,780
Hey.

267
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,540
We're here.

268
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,340
Stop it.

269
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,270
Why are you taking the peaches?

270
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:02,830
You'll know soon.

271
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:06,040
Wang Nianyu.

272
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,470
Open the door.

273
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,240
You scared me.

274
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,460
What are you doing, Qiao?

275
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:12,750
I'm looking for the village head.

276
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,040
Village head?

277
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:18,380
My dad.

278
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,500
What are you two doing here?

279
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:24,910
Ah.

280
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,850
I'm here for Wang Nianyu.

281
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,700
That's all you know.

282
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:32,120
Why is Ms. Yu here?

283
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,390
Hey hey.

284
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,220
She's my aunt.

285
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,220
Come on.

286
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,300
Hurry up, call your dad.

287
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,550
Dad!

288
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,280
Dad!

289
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,320
Su Qiao is here.

290
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:46,400
Hello, village head!

291
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,170
Comrade Su is here.

292
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,380
Have a seat.

293
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:51,680
Uncle,

294
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,060
my uncle asked me to bring you some peaches

295
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,090
which we just picked from peach trees.

296
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,930
He's so kind.

297
00:14:59,100 --> 00:14:59,700
It's good that you're here.

298
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:01,150
You don't need to give me the peaches.

299
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:01,900
Thank you.

300
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:03,880
Uncle.

301
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,180
This time,

302
00:15:05,370 --> 00:15:06,660
peaches are not only soft,

303
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,430
but also hard.

304
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,190
And roasted ones are included.

305
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,820
Yes.

306
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,380
Ah?

307
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:19,470
Yes.

308
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,170
All kinds of peaches are different.

309
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,220
They all taste good.

310
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,160
Haha.

311
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,270
This time,

312
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,020
besides bringing you peaches,

313
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:26,890
I have something else to do.

314
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:27,960
Well,

315
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,350
can you pay me

316
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,110
for the "hard peaches" before?

317
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:36,830
Su Qiao,

318
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:39,460
do you think

319
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,910
I'm a person who would deny his debt?

320
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:41,900
Of course not.

321
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,430
Right?

322
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,340
After all,

323
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,520
I'm the head of the village.

324
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:45,530
Right?

325
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:47,020
Just a few catties of peaches.

326
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,900
Well...

327
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:49,630
How about this?

328
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,860
When I get my allowance,

329
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,270
I'll pay right away.

330
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:52,850
All right?

331
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,800
Uncle.

332
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,200
If I wait any longer,

333
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,070
we can't support ourselves.

334
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:58,960
Well.

335
00:15:59,110 --> 00:15:59,930
As you know,

336
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,790
for me,

337
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,460
smoking...

338
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:01,830
Oh no,

339
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:02,820
having a peach

340
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:03,940
is not easy.

341
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:04,730
Right?

342
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:05,750
I don't have

343
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:06,980
the financial power.

344
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,100
I'll give you

345
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,320
the money in a few days.

346
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,250
As for those peaches,

347
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,440
give me a few days.

348
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:12,860
OK?

349
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,090
It's a deal.

350
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:15,630
What money?

351
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:18,950
Well,

352
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,540
Su Qian came to our house for money

353
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:22,240
for the peaches.

354
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:28,210
Here's the thing, Aunt.

355
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,250
Uncle took some peaches from us.

356
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:30,580
Yes.

357
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,930
He said he would pay today.

358
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:37,800
Yes.

359
00:16:39,390 --> 00:16:40,420
Things must be mistaken.

360
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:42,220
It's not about the money for peaches.

361
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,320
It says money for cigarettes.

362
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:44,200
It's hundreds of RMB.

363
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,110
Wang Fugui!

364
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,580
Aren't you quitting smoking?

365
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,270
Well,

366
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,940
It's a gift for others.

367
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,460
A gift.

368
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,370
Really.

369
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:57,040
A gift.

370
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:58,900
Su Qiao.

371
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:00,500
You betrayed me!

372
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:01,220
It hurts!

373
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,260
Be gentle. I...

374
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,020
Listen to me.

375
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,859
I really bought cigarettes for someone.

376
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:05,460
Be gentle.

377
00:17:05,589 --> 00:17:06,390
Stop.

378
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:15,260
Take it.

379
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:19,310
Comrade Su Qiao,

380
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,200
I've paid

381
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:28,160
you.

382
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,490
Uncle.

383
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,990
Uncle.

384
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,230
Uncle.

385
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:36,300
Lin Zilu!

386
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,320
It's all your fault!

387
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:38,980
We've lost our biggest client!

388
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,740
Make compensations for me.

389
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:40,800
You must do it!

390
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,320
How?

391
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:43,720
I don't know!

392
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:54,920
Fang Liang!

393
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,040
This is my second brother.

394
00:18:06,850 --> 00:18:07,650
This is my third brother.

395
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,230
I

396
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,490
am the youngest in the family.

397
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,860
Long time no see, Su Qiao.

398
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,100
Are you looking for Fang Liang?

399
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:20,330
No.

400
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:23,320
I'm here for money.

401
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:25,560
Money?

402
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,790
You owe her money?

403
00:18:26,810 --> 00:18:27,480
What did you buy?

404
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,310
It's not me.

405
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,600
Absolutely not.

406
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,200
Not to mention me.

407
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,640
Me neither.

408
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,580
Could it

409
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:36,500
be

410
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,810
you getting it wrong?

411
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:43,700
I...

412
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,150
Could it be our eldest brother?

413
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,100
Eldest brother?

414
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:52,300
It's possible.

415
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,010
I'll ask him

416
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,010
after he comes back.

417
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:56,820
Oh.

418
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,370
Thank you, the second brother.

419
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:05,030
Do you have any profitable work to do recently?

420
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:08,130
Our farm

421
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,410
needs some commercials. Does it count?

422
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,880
Yes.

423
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,810
Hey, Lin Zilu.

424
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,620
You're as stiff as a scarecrow now.

425
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,180
Can't you have some gestures?

426
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,640
Smile.

427
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,050
Come on.

428
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:36,610
One, two, three, smile.

429
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,670
WeChat payment received.

430
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,250
Let's go.

431
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,050
Next one.

432
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:58,130
Does a superstar also need to run errands?

433
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,840
I've read the ledger.

434
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,100
I haven't bought

435
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,430
these things.

436
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,300
Grandma,

437
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,010
Guan Mingming bought these.

438
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,100
Not me.

439
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,400
Guan Jinjin bought these.

440
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,540
Jinjin,

441
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,940
how can you

442
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,720
put in on your brother's account?

443
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:20,650
No.

444
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,390
Grandma, I've never bought these things.

445
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,950
You would believe him every time he blames me.

446
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,780
I'm just afraid that he'll do that to me.

447
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,740
Every time I went to the shop,

448
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,500
I didn't even dare

449
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,400
to get something from Uncle.

450
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,150
How could I owe him money?

451
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,850
Mingming is just a child.

452
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,490
As his sister,

453
00:20:35,490 --> 00:20:36,850
what's wrong with buying him something?

454
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:37,820
You

455
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:38,630
should pay for this.

456
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:39,740
No.

457
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,650
Grandma.

458
00:20:42,570 --> 00:20:45,910
Lalala.

459
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:50,300
You naughty boy.

460
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,630
I just met Ms. Yu.

461
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,140
She also mentioned Mingming.

462
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,380
She said he's smart.

463
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,860
-Really? -He said such a good kid

464
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:02,750
shouldn't be delayed.

465
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:04,560
He should do more tests every day.

466
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:05,300
Try

467
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,130
to run ahead of others.

468
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,450
When he grows up,

469
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,380
he'll be admitted to Tsinghua University.

470
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,640
Tsinghua?

471
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,520
Yes.

472
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:12,140
Ms. Yu also said she wanted

473
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,990
Lin Zilu to give Mingming the test paper.

474
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,060
She said at his age,

475
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,080
he can't just go to school.

476
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,270
He has to prepare for Gaokao,

477
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,110
since young.

478
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,460
It happens

479
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,300
that Lin Zilu

480
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,370
came from the city.

481
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,880
He knows many tests.

482
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,590
Let him tutor Mingming.

483
00:21:25,810 --> 00:21:26,320
It's not expensive.

484
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,630
Thirty yuan

485
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,830
per class.

486
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,610
Okay.

487
00:21:30,710 --> 00:21:31,990
I don't want extra lessons.

488
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:33,180
Yes. Be good.

489
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,980
I don't want to do homework.

490
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:35,540
You need to do it.

491
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,100
I don't want to do homework.

492
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,020
Give me 50 cents change.

493
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:57,270
Welcome.

494
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,350
See you next time.

495
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:05,810
What's wrong?

496
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:09,100
He just looks like

497
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,420
my late husband.

498
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,310
I don't think so.

499
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,930
It's not about the appearance.

500
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,220
It's the fact

501
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:23,380
that both of you can't do anything.

502
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,300
Granny Liu, you have sharp eyes.

503
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,330
That's how he is.

504
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:28,180
But,

505
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,130
he

506
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,810
has the advantage that he is good at singing.

507
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,780
He always sang for me.

508
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:35,720
Hey.

509
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:38,150
I heard you're a superstar.

510
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:41,210
A superstar must know how to sing.

511
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,210
Can you sing for me?

512
00:22:43,290 --> 00:22:43,730
I...

513
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,350
Hey.

514
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,430
He can.

515
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,720
Five yuan for a song.

516
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,250
OK.

517
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,870
I'll give you 35 yuan!

518
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,720

519
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:12,800

How many are left?

528
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:49,910

Okay, let me ask you.

539
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,510
How much money

540
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,310
did you earn?

541
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,200
100 yuan.

542

But you made me lose more than that...

543
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:17,220

544
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,340
because your time is worthless?

545
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,450
I'm sorry.

546

and you have to make money for me.

555
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,460
Now,

556

you have no right to think about other things,

557

Oh.

562
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:06,010
I'll throw it away.

563
00:25:06,970 --> 00:25:07,750
Throw it away?

564
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:09,240
Impossible.

No, I didn't.

it's something that my grandma left to me?

how much time did I spend on the ledger?

586
00:26:34,590 --> 00:26:37,420

It's about the shop.

632
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,120
Let's talk somewhere else.

633
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,310
Six years ago,

634
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,220
after her grandma passed away,

635
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,650
there were only Qiao and her uncle

636
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:06,080
in the house.

637
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,420
When her grandma had an accident,

638
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,780
her uncle sold his car.

639
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,350
But he still owed a lot.

640
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:14,230
He is not very good at running a shop.

641
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,250
And he likes to help the villagers.

642
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,100
At that time,

643
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,880
he went around to work for others.

644
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:24,130
He didn't have time to rest for a year.

645
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,320
He worked day and night

646
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,740
but didn't earn much.

647
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,210
As you know,

648
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,700
besides doing free labor,

649
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,640
he also likes to squander money.

650
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,450
It's good that he didn't send himself out.

651
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,360
It's not easy for Qiao.

652
00:29:44,570 --> 00:29:45,780
Su Qiao was thoughtful at an early age.

653
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,360
When her uncle was busy,

654
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:48,740
she also went to help.

655
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,620
When the fruits in the neighboring village were ripe,

656
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,320
and were sold here,

657
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:52,740
everyone wanted some.

658
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:54,840
So she delivered the fruits to each family.

659
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:55,740
Mrs. Wang,

660
00:29:55,870 --> 00:29:57,170
I put the peaches at the door.

661
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:02,490
Apart from the shop management,

662
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,020
Su Qiao also helped the elderly

663
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:05,390
do something within her power.

664
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,830
There was a big hornet's nest in front of Granny Liu's house.

665
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,500
Su Qiao cleaned it for her.

666
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,620
She even got a few bites.

667
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,160
Yes.

668
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,310
She's been through a lot!

669
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:25,290
Previously,

670
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,250
we found aliens in Fugua Village.

671
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,420
Qiao captured them for awards.

672
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,740
Hey hey.

673
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,320
I...

674
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,700
I just added

675
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,440
some legendary mysteries.

676
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,820
The economic situation

677
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,160
is getting better,

678
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,120
and they can support themselves.

679
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,540
But her uncle

680
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:54,500
still rides his old tricycle

681
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,690
for daily goods delivery.

682
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:56,960
It's very inconvenient.

683
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,070
Qiao cares about him.

684
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,800
She wants to save money

685
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,430
to buy him a used car.

686
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,690
It was my fault

687
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,670
on this matter.

688
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:18,630
Where does she usually go,

689
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,450
when she's angry?

690
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:22,930
How about

691
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,040
going to her secret base?
