4
00:01:37,550 --> 00:01:38,110
Zilu,

5
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,039
I've managed you for two years.

6
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,620
Tell me honestly.

7
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:44,289
Did I hurt you?

8
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:45,710
No.

9
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,670
I've asked someone to write a letter of apology.

10
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,180
Go back and memorize it.

11
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,450
Apologize to Mr. Liu immediately.

12
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:55,060
I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologize?

13
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:58,030
But this is the rule of this industry.

14
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,040
If you can't figure it out,

15
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,380
you can’t keep your job.

16

Wu,

17
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,490
do you really think what I did was wrong?

18
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:04,180
Look what I found.

19
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,910
Lin Zilu is a star.

20
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,300
Hello, good morning.

21
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,530
Everyone!

22
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,430
A good day begins again.

23
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,120
I’m your village chief, Wang Fugui.

24
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,370
Today,

25
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,960
let's talk about how to prevent

26
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:30,730
rice leaf-miner in the water field.

27
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,090
It not only eats rice secretly

28
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,160
but also hides and parasitizes.

29
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,940
When we realize it,

30
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,260
the leaves will be rotten,

31
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,160
and the rice will be destroyed.

32
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,829
This season's work will be in vain.

33
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,940
But don't be afraid.

34
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:48,579
As the saying goes,

35
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:52,410
there are thousands of ways of agricultural production.

36
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:55,329
Scientific pesticide application is the first strategy.

37
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:58,300
No need to worry about boosting yields and efficiency.

38
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:01,620
Scientific pesticide application ensures a bountiful harvest.

39
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,710
Well,

40
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,470
our village has also arranged for applying this pesticide

41
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,290
-to prevent the leaf-miner.
-Come on, Wangcai.

42
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,710
Time to eat.

43
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,050
By then,

44
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,140
we have to

45
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,820
spray it evenly.

46
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,050
Don't spray repeatedly or leave spots uncovered.

47
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,390

Yes.

52
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,340
I have a great news

53
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:24,580
to inform you.

54
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:27,470
The Fang family's pineapples are mature.

55
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,510
Ah.

56
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,460
They need to rush for the harvest these days.

57
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,500
The payment will be made at the end of the day.

58
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,200
You can help out when you have time.

59
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,860
I can make money out of it.

60
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,570
Why didn't you lock the door when you used the bathroom?

61
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,030
I locked the door.

62
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,140
Your lock is broken.

Why don't you eat?

66
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:32,840
It'll get cold.

abandoned being a superstar,

71
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:52,440
instead, he came to our little Fugua Town.

72
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,170
Has he ever been kicked by a donkey on his head?

73
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:57,540
How do you know?

74
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,100
I didn't tell her.

75
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,050
Why didn't you tell me since you knew?

76
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,220
Do you know that you're not famous enough,

77
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,620
so me discovering your identity

78
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,920
surprises you?

79
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:21,640
You're very interested in me.

80
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:25,570
Why? Do you need my autograph?

81
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,060
If I need your autograph, I'm a dog.

82
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,590
But I’ve watched your acting.

83
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
Are you from the same company as Yue?

84
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:46,680
He’s already the lead.

85
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:49,150
Why did you just act as a bodyguard?

86
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,230
None of your business.

87
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,670
How could you ask him in that way?

88
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,790
He can't be the protagonist.

89
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,680
Of course, it's because he is not good.

90
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,380
He is not good.

91
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,450
So he has a bad personality and would offend someone.

92
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,220
Anyway, he just didn't have the fate to become popular.

93
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:10,180
If you ask him face to face, he'll be embarrassed.

94
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:19,620
I'm going to school.

95
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,110
Zilu, wait.

96
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:22,360
Ask Qiao to send you.

97
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,990
Why is he angry?

98
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:27,260
It's all your fault.

99
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:28,730
Uncle.

100
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,860
In a way,

101
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,680
you're better than me.

102
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,420
Uncle, I’m going to school.

103
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,280
Lin Zilu, let me make it clear.

104
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,540
Don’t let anyone know

105
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,520
about you staying at my house.

106
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,590
Especially those at school.

107
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,410
Shouldn't you do something

108
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,860
if you want to ask me for a favor?

109
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:11,720
What do you want?

110
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:14,830
The school is too far. I'm tired from walking.

111
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,420
But if I had a bike,

112
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,040
I might feel better.

113
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,890
Maybe I'll agree to some requests.

114
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,290
Shame on you!

115
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,650
Hey.

116
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:41,720
Here.

117
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:50,710
Humph.

118
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,460
My bag is still on it.

119
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:55,990
Lin Zilu.

120
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,780
Stop!

121
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,510
Give my bag back!

122
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:02,140
Stop!

123
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,190
Hey!

124
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,900
Come up. You can sit in the back seat.

125
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,330
You have a conscience.

126
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,270
Hello, everyone.

127
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,820
I just heard a good news.

128
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,020
A superstar came to

129
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,080
our village.

130
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,260
He is

131
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,900
Lin Zilu,

132
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,830
a student in the second year of high school at Fugua Town Middle School.

133
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,460
I hope you can make

134
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,580
Lin Zilu feel

135
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,140
our village...

136
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,940
I didn't tell the village chief.

137
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,760
I just posted it in the group chat.

138
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,060
But

139
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,190
the village chief's son is in the group.

140
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,110
Hey.

141
00:09:48,370 --> 00:09:49,910
Why are you so cold?

142
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:51,440
Humph.

143
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,170
What are you looking at? Why don't you go in?

144
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:02,980
We are lining up.

145
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,770
For what?

146
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,620
For visiting the zoo.

147
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,560
Speak human.

148
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:10,380
The loudspeaker announced that Lin Zilu is a superstar,

149
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,180
so the whole school came to see him.

150
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:13,990
What's there to see?

151
00:10:14,410 --> 00:10:15,890
Sign here.

152
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,040
Sign here.

153
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:19,230
Squeeze in.

154
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:19,980
Squeeze in.

155
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,130
You lead the way.

156
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:28,930
Isn't this Lin Zilu, the star?

157
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,530
I'm staying

158
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,110
at Su Qiao's house.

159
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:42,250
All those who need to take photos,

160
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
get signatures, and conduct interviews

161
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,090
should report to Su Qiao.

162
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,970
Remember to bring them back

163
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:48,960
to our home tonight.

164
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,160
You...

165
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,910
Su Qiao.

166
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,420
Are you two together?

167
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,460
Lin Zilu!

168
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,860
Zilu, you haven't figured it out yet?

169
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:44,720
I'm still confused.

170
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:47,580
I thought I could figure it out

171
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:48,990
when I went back to the village and stayed by myself.

172
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,740
Looks like I need more time to think about it.

173
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:54,910
There's no rush.

174
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:55,720
Take your time.

175
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:06,600
Yue.

176
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,750
Do you also think I did something wrong?

177
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:16,900
Have you heard?

178
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,740
Lin Zilu lives at Su Qiao’s.

179
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,380
Stop it.

180
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:27,510
Su Qiao is shy.

181
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,290
Don't be angry.

182
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,140
Life is short.

183
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,230
It'll be over soon.

184
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:45,620
Qiao.

185
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,220
I heard them say

186
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,660
you had known each other since childhood

187
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:49,730
and you played together

188
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,070
and were candid with each other.

189
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,120
The latest version is that

190
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:55,090
you and Lin Zilu have been engaged since childhood.

191
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,330
But you never met him.

192
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,300
I know these are just rumors.

193
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,750
But there are all kinds of them everywhere.

194
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,850
Even the school next town is talking about it.

195
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,250
Ah!

196
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,830
This is ridiculous.

197
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,340
I knew it.

198
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,540
Lin Zilu is a jinx.

199
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,170
A jinx.

200
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,620
He ruined my Feng Shui magnetic field.

201
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,150
He ruined it.

202
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,680
No, I can't sit back and do nothing!

203
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:18,660
I'll fight back!

204
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,420
Fight back!

205
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,840
Show him the power of Fugua Town.

206
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:24,710
Power.

207
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:44,980
Lin Zilu.

208
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,390
Lin Zilu.

209
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:51,490
Lin Zilu.

210
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,180
You're awake.

211
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,900
What are you doing?

212
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:03,430
I'm here to apologize.

213
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,880
Today's events were caused by my mistake.

214
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:08,170
I shouldn't have told others

215
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,660
about you without your permission.

216
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:10,930
Of course,

217
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,800
I didn't mean any harm.

218
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,030
However, there have been some minor unexpected occurrences

219
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,830
that are beyond my control.

220
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,470
I'll give you half of the popsicle.

221
00:14:27,820 --> 00:14:28,730
Please forgive me.

222
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:34,150
What are you up to?

223
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:37,340
What conspiracy could there possibly be in offering you the popsicle?

224
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,930
Don't think too much of me.

225
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,200
Give me the other half.

226
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:48,260
Then I'll forgive you.

227
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:53,270
It's already like this. Do you still want it?

228
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,270
Yes.

229
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,010
I’ll treat the trash can.

230
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:05,720
What?

231
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:14,990
Lin Zilu,

232
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,340
I gave you the popsicle.

233
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,400
Let's go.

234
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:19,230
Where?

235
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,490
Home.

236
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:23,490
The class is over early today. They're all off school.

237
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,720
Are you waiting for me?

238
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:27,510
Yes, of course.

239
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,910
Let's go.

240
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:45,560
I don't think this is the road we took this morning.

241
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,090
This way is shorter.

242
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,150
Just keep riding forward.

243
00:15:49,390 --> 00:15:50,310
Hurry up.

244
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,590
Stop! Stop!

245
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,280
Stop!

246
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,370
What?

247
00:16:01,130 --> 00:16:01,900
Are you ready?

248
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,100
I want to show you

249
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:06,960
the folk style of Fugua Town.

250
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:23,440
You purposely tricked me here.

251
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,060
Since you're here,

252
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,370
I won't let you go.

253
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,490
Look, everyone.

254
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,060
The superstar Lin Zilu

255
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,810
is also here to help with the harvest.

256
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,950
Look!

257
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:46,700
Young man.

258
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,280
Hey.

259
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,490
It seems that Lin Zilu

260
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,620
is used to being a superstar

261
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,850
and doesn't want to work with us.

262
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,930
He dislikes us.

263
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,920
Don't talk nonsense. He looks like a good kid.

264
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,480
He must be willing to work.

265
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,460
Right.

266
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,740
Lin Zilu didn’t say he won’t work.

267
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:10,599
Why do you dislike him so much?

268
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:11,460
Maybe someday when

269
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:13,180
he writes a memoir as a superstar,

270
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,990
he will mention this wonderful memory.

271
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,220
Yes.

272
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,890
Wonderful memory.

273
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,940
Jinjin. It's heavy. Let me take it.

274
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:01,630
It's okay.

275
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:02,920
Let me do it.

276
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,660
Not bad.

277
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,800
You're doing it the right way.

278
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,520
I accidentally bumped into you.

279
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,920
I'm sorry.

280
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,770
It's okay.

281
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,130
Is this the piglet from last time?

282
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,190
Yes.

283
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:04,780
Here.

284
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,020
The one who caused Su Qiao to lose a lot.

285
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:13,400
Can I hug it?

286
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,000
Be careful.

287
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,930
Now it's well behaved.

288
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:27,070
I didn't expect the piglet to be so cute.

289
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,460
Right?

290
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,070
Lin Zilu.

291
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,050
Are you slacking off?

292
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,590
Even a yellow cow needs to rest, right?

293
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,850
You are so pretentious and troublesome.

294
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,450
I'm here to tell you

295
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,710
to finish work early and have roast suckling pig.

296
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,740
Fang Liang's family will specially reward us.

297
00:19:48,650 --> 00:19:49,650
Why should we eat it?

298
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,770
It tastes good.

299
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:53,430
It's not enough for me to eat.

300
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:54,790
Get to work.

301
00:19:58,530 --> 00:19:59,520
Are you a human?

302
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,570
What a pity.

303
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,330
Char Siu is pretty.

304
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:11,430
It doesn't matter whether it's raised as a pet

305
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,890
or as a breeding pig,

306
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,460
it can live to adulthood.

307
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,300
It's just disobedient.

308
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:18,270
Disobedient?

309
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:21,160
Other pigs either eat or sleep.

310
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,000
It

311
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,670
doesn't eat or sleep.

312
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,860
One time,

313
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:27,820
it even bit through the cage

314
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,470
and escaped with a bunch of piglets.

315
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:31,900
Since it doesn't obey,

316
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,920
it has to be eaten.

317
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,800
Wang Nianyu, stop slacking off.

318
00:20:46,730 --> 00:20:47,310
Coming.

319
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:48,920
Coming.

320
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,460
I'm leaving.

321
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,160
Are you going to be eaten if you don't obey?

322
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,750
Why?

323
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,670
Jinjin.

324
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:15,470
I'll treat you to roast suckling pig tonight.

325
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,340
No share for me?

326
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,060
Wait.

327
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:19,930
Where is my piglet?

328
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:24,430
It must be Lin Zilu who wants to eat alone.

329
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,200
I’ll go find him.

330
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:26,840
Boss! Boss!

331
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:28,380
Look! Look!

332
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:39,020
No wonder Lin Zilu came to our village.

333
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:45,760
Char Siu.

334
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:47,550
I'll let you go

335
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,360
when I find a place with nobody around.

336
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:50,410
You must run away.

337
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,630
You must survive.

338
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,850
Why should you be eaten just because you don't obey?

339
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,420
[Three months ago]

340
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:04,370
I'm late.

341
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:05,800
Do your best.

342
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,310
Make sure the interview goes well.

343
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,290
Why is it here?

344
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,910
It's okay. Wu's here. Don't worry.

345
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,720
Let’s go.

346
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,770
Mr. Liu.

347
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:20,340
Mr. Liu.

348
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,260
Come on.

349
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,230
You're attractive like plum blossoms.

350
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,100
Mr. Liu, let me introduce.

351
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,030
They're two actors in our company.

352
00:22:32,330 --> 00:22:32,940
Say hello to Mr. Liu.

353
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,730
Hello, Mr. Liu.

354
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,940
Hello, Mr. Liu. I admire you so much.

355
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,990
Really?

356
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,350
Since you like Mr. Liu so much.

357
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,280
Come, sit next to Mr. Liu.

358
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:42,830
Have a good chat with Mr. Liu.

359
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,430
Sit down.

360
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,380
Sit here.

361
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,660
Cheers.

362
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,700
Come on, Mr. Liu.

363
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,740
Cheers.

364
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:50,570
Mr. Liu,

365
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,300
This is the information card of Lin Zilu.

366
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,910
Look, the boy is very nice.

367
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,730
He plays well and can sing.

368
00:22:58,190 --> 00:22:59,660
Come, have a drink.

369
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:00,840
Come on.

370
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,770
Sorry, Mr. Liu.

371
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,780
I can't drink.

372
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,470
Let me toast you with water.

373
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,960
Why are you here if you can't drink?

374
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:11,540
He's not an adult yet.

375
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,170
I'll toast to you.

376
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,370
Boy.

377
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:17,200
Sing a song

378
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,230
to cheer everyone up.

379
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,580
OK. Hurry up.

380
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:23,090
Sing a song. Come on.

381
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
Sing a song.

382
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:25,590
Sing a song for Mr. Liu. Come on.

383
00:23:25,930 --> 00:23:28,020
Let's toast to Mr. Liu.

384
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,260
Wish Mr. Liu's movies great success at the box office.

385
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,140
Cheers! Cheers!

386
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,850
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

387
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:43,420
Good drinker! Good drinker!

388
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:45,210
Come on. Fill it up.

389
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,850
Good things come in pairs.

390
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,090
Fill it up.

391
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:51,460
Not everyone can be in Mr. Liu's plays.

392
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,060
Come on.

393
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:54,140
We...

394
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,820
Mr. Liu.

395
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,390
Yu He is also a good singer.

396
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,910
How about she and I sing a song for you together?

397
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,310
It's good that you can sing.

398
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,260
Let's sing a love song together.

399
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,510
Let's sing Heart Rain.

400
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:09,090
-OK?
-Bravo.

401
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:13,260
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry. I can't sing well.

402
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,330
It doesn't matter if you can't sing well.

403
00:24:15,470 --> 00:24:17,560
We can talk about the script

404
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:18,870
and production.

405
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:28,050
Mr. Liu, remove your hands.

406
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,100
Shush.

407
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,180
I'll leave you a good role.

408
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,090
Remove your hands!

409
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:40,140
What are you talking about?

410
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,130
Are you crazy?

411
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:44,300
Wu.

412
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,170
Did you teach him to be like this?

413
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,010
Does he know the rules?

414
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,240
He's just a kid. He's immature.

415
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,810
Bro, don't be angry.

416
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,750
Here, a toast to you.

417
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,100
Lin Zilu.

418
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,490
Get out.

419
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:57,900
Cheers, Mr. Liu.

420
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:58,630
Cheers.

421
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,140
Come on. Mr. Liu, don't be angry. Let's drink.

422
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,660
Don't let the kid ruin our mood.

423
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,870
Come on, let's continue drinking happily.

424
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:05,840
Let's drink.

425
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,710
Come on, let's continue drinking and enjoy ourselves.

426
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:08,360
OK. Come on.

427
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,660
Come on. Love shot.

428
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,020
Okay.

429
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,900
Good drinker.

430
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,380
Bravo.

431
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:20,740
Let's drink. Come on.

432
00:26:26,990 --> 00:26:28,110
Stop fighting!

433
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,620
Beat him!

434
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,690
Stop!

435
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,710
You're asking for it.

436
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:33,020
Stop!

437
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,520
You're free.

438
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:50,220
You must survive.

439
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,440
Lin Zilu.

440
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,530
You still know to come back? Where have you been?

441
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:44,930
I've been looking for you all night. I almost broke my legs.

442
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,680
Where's the piglet?

443
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:48,620
The villagers are waiting to eat roast suckling pig.

444
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,660
I'll pay for it.

445
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,700
What kind of attitude is that?

446
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:54,480
No wonder you can't survive in the city.

447
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,140
Is the kind of un-famous

448
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,850
and untalented celebrity that my uncle talks about during the day

449
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:58,580
just like you?

450
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,090
What did you say?

451
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,240
I know everything.

452
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,340
You went back to the village

453
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:03,730
because you caused trouble in the city.

454
00:28:03,730 --> 00:28:04,820
You're fired.

455
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,070
Why are you talking nonsense here without being fully informed?

456
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,260
I am informed.

457
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,570
It's said online that

458
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:10,940
not only did you hit the director, you didn't apologize.

459
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,920
I didn't do anything wrong. Why should I apologize?

460
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:13,300
Isn't it wrong to hit someone?

461
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,330
Do you know what he did?

462
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,080
He not only insulted me

463
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,910
but forced others to drink and sexually harassed others.

464
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:20,630
Sexual harassment?

465
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:23,310
He made a move on my female colleague.

466
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,740
Do you also think it's not right for me

467
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,030
to hit someone over such a thing?

468
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,400
You did the right thing.

469
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:49,510
You should hit him at that time.

470
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:52,110
If I were there, I would also slap him.

471
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:53,840
Lin Zilu, I support you.

472
00:28:58,670 --> 00:28:59,690
You mean...

473
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,470
You mean I did nothing wrong?

474
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:02,640
Of course.

475
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,610
Not only that, you should be praised.

476
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,230
But my agent Wu said I was wrong.

477
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,260
He asked me to think about it

478
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,370
and call him back when I figured it out.

479
00:29:13,630 --> 00:29:14,380
Call him back then.

480
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:16,260
No matter who he is,

481
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,630
call him now

482
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,090
and tell him you did nothing wrong.

483
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,050
Now?

484
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:20,790
Of course.

485
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,100
Hurry up.

486
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:35,670
Stop dawdling.

487
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,050
Hey Siri, call Wu.

488
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,130
Wu.

489
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,290
Have you figured it out?

490
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,640
Yes.

491
00:30:00,610 --> 00:30:01,580
That's good.

492
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:02,710
It's common for young people

493
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,180
to be rebellious.

494
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,760
After you know you were wrong, just follow the rules.

495
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,310
After all, things like this

496
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:09,270
will happen often in the future.

497
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:09,650
Say it.

498
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:17,100
Wu, I thought about it for a long time.

499
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:19,880
But I still think I did nothing wrong.

500
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,330
I know there are rules in this industry,

501
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:24,870
but I have my persistence.

502
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,150
Thank you for cultivating me for so many years.

503
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,580
It’s good that you’ve made up your mind.

504
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,190
Lin Zilu,

505
00:30:44,150 --> 00:30:45,190
you handled this

506
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,950
really cool.

507
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:52,830
Thank you.

508
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:57,130
I didn't hear you.

509
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,170
I said thank you.

510
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,010
Louder. I can't hear you.

511
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,050
I said thank you!

512
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,830
Good boy.

513
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,510
Really? Did you find it?

514
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,990
Okay, I'll be right there.

515
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,580
Don't be upset.

516
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,710
Let's go eat roast suckling pig.

517
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,340
