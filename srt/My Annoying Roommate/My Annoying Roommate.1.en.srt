173
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,410
I knew you would be late,

174
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,050
so I lured the teacher away.

175
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,130
Follow me.

176
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,180
That's our monitor.

177
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,630
I, Su Qiao,

178
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,560
the monitor, Guan Jinjin,

179
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:10,840
big guy, Fang Liang,

180
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,570
And Blenny, Wang Nianyu.

181
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,910
We are the most famous foursome

182
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,950
in Fugua village.

183
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,220
[Class 3, Grade 2]

184
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,220
[Meigang City Fugua Middle School]

185
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,950
Why did you bring it?

186
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:36,530
I should have sent it to your home this morning,

187
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,910
but I met a jinx on the way.

188
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,210
I fell into the fields and got covered in mud.

189
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,490
So I didn’t make it.

190
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,810
-I’ll give it to you now.
-No.

191
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:46,610
What if it makes a sound?

192
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:47,420
It won't.

193
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,060
I fed it some wine.

194
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,060
It's sleeping like a log.

195
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:50,660
No.

196
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,820
If Miss. Yu finds out,

197
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,880
my brothers will beat me to death.

198
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,260
Then let them beat you to death.

199
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,120
Don't look at me.

200
00:11:58,610 --> 00:11:59,340
I'm not getting involved.

201
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,060
Don't look at me.

202
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,140
You should be responsible for it.

203
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,210
We're no longer friends!

204
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,600
No, no, no.

205
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,950
There's no one here.

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,960
Put it into the desk.

207
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,410
What?

208
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,100
Boss Su, a bottle of coke.

209
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:23,760
Pay first.

210
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:29,680
Boss Su, your business is good.

211
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,220
How much is this bottle of coke?

212
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:38,180
How can I ask you for money?

213
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,940
Miss. Yu. You work hard today.

214
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,690
Rinse your mouth with cola.

215
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,820
You're getting bolder.

216
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,810
Put it away.

217
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,790
If I catch you selling things again,

218
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:49,860
I'll confiscate all of them.

219
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:51,960
Candy.

220
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,980
Before class,

221
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:08,420
let me introduce

222
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:09,780
our newly transferred classmates to you.

223
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:11,020
Come in.

224
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:25,450
This is the jinx I mentioned.

225
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,870
He's quite handsome.

226
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,980
You can't say you are the most handsome boy in the school anymore.

227
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:34,650
Quiet.

228
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,800
Introduce yourself first.

229
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,540
My name is Lin Zilu.

230
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,530
Just sit there.

231
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,890
No.

232
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:53,820
Su Qiao. You've been a boss for a long time,

233
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:55,220
so you think you own the school, right?

234
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,750
Sit down.

235
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,490
Ignore her.

236
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,670
Just sit there.

237
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:03,370
If she dares to bully you,

238
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,410
just tell me.

239
00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:07,510
Thank you. Teacher.

240
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:14,680
In the last class,

241
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,860
we talked about the second paragraph of The Orchid Pavilion.

242
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,300
Who would like to review

243
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,660
what we talked about last class?

244
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,620
You are so shameless.

245
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,940
How dare you be my deskmate?

246
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:29,370
It's you.

247
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:30,750
I remember your face.

248
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,740
What's your name?

249
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,640
Li Lu.

250
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,000
This is my bag.

251
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:49,610
This is my seat.

252
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,800
Keep your voice down.

253
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:07,720
Char Siu.

254
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,510
Char Siu.

255
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,250
Char Siu.

256
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,320
Don't make a fuss.

257
00:15:24,130 --> 00:15:25,550
Char Siu. Stop!

258
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,700
I finally caught you.

259
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:40,380
Miss. Yu, do you like pork?

260
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,410
Su Qiao.

261
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,660
Miss. Yu, I was wrong.

262
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,780
Just watch my performance this time.

263
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,300
Last time, I flopped down on my knees

264
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,070
and captured her mind.

265
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,540
We must get Char Siu back this time.

266
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:58,300
Come on.

267
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,990
Miss. Yu. I've had such a hard time.

268
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,910
I grew up in a poor family.

269
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,580
And I have a useless uncle.

270
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,940
I've been working hard for over ten years

271
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,620
to support

272
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,040
my small but warm home.

273
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:20,580
That pig...

274
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:21,940
That pig is the life-saving straw

275
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,860
of my family.

276
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,820
There's no need to kneel down.

277
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,440
Why are you here?

278
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,230
It's none of your business.

279
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,260
Next time,

280
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,410
don't kneel down to others casually.

281
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,610
It's embarrassing.

282
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:38,030
Stop!

283
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,390
What are you doing?

284
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:43,830
Lin Zilu, are you okay?

285
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,820
You know...

286
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,500
Every school

287
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,710
always has some special students.

288
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,300
Thank you. Teacher.

289
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,970
You're welcome.

290
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:54,730
Miss. Yu, I just came here.

291
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,260
So I'm not familiar with many things.

292
00:16:56,420 --> 00:16:57,890
I would like to apply to you

293
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,660
to go back today first.

294
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,380
No problem. Go ahead.

295
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:00,410
Thank you. Teacher.

296
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,579
Miss. Yu, I was wrong.

297
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:15,510
Miss. Yu. I've had such a hard time. I grew up in a poor family.

298
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:17,020
And I have a useless uncle.

299
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,790
I've been working hard for over ten years

300
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,220
to support

301
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,810
my small but warm home.

302
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:23,750
That pig...

303
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:24,980
That pig is the life-saving straw

304
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,819
of my family.

305
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,940
Miss. Yu.

306
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,080
The life-saving straw, right?

307
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,730
Stand up.

308
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,780
The straw of last month.

309
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,740
The straw of the month before last.

310
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:44,050
Haven't you realized your mistake yet?

311
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:46,540
What do you mean?

312
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,240
This is for you.

313
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:50,740
You work so hard in class.

314
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,080
Don't tell others.

315
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,460
Cut the crap.

316
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:58,240
A self-criticism of 3000 words.

317
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,420
Also, you broke Qian's phone

318
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:01,930
when catching the pig.

319
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,000
Prepare to compensate her.

320
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,010
Li Yilu. Change seats.

321
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:25,140
Lin Zilu.

322
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,180
I've only known you for a few hours,

323
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:30,650
but you made me fall and let the pig go.

324
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:31,890
And you just let me kneel in vain.

325
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,620
My life will be shorten

326
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,700
if we continue to be deskmates.

327
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
I didn't ask you to kneel in the office.

328
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:39,150
You brought the pig and put it into my desk.

329
00:18:39,830 --> 00:18:43,310
You pounced at me this morning

330
00:18:43,530 --> 00:18:44,920
and fell because you couldn't stand properly.

331
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,040
What does it have to do with me?

332
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:47,470
Qiao.

333
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:48,670
It sounds like

334
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,830
you are just unlucky.

335
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,760
Why did you pounce at him?

336
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:55,660
I was trying to prevent someone from destroying the field.

337
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,890
You broke my cassette recorder.

338
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:57,610
How will you compensate me?

339
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,410
It's just a cassette recorder.

340
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:01,450
Are you trying to blackmail me?

341
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,850
[Yu He]

342
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,260
Don't go if you dare.

343
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,060
What kind of attitude is that?

344
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,440
I'd rather be the garbage's deskmate

345
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,800
than your deskmate.

346
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:33,790
Hello.

347
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:36,090
Zilu, you finally picked up.

348
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,010
I called you many times but you didn't answer.

349
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:39,990
How are you?

350
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:42,220
I...

351
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:44,340
I'm fine.

352
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:46,180
Anyway,

353
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,300
it's not my first time experiencing this kind of thing.

354
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:49,470
Zilu,

355
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,990
you’d better call Wu and admit your mistake.

356
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,430
Do you think I was wrong?

357
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,810
This is the rule of this industry.

358
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,740
If we still want to work in this industry, we must obey it.

359
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:16,250
What a jinx! What a jinx!

360
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,370
Why am I so unlucky?

361
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,480
Qiao. I’ve known you for more than ten years.

362
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:24,000
No one has ever talked to you like that.

363
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,380
Let's beat him up.

364
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,600
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to stand it.

365
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:29,770
He's too handsome. I'll kill him.

366
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:30,460
That's right.

367
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:32,540
We have to teach him a lesson.

368
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,620
Let him know that

369
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:35,580
we foursome is not easy to mess with.

370
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,670
Do you agree, Jinjin?

371
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:38,870
I'm not involved.

372
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:41,310
But he has left.

373
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,270
How can you teach him a lesson?

374
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,010
Go after him!

375
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,190
Laugh while you can.

376
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,360
You won't even be able to cry in a while.

377
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,440
Blenny. Take photos.

378
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:38,840
What photos?

379
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,680
I‘ll break his jaw,

380
00:21:41,710 --> 00:21:42,640
let him choke on his teeth.

381
00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:43,360
Take a photo of him.

382
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,060
I’ll take the photos.

383
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:46,620
I'll teach you...

384
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,560
Boss, he's shameless.

385
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,430
He's playing dirty.

386
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,650
Boss.

387
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,610
Looks like the enemy is prepared.

388
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,900
You're good at tactics. Boy.

389
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,500
If I don't beat you up today and let you call me dad,

390
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,920
you are my dad.

391
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:05,290
-I...
-Su Qiao.

392
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,940
Reading makes people fulfilled.

393
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,380
Thinking makes people profound.

394
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:36,710
Communication makes people sober.

395
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:39,220
Fang Liang, you don't study.

396
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,230
Wang Nianyu, you're not sober.

397
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:43,890
Su Qiao,

398
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,700
you neither read nor think,

399
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,440
nor are you sober.

400
00:22:48,230 --> 00:22:49,540
Take a good look at the slogan.

401
00:22:50,270 --> 00:22:51,540
Don't leave until you finish 100 squats.

402
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:55,210
Don't stand by anymore. Go back.

403
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,810
Wipe your sweat.

404
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:58,760
I'm not tired. Jinjin.

405
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:02,810
Jinjin is the best.

406
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,180
There are 35 more.

407
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,160
Who said

408
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:14,380
they were going to beat me up

409
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,110
and take photos?

410
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,020
Smile.

411
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,500
-Lu Xiaolin. You want to die, don't you?
-Miss. Yu.

412
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,500
Miss. Yu. I...

413
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:25,870
I'm leaving.

414
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:28,880
While the priest climbs a post,

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,160
the devil climbs ten.

416
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:35,570
[Auspicious Shop]

417
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:40,800
I have something to...

418
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,600
Leave me alone.

419
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,040
It's daytime.

420
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,050
Why is someone at my home?

421
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:35,250
How long are you going to block the way?

422
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,740
Bastard, why are you in my house?

423
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:46,690
Wait and see.

424
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,860
Come on, Zilu.

425
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:58,180
This beef is delicious. Eat it.

426
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,800
Thank you, uncle.

427
00:24:58,910 --> 00:24:59,850
It's good for your health.

428
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,530
Here, have one.

429
00:25:01,730 --> 00:25:03,810
Thank you, Zilu. Good boy.

430
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:05,700
Flatterer.

431
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,780
Qiao likes to eat corn.

432
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:10,780
Qiao. Here you are.

433
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:11,810
Cut it out.

434
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,010
Explain it to me.

435
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,790
Why is Lin Luzi here?

436
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,640
His name is Lin Zilu.

437
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:23,310
His family has something to deal with.

438
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,890
He will temporarily stay at our house.

439
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,320
Are you kidding? Did I allow him to move in?

440
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,960
Who is he? Does he deserve it?

441
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:35,140
Lin Zilu’s dad said 1,600 yuan a month

442
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,370
as his rent and living expenses.

443
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,690
Think about it.

444
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,880
1,600 yuan.

445
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,400
Then maybe it's possible.

446
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:50,860
How about this?

447
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,530
Clean up the warehouse

448
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,810
and let him sleep there.

449
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,580
He's a consumer after all.

450
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:01,000
As the landlord, we should be sincere.

451
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:02,850
So he will live in your room.

452
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:04,430
You will live in my room and I will live in the warehouse.

453
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,660
I'll live in your room?

454
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,880
Your room smells like a toilet.

455
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:09,730
Even a dog won't live in your room.

456
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,290
So you will live in the warehouse.

457
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,070
Deal.

458
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,830
Zilu, eat this beef ball.

459
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,890
This is very good.

460
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,420
This beef ball smells so good.

461
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,580
Eat, Zilu.

462
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:24,430
Hu Zhifei, you have no conscience.

463
00:26:24,570 --> 00:26:26,250
I've lived with you for more than ten years.

464
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,740
You only know that flatterer for a day

465
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,880
and you kicked me out of my room.

466
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,230
Why? I don't care.

467
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,580
From now on,

468
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,620
in this family,

469
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,610
only one of us can stay.

470
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,780
I'll give you 800 yuan.

471
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,360
It's not about money.

472
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,560
It's a matter of principle.

473
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,030
One thousand at most.

474
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:41,860
I can't give you more.

475
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,280
You want to bribe me with just 1,000 yuan?

476
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,690
That flatterer

477
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:47,020
caused me to lose a lot of money.

478
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:47,890
A thousand yuan is nothing.

479
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,980
At least 1,200 yuan.

480
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,440
No, then I have no money.

481
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,500
It's not going to work.

482
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:59,450
Fine, you don't want to, right?

483
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,240
Then don't regret it.

484
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,650
From now on,

485
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,610
I won't step into this house

486
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,580
even if it's windy, rainy, or if I'm struck by lightning.

487
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,740
You'll regret it.

488
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,270
When will you move out of my house, Lin Zilu?

489
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,150
Su qiao.

490
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,800
You finally

491
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:47,840
called my name right until now.

492
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,390
Flatterer.

493
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,810
Don't show off.

494
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,980
I didn't give you my room

495
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,020
because of 1,200 yuan.

496
00:28:35,530 --> 00:28:37,270
It's because I‘m kind

497
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,010
and magnanimous.

498
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,680
Also,

499
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:41,700
don't touch my stuff.

500
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:42,670
I locked them.

501
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,840
Bastard!

502
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:49,380
Wait.

503
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,180
What?

504
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:51,540
What's the Wi-Fi password?

505
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:54,170
I'll only say it once.

506
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:58,310
MQDQXYYYQYYYYKLSYS.

507
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,140
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

508
00:28:59,160 --> 00:28:59,770
That's all.

509
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,660
Who can remember that?

510
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,170
You can't even remember this? So stupid.

511
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,250
Zilu,

512
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,180
I set the Wi-Fi password. Is it hard to remember?

513
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,190
It's too long.

514
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,530
It's easy to remember. Listen.

515
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:18,490
There's a bunch of ducks down the bridge in front of the gate.

516
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,540
Come and count.

517
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:22,020
Two, four, six, seven, eight.

518
00:29:22,050 --> 00:29:23,520
Lula Lula...

519
00:29:23,550 --> 00:29:23,960
Zilu.

520
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,520
The first letters of the Pinyin are the Wi-Fi password.

521
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,180
I met my old friend.

522
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,810
But she doesn't seem to remember me anymore.

523
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:08,250
These are my treasures.

524
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:13,300
Look! My conch, crystal and the flying chess.

525
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:19,980
Do you like music?

526
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,620
I always wanted to have a family group.

527
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,010
In the past, only Su Qiao and I couldn't build a group.

528
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:40,840
But now,

529
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,970
welcome Zilu to our family.

530
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:48,780
Who is his family?

531
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:49,610
Leave me alone.

532
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:50,370
I have muted my phone.

533
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:55,710
Zilu. Have you decided what to do?

534
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:57,940
Call me when you make your decision.

535
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:58,540
Okay?

536
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:21,250
So handsome.

537
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,040
This scene is so cool.

538
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:53,460
Lin Zilu

539
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,680
is a star?
