3
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,540
Mr. Shi!

4
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,170
Xiaoyao!

5
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,360
In the end,
evil people will get their retribution.

6
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,210
No, no.

7
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:56,850
This all can't be true.

8
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,920
Xiaoyao...

9
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,170
Sir, please have a look.

10
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,720
Why isn't he watching where he's going?

11
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,180
What's wrong with him?

12
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,200
Are you sick or something?

13
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,280
Are you blind?

14
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,690
Tell me why.

15
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:56,690
Why is this happening? It can't be!

16
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:58,380
What do you mean why?

17
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,220
What's wrong with you?

18
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,840
- Looking for a beating, huh?
- Sir, sir, sir.

19
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:01,680
I'm really sorry.

20
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,200
My friend here
has had too much to drink.

21
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,920
Sorry, sir. I'm truly sorry.

22
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,050
Come on.

23
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:10,660
Sir,

24
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:11,810
do you remember me?

25
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm Huang.

26
00:03:19,490 --> 00:03:20,330
Sir,

27
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,450
you're the hero
who caught the female thief,

28
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:26,410
the hero of Yangzhou City.

29
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:28,970
Hero?

30
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,530
Hero.

31
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,610
Speaking of which,

32
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,820
the female thief

33
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:40,000
will be executed in a few days.

34
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,360
Will you be there, sir?

35
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:43,810
Female thief...

36
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:48,860
Female thief.

37
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,050
I knew you would come.

38
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,760
You said my parents died in Nanzhao.

39
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,760
I've told you before.

40
00:04:31,770 --> 00:04:33,440
It's just that you didn't believe it.

41
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,970
How did they die?

42
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:38,160
You came here specifically for this,

43
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,320
so you must already

44
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:42,160
have an answer in your heart.

45
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:46,090
I want you to tell me everything.

46
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,530
Everything.

47
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,440
Why should I?

48
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,730
Everything I am today is thanks to you.

49
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,880
Why should I tell you?

50
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:01,850
I can get you out of here.

51
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,480
Do you think

52
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,440
this small cell

53
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,250
can trap me?

54
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,040
Then what would make you
willing to tell me?

55
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:14,090
It depends on my mood.

56
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,810
Right now, I'm not in a good mood.

57
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:17,050
I don't want to talk.

58
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,640
I'm begging you.

59
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,250
Please tell me.

60
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,250
What else do you want to know?

61
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,820
The truth.

62
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:03,570
The whole truth.

63
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,480
Ten years ago,

64
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,630
they snuck into
the Nanzhao Imperial Palace to steal

65
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,250
the Witch Queen's Water Spiritual Bead
and got caught.

66
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,730
The Witch Queen
ordered a massive manhunt.

67
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,820
Though they desperately tried to escape,

68
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,730
they were still hit by

69
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,640
the Witch Queen's unique
Shadowless Poison.

70
00:06:25,450 --> 00:06:27,820
Those poisoned would suffer
as if their intestines were rotting,

71
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,090
like being bitten by thousands of ants,

72
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,640
with excruciating pain.

73
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,440
So, Li,

74
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,320
your parents

75
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,640
died in agony.

76
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:43,980
My parents

77
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,850
were killed

78
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,850
by Ling'er's mother?

79
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,170
No.

80
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,880
It's impossible.

81
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:01,410
Impossible.

82
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,200
Considering I'm somewhat
of an elder to you,

83
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,760
let me advise you.

84
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,850
You're alone and powerless.

85
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,600
Don't think about revenge.

86
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,880
It would serve as consolation
to your parents' spirits in heaven.

87
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,660
Your Highness,

88
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,850
you've been waiting all night.

89
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,130
He's not coming back.

90
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,540
No,

91
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,410
he will come back.

92
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,050
We should set off as soon as possible.

93
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:37,640
I promised Xiaoyao

94
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:39,800
that I would never leave him again.

95
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,090
But this time, he left you.

96
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,970
Impossible.

97
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,530
I will wait for you at the dock.

98
00:09:37,340 --> 00:09:38,410
Weren't my dad and mom

99
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:40,460
the envied couple in the martial world?

100
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,930
What envied couple?

101
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,730
Your parents are wanted
by the authorities now.

102
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,140
- You can't end up like your dad.
- You're lying.

103
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,120
My dad's not a thief.

104
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,340
My dad is a hero.

105
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:51,170
Xiaoyao of the Li family,

106
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:53,290
a thief's son with great ambition,

107
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:55,680
dreams of being a swordsman
reaching the clouds like the Sword Immortal.

108
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,340
Sleeping till noon,

109
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,220
living in dreams every day.

110
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,320
If your parents hadn't been so greedy

111
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,290
and messed with those
Nanzhao people back then,

112
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,760
they wouldn't have ended up like this.

113
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,970
They got what they deserved.

114
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:12,240
This is well-known
among the Nanzhao people.

115
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,930
Xiaoyao.

116
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:04,970
Ling'er.

117
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,930
Ling'er.

118
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,130
Ling'er.

119
00:11:15,970 --> 00:11:16,810
Ling'er.

120
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,010
Ling'er.

121
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,680
Ling'er,

122
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,540
let's go.

123
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:22,660
Let's leave this place together.

124
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,020
No matter what happened before,

125
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,630
it's irrelevant to anyone else.
You are still you.

126
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,620
Ling'er.

127
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,810
Ling'er.

128
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:40,130
Ling'er.

129
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,490
Ling'er.

130
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:46,970
Have you seen Ling'er?

131
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,440
Wasn't Ling'er with you?

132
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,100
Li Xiaoyao!

133
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,640
I'm leaving now.

134
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,970
If not looking back,

135
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,410
why not forget?

136
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:28,930
If it's not destiny,

137
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,000
why make promises?

138
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,530
Today's matters,

139
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,240
like water, leave no trace.

140
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,610
Tomorrow, what of tomorrow?

141
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:48,250
You'll be

142
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,320
a stranger on a different path.

143
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,250
Hey,

144
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:28,130
tell me now

145
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,090
how you're doing business.

146
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,380
Okay, okay, okay.

147
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:31,220
Waiter!

148
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:34,850
- Yes, sir?
- Good.

149
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,090
You can't drink anymore.

150
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,200
Let me tell you.

151
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:40,250
Well...

152
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,320
I'll get you some wine right now.

153
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,460
Probably had too much.

154
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,630
Acting crazy after being drunk here.

155
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,560
Young man, you can really drink.

156
00:14:55,850 --> 00:14:57,290
Drinking alone is so boring.

157
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,970
Here, let me toast to you.

158
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,050
Young man, you're really being rude.

159
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,650
My friend is offering you a drink,

160
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:11,050
and you're not
showing any courtesy at all.

161
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,890
Get lost!

162
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:21,120
Money! The bill for the wine
hasn't been settled yet.

163
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,180
I'll take care of it.

164
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,420
Li Xiaoyao,

165
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:25,930
what are you going crazy for here?

166
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:27,970
Are you trying
to drink yourself to death?

167
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:30,380
A little drinking is fun,
while too much of it harms the body.

168
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,600
- Better not to drink...
- Get out of my way!

169
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:38,800
What happened with you and Ling'er?

170
00:15:39,290 --> 00:15:40,560
Why did Ling'er leave again?

171
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,810
Li,

172
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,410
although I don't know what happened

173
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:49,390
between you and Miss Ling'er,

174
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:50,850
there's always a solution.

175
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,260
Nothing in this world

176
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,640
can't be solved.

177
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,760
This can't be solved by anyone.

178
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:01,760
Can't be solved?

179
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,440
Tell us. Let us help you solve it.

180
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:08,570
Be careful.

181
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:20,000
No one can help me.

182
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,050
No one.

183
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,980
Li Xiaoyao,

184
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:39,240
Ling'er left. Why don't you go after her?

185
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,370
Where's the effort
you used to find her before?

186
00:16:42,090 --> 00:16:43,410
Drinking here, avoiding the problem.

187
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,560
How can you solve anything?

188
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,000
You're really despicable now.

189
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:48,130

270

272
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,580

273
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,490

274
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:25,050
Sorry, A'nu.

275
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,090
It must have been Mr. Shi who took you.

276
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,320

00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,530

00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,050

So, here we are now.

280
00:22:36,770 --> 00:22:39,220

281
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,040

is also my responsibility.

282

283
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:43,730

284
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:47,560

285
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:51,320

Thousand Worms Devouring Heaven.

00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,010

287
00:22:53,890 --> 00:22:54,730

not to cause trouble anymore,

358
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,040
is finding Ling'er
only your responsibility?

359
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,800
This all started because of me.

360
00:27:35,050 --> 00:27:36,520
I don't want to involve you all.

361
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,770
Since when did you
become so overcautious?

362
00:27:45,050 --> 00:27:46,700
Li, I understand your feelings,

363
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,770
but the Yunmeng Marsh
that Miss Ling'er went to in the southwest

364
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:50,010
is no ordinary place.

365
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:51,890
It's not even marked on the maps.

366
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,090
Where will you start looking?

367
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:58,490
Why not return to the capital
with us first?

368
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,130
I have some connections in the capital.

369
00:28:00,410 --> 00:28:02,730
Maybe we can find
the exact location of Yunmeng Marsh.

370
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,320
It won't be too late to leave then.

371

373

00:28:21,650 --> 00:28:22,490

00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,850
Excuse me.

377
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,740
Is this the boat to the capital?

378
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,580
Yes.

379
00:28:35,170 --> 00:28:36,200
When does it leave?

380
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,540
It's leaving now.

381
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:07,850
Don't worry.

382
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,850
We'll find Ling'er.

383
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,250
Silly rat,

384
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,970
we've been in danger together
several times.

385
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:28,680
What can't you tell us?

386
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:30,010
Whatever happens,

387
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,850
me...

388
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,200
Me and Jinyuan will help you.

389
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,650
What exactly happened

390
00:29:54,170 --> 00:29:55,770
between you and Ling'er?

391
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:09,730
If

392
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:13,680
it were you,

393
00:30:16,410 --> 00:30:18,200
would you fall
for the child of your enemy?

394
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,130
Are you saying...

395
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,400
How could that be?

396
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,560
I thought it was impossible too.

397
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:39,730
I don't want to believe it.

398
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:43,680
I just can't help but overthink.

399
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:47,770
Are you sure it's true?

400
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,320
Then why do you look like this?

401
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,800
If you're not sure,
go find out the truth.

402
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:59,890
Sometimes seeing isn't believing,

403
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:02,090
let alone hearsay.

404
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,040
If it were me,

405
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:15,890
as long as it's where my heart lies,

406
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,850
I would never change my mind.

407
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,420
Thank you,

408
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,210
savage girl.

409
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,520
Don't be afraid.

410
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,130
I'll be very careful.

411
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,420
Careful, careful.

412
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,130
Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid.

413
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:54,770
I'll be very careful.

414
00:32:58,130 --> 00:32:58,970
Are you okay now?

415
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:20,970
Jinyuan!

416
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:23,610
Coming!

417
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,180
Jinyuan!

418
00:33:26,530 --> 00:33:28,130
It's half a day left
before we reach the capital.

419
00:33:28,130 --> 00:33:28,980
Come eat something.

420
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,820
Coming, coming.

421
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,820
Have some.

422
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,860
These buns look good.

423
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:38,700
You try first.

424
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,580
Indeed quite good.

425
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:51,820
Li,

426
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,410
Miss Ling'er is with Tang Yu and A'nu.

427
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:55,340
Nothing will happen to her.

428
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,440
Ease your mind a bit.

429
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,930
Let's go. We can eat while walking.

430
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:15,620
What's wrong?

431
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,010
Nothing, nothing.

432
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,410
Take it easy.

433
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,860
(Capital)

434
00:34:31,780 --> 00:34:33,220
(Capital)

435
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,690
Finally back.

436
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,620
(Good Weather for Crops)

437
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:43,790
Looking back at the capital,
it seems like a pile of embroidery.

438
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,760
The doors at the mountain top
open one by one.

439
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,960
- See, this is the capital.
- The capital really is prosperous.

440
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:52,590
Yueru, how long has it been
since you last came to the capital?

441
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,790
Candied haws!

442
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:55,370
Not that long, I guess.

443
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,370
Candied haws!

444
00:34:57,810 --> 00:34:58,650
Yueru.

445
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,620
Yueru,

446
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:02,210
when we enter the house,

447
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:04,890
can you go in first?

448
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:05,730
Why?

449
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,520
Well...

450
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,820
I know.

451
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,300
You're afraid of angering Auntie,

452
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:14,570
so you want me to take the fall, right?

453
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,520
Exactly, exactly.

454
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:25,490
Let's go.

455
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,570
What's the fight about?
What's happening?

456
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,410
Get lost.

457
00:35:42,770 --> 00:35:43,610
Let's go.

458
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,130
Candied haws!

459
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,090
Let's go. Let's go.

460
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,450
What's wrong?

461
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:48,480
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

462
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,340
- Sir, your money.
- Candied haws!

463
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,480
Your money.

464
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,040
Be sure to keep an eye on it this time.

465
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,060
You...

466
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:11,690
You used the Dragon Pick, right?

467
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:14,610
How did you know?

468
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,850
Li Xiaoyao, there are snacks ahead.

469
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:17,960
Let's go. I'll take you to eat.

470
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,010
Let's go.

471
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:29,200
Candied haws!

472
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,740
Candied haws!

473
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,260
Come and buy!

474
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,100
- Li, are you okay?
- Candied haws!

475
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:37,970
I'm fine.

476
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:39,450
Let's go.

477
00:36:41,610 --> 00:36:43,410
Cosmetics!

478
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:52,700
(Lizhao Residence)

479
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,810
The young master is back!

480
00:36:54,810 --> 00:36:56,300
- Don't shout. Stop it.
- Come back. Come back.

481
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,140
Come back.

482
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,060
Where's my mother?

483
00:36:58,370 --> 00:36:59,280
The lady is in the hall.

484
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,380
- Auntie!
- Yueru.

485
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,060
Do me a favor.

486
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,380
Here.

487
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,010
Please.

488
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,040
Here, here.

489
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:09,930
Here, here.

490
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,320
This way, this way.

491
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,580
- Thank you.
- Yueru,

492
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,060
please your aunt.

493
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:15,900
Then,

494
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:18,240
calm her down.

495
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:20,900
Auntie!

496
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,820
Auntie!

497
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,320
Auntie, I'm back.

498
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,720
Who's this girl?

499
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:39,450
(Mrs. Yun)
Why are you calling me Auntie?

500
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:42,060
You didn't even look at me.

501
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,520
How would you know
whose daughter I am?

502
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,320
Now you've seen.

503
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,960
I'm from the Lin family in Suzhou City.

504
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,890
Don't you recognize your own niece?

505
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,780
I remember

506
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,720
my niece wouldn't act like this.

507
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:58,490
She

508
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,720
would come to see me
every now and then.

509
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:03,980
How come I haven't seen her

510
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,760
for such a long time?

511
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,960
Here I am now.

512
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:21,370
You always make me forget all that.

513
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:24,720
You're not angry anymore?

514
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:26,890
I wasn't angry to begin with.

515
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:30,090
Even if I was,
seeing you would dissipate all of it.

516
00:38:30,090 --> 00:38:30,930
Really?

517
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,250
Really.

518
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,690
Then you've said it. You're not angry.

519
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:41,000
Mother.

520
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,650
You rascal!

521
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,560
Mother.

522
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,520
You rascal!

523
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:47,940
You still know you have a home, huh?

524
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,370
You still know how to come back, right?

525
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,000
Mom, my friend is here.

526
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:52,570
I'm telling you.

527
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,700
Now that you're back,
you're not going anywhere.

528
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,540
Did you hear me?

529
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,480
- But I...
- No buts.

530
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:00,410
You should start settling down,
considering being an official.

531
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,250
Mother.

532
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:13,240
This is...

533
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,800
I am Li Xiaoyao,
pleased to meet you, Madam.

534
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:19,280
So, you're Mr. Li.

535
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:21,650
Sorry for what you saw just now.

536
00:39:22,410 --> 00:39:23,370
Madam, you're too kind.

537
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:25,020
My aunt used to treat me the same way,

538
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:26,410
so it feels very familiar.

539
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,280
Mr. Li, don't be polite.

540
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,760
Just call me Mrs. Yun.

541
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,460
I see you've had a hard journey.

542
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,650
Go rest in your room first.

543
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:38,450
I'll prepare some food
and drinks for you.

544
00:39:38,850 --> 00:39:39,890
Okay, Auntie.

545
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,480
Please prepare some
delicious dishes for me.

546
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,280
I haven't eaten well
throughout the journey.

547
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:45,900
Okay.

548
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,020
Don't worry.

549
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,450
I will prepare your favorite dishes.

550
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,010
Let's go.

551
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,060
Scholar,

552
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,090
about Ling'er, please...

553
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,170
About Miss Ling'er, I have my plans.

554
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,620
Yueru,

555
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,560
that Mr. Li

556
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:06,170
is the one you competed with
in combat for marriage, right?

557
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,850
Auntie, you already know.

558
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,410
Your father wrote to us

559
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:13,040
and told us everything.

560
00:40:13,570 --> 00:40:15,650
Your father, though stubborn,

561
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,280
is very concerned about you.

562
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,560
He shouldn't worry needlessly.

563
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,240
Just taking care of himself is enough.

564
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,450
Tell me.

565
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:26,370
You and Mr. Li...

566
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,650
You two...

567
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:29,040
We're just friends.

568
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,370
I watched you grow up.

569
00:40:32,610 --> 00:40:33,930
You can't hide your little secrets

570
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:35,450
from me.

571
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,780
Auntie.

572
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:43,520
You two are currently...

573
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,410
I just consider him a good friend.

574
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,340
Besides,

575
00:40:49,850 --> 00:40:51,320
he already has someone he likes.

576
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,170
She's also a good friend of mine.

577
00:40:55,570 --> 00:40:57,000
Now you've grown up,

578
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:59,560
so you have your own thoughts
about romantic feelings.

579
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,260
We, as the older generation,

580
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,760
shouldn't interfere too much.

581
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:04,610
But remember one thing.

582
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:08,130
In this matter, you can't force others,

583
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,960
nor yourself.

584
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,170
I understand.

585
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:17,320
Sure. I'm not worried about you.

586
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,300
You're a bit naughty,

587
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,760
but you know how to do things properly.

588
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:23,170
Auntie, you know me the best.

589
00:41:24,490 --> 00:41:25,330
Auntie,

590
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:27,610
I have a favor to ask
of you and my uncle.

591
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,370
What is it? Just tell me.

592
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,410
Li,

593
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,890
you should rest for today.

594
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,060
Don't worry.

595
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:37,980
I've already sent someone

596
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,210
to inquire about Miss Ling'er.

597
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:56,930
You used the Dragon Pick, right?

598
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:03,170
Li?

599
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,690
Scholar, I need to go out.

600
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,970
Where to?

601
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:11,610
To find the beggar we met today.

602
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:14,730
To find

603
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,040
a beggar?
