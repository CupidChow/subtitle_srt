00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 7=

3
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,500
Wake up.

4
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:09,450
Wake up.

5
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:16,580
Look,

6
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:17,560
there's blood on the ground.

7
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:20,890
The Snake Demon
must have gone that way.

8
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:33,170
Why are there
more and more forks in the road?

9
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:35,090
What place is this?

10
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,970
I miss my grandfather.

11
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,410
I miss my grandfather.

12
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:53,380
Don't, don't kill us.
Please don't kill us.

13
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,460
Don't be afraid.

14
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,920
We're here to rescue you.

15
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:58,170
Hero,

16
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,380
please let us out.

17
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,300
We beg you.

18
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,120
Have you seen a girl
named Zhao Ling'er?

19
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,560
No, we haven't.

20
00:04:11,660 --> 00:04:12,920
What does the Snake Demon do with you?

21
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,330
The Snake Demon captures young girls

22
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,250
to absorb their vital energy

23
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,290
for the Fox Demon's cultivation.

24
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,130
Fox Demon?

25
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,100
Yes.

26
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:23,540
She's the Snake Demon's wife.

27
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,530
So,

28
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,480
Ling'er must have been captured
by those two demons.

29
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,780
Don't worry.

30
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,140
We'll rescue you soon.

31
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,260
Thank you, Miss.

32
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:38,920
Thank you, Hero. Thank you so much.

33
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,780
(Female Fox Demon)

34
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:24,290
You hurt my husband.

35
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:25,730
Hand over Ling'er.

36
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:28,700
Ling'er? What Ling'er?

37
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,360
Stop talking nonsense
and hand over Ling'er.

38
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,640
Or I'll end you here and now
for the people.

39
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,200
That's big talk.

40
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:47,130
The Ling'er girl you're looking for,
I ate her.

41
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,090
Can you even kill me?

42
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,850
I'm coming.

43
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,570
Honey!

44
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,540
Where's Ling'er?

45
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:11,640
Where is Ling'er?

46
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:13,040
You...

47
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,090
If you release my husband,
I'll tell you.

48
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:18,940
Speak quickly!

49
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,570
She's over there.

50
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,050
Be careful!

51
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,730
Hon...

52
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:35,880
Honey...

53
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:43,980
Ling'er.

54
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
Ling'er.

55
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,570
Ling'er.

56
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:53,170
Ling'er!

57
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,660
Li Xiaoyao,

58
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,760
calm down.

59
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,200
Ling'er isn't here.

60
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,970
Let's go look elsewhere.

61
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,880
That Fox Demon said

62
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,290
Ling'er has been...

63
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,240
Do you think she really...

64
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,560
You are a fool.

65
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:11,940
She said those things
just to disturb your mind.

66
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,370
Can you snap out of it?

67
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,940
Let's leave this place

68
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,200
and find another way to locate Ling'er,

69
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,540
okay?

70
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:15,450
Uncle.

71
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,740
Jinyuan,

72
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,140
this cave is dangerous.

73
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:19,930
Stay here since you
don't know martial arts.

74
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,000
- Li, Yueru, are you alright?
- Dad!

75
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:26,100
- Let's help them first.
- It's okay.

76
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:26,810
Help them first.

77
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,620
Come on, come on.

78
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:30,010
- Yueru!
- This way, this way.

79
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:31,100
- Father!
- Let's go.

80
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,220
Are you alright?

81
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,850
I'm fine. Why are you here?

82
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,240
How could I not come

83
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,640
with that Snake Demon being so powerful?

84
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,930
We killed both the Snake Demon
and the Fox Demon.

85
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,660
What?

86
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,140
You really killed the Snake Demon?

87
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,980
Of course.

88
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,490
Then...

89
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,800
Where is Miss Ling'er?

90
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,220
She's not here.

91
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:10,180
Dad,

92
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,440
since Ling'er disappeared
from Lin Fortress,

93
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,050
it's my responsibility to find her.

94
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,130
I know

95
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,440
you think I'm not mature enough,

96
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,560
still reckless and impulsive.

97
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,120
But I want to tell you

98
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,760
I have grown up.

99
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,120
I'm no longer the little girl
who cries when she falls.

100
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:33,490
So,

101
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,970
whether you agree or not today,

102
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,930
I'll take up this responsibility

103
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:39,410
to find my friend

104
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,640
and ensure her safety.

105
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,690
Yueru,

106
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,250
this is

107
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,000
our family's secret technique,

108
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,730
called "A Throw of Qiankun".

109
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:07,000
Wandering the martial world

110
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,490
is not like being at home.

111
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,610
No one will be lenient with you.

112
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,490
When it's time to use deadly moves,

113
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,120
you must not hesitate.

114
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,850
Father, you agree?

115
00:12:22,090 --> 00:12:23,200
If I don't,

116
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,730
would you not go?

117
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,580
(A Throw of Qiankun)

118
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,290
With this secret manual,

119
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,340
I won't disgrace Lin Fortress.

120
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,180
Promise me,

121
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,320
once you find Miss Zhao,

122
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:37,850
come back home immediately.

123
00:12:38,730 --> 00:12:39,570
Rest assured, Father.

124
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:46,220
Yueru,

125
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,640
you must come back safely.

126
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,740
I'll swear it with a high five.

127
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,020
(Baihe Village)

128
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,410
- Come on, come on.
- Slow down.

129
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,180
Miss,

130
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,090
you're awake.

131
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,240
Where am I?

132
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,490
This is the medical hut
of Han, the Great Physician.

133
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,120
I'm a medic here.

134
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,050
Physician Han found you unconscious

135
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:09,640
in the forest while searching for herbs

136
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,170
and brought you here.

137
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,760
These clothes belong
to Physician Han's daughter.

138
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:20,800
Where is this medical hut located?

139
00:14:21,730 --> 00:14:24,260
Just ahead, there's a mountain

140
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:25,320
called Mount Guiyin.

141
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,880
Behind us is the Baihe Village.

142
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
Both I and Physician Han
are the villagers.

143
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,050
Did Mr. Han

144
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,090
say if there was anything unusual

145
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,900
about me?

146
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,730
Don't worry, Miss.

147
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,530
Physician Han said

148
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:45,580
you were just weak and fainted.

149
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,800
There's nothing serious.

150
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:52,050
That girl must be your friend, right?

151
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,530
Physician Han said
when he found you,

152
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,760
she was lying beside you.

153
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,320
Her wrist appeared to have been bitten,

154
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,760
seemingly in an effort to protect you.

155
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,850
Can Physician Han save her?

156
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:09,570
Save?

157
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:10,970
She can't be saved.

158
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,090
It's too late now.

159
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,090
(Han, the Great Physician)
She was bitten by a corpse demon.

160
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:21,640
The corpse poisoning

161
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:23,760
has already begun to spread.

162
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:26,880
Corpse poisoning?

163
00:15:27,290 --> 00:15:29,730
Currently, I can only use silver needles

164
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,530
to delay the spread of the poison,

165
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:32,640
but

166
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,640
it's only a matter of a few hours.

167
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:45,640
Physician Han,

168
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:48,490
can I

169
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:50,640
try something?

170
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:54,320
She's beyond saving.

171
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,530
You might as well

172
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,320
consider her no longer your friend.

173
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,200
You should leave quickly.

174
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,810
This place

175
00:16:03,610 --> 00:16:05,240
is not where you should be.

176
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,930
Physician Han,

177
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:09,610
please let me try.

178
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:34,580
(Mount Guiyin)

179
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,370
Be careful, Yueru.

180
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,060
Be careful, careful.

181
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,660
Li.

182
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:47,890
Li,

183
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,610
let's rest for a bit.

184
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,880
Yeah, with you walking so aimlessly,

185
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,610
how could we find Ling'er?

186
00:16:59,650 --> 00:17:00,850
Let me drink some water.

187
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,220
I'll drink some water.

188
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,450
Take a break.

189
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,890
Don't worry.

190
00:17:12,890 --> 00:17:14,250
Ling'er will be fine.

191
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,560
Since Miss Ling'er wasn't captured
by the Snake Demon,

192
00:17:18,890 --> 00:17:20,520
she must be waiting for us somewhere.

193
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,010
Good people are blessed, after all.

194
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,340
No matter how far I need to go,

195
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,320
I must find Ling'er.

196
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:32,970
Savage girl,

197
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,400
how is your lightness skill?

198
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:37,520
I'm not sure how good it is,

199
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,970
but it's definitely
much better than yours.

200
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,440
Then teach me now.

201
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,560
Now? You want to learn lightness skills?

202
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,170
Learning some might help me move faster,

203
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,280
so I can find Ling'er sooner.

204
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,730
But we're not even sure
of the direction now.

205
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:53,040
Even if you move faster,
it wouldn't help, right?

206
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,460
Exactly.

207
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:56,170
Ling'er just disappeared not long ago.

208
00:17:56,170 --> 00:17:58,160
Even if someone captured her,
they couldn't have gone far.

209
00:17:58,530 --> 00:17:59,740
As long as our direction is correct,

210
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:01,160
we'll definitely find Ling'er soon.

211
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,650
Fool, stop thinking of such nonsense.

212
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,420
Nonsense?

213
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,440
Then tell me,

214
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,850
what's a sensible method?

215
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,520
As if you're the only one worried,

216
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:14,370
questioning this and that all day.

217
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:15,320
- Who do you think you are?
- I...

218
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,580
Yueru, Li.

219
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,090
She's acting strangely.

220
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,200
You're anxious for Ling'er,
which is understandable,

221
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,890
but look at yourself now.

222
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,390
And consider the injuries
you have received.

223
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,850
I'm fine. I don't need you
to worry about me.

224
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,370
Then do you care about how others feel?

225
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:29,410
What's wrong with others?

226
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,500
After we fought the Fox Demon,

227
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,050
why didn't you ask if I was hurt?

228
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:33,500
You weren't hurt, so why would I ask?

229
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:34,700
How do you know I wasn't hurt?

230
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,090
I was right beside you at the time.

231
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,250
Yueru.

232
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:39,210
Yueru...

233
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:42,250
Why are you arguing again?

234
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,740
Scholar, look at her.

235
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,280
Your cousin is being unreasonable.

236
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,680
Li, just calm down.

237
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,130
My cousin, from a young age till now,

238
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,650
has never been in such danger.

239
00:18:50,130 --> 00:18:51,440
Though she doesn't say it,

240
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,130
she must be very nervous inside.

241
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,010
She's just trying to relieve some stress.

242
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:57,130
Don't take it to heart.

243
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,170
The priority

244
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,520
still is to find Miss Ling'er.

245
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,780
Forget it.

246
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,200
I can't be bothered to argue with her.

247
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:11,820
You should have asked me.

248
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,100
Whether I answer or not is my business.

249
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,440
But not asking is your fault.

250
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,370
Jerk. You have to provoke me every time.

251
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:19,200
Next time I'll make sure
you cry out loud.

252
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,560
What is all this?

253
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,220
It is said the bodies
that don't decompose after a long burial

254
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,410
will have eyes like white pearls,

255
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:58,440
curved fingers like hooks,

256
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,130
and teeth exposed out of lips
like blades.

257
00:20:00,130 --> 00:20:02,250
Such transformed corpses
are called corpse demons by the people.

258
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:02,850
Corpse demons?

259
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:05,170
What, scared? Then hide.

260
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,250
I'll protect you.

261
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:11,890
Be careful.

262
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:14,100
It's said being bitten by a corpse demon
can turn you into one too.

263
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:27,770
Please stop, don't hit me.

264
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,610
Stop hitting me.

265
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,100
Please stop, don't hit me.

266
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,050
Stop hitting me.

267
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,730
Stop, stop hitting me, please.

268
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,800
Help!

269
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,010
It hurts so much.

270
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,560
It hurts!

271
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,520
Stop, stop, stop hitting.

272
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,520
Why stop? Are you scared?

273
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:08,210
It's not that I'm scared.

274
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,680
It's that ghosts are afraid of people.

275
00:21:10,370 --> 00:21:11,210
Afraid of people?

276
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,010
Corpse demons
are transformed from the dead,

277
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,680
naturally having no pain
or consciousness.

278
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,650
But these corpse demons,

279
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:19,160
scared away by you,

280
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,250
must be ordinary people in disguise.

281
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,200
Exactly.

282
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,010
Did you really think
I couldn't see through it?

283
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,490
Speak up.

284
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:28,600
Why pretend to be a corpse demon
when you could be a normal person?

285
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,370
Speak. What's your name?

286
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:31,320
Why dress up as a corpse demon?

287
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:33,610
I...

288
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:34,770
My name is Li Si.

289
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:37,800
This is Mount Guiyin.

290
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,560
Strangers are not allowed to trespass.

291
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:40,970
Mount Guiyin?

292
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,010
Dragon-hidden Cave is in Mount Guiyin.

293
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,730
Then why are you
playing corpse demons here?

294
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,680
Not talking, huh?

295
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,250
Don't hit us. Don't hit us.

296
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,090
We...

297
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,180
We...

298
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:55,130
We're just

299
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:57,770
bandits living in Mount Guiyin,
trying to make a living.

300
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,970
Bandits?

301
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,890
Our village

302
00:22:05,410 --> 00:22:06,920
used to be here in Mount Guiyin.

303
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,010
Then the corpse demons appeared,

304
00:22:10,290 --> 00:22:12,040
and the young and strong fled.

305
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:13,730
Only some old people and kids remained.

306
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,090
We really couldn't survive, so

307
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,250
we thought of robbery.

308
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,050
Really.

309
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,100
Just after dealing with the Snake Demon,
now it's corpse demons.

310
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:31,770
Have you seen a girl
about 17 or 18 years old,

311
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,610
named Zhao Ling'er?

312
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,970
Zhao Ling'er?

313
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,130
Yes, we have seen her

314
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,320
just now.

315
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,490
Yes, yes, yes.

316
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:38,440
Why would it be ineffective?

317
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,300
Miss,

318
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,040
seeing you cast spells just now...

319
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:45,370
Are you a cultivator?

320
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,730
That was the Guanyin Mantra
my master taught me.

321
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:58,040
It can save lives in critical moments.

322
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,680
But for some reason,

323
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,090
it had no effect

324
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,400
on this corpse poisoning.

325
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,090
Why are you here?

326
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:09,730
I...

327
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,400
I got lost.

328
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:23,250
Miss, step back.

329
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,130
Don't!

330
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:05,940
Miss,

331
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,160
you will regret this.

332
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,730
It harms both others and yourself.

333
00:25:18,010 --> 00:25:18,970
Maybe

334
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,970
it was wrong from the start.

335
00:25:35,010 --> 00:25:36,200
I warned you.

336
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,250
Soon the poison will invade your body,

337
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:40,970
and you will become like her.

338
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:46,970
Physician Han,

339
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,560
that girl once saved my life.

340
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,730
I cannot watch her die because of me.

341
00:25:52,890 --> 00:25:53,970
Now,

342
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,730
you both will die together.

343
00:25:56,050 --> 00:25:56,970
Are you satisfied?

344
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,200
This corpse poisoning...

345
00:26:00,010 --> 00:26:01,400
Why is it so fierce?

346
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,010
It's all because of Mount Guiyin,

347
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,090
where corpse demons run rampant.

348
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:15,250
Corpse demons?

349
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:17,770
I have read about them in books,

350
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,250
but they haven't appeared in the world
for hundreds of years.

351
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,970
Why would they appear here?

352
00:26:29,890 --> 00:26:30,730
Is there

353
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,130
no way to vanish them?

354
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,010
Corpse demons are invulnerable to weapons

355
00:26:36,410 --> 00:26:37,560
and release corpse poisoning.

356
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,800
Once infected,

357
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,090
if the poison reaches the heart,

358
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:45,160
there's no cure.

359
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:46,680
Sooner or later,

360
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,400
the infected
will become a corpse demon.

361
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,440
You mean...

362
00:26:56,370 --> 00:26:58,010
I have tried many methods,

363
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,890
but none can resolve this type
of corpse poisoning.

364
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:06,560
I can only use silver needles
to seal the meridians,

365
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:10,280
delaying the onset of the poison,

366
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,610
while searching
for another way to detoxify.

367
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:16,580
Where

368
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:19,400
did the corpse demon that attacked us go?

369
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,160
I have already eliminated it.

370
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,250
Why are you unharmed?

371
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,520
And even your wounds are healing.

372
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,250
Come with me.

373
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,800
Anyone poisoned would immediately
show black stains,

374
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:52,010
without exception.

375
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,130
Yet you, after so long,

376
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,850
show no symptoms.

377
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,130
Who exactly are you?

378
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:31,890
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

379
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,610
Hurry.

380
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,300
Hurry.

381
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:11,980
Help! Where is this?

382
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,130
Are you crazy? Stop shouting.

383
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:16,090
We got caught because of you.

384
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,050
As soon as the bandits
mentioned Ling'er,

385
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,560
you rushed into their trap
without thinking.

386
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:22,160
And you, who hasn't even left Suzhou City,
act like an old hand.

387
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,700
Why were you so curious?

388
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,560
I wasn't.

389
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,280
It was just the bandits
spreading the drug too widely.

390
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,730
Yueru,

391
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,040
are you okay?

392
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,980
Miss Lin, capable of anything,

393
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,100
yet still got locked up here.

394
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,040
Li Xiaoyao, you...

395
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,530
- What?
- Say that again.

396
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,370
Stop it.

397
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,200
Save your energy
and think about how to escape.

398
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,770
Li, Yueru, calm down.

399
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:45,890
What do we do now?

400
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:47,440
- Find a way out.
- Did I ask you?

401
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,620
Li, Yueru,

402
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,220
now is not the time to argue.

403
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:55,490
Perhaps Miss Ling'er
is nearby waiting for us.

404
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,340
Exactly.

405
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:59,490
Unlike someone who only wastes time.

406
00:30:04,290 --> 00:30:05,130
Scholar.

407
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:09,130
What's wrong?

408
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,250
Look.

409
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,440
The key is hanging right there.

410
00:30:13,130 --> 00:30:13,970
So far away.

411
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:15,730
Move aside.

412
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,400
Move aside. Move aside.

413
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,090
Impressive.

414
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,300
Yueru,

415
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,740
I didn't expect your Airy Sword Finger

416
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,040
to be so powerful.

417
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:36,680
Aim for that direction.

418
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,040
I forgot to say

419
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,220
that for this skill,

420
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,160
I need to rest for two hours
after each use.

421
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,610
Sorry, you'll have to figure it out
by yourselves.

422
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:49,250
Yueru,

423
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,580
why does your technique

424
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:51,940
have such peculiarities?

425
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,160
It wouldn't normally,

426
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:56,520
but after getting angry just now,

427
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,620
I felt my qi and blood
were not flowing smoothly,

428
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,490
so I couldn't use it.

429
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:00,780
You...

430
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,820
But,

431
00:31:03,410 --> 00:31:04,490
there's still a way.

432
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,280
- She...
- Li,

433
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,040
in your opinion,

434
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:12,890
what should we do?

435
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:24,940
Boss.

436
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,220
(Third Chief)
What's up?

437
00:31:32,650 --> 00:31:34,040
We just captured three people

438
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,610
and locked them up in the dungeon.

439
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,280
Why capture them?

440
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,770
They're not afraid of us at all.

441
00:31:41,770 --> 00:31:42,890
That woman

442
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,320
even whipped us.

443
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,890
If that's the case,

444
00:31:45,890 --> 00:31:46,970
just kill them.

445
00:31:47,770 --> 00:31:49,130
They know our secret now.

446
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,250
Wait a moment.

447
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,920
Wouldn't it be a pity

448
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,610
to kill them just like that?

449
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:00,730
Come here.

450
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:09,440
Miss Lin, I was wrong.

451
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:10,700
What did you say just now?

452
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,540
I didn't hear clearly.

453
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,200
Miss Lin, I was wrong.

454
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:24,200
Please forgive me

455
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:25,800
and get us out.

456
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,010
Jinyuan,

457
00:32:28,130 --> 00:32:30,370
I feel much better now.

458
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,130
Aim right.

459
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:43,610
A little higher.

460
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:44,700
A little lower.

461
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:46,890
Good, good. Aim right.

462
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:47,920
A little lower. A little lower.

463
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:49,850
Hurry.

464
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,340
- It's coming, it's coming.
- Almost there.

465
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,180
You go ahead.

466
00:32:58,460 --> 00:32:59,560
Your legs are longer, hurry up.

467
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:12,650
- Stretch further.
- Stretch your long legs a bit more.

468
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:14,280
My butt's stuck.

469
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,130
How can you be so useless?

470
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,130
We're almost there, hurry.

471
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,400
Showing off your long legs, right?

472
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,680
- Take them away.
- Yes.

473
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,200
She bit you,

474
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,560
and the corpse poisoning seemed to ease.

475
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,280
Why does your blood

476
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,440
have a detoxifying effect?

477
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,820
I...

478
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,090
I don't know.

479
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,410
Physician Han,

480
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,280
staring at me like that

481
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,210
makes me a bit scared.

482
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:27,760
I earnestly request you
to help me save someone.

483
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:34,610
Everyone, watch closely.

484
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,690
Alright.

485
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:39,330
Today, I have gathered you all here

486
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,460
mainly because
the First Chief of our Baihe Fort

487
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,760
has been ill for a long time.

488
00:34:43,130 --> 00:34:45,000
Despite various treatments,
nothing has worked.

489
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:47,930
So, we plan to resort
to some folk remedies.

490
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,130
Does this have anything to do with us?

491
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,280
Of course.

492
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,170
Alright, alright.

493
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,540
We plan to arrange a marriage

494
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,210
to bring joy to our chief
to cure her illness.

495
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:01,450
What?

496
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,240
A marriage for joy?

497
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:06,560
Why are you all looking at me?

498
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,090
I'm telling you it's impossible.

499
00:35:08,090 --> 00:35:09,460
I just went through a combat
for marriage.

500
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,410
Dragging me into a marriage for joy?
Impossible.

501
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:14,720
Everyone, this marriage for joy
is just a folk rumor.

502
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:16,040
It can't be taken blindly.

503
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,480
Maybe this is fate.

504
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:22,320
Don't resist the arrangement of destiny.

505
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,130
He won the combat for marriage.

506
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,330
He's now my husband.

507
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:30,610
If you want me to bring joy,

508
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:31,890
you'll have to deal with him first.

509
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:32,850
Don't listen to her nonsense.

510
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,700
That doesn't count.

511
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,090
This woman was forcing me,
and I was coerced.

512
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:36,170
- When did I force you?
- Alright.

513
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,010
I...

514
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:40,320
You guys, hold them down for me.

515
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,140
Come here.

516
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:44,970
We...

517
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,690
Stand straight, stand straight.

518
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,560
Who says the marriage for joy
can't be with you two?

519
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,020
The marriage for joy is just a folk rumor,

520
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,000
not to be taken blindly.

521
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,410
Yes, yes.

522
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:03,960
I think there's no need for this.

523
00:36:07,570 --> 00:36:08,480
Li Xiaoyao,

524
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,170
this is fate.

525
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,170
Don't resist the arrangement of destiny.

526
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:15,650
Scholar,

527
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,740
are you interested?

528
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,800
I won't compete with you.

529
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:20,780
Li, I have always admired
my cousin wholeheartedly,

530
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,280
so naturally, I have no such interest.

531
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,140
Come back.

532
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,210
Boss,

533
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:37,850
I'm still young.

534
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:50,690
Indeed very ordinary.

535
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,410
You look clean and well-groomed,

536
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:57,960
quite handsome.

537
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,410
Being chosen to serve the First Chief

538
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,720
is an honor for me.

539
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:16,800
However,

540
00:37:17,410 --> 00:37:19,560
I have been suffering from
a serious illness since childhood,

541
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:21,960
whether it's contagious
is still uncertain.

542
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,890
It will be okay to serve the First Chief.

543
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:28,890
Young man,

544
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:31,480
I saw nothing unusual about you earlier.

545
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,890
Why are you coughing so suddenly now?

546
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,450
Just now, I was solely focused

547
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,800
on being chosen to serve the Chief,

548
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,650
so I was holding it in.

549
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:43,610
It's alright.

550
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:46,720
My illness only acts up
for a few hours each day.

551
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,000
No big deal.

552
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,800
No big deal.

553
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:58,040
Scholar is indeed scholarly.

554
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,240
This won't do.

555
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,800
The First Chief is already sick.

556
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,090
Finding her a sick man...

557
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:09,930
That's even worse.

558
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,520
You. You choose.

559
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,250
Me?

560
00:38:16,850 --> 00:38:19,520
Through a woman's eyes,
who's more suitable?

561
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:33,040
I think if it's for bringing joy,

562
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,720
the goal should be joy, right?

563
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,720
So, definitely someone healthy.

564
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,520
Everything else can come later.

565
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,450
Savage girl, you...

566
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:43,130
That makes sense.

567
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,330
Our primary task now

568
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:45,760
is to save the First Chief.

569
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:49,210
If Chief doesn't like this one's looks,

570
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,370
we can make the change later.

571
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:52,010
What?

572
00:38:58,170 --> 00:38:59,010
Stop acting.

573
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,370
It's not convincing.

574
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:03,090
Give him a heavier dose of the drug.

575
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:04,400
No, no, no.
Give me another chance, please.

576
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:04,970
Shut up.

577
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,540
Hurry, hurry.

578
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,370
Slowly, slowly. Be careful.

579
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,690
Why is the door open?

580
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,860
Don't.

581
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:38,930
Don't panic.

582
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,320
It must be that the First Chief

583
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:45,800
knows about the wedding

584
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,210
and is too eager for the wedding night,

585
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:49,410
waiting for us here.

586
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,690
You, go.

587
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,010
Hurry.

588
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,410
She is inside.

589
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,280
- Hurry, hurry. Hurry up.
- Hurry, hurry.

590
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,380
- Lend a hand.
- Hurry.

591
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:17,820
Go, go, go.

592
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:20,560
