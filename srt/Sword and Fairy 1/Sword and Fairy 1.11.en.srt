=Episode 11=

3
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,640
The Second Chief is back!

4
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,380
The Second Chief is back!

5
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,680
- Second Chief! Second Chief!
- Quick!

6
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,820
Second Chief!

7
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,220
Yueru!

8
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,210
Let's go, go, go.

9
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,560
- How are you? Everything okay?
- I'm fine.

10
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:24,970
Mengci!

11
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,760
- Shaoyun!
- Mengci!

12
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,250
Mengci.

13
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,480
Mengci.

14
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,170
I'm sorry.

15
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,540
Thank you all for your hard work
on this journey.

16
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,000
Thank you for saving Shaoyun.

17
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:00,640
Thank you, everyone.

18
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:01,740
No need for such formalities.

19
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,530
I have always enjoyed
helping others as a hero.

20
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,050
Let's get to the point.

21
00:03:06,050 --> 00:03:07,890
The corpse demon issue
is still unresolved, Hero.

22
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:13,690
Little Stone.

23
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:27,480
Miss Fairy, what do you want?

24
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,500
Little Stone,

25
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,330
this place is overrun with corpse demons.

26
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,640
Do you know why and how to solve it?

27
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,360
It's all because of Han Kuang.

28
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,610
My father?

29
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:43,640
I have been in Mount Guiyin
for thousands of years.

30
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:47,050
I know everything that has happened

31
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:49,050
in every corner here.

32
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,610
Many years ago,

33
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:56,120
Han Kuang had some success
in his cultivation

34
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:01,330
and was ordered by his sect
to leave the mountain to exorcise demons.

35
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,360
Arriving at Mount Guiyin,

36
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,410
he found it ravaged by corpse demons.

37
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,000
While searching for the cause,
he met Meng Ke.

38
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,050
They shared common interests

39
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,650
and felt like old friends
when they first met,

40
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,840
so they quickly became close friends.

41
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,010
Unexpectedly,

42
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:22,010
Meng Ke was a demon who'd lived here
for hundreds of years,

43
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,440
known as the Ghost General.

44
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,640
Although he hadn't committed evil deeds,

45
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,320
in the eyes of the world,

46
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,440
he was still a demon.

47
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:32,880
No matter how Han Kuang explained,

48
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,690
his sect and his friends
in the martial world

49
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,690
determined Han Kuang
had befriended a demon,

50
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,250
and they utterly rejected him,

51
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,130
ruining his reputation.

52
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,580
It seems

53
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,880
Physician Han's sect and friends

54
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,250
had their reasons.

55
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,980
Indeed.

56
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,160
People in the martial world
uphold justice

57
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,200
and should not associate with demons.

58
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:00,730
Later, Meng Ke,
in an effort to protect Han Kuang,

59
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:04,690
joined him in searching
for the source of the corpse demons.

60
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:08,010
They finally found the Desolate Tomb.

61
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:12,290
Han Kuang and Meng Ke
arrived at the Blood Pool,

62
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,010
saw the overflow of corpse demons,

63
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:17,130
and joined forces
to set up a magical zone.

64
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:20,090
But the Blood Pool didn't calm down.

65
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,360
Instead, it became more turbulent.

66
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:24,250
The corpse demons counterattacked.

67
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:26,330
Despite their joint resistance,

68
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:28,010
they were outnumbered.

69
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,880
More corpse demons poured in.

70
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,610
Han Kuang momentarily lost his courage

71
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,730
and let go,

72
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:36,970
opening a gap in the zone.

73
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,860
With just Meng Ke's power,

74
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,440
they quickly became overwhelmed.

75
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:44,770
At that time, a blood wave
stormed out of the zone

76
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:46,010
and knocked them away.

77
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,810
Both of them were severely injured,

78
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,140
but the swirl in the Blood Pool
was getting bigger and bigger.

79
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,890
Han Kuang couldn't help but back out.

80
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,260
At a critical moment,

81
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,890
Meng Ke jumped into the Blood Pool

82
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,090
to suppress it with his body,

83
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:00,610
but he was affected by the corpse aura

84
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,760
and turned into one.

85
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:05,820
Losing his close friend
due to his own cowardice,

86
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,320
Han Kuang was filled with regret.

87
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:10,090
Han Kuang later learned

88
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:13,200
the demon king of Mount Guiyin
was called the Red Ghost King.

89
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:15,920
After Meng Ke sacrificed himself
to seal the Blood Pool,

90
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:19,090
the Red Ghost King
no longer caused trouble.

91
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,730
Later,

92
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:25,530
Han Kuang retrieved Meng Ke's body,

93
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,090
only to find it
infected by the corpse aura.

94
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,440
He placed the body in a coffin

95
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,130
to slow the infection,

96
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:37,980
deciding to stay here for two reasons.

97
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:41,010
First, to continue
guarding the Blood Pool.

98
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:42,170
And the second

99
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,130
is to protect Meng Ke's body.

100
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,440
Baihe Fort arose during that time.

101
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:48,850
Exactly.

102
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,700
After the Blood Pool was suppressed,

103
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,610
the bold villagers of Baihe Village,

104
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,570
to prevent corpse demons
from attacking again,

105
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,920
used Baihe Fort as a base,

106
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,690
volunteering to stand guard.

107
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:00,010
Over time,

108
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:03,200
generation after generation
lived this way.

109
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,730
Han Kuang traveled everywhere for years,

110
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,760
hoping to save Meng Ke.

111
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:14,040
Eventually, he found
the Earth Spiritual Bead.

112
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:19,360
Han Kuang tried to revive Meng Ke
with the Earth Spiritual Bead,

113
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:23,090
unaware that although the Earth Spiritual Bead
has the power of the Earth,

114
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,040
it could only purify
and slow the corpse poisoning.

115
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:28,040
It can't eliminate the poison.

116
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:30,140
Relieved by the purification effect,

117
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,880
Han Kuang inadvertently reawakened

118
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,050
the suppressed Blood Pool,

119
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:36,810
allowing corpse demons

120
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,530
to escape from the magical zone.

121
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,490
Despite his efforts to suppress them

122
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,410
and push them back into the Blood Pool,

123
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:47,880
some corpse demons escaped.

124
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,330
The escaped corpse demons

125
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:52,530
bit a couple of hunters in the mountains.

126
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,580
When Han Kuang arrived,

127
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:57,050
the hunter couple
was embracing each other,

128
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,640
facing down on the ground,

129
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,530
being dragged and bitten
by corpse demons.

130
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:04,570
Han Kuang killed the corpse demons.

131
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,290
In her last moments of clarity,

132
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,570
the woman begged Han Kuang
to save her child.

133
00:08:09,940 --> 00:08:11,570
Only then did Han Kuang see

134
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:14,490
the infant wrapped in swaddling clothes

135
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,570
that the hunter couple
had desperately protected.

136
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,600
He decided to take in the infant.

137
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,330
And that infant...

138
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:25,170
It was her.

139
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,160
My father, he...

140
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:34,130
What happened later?

141
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,120
Later,

142
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,650
Han Kuang stayed in Baihe Village

143
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,090
as Physician Han.

144
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,610
Since then,

145
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,530
the corpse demons once again ran rampant.

146
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,640
Han Mengci was also accidentally injured
by a corpse demon,

147
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:47,730
gradually transforming into one.

148
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:48,800
Han Kuang

149
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:50,930
had no choice but to lock her up.

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,490
One day,

151
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,440
when Han Mengci escaped,

152
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,970
she encountered Miss Fairy.

153
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,170
Then,

154
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:03,240
Physician Han discovered

155
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,410
my blood could
remove the corpse poisoning

156
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,850
and wanted to use it
to cure the Ghost General.

157
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:13,530
To say all of this
originated from Han Kuang

158
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,240
is not an exaggeration.

159
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,200
Physician Han's unwillingness
to abandon his friend

160
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:24,410
is indeed admirable.

161
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:27,000
But, for the sake of a mere demon,

162
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,880
was such a huge sacrifice

163
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,490
worth it?

164
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,050
Physician Han ultimately suffered
because of the demon.

165
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,580
Ling'er!

166
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,680
- Ling'er!
- Miss Fairy!

167
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,550
- Ling'er!
- What's wrong?

168
00:09:49,550 --> 00:09:51,000
- Miss Fairy, what's wrong?
- Ling'er!

169
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,570
Ling'er!

170
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,640
Miss Zhao is weak and needs rest.

171
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,730
I will take her back to her room
for proper care.

172
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,490
Everyone, please wait here.

173
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:09,170
- Miss Han.
- Don't worry, Mr. Li.

174
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,500
I have learned medicine
from my father for many years.

175
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,730
I will surely cure Miss Zhao.

176
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,620
Ling'er,

177
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,490
you're pregnant.

178
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,000
You must take good care of yourself.

179
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:30,180
Mengci.

180
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,130
Please

181
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,440
promise me one thing.

182
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,060
Tell me.

183
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,640
You must keep this secret for me.

184
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:43,560
Don't tell anyone else,

185
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,370
especially Xiaoyao.

186
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,170
But you won't be able

187
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,850
to hide this for long.

188
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:53,410
Perhaps,

189
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,530
it might be different for me.

190
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,780
Miss Zhao,

191
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,760
Mr. Li doesn't seem

192
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,610
to be a heartless person to me.

193
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,800
His actions in the past few days

194
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,050
show he cares

195
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,440
about you deeply.

196
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,800
Miss Zhao, you're alone,

197
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:20,200
and your body is weak.

198
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:21,850
If nobody could look after you,

199
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,640
how will you manage

200
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:25,370
in the days to come?

201
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,060
Mengci,

202
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,620
I have decided

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,240
to join Xiaoyao

204
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,800
in suppressing the Red Ghost King.

205
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:43,410
Miss Zhao, you mustn't!

206
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,730
You're very weak right now.

207
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:51,050
And this was all because of me.

208
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,760
It's a matter of Baihe Fort.

209
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,880
You have already done so much for us.

210
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,240
This mission

211
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,850
will be extremely dangerous for Xiaoyao.

212
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:03,170
How could I let him go alone?

213
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:04,680
But in your current state,

214
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,170
you can't use your spiritual power.

215
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,330
Otherwise,

216
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,290
it might affect the fetus in your womb.

217
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:14,980
Mengci,

218
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,410
this might be

219
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,730
the last thing I can do

220
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,000
for Xiaoyao.

221
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,880
The last thing?

222
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,530
Please, Miss Han,

223
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:33,240
grant me this request.

224
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,010
Be careful.

225
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,810
Careful.

226
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:52,420
Slow down.

227
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,540
Ling'er.

228
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,140
- How are you now?
- Ling'er.

229
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,340
- Xiaoyao.
- How are you?

230
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,610
I was fine to begin with.

231
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,140
I just rested for a bit

232
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,290
and am completely better now.

233
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,420
Ling'er,

234
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,340
since we know everything
is caused by the Red Ghost King,

235
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,850
I'll go with the savage girl
to eliminate him.

236
00:13:09,410 --> 00:13:10,530
I'm going with you.

237
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,690
How can that be?

238
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,850
Ling'er, you have used
too much spiritual power,

239
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,730
and you're too weak.

240
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,820
You definitely can't go.

241
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,730
Yes, Ling'er,

242
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,850
we can handle it.

243
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,530
Xiaoyao, Yueru,

244
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:24,090
Little Stone told me

245
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,290
the Red Ghost King
is not like other demons.

246
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,240
Since my blood
can remove the corpse poisoning,

247
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:33,240
it must also be able
to eliminate the corpse demons.

248
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:40,060
And

249
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:41,490
only if I'm there

250
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,000
will Little Stone behave

251
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:45,610
and tell us where the Ghost General is.

252
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,220
Ling'er,

253
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:58,090
if you feel any discomfort,

254
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:58,970
we'll come back.

255
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,290
Don't force yourself.

256
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,330
Let's go.

257
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,170
Stay safe.

258
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,530
Don't overexert yourself.

259
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,930
Let's go.

260
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,580
(Tomb of Jin's Border Commander)

261
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,370
It's here.

262
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:58,050
Physician Han
and the Ghost General are inside.

263
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:16,570
Physician Han.

264
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:20,490
How did you all get here?

265
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,880
I won't let you harm him.

266
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,740
Physician Han,

267
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,640
we're aware of your story

268
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,000
with the Ghost General.

269
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:39,320
What matters now is completely
eliminating the corpse demons.

270
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,970
All of this

271
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:46,000
started because of me,

272
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:48,410
my cowardice,

273
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,850
selfishness,

274
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,490
causing so much harm to others.

275
00:16:00,490 --> 00:16:02,170
But you have also saved many people.

276
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,440
You did this

277
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:10,050
just because you're unwilling
to give up on your friend.

278
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,320
Physician Han,

279
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,050
I can use my blood

280
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,410
to fully revive the Ghost General.

281
00:16:45,290 --> 00:16:46,200
Miss Zhao,

282
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:47,880
are you truly willing to do that?

283
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,240
Physician Han,

284
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,930
may I ask you a question?

285
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,440
Please, Miss.

286
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,240
Your friendship with the Ghost General.

287
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,240
Do you ever regret it?

288
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,850
At this point,

289
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:19,610
I wish I had never met Meng Ke.

290
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,700
That way,

291
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,490
so many people wouldn't have suffered

292
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:30,850
such pain and harm.

293
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,920
Wishing you had never met...

294
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,780
Indeed.

295
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:44,820
Indeed.

296
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,440
Get out of here, quickly!

297
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,010
Ling'er, are you okay?

298
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:24,010
I'm fine.

299
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,610
Yueru, how about you?

300
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:27,010
I'm fine.

301
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,400
Is this blood?

302
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,320
Where did all this blood come from?

303
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,400
So much blood.

304
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,920
This demon has harmed numerous lives.

305
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:40,520
Quickly leave this place.

306
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,540
(Red Ghost King)

307
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:06,730
Red Ghost King!

308
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,160
After so many years,

309
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,040
finally, I can breathe some fresh air.

310
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:18,040
Though the Ghost General's taste
is somewhat lacking,

311
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,650
the spiritual energy gathered in him

312
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,200
really adds to my strength.

313
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,040
The Ghost General...

314
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:28,440
After hundreds of years,

315
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:29,970
today,

316
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,130
let's settle this.

317
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:16,800
Miss Fairy,

318
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,610
this demon's magical power is too strong.

319
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,780
It's not wise to confront it directly
with spiritual power.

320
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,650
Miss Fairy,

321
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,680
don't you have a Gluttony Demon Worm?

322
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,160
The Gluttony Demon Worm
can slow his movements.

323
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,700
Maybe then we can find his weakness

324
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:00,770
and strike decisively.

325
00:23:27,650 --> 00:23:28,730
Why didn't it work?

326
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:30,370
No,

327
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,370
I have to help them.

328
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,890
Miss Fairy, you mustn't!

329
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,700
If you use your spiritual power,

330
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,370
it could harm the life inside you.

331
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,560
- Li Xiaoyao!
- Xiaoyao!

332
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,850
Han Kuang.

333
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:27,540
Meng Ke.

334
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,540
Meng Ke!

335
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,280
Is it really you?

336
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:37,520
Han Kuang, kill me,

337
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:40,920
while I can still control my mind.

338
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:41,970
No, no.

339
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,180
No.

340
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,440
Han Kuang, there's no time left.

341
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,650
The Worm is absorbing
the Red Ghost King's life essence,

342
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,940
so I can only control myself
for a moment.

343
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:54,410
Quick, kill me.

344
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,250
No, no.

345
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,490
I can't.

346
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,850
Hurry, Han Kuang,

347
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:01,620
or all will be lost.

348
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,560
No, I can't!

349
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:08,130
Quick, Han Kuang.

350
00:25:43,410 --> 00:25:47,530
Having such a friend as you,

351
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:51,250
to walk the martial world side by side,
righting wrongs,

352
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:53,770
I can die without regrets.

353
00:25:55,410 --> 00:25:56,680
Meng Ke!

354
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,040
Xiaoyao!

355
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,040
- Li Xiaoyao, how are you?
- Xiaoyao!

356
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,730
What's happening here?

357
00:26:35,410 --> 00:26:36,440
This Blood Pool

358
00:26:37,250 --> 00:26:38,680
accumulated countless lives,

359
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,200
resentment soaring to the heavens.

360
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,040
With the death of the Red Ghost King,

361
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,320
the corpse demons in the Blood Pool

362
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,520
will soon erupt.

363
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,770
Then let's leave quickly.

364
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,210
No.

365
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,500
Hurry and climb through the crack.

366
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,130
This place will be flooded
by the Blood Pool.

367
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,850
Physician Han, leave this place.

368
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:14,160
The Blood Pool needs
to be suppressed by someone

369
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:17,250
to completely solve
the corpse demon problem.

370
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,770
All of this

371
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,730
started because of me.

372
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,130
It's only right for me to end it.

373
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,400
Meng Ke used his body
to suppress the Blood Pool.

374
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,490
Now,

375
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,010
it's my turn.

376
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:42,010
Mr. Li,

377
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:44,970
I gift you the Dragon Sword.

378
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,820
Miss Zhao,

379
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,610
the Earth Spiritual Bead

380
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,250
is entrusted to you.

381
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:04,920
Physician Han!

382
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,520
Go now.

383
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:11,610
Go!

384
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,660
Yueru,

385
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,580
are you okay?

386
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,580
I'm fine.

387
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,520
Let's hurry and leave.

388
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,580
Okay.

389
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,460
Xiaoyao,

390
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,370
the Gluttony Demon Worm
just entered your body.

391
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:20,770
Do you feel unwell?

392
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,520
What? Are you afraid
I'll eat it like Douzi?

393
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:25,970
Stop joking.

394
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,370
To be honest, I am a bit hungry.

395
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,920
Xiaoyao!

396
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,340
Li Xiaoyao!

397
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,740
- Li Xiaoyao, what's wrong?
- Xiaoyao!

398
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,820
How are you, Xiaoyao?

399
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,920
Li Xiaoyao, are you okay?

400
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,700
Li Xiaoyao!

401
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,280
What's wrong with you, Xiaoyao?

402
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,440
Was it from blocking the strike
of corpse aura for me?

403
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,660
Li Xiaoyao!

404
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,090
- Xiaoyao!
- Li Xiaoyao, what happened?

405
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,010
- Wake up, Li Xiaoyao!
- Xiaoyao!

406
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,490
- Xiaoyao!
- What happened to you?

407
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:28,320
The Worm absorbed the Red Ghost King's
life essence of a century.

408
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:30,770
Such power, if acquired
by ordinary people,

409
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:31,900
could not be withstood

410
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,770
and would lead to
bleeding from seven orifices

411
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:34,890
and instant death.

412
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,770
Mr. Li, through the Gluttony Demon Worm,

413
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,850
suddenly obtained
a century of life essence.

414
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:46,010
If he cannot refine it smoothly,

415
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,370
letting the vital qi
run wild in his meridians,

416
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,770
it could cause unbearable pain at best,

417
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,850
and at worst, lead to deviation

418
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:55,370
and explosion, resulting in death.

419
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:01,050
If he can refine it successfully

420
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,250
and make it his own,

421
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,010
he will hardly meet
any rivals in the future.

422
00:31:10,650 --> 00:31:11,800
Miss Fairy,

423
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,560
this will also consume a lot
of your spiritual power.

424
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,700
Ling'er.

425
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,890
Ling'er.

426
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:15,610
Ling'er.

427
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,370
Silly rat.

428
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,200
Silly rat.

429
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:28,920
Silly rat.

430
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,660
Silly rat.

431
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,040
Silly rat, you're still...

432
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,160
Wasn't Ling'er supposed to be here?

433
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,580
It seems a bit better now.

434
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:48,780
The quilt is not properly covered.

435
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,690
You silly rat.

436
00:34:47,410 --> 00:34:49,040
Why get hurt just to save me?

437
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,480
I won't owe you any favors.

438
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,620
Li

439
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,060
Xiao

440
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:03,690
-yao.

441
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:09,340
Li

442
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,380
Xiao

443
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:11,900
-yao.

444
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:15,540
Ling'er.

445
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,860
Ling'er.

446
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,620
Ling'er.

447
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,060
Ling'er.

448
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,850
Ling'er.

449
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,000
The Sacred Spiritual Bead
is getting brighter.

450
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,500
The Earth Spiritual Bead must be nearby.

451
00:36:52,940 --> 00:36:53,780
This...

452
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:55,240
This is

453
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:56,930
the power of Nuwa.

454
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,850
- Princess Ling'er!
- My Lady.

455
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,850
The Earth Spiritual Bead
should be on her.

456
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:01,690
Let me retrieve it.

457
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:11,410
Don't come any closer.

458
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,250
Don't come over.

459
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,460
Don't come over.

460
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:17,090
Don't come any closer.
Don't look at me.

461
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,370
- Don't look at me.
- Your Highness.

462
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:19,890
Don't look at me.

463
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:22,720
I'm not a bad person, Your Highness.

464
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:24,780
Your Highness.

465
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:36,170
Your Highness.

466
00:37:37,370 --> 00:37:38,320
It's you.

467
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,250
It's me.

468
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,210
I'm A'nu.

469
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:43,760
A'nu?

470
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,170
When I was a child,

471
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:48,700
the Lady of the South took me
to the palace to play with you.

472
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:50,890
We even became sworn siblings.
Do you remember?

473
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,490
A'nu.

474
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:01,140
A'nu.

475
00:38:04,330 --> 00:38:05,170
A'nu.

476
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:08,480
How could I become like this?

477
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,720
I'm not a snake demon.

478
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,410
I'm not a snake demon.

479
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:14,930
Snake demon?

480
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:19,700
Who said you're a snake demon?

481
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,210
You're not a snake demon at all.

482
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,000
You're a descendant of Nuwa.

483
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,410
Descendant

484
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,650
of Nuwa?

485
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,410
You didn't know?

486
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:35,170
But

487
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,210
my appearance...

488
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,690
I look like...

489
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,090
Before I came out here,

490
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:46,330
my mother and the Sacred Maid

491
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:47,480
told me to find you,

492
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:50,060
because you are the descendant of Nuwa

493
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:52,170
that our Witch Moon Sect has been
protecting for generations.

494
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,730
A'nu,

495
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,650
I just want to be an ordinary person.

496
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,090
Can you help me return
to my original appearance?

497
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:08,940
My master, the Sacred Maid, told me

498
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,700
that when a descendant of Nuwa
shows her snake form,

499
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,090
it means the power of Nuwa
within her is awakening.

500
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:16,210
Your Highness, you will become
more and more powerful.

501
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,480
I don't want to become powerful.

502
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,040
I don't want to.

503
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,410
I just want to be an ordinary person.

504
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:29,000
I just want to live a good life

505
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:30,960
with Xiaoyao.

506
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:34,040
Xiaoyao?

507
00:39:37,410 --> 00:39:38,250
A'nu,

508
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:40,210
I beg you.

509
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,000
Please help me.

510
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:43,540
Even if...

511
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,320
Even if

512
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,210
it's just for a moment
to be an ordinary person.

513
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,690
That's great enough for me.

514
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,000
Help me.

515
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,320
Alright then.

516
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,570
This Sacred Spiritual Bead

517
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,280
is a sacred item of our Witch Moon Sect.

518
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,090
It can help you

519
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:15,720
control the power of Nuwa within you.

520
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:08,450
Why?

521
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,850
Why?

522
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,610
Why?

523
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:24,410
Why me?

524
00:41:28,650 --> 00:41:29,490
Your Highness,

525
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,720
Nanzhao is suffering from drought.

526
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:34,040
The people are in misery,

527
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,720
and the followers of
the Moon Worship Sect are restless.

528
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,650
The danger is everywhere.

529
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:40,650
Ordinary people

530
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,650
can no longer save Nanzhao.

531
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:47,450
Nanzhao?

532
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,690
Nanzhao has been suffering
from drought for years.

533
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,960
The people barely survive.

534
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,480
This Sacred Spiritual Bead shares
the same origin with the Five Spiritual Beads.

535
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:00,570
It was also given to me by my mother

536
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:02,040
to find the other Spiritual Beads.

537
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,090
The Five Spiritual Beads?

538
00:42:09,650 --> 00:42:12,760
Are you willing to join me
in searching for the Spiritual Beads?

539
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:15,650
