3
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:57,220
(Book Immortal)

4
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,660
Am I being too anxious?

5
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,970
There's no demon
in the Tower I haven't seen.

6
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:36,740
Nothing to be afraid of.

7
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,690
Book Immortal.

8
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:52,530
Who are you?

9
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:56,940
How come I've never seen you
in the Tower before?

10
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:02,380
No.

11
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:06,300
Why do you carry the aura
of the King of Prison?

12
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,180
It doesn't matter who I am.

13
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,210
Just answer my question.

14
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:13,820
What do you want to know?

15
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:17,660
How can I get out of here?

16
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,740
Leaving the Tower?

17
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,380
Since this Tower was built,

18
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:24,410
no demon has ever escaped

19
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,460
from here.

20
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,970
I don't believe it.

21
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,100
There must be a way.

22
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,970
Don't you claim to be

23
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:35,490
the all-knowing Book Immortal?

24
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:39,020
But in all the books in the world,

25
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,770
there's never been a record

26
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:43,260
of anyone leaving this place.

27
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,000
It seems you have to be threatened
to give me an answer.

28
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,660
I'll look again. I'll look again.

29
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:51,570
- Hurry up!
- Yes, yes.

30
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,410
I'm looking. I'm looking.

31
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,530
I'm looking...

32
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,860
Tai.

33
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,740
Do you

34
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,380
- realize your mistake?
- Tai,

35
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:11,970
I do.

36
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,330
From now on,

37
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:15,460
I won't ever dare to fight
or quarrel with other fellows again.

38
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,010
I will focus on my cultivation.

39
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,420
So this time...

40
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,260
20 strokes of punishment.

41
00:04:20,770 --> 00:04:21,940
Tai, Tai,

42
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,050
I know I was wrong.

43
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,100
I really know I was wrong.

44
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,780
Let's go.

45
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,420
What's there to be embarrassed about?

46
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:38,940
Go on.

47
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:44,450
Excuse me,

48
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,290
Tai.

49
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,660
I don't quite understand
the Seven-Star Sword Formation.

50
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:53,260
I hope you can enlighten me.

51
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,380
This is my gift to you.

52
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,500
If you don't know,

53
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:01,250
you should ask the one
who teaches on behalf of the master.

54
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,210
He really doesn't know
how to treat girls.

55
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:10,140
That sounds as if you know it well.

56
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:11,700
Of course.

57
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,100
Look, I've never treated you like that.

58
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:14,260
Then thank you.

59
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,450
You're welcome.

60
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,820
After all, we are like brothers.

61
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,500
We can fight,

62
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,820
and I would never bully the weak.

63
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:23,780
You two.

64
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,490
Why were you following me just now?

65
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,580
We were just walking around,

66
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,100
admiring the scenery of Mount Shu.

67
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:39,330
Have you seen enough?

68
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,770
If you have,
please return to the guest room and wait.

69
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,690
There are many
forbidden areas in Mount Shu.

70
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,390
Outsiders are not allowed
to wander around.

71
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,260
Are you two

72
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:55,700
suspecting that
I am in cahoots with Bao Pu?

73
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,260
Are you?

74
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,940
As I've said,

75
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,450
Bao Pu's whereabouts are unknown.

76
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,050
Since his last mission with me
to capture the demoness,

77
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:04,610
I haven't seen him again.

78
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,380
Since you say so,

79
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,580
we'll believe you.

80
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,540
Please

81
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,290
abide by the rules of Mount Shu.

82
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,770
Although Tai Wu is not likeable,

83
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,290
he doesn't seem like a liar.

84
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:41,380
Could it be
that Bao Pu really isn't in Mount Shu?

85
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,550
The Wind Spiritual Bead is in Mount Shu?

86
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,050
Tai Wu appears upright.

87
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,890
Why does he speak lies so righteously?

88
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,610
Could it be that Bao Pu
is hiding in this canyon?

89
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,940
Impossible, impossible.

90
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,450
Hurry up and find it.

91
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,100
There really are no records.

92
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:38,010
No records.

93
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,890
If I had known,
I wouldn't have traded the Spiritual Bead

94
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:41,140
for the power of the King of Prison.

95
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:41,980
Spiritual Bead?

96
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,580
I remember now.

97
00:07:45,610 --> 00:07:49,450
The Demon-Locking Tower
is built of spiritual stones,

98
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,170
containing their power.

99
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:52,010
And then?

100
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,210
Have you heard of
the Five Spiritual Beads?

101
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,420
Five Spiritual Beads?

102
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,100
Yes, it's recorded in the books

103
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:03,010
that the Five Spiritual Beads
contain five types of spiritual powers,

104
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,980
which are of the same origin
as the five spirits of the Demon-Locking Tower.

105
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,050
Those who possess the Beads

106
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,580
might be able to freely enter
and exit the Demon-Locking Tower.

107
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,890
Someone has entered
the forbidden area of Mount Shu.

108
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:21,290
Who is it?

109
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:27,290
Doesn't look like a Mount Shu disciple.

110
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:34,730
There always is a way out indeed.

111
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:36,250
Li Xiaoyao,

112
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,820
your timing couldn't be better.

113
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,900
Since you've walked
into the trap yourself,

114
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,490
I won't

115
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,410
disappoint you ever again.

116
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,580
Li Xiaoyao?

117
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,260
Who dares to trespass
on the forbidden area of Mount Shu?

118
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:16,130
Retreat immediately!

119
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:16,800
Gentlemen,

120
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:17,900
we are here in search of someone

121
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:18,950
and were unaware that this is

122
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,200
the forbidden area of Mount Shu.

123
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:20,950
Please retreat immediately.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,260
Gentlemen, please make an exception.

125
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,350
The person we are looking for
is the disgrace of Mount Shu,

126
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:24,930
Bao Pu.

127
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,440
I have never seen
such a person in Mount Shu.

128
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,340
No matter the reason,

129
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,490
you must retreat immediately.

130
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,240
Are you Mount Shu disciples
only good at covering for each other?

131
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:33,370
What did you say?

132
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,220
It's you again.

133
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:38,450
- Tai.
- Tai.

134
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,690
The person you're looking for
cannot possibly be here.

135
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:42,850
How can you be so sure?

136
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:44,020
We Mount Shu disciples

137
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:45,580
are not allowed into the forbidden areas.

138
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,540
Since it's a forbidden area,

139
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,340
if someone wants to hide,

140
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,290
this is the perfect place.

141
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,380
You're just causing trouble.

142
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,610
If you won't let us in,

143
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:51,900
then he must definitely be hiding here.

144
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:52,740
Impossible.

145
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,110
Inside the forbidden area

146
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:55,400
lies the Demon-Locking Tower.

147
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,140
Anyone who enters
has never returned alive.

148
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,380
If he went in, it's a death wish.

149
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,850
Regardless of what you say,

150
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,180
we have to find Bao Pu.

151
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,780
Come with me.

152
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,810
The Demon-Locking Tower,

153
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,050
since the founding of the Mount Shu Sect,

154
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:33,170
has existed as a Buddha tower

155
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,730
to suppress the demons of the world,

156
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,610
guarded by the King of Prison.

157
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:39,610
Once a demon is imprisoned
in the Demon-Locking Tower,

158
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,410
escape is nearly impossible.

159
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:45,490
So, the Tower
does not belong to Mount Shu?

160
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,780
That's right.

161
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,700
Our sect does not allow

162
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,600
disciples to approach the Tower.

163
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,500
Violators would
have their martial arts stripped

164
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,470
and be expelled from the sect.

165
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,450
So, Bao Pu

166
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,100
really wouldn't be
hiding inside the Tower?

167
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:00,220
The Tower only locks away demons.

168
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:03,020
You two have some ties to our Mount Shu,

169
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,880
but now that the demoness
has been subdued,

170
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,340
please act carefully later on

171
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,450
and ensure that you no longer
associate with demons.

172
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,420
Stop, stop.

173
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,580
That demoness again. What demoness?

174
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:14,860
To my knowledge,

175
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:17,490
Bao Pu is currently not in Mount Shu.

176
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:19,050
Since he offended you two,

177
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:20,890
I will report it to Master
when he comes out of seclusion

178
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,120
and ask him to investigate the truth.

179
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,380
You girl.

180
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,340
I finally made a friend,

181
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:01,790
and I was about
to bring her here to see you,

182
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,610
but she was caught
by that King of Prison.

183
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,410
Don't talk nonsense.

184
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,970
A Taoist just came here

185
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,850
and made a mess.

186
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:14,260
Then someone intruded
into the forbidden area of Mount Shu.

187
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:17,580
The Taoist said
the person's name was Li Xiaoyao

188
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,100
and then left.

189
00:12:19,610 --> 00:12:21,530
I haven't even cleaned up here yet.

190
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,380
The Li Xiaoyao you just mentioned.

191
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,850
Could he be the Xiaoyao
that Ling'er talks about?

192
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:44,980
Ling'er!

193
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:46,610
Ling'er, how are you?

194
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,100
Wan'er,

195
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,540
you should go now.

196
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:55,610
Don't let the King of Prison find out.

197
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,810
Wait.

198
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:57,780
I'm coming to save you.

199
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,340
Wan'er, you need to leave.

200
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,390
I've never seen the King of Prison
take such interest in a demon.

201
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,730
I'll go find the Book Immortal for help.

202
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:22,890
Ling'er,

203
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,220
don't worry.

204
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:26,170
Xiaoyao has come to find you.

205
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,420
What?

206
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,490
His name is Li Xiaoyao, right?

207
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,490
Yes.

208
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,100
That's right then.

209
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,250
He has come for you.

210
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,010
It can't be.

211
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:48,010
It can't be.

212
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:50,650
I've erased his memory.

213
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,170
He doesn't know I exist.

214
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,780
How could he come to save me?

215
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:57,090
Maybe he remembered.

216
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:58,450
No matter what,

217
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,780
he has come to save you.

218
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,580
This place is too dangerous.

219
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,730
The King of Prison's powers
are so strong,

220
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,410
Xiaoyao could be in danger.

221
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,620
Wan'er,

222
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:12,890
I beg you.

223
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,850
Can you think of a way

224
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:17,050
to find him?

225
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:19,220
Please don't let him come in here.

226
00:14:20,050 --> 00:14:20,890
Ling'er,

227
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:22,780
don't you want to see him?

228
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,020
I only hope

229
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:37,650
that he is safe and sound.

230
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:26,570
Gui Ying.

231
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:30,410
It turns out to you, General Gai.

232
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,380
You've got some nerve,

233
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,460
setting up a secret palace
beneath the imperial palace.

234
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,020
A mere imperial palace
counts for nothing.

235
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,060
General Gai,

236
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,730
why not abandon the dark
and come to the light?

237
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,220
Join our Moon Worship Sect.

238
00:15:42,850 --> 00:15:43,900
Dream on.

239
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,530
I don't care what your plot is,

240
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,610
it will never succeed.

241
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,850
Just you want to stop us?

242
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,420
This...

243
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,570
This is...

244
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:21,930
Indeed,

245
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,050
it is the Water Demon Beast.

246
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,730
You actually dare to try
to revive the Water Demon Beast.

247
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,600
Have you forgotten how it wreaked havoc

248
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,460
in Nanzhao ten years ago?

249
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,780
A mere Nanzhao counts for nothing.

250
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,380
If it weren't for the demon queen
meddling back then,

251
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,820
the whole world
would be under our Moon Worship Sect.

252
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,850
Today, I must put an end to your hopes.

253
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,380
(Mount Shu)

254
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,130
Master, you called for me.
Any instructions?

255
00:17:27,050 --> 00:17:29,650
Is it that
Situ has returned to Mount Shu?

256
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,740
Not only did he return,

257
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,370
but he also brought two young heroes,

258
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,500
Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yueru.

259
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:37,530
They trespassed in the forbidden area?

260
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
Yes.

261
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,340
Li Xiaoyao said
he was looking for Bao Pu,

262
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,170
but I told him

263
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,890
I do not know where Bao Pu is.

264
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,130
But he did not believe what I said

265
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,760
and even made his way
to the forbidden area.

266
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:51,410
What do you think about this?

267
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,220
I'm afraid this time,

268
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,130
looking for Bao Pu is just a pretext,

269
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,190
and in reality,
he's here to rescue the demoness.

270
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,580
In talking with him,

271
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,990
I found that
he doesn't remember the demoness.

272
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:03,290
I'm not sure if he's intentionally hiding it.

273
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,370
This matter is quite strange.

274
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:08,410
Everything in the world

275
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:10,250
exists for a reason.

276
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:12,150
To punish evil and promote good

277
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,760
and to slay demons
and eradicate evil spirits

278
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:15,500
is indeed our duty.

279
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,580
Thus,

280
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:20,100
the truth becomes even more important.

281
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,820
Master,

282
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,010
do you mean

283
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,740
I should ask the King of Prison
for clarity?

284
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:26,970
No.

285
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,010
You must investigate yourself.

286
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,060
Yes.

287
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,130
Mr. Li?

288
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,730
Mr. Li?

289
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,660
This is bad.

290
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,790
They must have sneaked off
to the forbidden area again.

291
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,460
Luck is on my side.

292
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,820
Savage girl, look.

293
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:34,490
A few more lights
have gone out over there.

294
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,600
It looks like the Mount Shu disciples' bedtime
is approaching.

295
00:20:37,050 --> 00:20:37,890
Once they all go to sleep,

296
00:20:37,890 --> 00:20:39,290
we can secretly
explore the secret forest.

297
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,410
You say the lights are out.

298
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,620
Where are the lights out?

299
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:45,540
Over there.

300
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,970
Li Xiaoyao,

301
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,650
why do you never

302
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,860
call me by my name?

303
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:09,940
Your name is awkward to say,

304
00:21:10,290 --> 00:21:11,500
troublesome, and not nice to hear.

305
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:13,100
Didn't I tell you before?

306
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,700
That was before.

307
00:21:18,650 --> 00:21:20,170
What about now?

308
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,580
Is there any difference from before?

309
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,760
Are you planning to change your name?

310
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:26,010
What would that be?

311
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:27,100
Forget it. I'll think of one for you.

312
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,460
Lin Bingru.

313
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,660
Lin Xingru.

314
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,660
Lin Fengru.

315
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,130
- "Lin Fengru" suits you quite well.
- Li Xiaoyao!

316
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,980
Li Xiaoyao, I mean...

317
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,250
Is there a possibility

318
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:49,410
for us

319
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,770
to take a step further?

320
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,500
Savage girl, I didn't catch that.

321
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,100
I'm saying
you have no right to disdain me.

322
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,500
Your name is even worse than mine.

323
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:03,690
Shh.

324
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:05,730
They've gone.

325
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,780
Come with me, quickly.

326
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,500
Silly rat.

327
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:16,610
Come on. What are you doing?

328
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,460
You don't think Tai Wu
will come after us, do you?

329
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,980
Relax. He's such a stickler for rules.

330
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,410
He wouldn't break them just for us.

331
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,410
Tai,

332
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:46,130
look,

333
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,220
we've somehow ended up here.

334
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:50,020
Are you planning to go
to the Demon-Locking Tower?

335
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,580
No.

336
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,700
We were really just out for a walk.

337
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:54,490
- You're overthinking it.
- Exactly.

338
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:56,170
You warned us during the day.

339
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,130
I've kept it all in mind.

340
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:58,820
How could we
knowingly make a mistake?

341
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,500
We really just got lost.

342
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,980
We're not trying to enter the Tower.

343
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,970
Right, right.

344
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,090
I stopped you
from entering the Tower before

345
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,500
only because that's our sect's rule.

346
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,530
It's really not convenient during the day

347
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:11,010
with so many eyes around.

348
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,530
I'll take you
to the Demon-Locking Tower now.

349
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,340
Follow me.

350
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,130
Why is this blockhead

351
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,770
suddenly so enthusiastic

352
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,640
about taking us
to the Demon-Locking Tower?

353
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,220
Do you remember

354
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,460
what he told us during the day?

355
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,580
He said that anyone
who violates Mount Shu's rules

356
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,100
would be expelled from Mount Shu.

357
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,740
He's trying to get rid of us rightfully.

358
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:42,650
So what do we do now?

359
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,660
Tai,

360
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,500
we won't go to the Demon-Locking Tower.

361
00:23:49,050 --> 00:23:49,890
Why not?

362
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,130
Tai, don't test us anymore.

363
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,770
It's forbidden to enter the forbidden area.

364
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
Even though
we're not disciples of Mount Shu,

365
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,370
we still promised to obey and we will.

366
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:01,370
Yes, Tai. We're going back now.

367
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:02,970
Bye, Tai.

368
00:24:43,010 --> 00:24:44,250
Miss Fairy,

369
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:47,100
I'm sorry.

370
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,370
Who is this Miss Fairy?

371
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,290
Why does it sound so familiar?

372
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:55,250
Xiaoyao.

373
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,820
Yueru.

374
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,890
I'm okay. How about you?

375
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,340
Xiaoyao.

376
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:01,610
Yueru.

377
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:21,620
Tai Wu, what are you doing?

378
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,130
Xiaoyao.

379
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,180
Xiaoyao.

380
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:45,490
Ling'er...

381
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,700
Ling'er!

382
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,370
I remember now.

383
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:26,490
I remember everything.

384
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,660
Li Xiaoyao,

385
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:31,820
I remember now.

386
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,090
Ling'er has been captured.

387
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,250
She's in Mount Shu.

388
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,420
We have to go save her.

389
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,370
But Mount Shu is so big.
How will we find her?

390
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,370
Come with me.

391
00:27:01,650 --> 00:27:02,490
Tai Wu,

392
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:05,050
I have removed
the demonic aura from you.

393
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,410
As the senior disciple of Mount Shu,

394
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,740
being exploited by a demon,

395
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,250
I feel ashamed.

396
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,340
Please, Master, punish me.

397
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,370
This demonic aura
was not something you could resist,

398
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,890
but it was indeed
because your mind was unsettled.

399
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,980
Let this be a lesson.

400
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:22,180
Yes, Master.

401
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,090
Mr. Li,

402
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,540
Miss Lin,

403
00:27:30,130 --> 00:27:31,740
I truly regret

404
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:33,110
causing harm to both of you.

405
00:27:33,410 --> 00:27:35,130
My apologies indeed.

406
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,890
It was not your true intention,

407
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,060
so we don't blame you.

408
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,140
The chaos was caused by the demon.

409
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,730
You don't have to blame yourself.

410
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:49,540
Situ,

411
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,500
you taught our sword techniques
to outsiders.

412
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,890
Do you want to take him as a disciple?

413
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,010
No, no.

414
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:01,050
I don't know what you're talking about.

415
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,980
I merely saw some potential
in this young man

416
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:06,770
and casually taught him a few moves.

417
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,940
Don't you remember our rules?

418
00:28:10,290 --> 00:28:12,500
I've taught him anyway.

419
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,620
In that case,

420
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,060
Li Xiaoyao,

421
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,700
would you be willing to become
a disciple of Mount Shu?

422
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:20,060
Well...

423
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:28,100
I am grateful for your kindness.

424
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,650
But we are here

425
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:34,650
for the girl

426
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,500
Tai Wu brought here a few days ago.

427
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,540
She's Zhao Ling'er.

428
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,820
Mr. Dugu,

429
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,100
I think there must be
some misunderstanding.

430
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,580
Dugu,

431
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,980
did you really capture her?

432
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,460
A few days ago,
we received news in Mount Shu

433
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,010
that a great demon was causing havoc,

434
00:28:57,290 --> 00:28:58,290
and killed Taoist Mu.

435
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:02,340
Thus, Mount Shu disciples were dispatched
to capture the demon.

436
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,660
Nonsense.

437
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,130
It was Bao Pu who killed Taoist Mu
and framed us.

438
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,060
Correct.

439
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,100
Bao Pu left with Tai Wu,

440
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:11,050
but returned alone,

441
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:12,500
intending to kill Li Xiaoyao and me.

442
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,500
Finding Bao Pu will clarify everything.

443
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:17,660
Indeed.

444
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:20,300
Bao Pu said he needed to deal
with the aftermath for Taoist Mu,

445
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:22,170
so he did not return with us.

446
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,170
This is quite peculiar.

447
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:33,650
I will have it thoroughly investigated.

448
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
In that case,

449
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,060
Mr. Dugu,

450
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,340
where is Ling'er now?

451
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,790
Please have someone bring her here.

452
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:40,460
According to Mount Shu rules,

453
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:42,250
all captured demons

454
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:44,980
are imprisoned
in the Demon-Locking Tower.

455
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,300
Ling'er is not a demon.

456
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:49,850
You...

457
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,710
How can you imprison a person
in the Demon-Locking Tower?

458
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,340
She has high magical powers.

459
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,700
Even if she's not a demon,

460
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,940
she's certainly no human.

461
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:06,130
Please, Mr. Dugu,
open the Demon-Locking Tower,

462
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:06,970
and release Ling'er.

463
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:09,050
The Demon-Locking Tower
isn't something you can open

464
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,370
just because you want to.

465
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,370
I don't wish to overstep,

466
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,410
- but...
- There's no need for further discussion.

467
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,500
I will ascertain the truth myself.

468
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:44,820
Situ, keep an eye on Li Xiaoyao.

469
00:30:45,370 --> 00:30:46,500
Trapped in emotions,

470
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:47,980
he'll act impulsively,

471
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:50,500
and make irredeemable mistakes.

472
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:56,250
We must learn from past examples.

473
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,340
Understood.

474
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,130
Understood.

475
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,300
Silly rat,

476
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,110
haven't you gone to sleep yet?

477
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,300
I can't sleep.

478
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,340
Me neither.

479
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,940
I never thought

480
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,820
that one day I would forget Ling'er.

481
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:04,770
Neither did I.

482
00:32:06,770 --> 00:32:07,740
But it's not your fault.

483
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,620
Whether it's my fault or not,

484
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,940
I will never let go of Ling'er again.

485
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,210
Last night,

486
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,460
you said...

487
00:32:37,250 --> 00:32:38,290
I mean...

488
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,500
Is there a possibility

489
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,460
for us

490
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,940
to take a step further?

491
00:32:48,290 --> 00:32:49,130
No way.

492
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,980
I was just joking.

493
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,390
I didn't even take it seriously.

494
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:53,630
You didn't take it seriously, did you?

495
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:07,740
I wonder what it's like

496
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,990
inside the Demon-Locking Tower.

497
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:15,620
You're asking me?

498
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,980
I've never been there. How would I know?

499
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,730
Wait till I come back and I'll tell you.

500
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,750
You're going
into the Demon-Locking Tower?

501
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:30,860
I must save Ling'er.

502
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,650
How come you're saying
what I wanted to say?

503
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:40,580
This time,

504
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:42,130
it's serious.

505
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,940
Funny. That's exactly
what I wanted to tell you.

506
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,460
Do you know how much I dislike you?

507
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:48,980
I get annoyed just seeing your face.

508
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,370
I get a headache just hearing your voice.

509
00:33:50,650 --> 00:33:51,700
If you really care about Ling'er,

510
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:53,720
you should leave Mount Shu now
and go back to your Lin Fortress.

511
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,600
Stop causing me trouble.

512
00:33:58,650 --> 00:33:59,490
Are you done?

513
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,980
Li Xiaoyao, do you know

514
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,010
how funny you look when you lie?

515
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,540
The Demon-Locking Tower
is a place of no return.

516
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,300
Do you understand that?

517
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:12,500
It doesn't matter if you agree or not.

518
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:14,220
We'll see each other
inside the Tower then.

519
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:15,340
Fine.

520
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:16,810
My mind is made up.

521
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,610
If you're my friend,
don't try to stop me anymore.

522
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,330
I have just one wish.

523
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,130
Once we save Ling'er,

524
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:32,980
let's

525
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,540
eat and play together

526
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:36,900
growing old

527
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:38,650
and be friends for life.

528
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:44,900
Alright.

529
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,500
Let's eat and play together

530
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:48,970
growing old

531
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,220
and be friends for life.

532
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:53,860
Pinky swear.

533
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,340
Alright.

534
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,540
A'nu.

535
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,010
Tang Yu,

536
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,500
why did you lie to me?

537
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,540
Let me explain.

538
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:17,490
Tang Yu,

539
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:19,730
I'm sorry.

540
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,500
I'm sorry.

541
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,410
I shouldn't have doubted you.

542
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:27,170
I shouldn't have
let my thoughts run wild.

543
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,650
What's wrong with you?

544
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,090
I should have known

545
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,980
only the Golden Silkworm Venom

546
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,330
can save a dying person's life.

547
00:36:39,850 --> 00:36:41,090
I'm sorry, Tang Yu.

548
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:44,090
I'm sorry.

549
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:52,980
You knew that.

550
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,940
How could you be so foolish?

551
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,410
This is the wisest decision

552
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,610
I've ever made.

553
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:22,580
Tang Yu,

554
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,650
let's hurry and find the Sacred Maid.

555
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,260
She must have a way.

556
00:37:27,170 --> 00:37:28,740
She must be able to cure you.

557
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,620
Let's go.

558
00:37:41,650 --> 00:37:43,020
Master, Master,

559
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,090
please save Tang Yu.

560
00:37:46,330 --> 00:37:47,810
You can save him, right?

561
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,170
The Golden Silkworm Venom

562
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,850
has no antidote.

563
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,300
It can't be.

564
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:56,170
It can't be.

565
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,020
No. You must save him.

566
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,100
You have so many medicines here.

567
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,940
There must be an antidote
that can save him, right?

568
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,410
A'nu,

569
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,820
I'm fine.

570
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,570
No need to bother
the Sacred Maid any further.

571
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,410
It can't be.

572
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,940
- Master.
- You...

573
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:14,820
Master.

574
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,130
- A'nu.
- I beg you to save him.

575
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,540
- Get up.
- Please save him.

576
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,540
A'nu,

577
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:19,620
get up.

578
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:21,020
Get up now.

579
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:24,730
Sit down.

580
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,220
My master will surely save you.

581
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:22,930
Master,

582
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:23,970
how is it?

583
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,410
He is not beyond help.

584
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,140
Master,

585
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,130
I knew you could save him.

586
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,450
A'nu,

587
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,210
rest assured.

588
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,650
I'll find a way to save him.

589
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,300
Now go and prepare the herbal medicine

590
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:58,850
I had set aside for Tang Yu.

591
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
Okay.

592
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:02,020
Okay. I'm on it now.

593
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:12,490
Tang Yu,

594
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,780
you...

595
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:17,020
Master, come and look at Luojiao!

596
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,090
Are you really going with me?

597
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:49,330
If you're scared, you can go back alone.

598
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:56,780
Why are you two here?

599
00:40:56,850 --> 00:40:57,890
Go back. Go back.

600
00:40:59,130 --> 00:40:59,970
Master,

601
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:02,260
we're here to save someone.

602
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,980
I'm not your master.

603
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:06,060
I'm telling you.

604
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,130
The Demon-Locking Tower
is full of evil demons.

605
00:41:08,370 --> 00:41:09,210
Ling'er isn't a demon.

606
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,700
She was framed by Bao Pu

607
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:13,890
and captured in the Tower.

608
00:41:14,410 --> 00:41:16,260
Okay, okay. I know. I know.

609
00:41:16,570 --> 00:41:17,700
I'm telling you again.

610
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,650
This Tower

611
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,410
is full of extremely
evil demons and spirits.

612
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,540
It's always been easy to enter
but hard to leave.

613
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,220
Not only will you
not be able to save her,

614
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:31,260
but you'll also
lose your lives for nothing.

615
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:33,020
Whether I can save her or not,
I'll know only if I try.

616
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:34,890
No is no.

617
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,860
Master!

618
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,130
What are you doing?

619
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,300
Trying to move me?

620
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:46,540
I can do it too.

621
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,170
Master,

622
00:41:50,570 --> 00:41:51,610
I can't fight against you.

623
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:53,610
Either let me into the Tower,

624
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:54,540
or kill me right now.

625
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:55,970
Whichever you choose,

626
00:41:56,020 --> 00:41:57,130
I hope you will do it quickly.

627
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,020
I'm not your master,

628
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:01,460
but since you've come to Mount Shu,

629
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,170
you must follow the rules here.

630
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:04,450
You can't enter the Demon-Locking Tower.

631
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,250
Sir!

632
00:42:05,610 --> 00:42:06,700
Please let us in.

633
00:42:07,330 --> 00:42:08,410
Please let us in.

634
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:10,620
You...

635
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:14,930
You two...

636
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,460
Come on, get up. Get up.

637
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,220
Why don't you two listen to me?

638
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:25,940
Since ancient times, humans and demons
have walked on different paths.

639
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:28,810
Why must you both be so stubborn?

640
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,380
Get up.

641
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:31,890
I don't care
if Ling'er is human or demon.

642
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:36,090
I only distinguish good from evil,

643
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,460
not human from the demon.
