00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:51,720
How strange.

4
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:54,170
We searched all night
but didn't see that demon.

5
00:01:54,810 --> 00:01:56,960
I'm worried that Jinyuan
won't hold on much longer.

6
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,060
The Taoist priest from Sanqing Abbey said

7
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,600
this demon has
a thousand years of cultivation,

8
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:01,790
and it's hard to reveal its true form.

9
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,170
What do we do now?

10
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,810
Hurry, hurry!

11
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,690
Someone has died.

12
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:13,050
Think of a way to save Jinyuan.

13
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:14,890
Hurry, hurry!

14
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:16,690
Hurry up, hurry up!

15
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,530
Come on.

16
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:18,810
Li Xiaoyao!

17
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,690
- Why does this corpse smell of alcohol?
- Li Xiaoyao!

18
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,570
Li Xiaoyao, what are you doing?

19
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:28,200
Hurry back
and think of a way to save Jinyuan.

20
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:30,000
He is the one who can save your cousin.

21
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,450
Master.

22
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:35,970
Master.

23
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:37,610
Drunken Sword Immortal?

24
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,690
Master!

25
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,260
He moved! He moved!

26
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,760
It turns out he's just a drunk.

27
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,480
Who's calling me?

28
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:55,810
Who is it? Who's calling me?

29
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,530
Master.

30
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,640
Who are you?

31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,460
Master, it's me, your disciple,

32
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,300
Li Xiaoyao from Yuhang.

33
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,020
You're still alive, boy?

34
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,450
Master, I've finally found you.

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:07,890
What do you need me for?

36
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:11,410
I have a story. Do you have good wine?

37
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,860
It's not about wine.

38
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,560
Master, it's an important matter of life.

39
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:17,020
I've saved enough lives

40
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,200
of the common people. No more, no more.

41
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,120
Master, Master, Master,

42
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,020
he's my very good friend,
poisoned by a demon.

43
00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:24,860
Please save him.

44
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,300
I won't go.

45
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,970
There's no good wine.

46
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:29,380
No, no, no.

47
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,280
There's plenty of wine!

48
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,660
Osmanthus Dew Wine, Rose Dew Wine,

49
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,260
Suhe Fragrant Wine, and Fuqing Spirits,

50
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,770
all bestowed by His Majesty,

51
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:36,920
plenty in the Liu Mansion.

52
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:38,610
Li Xiaoyao, do you want to drink?

53
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:40,170
If you do, I'll find some for you
when we get back.

54
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,280
I don't like drinking.

55
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:44,720
Liu Mansion...

56
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,120
Saving lives is urgent.

57
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,920
Saving lives is urgent.

58
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,170
Let's go and save lives.

59
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,090
This is not good.

60
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,450
This place has a heavy demon aura.

61
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:06,940
Right.

62
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,920
Prepare more candles for me,

63
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,890
talisman paper, sandalwood,

64
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,740
and by the way,

65
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:15,760
bring a few more jars of the royal wine
you just mentioned.

66
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,330
What are you waiting for?

67
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,170
I'm going now.

68
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,730
Go now, don't delay my drinking.

69
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:23,570
No, catching demons.

70
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:28,850
Go help.

71
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,760
- Alright, alright, alright.
- Go, go, go.

72
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:46,690
Kids,

73
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:50,690
today I'll let you see

74
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,410
my long-sealed unique skill,

75
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,130
Demonic Sealing Technique.

76
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,760
Stay at least seven steps away from me.

77
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:03,970
Whatever happens,

78
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,810
do not act rashly.

79
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:12,810
This is the Demonic Sealing Technique?

80
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:14,890
I don't know.

81
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,360
I haven't seen it.

82
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:23,820
Don't be disrespectful.

83
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:29,850
He fell asleep?

84
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,420
Master?

85
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,420
What are you still doing here?

86
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,420
Don't waste time.

87
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:42,850
Hurry and check how Jinyuan is doing.

88
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:47,700
Master?

89
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:02,540
(Breezy and Pleasant)

90
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:37,810
Demon, release my cousin immediately!

91
00:07:39,170 --> 00:07:41,090
Yueru, just give me a bit more time.

92
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,200
If you don't release him,
don't blame me for being rude.

93
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,010
I'm detoxifying him.

94
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,930
I saw her go this way.

95
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,050
How come she disappeared?

96
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,800
Stop and release my cousin!

97
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:56,820
Please believe me. I won't harm Jinyuan.

98
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,050
It's because we trust you too much

99
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,290
that Jinyuan was poisoned.

100
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,610
Yueru, let me explain.

101
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,290
Scholar, Scholar!

102
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:45,660
Jinyuan!

103
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,260
(Lady of Poison)
Little butterfly,

104
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,730
you're so bold.

105
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:16,780
Lady of Poison, it's all my fault,

106
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,050
I beg you to let Yueru

107
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:18,970
and Mr. Li go.

108
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:19,880
It's not their fault.

109
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,850
Since you're here,

110
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,930
how could you possibly leave?

111
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,120
I beg you to give me more antidote
for Soul Entangling Silk.

112
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,490
Cai Yi,

113
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:31,440
you're really saving Jinyuan?

114
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,130
No.

115
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,860
No.

116
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,970
It's my fault.

117
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:42,410
He was poisoned because of me.

118
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,680
What exactly happened?

119
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,410
That day,

120
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:50,610
I was transforming into a butterfly,

121
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,880
caught in a web,

122
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,170
it was Jinyuan who saved my life.

123
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,620
But,

124
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,200
it ended up harming him.

125
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,730
I'm sorry, Cai Yi,

126
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:11,050
for misunderstanding you.

127
00:11:17,410 --> 00:11:18,250
Lady of Poison,

128
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,370
I beg you to save Jinyuan.

129
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,650
If you can save him,

130
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,760
I'll agree to anything.

131
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,290
Really?

132
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:34,200
To save him, I need to use up my energy.

133
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,610
Why don't you

134
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,320
just let me eat you

135
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,290
to gain your cultivation?

136
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:47,240
Then I might be able to save him.

137
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,490
That's right.

138
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,760
If we delay further,

139
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:32,530
I might be powerless too.

140
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:31,530
You evil creature, do not harm people!

141
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,060
Thunder Spiritual Bead!

142
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,640
No, you can't die.

143
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:51,890
You can't die.

144
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:53,680
You have to save my husband!

145
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:55,640
You need to save him!

146
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:01,780
Jinyuan!

147
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,700
- No wonder this demon is so powerful.
- Jinyuan...

148
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,320
It turns out it has a Spiritual Bead.

149
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,760
Come on.
I'll give the Spiritual Bead to you.

150
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:13,890
Master,

151
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,290
save Scholar.

152
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:16,850
He

153
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,560
is deeply poisoned,

154
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:20,850
and his vital energy is almost gone.

155
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,800
He's dying with no cure.

156
00:15:25,650 --> 00:15:26,490
What?

157
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:33,820
It can't be, sir. You must have a way.

158
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:34,680
Please think of something.

159
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,410
- Well...
- Sir.

160
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,410
I beg you

161
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,240
to save Jinyuan.

162
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,200
Please!

163
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,800
Little butterfly,

164
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,240
do you really want
to use up your cultivation

165
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:52,410
to save him?

166
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,420
Is it worth it?

167
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:56,090
He's not just anyone.

168
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,560
He's my husband.

169
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,050
For the one I love,

170
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,290
I have no regrets.

171
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,440
There's no question of worth,

172
00:16:09,530 --> 00:16:11,170
only willingness.

173
00:16:14,410 --> 00:16:16,490
To save his life,

174
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,970
you have to harm your own.

175
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:23,530
I'm willing to do that.

176
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,200
Please, sir, save my husband.

177
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,090
Well, you...

178
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,660
Let's do this.

179
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,460
I will pass on the technique to you,

180
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,290
and then you help her.

181
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,300
I...

182
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:47,760
I can't do that either.

183
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,540
Yueru,

184
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,000
you help me.

185
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
Yueru,

186
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,040
you understand my intentions,

187
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,250
and you will help me,

188
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:19,340
right?

189
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,580
Okay.

190
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,130
I'll help you.

191
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,610
Thank you,

192
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:49,940
Yueru.

193
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,130
Thank you.

194
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,490
Alright.

195
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,010
When Jinyuan wakes up,

196
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,490
please

197
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,560
do not tell him about this.

198
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,700
Why?

199
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:53,920
The moment we met each other,

200
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:55,850
we understood each other.

201
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:59,130
However, we can't see each other anymore.

202
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,040
My only wish is for him

203
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:03,880
to live peacefully and happily

204
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,400
for the rest of his life.

205
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:14,850
Honey...

206
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,560
The world has always had troubled fates.

207
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:28,010
I didn't expect there
to be heartless people

208
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,090
and deeply devoted demons.

209
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,160
What really

210
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,970
is a demon?

211
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,040
When Cai Yi begged my master,

212
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,370
I don't know why

213
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,680
it felt strangely familiar.

214
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,580
It turns out

215
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,770
that falling in love with someone

216
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,850
can truly involve risking one's life.

217
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,010
If one day,

218
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,650
I was in danger,

219
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:48,850
would you save me like that?

220
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:52,750
Don't talk about
such inauspicious things.

221
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,740
I mean if that happens.

222
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,580
This kind of thing

223
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,560
won't happen to us.

224
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,970
But if it's for you,

225
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:06,940
I would.

226
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,680
Why so many ifs?

227
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:34,970
Now that Jinyuan is fine,

228
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:38,890
I'll take Yueru back to Suzhou City.

229
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,520
Dad, I still have things to do.
I can't go back with you.

230
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,490
Yueru,

231
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:49,250
speak properly to your dad.

232
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:50,560
He will agree.

233
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,490
Are you coming back with me

234
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:56,730
to Suzhou City or not?

235
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:57,970
No.

236
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,660
Fine.

237
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,820
You,

238
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:04,890
come with me.

239
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,180
Master Lin,

240
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:36,010
- between me and Yueru...
- Don't play dumb with me.

241
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:39,160
My daughter likes you.

242
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,250
Don't you know that?

243
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,580
I can see it.

244
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:48,280
Then why let her follow you
without proper procedures?

245
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,210
Master Lin,

246
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,610
Yueru and I fought snake demons,

247
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:56,200
battled corpse demons, caught thieves,

248
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,130
quelled unrest, and upheld justice.

249
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,400
We're like-minded...

250
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,490
Sincere hearts can be seen.

251
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:05,040
Don't waste words with me.

252
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:06,730
Draw your sword.

253
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,520
I want to see

254
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:11,730
if you are a true man

255
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:14,920
or just a slick-talking scoundrel.

256
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,370
How could I make a move against you?

257
00:26:16,370 --> 00:26:18,800
If you really want
to prove your sincerity,

258
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:23,010
just withstand three strikes
of the Lins' Seven Fatal Sword.

259
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,770
Then I'll believe you.

260
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,210
Then you

261
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,370
also have to promise me something.

262
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,490
If I withstand those three strikes,

263
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,170
could you agree

264
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,860
not to interfere
with your daughter's choices

265
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:45,090
and respect her decisions?

266
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:47,890
Alright.

267
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,560
Show your true skills.

268
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,160
If you die under my sword,

269
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,650
you can't blame me.

270
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,610
Get ready.

271
00:27:33,050 --> 00:27:33,920
One more strike.

272
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,010
Li Xiaoyao!

273
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,060
Are you alright?

274
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Li Xiaoyao,

275
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,970
you are indeed talented for your age.

276
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,520
I've said what I needed to say.

277
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:13,680
I hope you act wisely.

278
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,200
Yueru,

279
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:21,400
are you really not coming home with me?

280
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:24,970
Dad,

281
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,010
I prefer the life I have now.

282
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,440
But,

283
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:30,970
you're not the one he likes.

284
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:49,540
Dad,

285
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:51,770
I hope you can respect my choice.

286
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,010
You just better not regret it.

287
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,980
(Lizhao Residence)

288
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,730
Li, Yueru, be careful on your way.

289
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:34,060
Scholar,

290
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,770
my master went through a lot to cure you.

291
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:37,900
You must take good care of yourself.

292
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,520
Of course, of course.

293
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:40,890
Then Li,

294
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,010
please take good care of Yueru for me.

295
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,850
Jinyuan,

296
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:47,200
we'll leave first.

297
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,790
You've just recovered
from a serious illness.

298
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:50,890
Take good rest.

299
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,320
Don't overthink.

300
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:54,660
Don't...

301
00:30:04,770 --> 00:30:05,610
She...

302
00:30:09,530 --> 00:30:10,370
Li,

303
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
what's wrong

304
00:30:12,370 --> 00:30:13,520
with Yueru again?

305
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:17,370
Don't you know her yet?
She's startled at everything.

306
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,250
Scholar, you better go back.

307
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:23,250
Take care.

308
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,370
Where's your master?

309
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:47,460
We gave so many jars of royal wine

310
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,620
and asked him to take us to Mount Shu
to find the Wind Spiritual Bead.

311
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:50,680
Is he not coming?

312
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,440
I don't know.

313
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,130
Master!

314
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,580
Master!

315
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,490
Stop calling. Stop calling.

316
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,730
Look up.

317
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:01,010
Master.

318
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,730
Master, let's go to Mount Shu now.

319
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:06,090
Kid, don't rush.

320
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,440
Let me have another drink.

321
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:11,920
Remember.

322
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't be afraid later on.

323
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:18,440
What's there to be afraid
of going to Mount Shu?

324
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,740
It's too scary!

325
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,280
You're going to shout my ears deaf.

326
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:29,400
Li Xiaoyao, it's too high! I'm scared!

327
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:31,280
Savage girl, open your eyes and look.

328
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,980
The scenery below is very nice.

329
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,920
I don't want to. You just want
to see me make a fool of myself.

330
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,280
I'm not lying to you.
Open your eyes and look.

331
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,610
How about it? I didn't lie to you, right?

332
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:17,800
(How could this silly rat's silhouette)

333
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,890
(look so similar to that hero back then?)

334
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:21,650
(Impossible, impossible.)

335
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:23,520
(Back then,
he was only a few years old.)

336
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:26,610
(And how could he compare to a hero?)

337
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:28,090
(The hero's mount is a phoenix.)

338
00:34:28,090 --> 00:34:29,720
(He's only fit to ride a broken gourd.)

339
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,480
What are you laughing about?
Scared silly?

340
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:38,890
What's it to you? You're the silly one.

341
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:41,210
Let's go!

342
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:43,210
Help!

343
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,370
You and Book Immortal

344
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,240
speak so highly of the outside world.

345
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:58,850
If I could see it,

346
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,210
I'd die without regrets.

347
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,960
Does that Book Immortal you spoke of

348
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,370
know many things?

349
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,610
Of course, Book Immortal
is well-versed in all texts,

350
00:35:12,610 --> 00:35:14,240
knowledgeable in astronomy and geography.

351
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:17,610
If he knows everything,

352
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:19,210
then he might know

353
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,130
how to get out
of the Demon-Locking Tower.

354
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,800
Why not go ask him then?

355
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,280
- Sure.
- Let's go.

356
00:35:28,850 --> 00:35:32,450
You audacious villain, surrender now!

357
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:50,490
Ling'er!

358
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:55,210
Ling'er!

359
00:36:07,330 --> 00:36:08,170
King of Prison,

360
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,210
where did you take Ling'er?

361
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,760
Jiang Wan'er,

362
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:15,130
I can do nothing to you,

363
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,090
but don't push your luck.

364
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,930
You won't escape from my grasp.

365
00:37:07,650 --> 00:37:09,300
Master, how much longer?

366
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,130
Don't rush, kid.

367
00:37:11,130 --> 00:37:12,780
Do you see that little black dot up ahead?

368
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,610
Through those continuous clouds,

369
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,940
those layered mountain ranges,

370
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,780
that is...

371
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,340
Well, we've arrived.

372
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:25,890
Savage girl, open your eyes,

373
00:37:25,890 --> 00:37:26,760
or you'll regret it.

374
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,450
This truly has the air of immortals.

375
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:36,000
No wonder so many want
to join the Mount Shu Sect.

376
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,060
Of course.

377
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:41,040
Mount Shu has always been
a sacred place for cultivation.

378
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,040
Let's go.

379
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:47,410
Help! Slow down, slow down!

380
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:58,020
The savage girl who fears nothing

381
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:58,860
has her day too.

382
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,210
Which eye of yours saw me scared?

383
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,890
I just shouted once.

384
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,560
Hope your courage matches your words.

385
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,780
Come down.

386
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:10,820
Don't underestimate me.

387
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,890
Master, let's go inside.

388
00:38:16,330 --> 00:38:17,610
Don't call me master.

389
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,610
Why?

390
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:19,850
What do you mean why?

391
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,610
Just no.

392
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:25,130
Here is Mount Shu.

393
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,540
(Mount Shu)

394
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,480
You guys have a good look around.

395
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,930
Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal,

396
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:34,760
you're back.

397
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:42,170
Why is it this guy?

398
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:45,760
It's him.

399
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,890
Enemies do meet on a narrow road.

400
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:52,760
I hear in your tone
you have a past with him.

401
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,610
Before, he led
the Seven-Star Sword Formation

402
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,090
and attacked me and the savage girl.

403
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,960
Really? That happened?

404
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,060
Yes.

405
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,960
Why did they attack us?

406
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,560
I'm asking you. Who are you asking?

407
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,940
Alright, alright.

408
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,130
You guys have a good look around.

409
00:39:06,130 --> 00:39:07,000
I'm leaving first.

410
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,240
Master,

411
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,450
you just got back and you're leaving?

412
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,250
You don't know.

413
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:12,540
Tai Wu and his master are the same,

414
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,090
so annoying. I'm leaving first.

415
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,690
Can't see me. Can't see me.

416
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,130
Greetings, Mr. Situ.

417
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,000
You saw me.

418
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,480
My master instructed

419
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,020
that if you return to the mountain,

420
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,130
I must make you stay.

421
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,370
No need, no need.

422
00:39:30,370 --> 00:39:33,460
I am a person of leisure,
not suitable to stay long.

423
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:34,320
Right, right, right.

424
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:35,370
These two are my friends.

425
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,170
Take good care of them for me,

426
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:39,850
I'll take my leave. Goodbye.

427
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,330
Sir, if you want to find peace, go ahead.

428
00:39:45,330 --> 00:39:46,500
But please do not leave the mountain.

429
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:47,370
Master said if you leave,

430
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,780
he will confiscate the wine
you've hidden in the pill-making room.

431
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,520
Good for him.

432
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:54,240
Bye.

433
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,540
Master!

434
00:39:56,890 --> 00:39:57,930
He left just like that?

435
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:07,960
Was your Mount Shu swordsmanship

436
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:09,450
taught by Mr. Situ?

437
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:10,650
What?

438
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:11,980
Want to compete?

439
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,040
I previously mistook you
for posing as a Mount Shu disciple

440
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,340
aiding evil spirits.

441
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:17,140
My apologies.

442
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:21,850
Alright, I'll forgive you.

443
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:24,480
Are you here today

444
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,090
for that demoness?

445
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,900
Demoness?

446
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:29,280
What demoness?

447
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,460
If you must say so,

448
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,300
fine.

449
00:40:35,570 --> 00:40:36,960
I indeed came for a demon.

450
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,240
But it's not for a demoness.

451
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:39,290
I came here for a demonic Taoist.

452
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:40,800
Bring that jerk Bao Pu to me now.

453
00:40:41,090 --> 00:40:42,090
He's not in Mount Shu.

454
00:40:42,740 --> 00:40:43,580
I can't reason with you.

455
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,040
We want to see Mr. Dugu.

456
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,520
My master is in seclusion.

457
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:48,320
No one can see him.

458
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:51,890
You're not saying the Wind Spiritual Bead
isn't in Mount Shu too, are you?

459
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,690
What is the Wind Spiritual Bead?

460
00:40:55,170 --> 00:40:56,060
Still playing dumb?

461
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,300
You can't answer any of our questions
and only know to pass the blame.

462
00:40:58,350 --> 00:40:59,760
What exactly are you two here for?

463
00:41:00,650 --> 00:41:02,130
If it's to start trouble,

464
00:41:02,130 --> 00:41:03,690
I advise you to leave quickly.

465
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:06,280
Didn't you hear clearly just now?

466
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,280
We are important guests of Mr. Situ.

467
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,410
He told you to treat us well.
What's this attitude?

468
00:41:11,410 --> 00:41:12,690
Gods of Sanqing shall prove my words.

469
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,000
Bao Pu is missing,

470
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,410
and this matter must wait
for Master to end his seclusion to decide.

471
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,210
We can wait.

472
00:41:22,810 --> 00:41:23,650
If so,

473
00:41:24,370 --> 00:41:25,370
follow me then.

474
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,060
These are the guest rooms in Mount Shu.

475
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:44,980
When can we meet Mr. Dugu?

476
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:45,820
I don't know.

477
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,960
Then what do you know?

478
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,410
Mr. Dugu is still in seclusion,

479
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:50,890
and no one can disturb him.

480
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,410
- You...
- Forget it.

481
00:41:52,570 --> 00:41:53,450
Don't trouble him anymore.

482
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,460
After all, he doesn't even know
about his fellow here,

483
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,320
nor his master.

484
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,370
Maybe he doesn't even know who he is.

485
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,650
Since you want to stay in Mount Shu,

486
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,450
you must abide by Mount Shu's rules.

487
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,980
You can't step into the main mountain.

488
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,410
No loud noises, no fighting,

489
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:07,560
and no wandering around.

490
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,240
If you don't want to comply,

491
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,720
you can leave on your own.

492
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,930
Trying to drive us away?

493
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,970
Then we'll just not leave.

494
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,010
Right.

495
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,130
We'll find Bao Pu

496
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:16,450
and ask Mr. Dugu to decide.

497
00:42:24,370 --> 00:42:26,040
He's delaying us.

498
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,780
He must be afraid what they did

499
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,090
will be reported to Mr. Dugu.

500
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,410
Let's go.

501
00:42:33,570 --> 00:42:34,960
- Where to?
- Follow him.

502
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:36,170
If it's really like this,

503
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:37,450
he will definitely go see Bao Pu.
