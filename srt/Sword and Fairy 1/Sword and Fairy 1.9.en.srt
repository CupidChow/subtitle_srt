=Episode 9=

3
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,490
Corpse demons!

4
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,400
Corpse demons!

5
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,450
- Corpse demons are coming!
- Corpse demons are coming!

6
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:05,040
Corpse demons are coming! Close the gate!

7
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,810
Corpse demons are coming! Close the gate!

8
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,920
Corpse demons are coming!

9
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,460
- Corpse demons are coming!
- Corpse demons are coming!

10
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,460
Close the gate!

11
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,760
Get everyone to resist!

12
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,410
Close the gate!

13
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,410
- Coming!
- Go, go, go!

14
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,460
Don't let them bite you.

15
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,640
Attack their heads.

16
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,250
Block them.

17
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:14,360
Quick, don't let them get close.

18
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,200
Why are you pushing me? Push the door!

19
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,690
Chief, defending like this won't work.

20
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,250
Corpse demons only go out at night.

21
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,000
The sun will be out soon.

22
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,260
Just hold on a bit longer,
and they will retreat.

23
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,560
I need to rush to Baihe Village now.

24
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,050
The corpse demons attacked suddenly.

25
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,530
I fear some have crossed
over the fort into the village.

26
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:55,900
You all hold the line.

27
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:57,410
Boss, can I borrow a knife?

28
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,580
Dawn is breaking,
the corpse demons will retreat.

29
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,160
The corpse demons will retreat!
The corpse demons will retreat!

30
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,100
The corpse demons will retreat!

31
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,140
It's alright now. It's alright.

32
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:54,570
The sun has come out.
The corpse demons have retreated.

33
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,200
The corpse demons have retreated.

34
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,330
The corpse demons have retreated.

35
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,940
Guys, the corpse demons have retreated.

36
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,380
You all should leave quickly.

37
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,220
Chief,

38
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,850
do you think we can still leave now?

39
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,580
But this is a matter for Baihe Fort.

40
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,660
We shouldn't involve you.

41
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,000
Chief, fighting demons and monsters
is an undeniable duty.

42
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,290
This is not just a matter for Baihe Fort.

43
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,360
Yueru makes a valid point.

44
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,660
The more people,

45
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,500
the more strength.

46
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,580
Miss Han, the corpse demons attacked suddenly,

47
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,050
and many villagers were bitten.

48
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,360
They all need to be cured.

49
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,010
Let us stay.

50
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:30,100
In that case,

51
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,250
I, on behalf of Baihe Fort
and the villagers of Baihe Village,

52
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:34,690
thank you.

53
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:45,540
(Tomb of Mrs. Wang Ying)

54
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,420
What's wrong?

55
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:59,040
Isn't it normal to drool a bit in sleep?

56
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,700
My Lady,

57
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,160
it's time to look
for the Spiritual Beads.

58
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,880
Where did these corpse demons
come from out of the blue?

59
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,480
Could it be related
to the Earth Spiritual Bead?

60
00:07:50,890 --> 00:07:51,730
My Lady,

61
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,440
what did the person you were waiting for
last night look like?

62
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:57,410
An old man with white hair
and a white beard.

63
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,480
I know where he is.

64
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:03,500
Let's go.

65
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,290
That wicked corpse demon.

66
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,600
How did he end up biting you?

67
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,130
Those bitten by a corpse demon

68
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,200
will turn into one come nightfall.

69
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,970
Even if they are wives, children, or parents,

70
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,810
we must endure the pain

71
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,920
and find a secluded place
to burn them together during the day

72
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,410
to prevent harm to others.

73
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,800
Ling'er, don't look any longer. Let's go.

74
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:45,850
Miss Han,

75
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,490
you take Xiaoyao and the others
back to the village first.

76
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,410
I'll go to the medical hut.

77
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,000
Ling'er, I'll accompany you.

78
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:53,760
No need, Xiaoyao,

79
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:57,000
and the villagers need you more.

80
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,450
Alright,

81
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,600
but remember,

82
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:04,490
it's okay to use your spiritual power
to detoxify people,

83
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,050
but you must stop

84
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,000
before you wear yourself out.

85
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,290
I know, Xiaoyao.

86
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:09,930
Don't worry.

87
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,700
Didn't I tell you?

88
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:14,240
To detoxify from the corpse poisoning,
I only need a little spiritual power.

89
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:49,560
Here, have some more water.

90
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:50,740
Coming.

91
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,850
It's coming. It's coming.

92
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:54,850
- Miss Zhao.
- Physician Han.

93
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,050
It's coming. It's coming.

94
00:09:56,610 --> 00:09:58,610
The village was attacked
by corpse demons last night.

95
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,560
Many villagers were harmed.

96
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:05,050
Why did so many corpse demons
suddenly appear?

97
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,240
I will find out.

98
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:10,120
Physician Han, please

99
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,090
gather the injured,

100
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,000
and I'll save them.

101
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,140
There are too many poisoned.

102
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,880
The cost of detoxification is too great.

103
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,760
We can't save them all.

104
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,370
But we still have to try.

105
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,180
Alright.

106
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,660
Come with me.

107
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,850
Chief, the corpse demons
came suddenly last night,

108
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:40,730
causing great harm to everyone.

109
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,370
Folks,

110
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,200
it's our fault that we didn't stop them,

111
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:48,090
so they came here to harm you.

112
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,090
Please forgive us.

113
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,500
What's the use of asking for forgiveness?

114
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,220
- My father was bitten by a corpse demon.
- Exactly.

115
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,370
He definitely won't survive.

116
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:57,440
Your family only had one person bitten.
My whole family was bitten.

117
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
We're on the verge of losing everything.

118
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,170
With so many people guarding,

119
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:02,140
how did you fail to stop them?

120
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,850
What's the use of talking about this now?

121
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,140
Who knows what they're doing

122
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,200
in the fort?

123
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:07,370
In my opinion,

124
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:08,940
they definitely slacked off.

125
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,480
The corpse demons
will definitely come again.

126
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,220
What do we do now?

127
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,080
What can we do?

128
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,340
We can't rely on anyone.

129
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,930
We can only wait here to die.

130
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,610
It's all our fault.

131
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,680
Last night was urgent.

132
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,440
I failed to anticipate.

133
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,120
We will definitely guard the fort,

134
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,850
never letting the corpse demons
enter the village again.

135
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:36,530
These are my friends.

136
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,440
If you need anything,
you can ask for their help.

137
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:42,800
Let's split up and help them.

138
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:43,810
Sorry to trouble you.

139
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,530
Chief, is there a shortcut here?

140
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:48,370
I can take charge
of purchasing some supplies.

141
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:52,000
Leaving here leads only
to rarely trodden paths.

142
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:54,050
The village originally had a dock,

143
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:56,760
but it fell into disuse

144
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,670
as outsiders heard of
the corpse demons in Baihe Village.

145
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,170
Scholar, let's go help.

146
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:03,010
Okay.

147
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,250
Chief,

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,880
it happened so suddenly.
It's not your fault.

149
00:12:16,410 --> 00:12:18,640
Don't take to heart what they said.

150
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,680
Thank you, Miss Lin.

151
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,200
Come on, make it solid.

152
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:53,880
Is it aligned?

153
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,000
Put some strength into it.

154
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,200
Tie it tight, tie it tight.

155
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,060
Miss Zhao,

156
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:30,260
you have already saved numerous people.

157
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,680
Let's stop here for today.

158
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,620
Thank you.

159
00:13:43,090 --> 00:13:44,050
Let's continue.

160
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,220
Miss Zhao,

161
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,290
detoxification consumes too much
of your vital spirit.

162
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,930
You need to rest.

163
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,170
Right, Physician Han,

164
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,370
I...

165
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,240
I have something

166
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,930
I want to ask you about.

167
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,560
Miss, what would you like to ask?

168
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:04,410
Why

169
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,560
does my blood
detoxify the corpse poisoning?

170
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,760
To tell you the truth, Miss,

171
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,680
I have pondered over this too

172
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,760
but haven't found the reason.

173
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:20,560
However, your blood

174
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,490
is indeed different from ordinary people.

175
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:25,850
Different from ordinary people?

176
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,090
Physician Han,

177
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,760
could it be...

178
00:14:35,530 --> 00:14:36,640
I mean...

179
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,560
Is it possible

180
00:14:41,050 --> 00:14:41,930
that I am a demon?

181
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,320
Miss, why would you ask this?

182
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,880
I'm not very sure myself,

183
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,090
but Physician Han,
please tell me the truth.

184
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,170
With my cultivation and knowledge,

185
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,290
I can only say

186
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,490
you are no ordinary person.

187
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,440
As for anything else,
it's hard to be certain.

188
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:08,490
Miss, with your kind heart

189
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:10,000
and selfless acts of saving others,

190
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:12,120
your deeds

191
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:13,680
are truly virtuous.

192
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,560
As for

193
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:17,120
whether you're a demon or not,

194
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,760
does it matter?

195
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,740
It matters.

196
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,060
I just wish

197
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,200
to be an ordinary person.

198
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:41,120
Miss, you must not fixate on this.

199
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:43,320
Otherwise,

200
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,800
it will only bring endless troubles.

201
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,410
People say

202
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,090
humans and demons are different,

203
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:56,930
but deeply rooted prejudices

204
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,530
are the greatest evil.

205
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:03,800
There are evil humans

206
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,200
and good demons.

207
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:09,560
How can one generalize this?

208
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,320
Physician Han, please,

209
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,880
keep this secret for me.

210
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,930
Rest assured, Miss.

211
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,560
Only you

212
00:16:21,050 --> 00:16:22,200
and I

213
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:23,660
know about this matter.

214
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,490
Thank you, Physician Han.

215
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,610
Then let's continue saving people.

216
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:29,220
Okay.

217
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,730
Why is it getting worse?

218
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,680
The corpse poisoning
has reached the heart.

219
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,370
We must concentrate to force it out.

220
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,340
Honey!

221
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:18,370
Honey!

222
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:19,820
Honey!

223
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,650
Honey! My wife is dead.

224
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,580
Why did you harm her?

225
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,460
She's not dead.

226
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,860
- Why did you harm her?
- Just wait.

227
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:29,170
How can she not be dead
if she's stopped breathing?

228
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,500
You're the one who killed her.

229
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,650
Don't be rash.
Miss Ling'er is saving people.

230
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,730
Many have already been cured by her.

231
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,410
Is this how she saves them?

232
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:38,580
My wife still had breath
when she was brought over.

233
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,740
She dripped her blood
on my wife's forehead,

234
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,650
and then my wife stopped breathing.

235
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,250
She also dripped her blood on others.

236
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,250
Can blood detoxify?

237
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,340
Those she dripped blood on

238
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,820
haven't woken up yet.

239
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,370
Clearly, it's demon magic harming people.

240
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,460
Everyone!

241
00:18:53,740 --> 00:18:54,580
Everyone!

242
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,920
Don't let her drip blood anymore.

243
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,650
It will kill you.

244
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,730
It will kill you!

245
00:19:01,010 --> 00:19:01,850
What did you say?

246
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,410
Repeat what you just said.

247
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:04,460
- What blood did she use?
- Xiaoyao.

248
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:05,980
- Xiaoyao.
- She used her own blood.

249
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,820
She killed my wife.

250
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,370
- Nonsense!
- Don't, Xiaoyao.

251
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:10,980
Ling'er, don't speak for now.

252
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,890
I'm going to smash his mouth.

253
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,730
Xiaoyao.

254
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:21,650
Are you blind or stupid?

255
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,890
Your wife was poisoned
and wouldn't have lived long.

256
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,520
What purpose would she have
in harming your wife?

257
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:28,370
But why did my wife stop breathing?

258
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,680
Dad, look.

259
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:45,160
Physician Han,

260
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,610
please save my wife.

261
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:52,850
Honey.

262
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,610
Honey.

263
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,250
Honey, you're awake. Honey.

264
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,970
You scared me to death.

265
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,850
Honey.

266
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,890
What happened to me?

267
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:19,050
Why do I have no strength at all?

268
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:20,440
You were bitten by a corpse demon,

269
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:22,010
so I brought you here.

270
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,040
Oh, I remember now.

271
00:20:26,370 --> 00:20:29,620
You sneaked off to A-Niu's house
to gamble. You jerk!

272
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,730
That's why I fell.

273
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:32,220
I'll teach you a lesson.

274
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:34,200
- Alright, alright.
- I'll teach you a lesson.

275
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:35,250
I won't gamble anymore.

276
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,440
It's all clear now, isn't it?

277
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,890
Is she saving or harming people?

278
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,970
Miss, I was frantic earlier.

279
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,340
You are a bodhisattva.

280
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:47,220
You are the compassionate
Guanyin Bodhisattva.

281
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:48,220
- Ling'er.
- Thank you.

282
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,520
This person doesn't deserve our help.

283
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:51,700
Miss,

284
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,650
his heart isn't bad.

285
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,580
It's just his mouth...

286
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,560
- He can't speak properly.
- Honey.

287
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,160
He can't speak properly.

288
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,520
Watch how I deal with you.

289
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,890
- Honey, I know I was wrong. Spare me.
- Wait there.

290
00:21:03,890 --> 00:21:05,090
- Stop running! Stop!
- Ling'er,

291
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:07,010
come with me.

292
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:38,610
Your other hand.

293
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,370
Xiaoyao, I'm fine.

294
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,250
Your other hand.

295
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,780
Wasn't it supposed to only use
a little bit of spiritual power?

296
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,130
Why did it have to use your blood?

297
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,250
Have you been preoccupied
these past few days because of this?

298
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,770
Xiaoyao,

299
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,530
listen to me.

300
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:13,370
No need to say anymore.

301
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,340
We're not saving people anymore.
I simply cannot...

302
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:16,860
My dear grandson.

303
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:17,940
Hurry, hurry.

304
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,100
Go, quickly.

305
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,560
My dear grandson.

306
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,490
We still need to save them,

307
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
but isn't there another way?

308
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,170
Now, others are saved,

309
00:22:36,170 --> 00:22:37,280
but you are hurt.

310
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,800
Xiaoyao, I really am fine.

311
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,890
It only needs a little bit...

312
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,780
A little bit of spiritual power,
a little bit of blood, right?

313
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,520
But with so many people,
how much blood can you spare?

314
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,250
I keep saying I'll protect you,

315
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:52,160
but now I can only see you suffer.

316
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,770
What kind of protection am I offering?

317
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:55,130
I'm no hero at all.

318
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:57,730
Xiaoyao, please don't belittle yourself.

319
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:00,850
You have more important things to do.

320
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,940
Ling'er,

321
00:23:06,170 --> 00:23:08,520
nothing is more important
than you right now.

322
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:46,730
My Lady,

323
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:48,060
this is...

324
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,890
This is the medical hut
of that old man from last night.

325
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,820
After I was injured
by that monster last time,

326
00:23:55,820 --> 00:23:57,130
I woke up here.

327
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,250
My Lady,

328
00:23:58,820 --> 00:23:59,660
you're injured?

329
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,920
You're my guard,

330
00:24:04,130 --> 00:24:05,400
and you don't even know I was injured?

331
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,180
I am guilty.

332
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:10,040
Please punish me, My Lady.

333
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,180
Forget it.

334
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:18,800
Anyway, for some reason,

335
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:20,730
my wound healed just like that.

336
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:23,620
What I want to say is

337
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,460
stop causing trouble.

338
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,300
Did you hear me?

339
00:24:26,990 --> 00:24:27,830
Shh.

340
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:42,940
Follow me.

341
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,280
I brought you here.

342
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:22,740
(Tomb of Jin's Border Commander)

343
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,700
(Tomb of Jin's Border Commander)

344
00:29:56,460 --> 00:30:00,500
(Ghost General)

345
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:41,010
My old friend,

346
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,730
you're finally awake.

347
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:43,850
The Earth Spiritual Bead!

348
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,780
Tang Yu.

349
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,370
The Earth Spiritual Bead...

350
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,210
My Lady.

351
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,170
My Lady!

352
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:23,800
Do you think

353
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:25,210
corpse demons eat pork?

354
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,650
They definitely do.

355
00:35:26,890 --> 00:35:27,730
How do you know?

356
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:30,280
Did you forget last time, Chief

357
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:31,330
and those chickens?

358
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,210
No, no, no.

359
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:34,520
Chicken and pork are different.

360
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:35,930
Corpse demons
definitely don't eat pork.

361
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:38,620
Boss,

362
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,320
look, this time,

363
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:42,690
so many corpse demons
came all at once.

364
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,690
Rather than being eaten
by corpse demons,

365
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,460
we might as well...

366
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,410
Pork stewed with vermicelli!

367
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:52,810
I have noticed

368
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,260
you guys have been eyeing my Xiaobai

369
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,500
for days.

370
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,340
I'm telling you.

371
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:57,960
Whoever dares to touch it, I'll...

372
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,700
Archers, get ready.

373
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,410
Grab your bows,
and get on the arrow bridge.

374
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,250
Quick.

375
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,650
Attack their heads.

376
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,410
Don't let them escape from Baihe Fort.

377
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,620
Get on the bows.

378
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:36,560
- Quick!
- Hurry!

379
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,170
Shoot! Hurry! Shoot!

380
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,720
Chief, be careful!

381
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,370
- Chief!
- Chief!

382
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,490
Third Chief!

383
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,690
- Boss!
- Boss!

384
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,450
- It's alright.
- Third Chief.

385
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:46,690
Chief,

386
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:49,410
I'll have to go before you.

387
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,370
I can't guard the fort with you anymore.

388
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,240
You should make the Second Chief...

389
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:05,860
In the future,

390
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,850
you must help Chief

391
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,130
guard the fort

392
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,650
and Baihe Village.

393
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,040
- Boss.
- Third Chief.

394
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:23,090
Xiaobai...

395
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,040
You guys eat it.

396
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:26,800
Consider it

397
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,690
my final treat for you all.

398
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:31,960
You will be fine.

399
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,560
We still need to follow you.

400
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,520
- Boss.
- My brother!

401
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:41,450
- My brother!
- Boss!

402
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,210
- My brother!
- Boss!

403
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,760
Boss!

404
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:52,410
