00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,780
=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,490
Your Highness,

4
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,960
this Sacred Spiritual Bead shares
the same origin with the Five Spiritual Beads.

5
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,940
It was also given to me by my mother

6
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,490
to find the other Spiritual Beads.

7
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,490
The Five Spiritual Beads?

8
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,360
Are you willing to join me
in searching for the Spiritual Beads?

9
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,140
Join you...

10
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,140
What's going on?

11
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,840
It seems like all my injuries
have healed.

12
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:10,810
Strange.

13
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:14,480
I also feel filled with strength.

14
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,220
Your Highness,

15
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:29,280
we will depart in two days.

16
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:34,450
If you still decide to stay
after two days,

17
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,760
please give me the Earth Spiritual Bead.

18
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,450
The Five Spiritual Beads

19
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,640
are the only hope for saving Nanzhao.

20
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,140
Ling'er!

21
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,140
Ling'er!

22
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,170
Xiaoyao,

23
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,050
how are you feeling now?

24
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,450
Pretty good, look how fast I can run.

25
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,970
That Gluttony Demon Worm

26
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,120
absorbed the Red Ghost King's power
of a century,

27
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,000
so you could recover so quickly.

28
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,720
It really was the Gluttony Demon Worm.

29
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,890
No wonder.

30
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,450
When I woke up this morning,
I felt refreshed.

31
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,740
Not only have the internal injuries
from fighting the Red Ghost King

32
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:16,940
mostly healed,

33
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,850
but my cultivation
has also significantly advanced.

34
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,290
Even so,

35
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:22,290
you must not be careless.

36
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:25,040
You still need to rest for two more days
to consolidate your cultivation

37
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,600
before you can fully utilize the power
of the Gluttony Demon Worm.

38
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,170
I understand.

39
00:04:30,330 --> 00:04:31,480
I'll properly cultivate.

40
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,040
Once I'm fully recovered,

41
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:34,600
we'll set off for Nanzhao together.

42
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,730
Ling'er,

43
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:40,160
as a descendant of Nuwa,
you have your own mission.

44
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,290
You're destined not to live as you wish,

45
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,970
never able to be

46
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,360
an ordinary person.

47
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,730
Xiaoyao,

48
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,410
what are your plans

49
00:05:04,580 --> 00:05:05,880
after you escort me to Nanzhao?

50
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,290
Me?

51
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:12,130
Of course, I'll roam the martial world,
upholding justice,

52
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,010
just like my name suggests,

53
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:15,440
living a carefree life.

54
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,610
Ling'er,

55
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,770
we have stayed in Baihe Fort for too long.

56
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,130
Now that we're finally leaving,

57
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,810
thinking about the world outside,

58
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,440
I really can't wait.

59
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,730
(Carefree...)

60
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:30,980
(Right.)

61
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:34,290
(That's the life Xiaoyao
has always longed for.)

62
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,660
Ling'er,

63
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:48,130
when the time comes,

64
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,920
let's travel to every corner
of the world together.

65
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,290
Xiaoyao, you have just recovered
from your injury.

66
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,320
Let's head back quickly.

67
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,780
Sure.

68
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,730
Let's go.

69
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,200
Ling'er, look how fast I can run.

70
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:07,160
Ling'er, hurry up and follow.

71
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,480
Miss Fairy,

72
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,250
why won't you tell Li Xiaoyao the truth?

73
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:30,130
I can't.

74
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,640
The world knows too little
about the descendants of Nuwa.

75
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:37,850
If people saw my form,

76
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:40,360
they would surely label me
as a snake demon.

77
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:46,730
Xiaoyao would definitely
try to protect me,

78
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:48,290
but I fear

79
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,600
he would end up

80
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:53,600
disgraced like Physician Han

81
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:55,200
and the Ghost General,

82
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,360
or even get hurt.

83
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:01,010
So you choose not to tell them

84
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,640
and let Li Xiaoyao and the others

85
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,440
accompany you
in search of the Spiritual Beads?

86
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,320
The path to find the Spiritual Beads
is fraught with danger.

87
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:13,290
Xiaoyao, Yueru,

88
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:14,410
and Mr. Liu

89
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,570
have already faced death
several times because of me.

90
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:18,690
How can I be so selfish

91
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,970
to let them continue to face danger?

92
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,130
Miss Fairy,

93
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:28,250
but you're...

94
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,090
You're...

95
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,640
Xiaoyao has already

96
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:42,250
lost his memories from the Fairy Island.

97
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:45,420
Now it's easier

98
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,690
for him to be a hero.

99
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,360
If he knew about this,

100
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:51,530
he would carry too many burdens

101
00:07:53,330 --> 00:07:55,730
and could no longer freely be a hero.

102
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,570
Miss Fairy,

103
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,700
are you really going to leave Li Xiaoyao

104
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:00,880
and go on your own?

105
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:04,410
Why is it so hard

106
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:06,970
to be an ordinary person?

107
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:10,570
Before,

108
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,880
when I faced difficulties,

109
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:15,580
I had Master, Grandma,

110
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:16,810
and Xiaoyao.

111
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,600
But now,

112
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,090
I don't know

113
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,320
what to do anymore.

114
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,730
How can one have it all in life?

115
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,000
Miss Fairy,

116
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:41,170
I know you have your own considerations,

117
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,090
but

118
00:08:43,850 --> 00:08:45,020
no matter what,

119
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,090
I will always stand by your side

120
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:49,930
and accompany you always.

121
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:04,450
Thank you,

122
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,570
Little Stone.

123
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,850
Why doesn't Ling'er

124
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:29,490
come with us to find the Spiritual Beads?

125
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,560
This place is so boring,

126
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:33,320
nothing fun at all.

127
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,440
What's there to miss?

128
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,410
I'm talking to you. Didn't you hear me?

129
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:45,810
Maybe,

130
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,170
Her Highness has someone
she doesn't want to leave.

131
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:51,410
Who? How do you know?

132
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:53,010
I...

133
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,660
guessed.

134
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,530
Anyway, Ling'er
is the Princess of Nanzhao.

135
00:10:02,530 --> 00:10:04,560
She will surely join me
in searching for the Spiritual Beads.

136
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,600
Baihe suffered
from great disaster this time,

137
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,370
with corpse demons rampant,

138
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,300
causing numerous deaths and injuries.

139
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:18,320
But all of us in Baihe

140
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:19,730
were united

141
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,170
and determined,

142
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:23,880
ultimately protecting the peace here.

143
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,440
This first drink

144
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:27,730
is to the brothers we have lost.

145
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,760
This second drink

146
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,640
is to my father.

147
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,610
My father

148
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:58,850
sacrificed himself

149
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:01,200
to seal the Blood Pool.

150
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,170
The third drink

151
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:19,090
is to all of you.

152
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,880
Without your help,

153
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,930
Baihe's crisis

154
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,760
could have been catastrophic.

155
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:28,490
Now that the corpse demons
are vanquished,

156
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:31,090
nearby villagers have started to inquire,

157
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,000
wishing to reconnect with Baihe Village.

158
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,880
The long-abandoned dock
is back in operation.

159
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:40,410
On behalf of the villagers,
I thank all of you.

160
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,880
Thank you.

161
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,010
Chief,

162
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:54,930
now that Baihe Fort is at peace,

163
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:57,370
you and the Second Chief should...

164
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:01,320
- Celebrate with a wedding feast!
- A wedding feast!

165
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:09,900
- A wedding feast!
- A wedding feast!

166
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,120
Stop it, stop it.

167
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,050
Shaoyun and I will continue

168
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,320
to fulfill our duty as tomb guardians,

169
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,880
protecting Baihe Fort,

170
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,370
and ensuring peace for all.

171
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,680
Honor our pledge,

172
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,970
remaining silent.

173
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:29,440
Faithfully serve our duties,

174
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:30,850
even with death at our door.

175
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,340
Honor our pledge,

176
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,730
remaining silent.

177
00:12:33,730 --> 00:12:35,260
Faithfully serve our duties,

178
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,700
even with death at our door.

179
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:38,090
Honor our pledge,

180
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,530
remaining silent.

181
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,900
Faithfully serve our duties,

182
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,220
even with death at our door.

183
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,610
Honor our pledge...

184
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,660
Scholar,

185
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,780
savage girl,

186
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,320
I don't know when we'll meet again
after this parting.

187
00:12:52,050 --> 00:12:52,890
What?

188
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:54,290
You're leaving?

189
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,050
I plan to depart for Nanzhao
with Ling'er tomorrow.

190
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,560
You have helped us a lot these days.

191
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:02,570
Thank you.

192
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,410
It's a pity, a pity.

193
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,490
Time flies so quickly.

194
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,730
I have just gotten to know
Mr. Li and Miss Zhao,

195
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,490
and now we must part.

196
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:12,530
It's hard to let go.

197
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,780
Li Xiaoyao,

198
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:16,940
before we part, I want to...

199
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,780
Ling'er!

200
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,780
Ling'er!

201
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,250
Ling'er, Ling'er,

202
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:21,220
have you made up your mind?

203
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,490
Tomorrow we're setting off.

204
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,800
Do you want to join us in searching
for the Five Spiritual Beads?

205
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,000
What Five Spiritual Beads?

206
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,780
I see.

207
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,930
You're the reason

208
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:36,730
Ling'er wants to stay.

209
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:38,760
You think you're worthy?

210
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,130
Xiaoyao.

211
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:43,970
This is A'nu,

212
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,610
my good friend from Nanzhao,

213
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,680
and her guard, Tang Yu.

214
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,260
This is Yueru

215
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,370
and Mr. Liu.

216
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,090
They're all my good friends.

217
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,320
Since you are Ling'er's friend,

218
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,680
I won't take it personally.

219
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,050
I knew why this voice sounded familiar.

220
00:14:00,490 --> 00:14:02,800
So, you're that bratty girl
from Lantern Tavern.

221
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:06,090
It's you. Well, it's a small world.

222
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:08,020
Ling'er, we shouldn't hang out
with these people.

223
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:09,930
What do you mean
by "these people"? Tell me.

224
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,090
- Yueru. Yueru.
- Exactly, "these people".

225
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,930
Stop arguing.

226
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,090
Stop it, stop it.

227
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,700
Since we have all fortunately met here,

228
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:17,950
let's make tonight like that night
at Lantern Tavern.

229
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,150
We're not going home until we're drunk.

230
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:20,010
Good idea.

231
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,660
Li Xiaoyao,

232
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,970
I'll challenge you again before you leave.

233
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:26,020
Always wanting to fight,
aren't you tired?

234
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:27,200
Are you scared, Li Xiaoyao?

235
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,580
I'm scared.

236
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,000
If you're scared, then we must fight.

237
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,700
- Li Xiaoyao, wait!
- Fight! It'll be more fun that way.

238
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,540
Wait!

239
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm coming!

240
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,050
Wait, Li Xiaoyao!

241
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:37,530
- Scholar, look at your cousin.
- Li Xiaoyao!

242
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:40,900
Jinyuan, why are you coming up here?

243
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,050
- Stop, stop fighting!
- Come here!

244
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,170
Teach your cousin a lesson.

245
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,460
- Come here, Li Xiaoyao!
- Let's eat, let's eat.

246
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,820
- Battle with me!
- No!

247
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,900
If you don't, you're a coward.

248
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,240
Then I'm a coward.

249
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,120
The food is getting cold.

250
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,260
Don't hide behind him, okay?

251
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:52,970
I want to hide behind him.
I won't battle.

252
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:54,610
Confucius said
not fighting makes you a good girl.

253
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,760
You savage girl!

254
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:56,890
Don't fight.

255
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:58,610
You were defeated by me.

256
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,400
Look at them.

257
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,850
- Don't speak while eating.
- Coward.

258
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:02,760
- I won't battle.
- Yes, you will.

259
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,820
Well, Yueru.

260
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,040
- I won't battle.
- Will you or will you not?

261
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:06,120
What can you do about it?

262
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:07,760
- Dare to hit me?
- Jinyuan, don't get in the way.

263
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,970
Why are you hiding here alone?

264
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:36,410
Afraid I'd come to settle scores?

265
00:15:37,090 --> 00:15:38,240
Try this. It's delicious.

266
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:41,180
Thanks, My Lady.

267
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,290
What's the name of the tune
you were playing just now?

268
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,490
It's a song a friend used to sing

269
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,560
when I was a child.

270
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:55,010
Let me give it a try.

271
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,420
It's too difficult.

272
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,860
You shouldn't eat anymore.

273
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,050
Play it for me in the future.

274
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,850
Good morning, Yueru.

275
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,980
Jinyuan, how did you approach so quietly?

276
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:14,850
You startled me.

277
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,650
What's troubling you
so early in the morning?

278
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,320
I'm not thinking about anything.

279
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,090
I'm just enjoying the view here.

280
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,520
Having stayed in Baihe Fort
for a few days,

281
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,920
I have just realized
how beautiful it is here.

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,520
It's just a pity

283
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,440
that we have to leave.

284
00:17:34,650 --> 00:17:35,970
I have grown quite fond of this place.

285
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,770
We're only half a day's journey
from Suzhou City.

286
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:41,850
If you're reluctant to leave,

287
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,370
we can always come back anytime.

288
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,130
It's not the same.

289
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:49,680
How so?

290
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,860
It's my first time

291
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:59,040
seeing you so dispirited, Yueru.

292
00:18:01,530 --> 00:18:02,890
What troubles could I possibly have?

293
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,290
My biggest worry before

294
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,090
was my dad pressuring me to get married.

295
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,500
Now

296
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,920
that's resolved.

297
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:12,800
I'm more carefree and happy than ever.

298
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,160
Perhaps I have been overthinking.

299
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,040
Yueru,

300
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:22,200
if you ever have any troubles
in the future,

301
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,970
you can always talk to me.

302
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,920
I have a friend.

303
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,970
A friend?

304
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:38,680
A friend of mine met a new friend.

305
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,170
At first,

306
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,560
she really disliked that friend.

307
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,940
But after spending more time together,
she realized

308
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,400
that friend had some good qualities.

309
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:51,490
Over time,

310
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,130
she even started to think

311
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,650
having such a troublemaker
to argue around

312
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,970
wasn't so bad.

313
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:02,460
Forget it, forget it.

314
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,780
I don't even know
what I'm talking about.

315
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,850
Yueru, you don't know, but I do.

316
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,320
That person simply wants to figure out

317
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,520
what her feelings really are
towards that friend.

318
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,250
What are those feelings?

319
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,520
You want to hear my honest opinion?

320
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,610
Those feelings

321
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,490
are called ''liking''.

322
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,610
Liking?

323
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:58,440
Does that person also like your friend?

324
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,890
How would I know?

325
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,650
Of course, I don't know.

326
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,280
Then, what should my friend

327
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,920
do next?

328
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,920
Tell your friend

329
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,850
to look clearly into her heart.

330
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,130
As for what to do,

331
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,400
it's up to her.

332
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,130
Tang Yu.

333
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,650
Tang Yu, Tang Yu.

334
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:24,730
Why can't I ever play this leaf whistle?

335
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:25,700
You have no talent.

336
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,370
Are you saying I am dumb?

337
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,700
Yes.

338
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,890
Don't underestimate me.

339
00:21:41,370 --> 00:21:42,210
Ling'er!

340
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:44,210
Ling'er!

341
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,130
Ling'er, I used the Sacred Spiritual Bead

342
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,740
to sense the location
of the Wind Spiritual Bead.

343
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,860
It's in the northwest direction.

344
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,280
I had Tang Yu ask the Chief,

345
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:52,130
and she said that is Yangzhou City.

346
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,180
I have calculated.

347
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:54,820
If we leave now,

348
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,920
we should arrive by tonight.

349
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,970
You...

350
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,820
Let's

351
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,280
set off together.

352
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:06,010
Ling'er,

353
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,160
have you decided?

354
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,490
Ling'er has decided.

355
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,300
Let's go.

356
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,300
Let's go!

357
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,890
If I like him,

358
00:22:25,890 --> 00:22:27,280
the side with the character

359
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:28,370
will be up.

360
00:22:38,010 --> 00:22:38,890
I knew it.

361
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,800
It was just my imagination.

362
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,370
I don't like him at all.

363
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,370
I'll flip it one more time.

364
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,850
Where did it go?

365
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:01,500
Why should I let a coin

366
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,920
decide my feelings?

367
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:06,040
Whether or not I have feelings
for Li Xiaoyao,

368
00:23:06,250 --> 00:23:07,650
he already has someone he likes.

369
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,280
Besides, Ling'er is my friend.

370
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:13,130
What am I thinking?

371
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,400
I value friendship above all.

372
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:20,610
Nothing is more important
than a true friend.

373
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,890
Oh, no.

374
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:43,370
Ling'er is leaving.

375
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:48,090
I can't let this happen.
I must tell Li Xiaoyao.

376
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,700
Sir, hurry, set sail.

377
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,800
I need to catch up to that boat.

378
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,560
That one's heading to Yangzhou City.

379
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,170
This one goes to Suzhou City.

380
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:23,010
I can't make it.

381
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:24,970
What about other boats?

382
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,800
This small dock only has a few boats.

383
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:28,050
You'll have to wait until tomorrow.

384
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:29,740
Sir, it's really urgent.

385
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,370
How much do I need to pay you
to go to Yangzhou City?

386
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:33,610
I really can't go there.

387
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,300
Sir.

388
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,040
I'm chartering this boat.

389
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:41,770
So much money!

390
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,890
Miss, please get on the boat.

391
00:24:42,890 --> 00:24:44,220
We'll go to Suzhou City now.

392
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,060
Wait.

393
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:46,770
Miss, any other instructions?

394
00:24:46,770 --> 00:24:47,680
I'll follow them exactly.

395
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,400
I don't want to go
to Suzhou City anymore.

396
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,770
I suddenly want to go to Yangzhou City
for a bowl of noodles.

397
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,010
But...

398
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,670
I'll give you more money
once we arrive in Yangzhou City.

399
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:00,160
Alright, whatever you say.

400
00:25:02,250 --> 00:25:03,090
Li,

401
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,090
Yueru,

402
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:06,090
in this heavy rain,

403
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,730
I was afraid
I wouldn't catch up with you.

404
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,490
Li, your bag.

405
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:11,210
Scholar.

406
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,040
Stop fussing and let's go.

407
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:16,970
You...

408
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,100
I just suddenly wanted to go
to Yangzhou for a bowl of noodles.

409
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,940
Is that wrong?

410
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,600
The more people, the more strength.

411
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:25,730
We'll accompany you
to bring Miss Ling'er back.

412
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,340
Thank you.

413
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:11,420
(Yangzhou City)

414
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,560
Hurry up.

415
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:26,160
Candied haws!

416
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:30,940
Look, look!

417
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,040
Steaming hot soup dumplings!

418
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,560
I want to fly a kite too.

419
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,970
Sweet osmanthus cake!

420
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:47,220
Out of the way.

421
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:48,850
Hunma cakes here!

422
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:51,820
Don't force me
to beat you in front of Ling'er.

423
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:56,890
Sweet osmanthus cake!
Red bean cake! Hunma cake!

424
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,440
Tang Yu! Where are your manners?

425
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,650
You look extraordinary.

426
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,090
You must be here
for the Treasure Appraisal Gathering.

427
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,200
Treasure Appraisal Gathering?

428
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,940
What's that?

429
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,440
You don't know that?

430
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,250
This Treasure Appraisal Gathering

431
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,610
is the most important event
in Yangzhou City.

432
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,580
All treasures from Yangzhou are gathered
in the Treasure Pavilion

433
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:29,490
for the nobles to admire and appraise.

434
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:32,680
Ling'er, it sounds fun.

435
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,650
I'm telling you.

436
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,160
You can't stop me this time.

437
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,100
With so many treasures
at such a gathering,

438
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,940
maybe the Spiritual...

439
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,440
Sir, may I ask

440
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:47,040
where is the gathering held?

441
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,100
I happen to head there myself.

442
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,200
I'll lead the way for you.

443
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,250
- Thank you.
- Please.

444
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,700
Ling'er,

445
00:27:54,890 --> 00:27:56,980
have you ever seen
such an insubordinate guard?

446
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:59,940
Sweet osmanthus cake! Red bean cake!

447
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,610
Hunma cake!

448
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:05,340
(Treasure Pavilion)

449
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:06,210
Right.

450
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,890
This is the Secretary General.

451
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,180
Ladies and gentlemen.

452
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:11,460
Ladies and gentlemen.

453
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,100
I am the Secretary General
of the Prefectural Governor.

454
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,340
Yangzhou is facing a severe drought,
which hasn't been seen in a century.

455
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,740
Thousands of miles of land are parched,

456
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:20,890
and the people are suffering.

457
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:24,130
The Governor has organized
this Treasure Appraisal Gathering

458
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:27,620
to encourage wealthy families
to practice virtue

459
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,920
and raise funds for disaster relief.

460
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,090
The Governor also sets an example

461
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,160
by donating

462
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:35,320
his own cherished treasures for auction,

463
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:39,010
with all proceeds going to disaster relief.

464
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
(List of Treasures)
The rare treasures listed here

465
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,610
are brought by the gentry and tycoons
from the Jiangnan region.

466
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,650
(Heavenly Earthly)
With so many treasures gathered,

467
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,850
this opportunity is extremely rare.

468
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,160
If you're a treasure enthusiast,

469
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,600
(Heavenly: Lustrous and Eye-Catching)
you really shouldn't miss out.

470
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,370
Why is there no picture

471
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,890
for this last item?

472
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,800
I have heard

473
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,010
it's a rare bead.

474
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,460
A bead.

475
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,440
A bead?

476
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,520
Let's hurry inside then. Come on.

477
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,770
Please present your invitation.

478
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,340
Miss, those not presenting treasures

479
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:27,730
must have an invitation to enter.

480
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,970
What invitation?

481
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,460
Look.

482
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:32,770
That one in his hand.

483
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,520
Anyone who donates a thousand guan
to charity can get an invitation.

484
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,920
Three thousand guan is way too much.

485
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,250
We don't have that much money.

486
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,420
Guys,

487
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,420
come this way.

488
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:51,460
Come.

489
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:56,850
Guys,

490
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:00,040
(Invitation)
I happen to have three invitations.

491
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:01,730
If you need them,

492
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,800
I can offer them to you,
though it pains me.

493
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:06,340
Look, look!

494
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,740
Candied haws!

495
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,280
Great, you...

496
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,850
You were going
to give them to us, right?

497
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,160
He wants to sell them.

498
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,530
The gentleman is correct.

499
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,500
Actually, I'm tasked by someone

500
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,730
to sell these.

501
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,580
I can offer them to you for a low price.

502
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,680
How much? I'll take them.

503
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:35,010
Miss, you only need
to give me three hundred guan.

504
00:30:36,290 --> 00:30:38,500
- That's so much cheaper.
- Indeed.

505
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:39,820
You're such a good person.

506
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:40,660
No, thanks.

507
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:41,890
We're leaving.

508
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,780
Sir,

509
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,490
you'll miss out
if you pass up this chance.

510
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,520
Hurry up.

511
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:53,500
Give me the money.
I'm going to the Treasure Pavilion.

512
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,770
He's a swindler.

513
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,200
You're the swindler.

514
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:02,860
Ling'er, it's okay.

515
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,280
This is to find the Spiritual Beads.

516
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:06,610
Here, see if this is enough.

517
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:08,970
Stop talking nonsense.

518
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,850
I'm on official business.

519
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:14,610
Then these three invitations are yours.

520
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,800
- Let's go.
- Miss,

521
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:20,860
you just arrived in Yangzhou City
and haven't found a place to stay, right?

522
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,730
I'm familiar with a local inn.

523
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,290
It's serene

524
00:31:24,290 --> 00:31:25,340
and reasonably priced.

525
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:27,040
In light of our fateful meeting,

526
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,280
I'll take you there.

527
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:29,610
Sure.

528
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,040
Come this way.

529
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:35,920
At crucial moments,
you still need to rely on me.

530
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:38,890
Sorry to trouble you.

531
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,770
Candied haws!

532
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,970
Excuse me, have you seen
two people from Nanzhao?

533
00:31:49,070 --> 00:31:50,460
- No.
- Have you seen two people from Nanzhao

534
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,740
and a girl about this tall?

535
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:52,100
No.

536
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:53,770
Have you seen two people from Nanzhao?

537
00:31:53,770 --> 00:31:54,970
No, no, no.

538
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,700
Have you seen three people
from out of town?

539
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,540
No, no, no.

540
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,290
Excuse me, have you seen
two people from Nanzhao

541
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:03,130
and a girl?

542
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:04,370
No, no, no.

543
00:32:09,650 --> 00:32:11,250
Since we're already in Yangzhou City,

544
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:13,170
why not find an inn to settle down

545
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:14,560
before looking for Miss Zhao?

546
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:18,730
You go ahead. I'll keep asking around.

547
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,580
Aimlessly searching in such a big city

548
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,400
like Yangzhou City isn't practical.

549
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:26,040
They must be staying at an inn
since it's their first time here.

550
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,370
I'll ask every inn

551
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,210
in Yangzhou City today.

552
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,200
I'm sure I will find them.

553
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,490
My cousin also looks tired.

554
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:34,850
Why not...

555
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,610
Don't blame me for your tiredness.

556
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,400
Let's go, Li Xiaoyao, to find Ling'er.

557
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,210
Well...

558
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,580
Let's go.

559
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,980
Have you seen two people
from Nanzhao and a girl?

560
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:52,900
- Wait for me.
- The girl looks...

561
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,130
No, I haven't seen them.

562
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,650
Please slow down.

563
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:57,850
Watch the steps.

564
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,560
This way, please.

565
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,460
This room is isolated,

566
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:04,010
not connected to other rooms,

567
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:05,490
so it's very quiet.

568
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,700
We'll take it.

569
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:13,540
Here you are.

570
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
Thank you, Miss.

571
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,420
Waiter,

572
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:18,770
don't let anyone know we're staying here.

573
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,610
Why not?

574
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:24,970
Okay, then I'll be downstairs.

575
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:27,320
You, go.

576
00:33:29,410 --> 00:33:30,250
Ling'er.

577
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,420
Yes.

578
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,770
Ling'er, is it nice here?

579
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:47,130
Just thinking about
that Tang Yu annoys me.

580
00:33:47,290 --> 00:33:49,250
He wouldn't let me do this,
wouldn't let me do that.

581
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:51,620
That man was kindly helping us

582
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,650
and arranged such a nice room for us.

583
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,160
He dared to call him a swindler.

584
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,560
I think he's more of a swindler himself.

585
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,090
Annoying.

586
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,160
A'nu, Tang Yu meant no harm.

587
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:05,440
Actually, I also found
that person a bit odd.

588
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:08,560
But now we have got the invitations,

589
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,210
we can find the Spiritual Beads

590
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:12,210
and return to Nanzhao sooner.

591
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:13,780
It's pretty good.

592
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,370
Ling'er, don't overthink it.

593
00:34:23,890 --> 00:34:26,170
This dress is a gift from me.

594
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,480
Rest early tonight.

595
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:30,020
Tomorrow morning,

596
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,060
we'll go to
that Treasure Appraisal Gathering

597
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,070
and get back the Spiritual Bead.

598
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,170
Thank you, A'nu.

599
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,340
I gotta go.

600
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:54,650
Li,

601
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:56,240
Li,

602
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:58,370
I really can't walk anymore.

603
00:34:58,370 --> 00:35:00,480
With so many inns in Yangzhou City,

604
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,760
it might be difficult
to find them quickly.

605
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,720
- Maybe we should...
- If you're hungry or tired,

606
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,450
just find an inn to rest.

607
00:35:06,850 --> 00:35:07,690
I'll go find them.

608
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,900
Don't worry about me.

609
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,130
Not selling anymore. I'm closing up.

610
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,650
Fine. Don't worry about him.

611
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,320
Jinyuan, let's go.

612
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,450
Let's leave him to starve and tire out
in Yangzhou.

613
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,000
That doesn't seem right.

614
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,460
You look like
you have traveled a long way.

615
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,610
Are you looking for an inn?

616
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:29,410
It's just the two of us who need an inn.

617
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,400
We want the biggest
and most comfortable place.

618
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:34,090
I know an innkeeper here.

619
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,020
The environment is good
and the price is fair.

620
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,540
Let me take you there.

621
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,890
- Let's go.
- Sir.

622
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:40,490
Sir,

623
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:42,090
are you a local?

624
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,660
Sir,

625
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:44,810
you can call me Huang.

626
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:47,020
I was born and raised in Yangzhou.

627
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,000
Then, can I ask you something?

628
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,090
Three people from out of town,

629
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,130
two women, and one man.

630
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,810
Sir, if you're looking
for people from out of town,

631
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:54,090
I can take you to the inn.

632
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,130
There, with people
coming and going every day,

633
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,450
maybe you'll find
the ones you're looking for.

634
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,210
Alright.

635
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,010
Let's go.

636
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:05,520
How much farther?

637
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:09,820
Delicious.

638
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:11,410
Eat slower, Yueru.

639
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,060
Sir,

640
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,740
the western room
has been prepared for you.

641
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,370
Once you have finished eating,
I'll escort you up.

642
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,000
Waiter,

643
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,500
have you seen
three people from out of town,

644
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,930
two dressed from Nanzhao,
one man, two women?

645
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:25,300
Sir,

646
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:28,300
there have been many people coming
for the Treasure Appraisal Gathering.

647
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,410
Not just people from Nanzhao,

648
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,370
but also from Xinluo,

649
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:32,480
Dayi and Gaoli.

650
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,650
I'll have to think
about the ones you're asking for.

651
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,040
Alright then, enjoy your meal.

652
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,850
Li, let's eat first.

653
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:51,170
Li Xiaoyao,

654
00:36:52,810 --> 00:36:53,790
do you find chopsticks tasty?

655
00:36:56,570 --> 00:36:57,450
I can't eat.

656
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,450
Then don't eat.

657
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:02,850
I can't stand this half-dead attitude.

658
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,370
Why is there so much sand in this dish?

659
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:14,240
Jinyuan, try this.

660
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,480
It really seems like there's sand.

661
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,320
- Right?
- But then it doesn't seem like it.

662
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,690
I can't tell.

663
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:30,410
No, I have to argue this with the waiter.

664
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,760
Hold on. Li.

665
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:32,960
Help us taste this.

666
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,650
No need to taste it.

667
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,780
There's none.

668
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,240
Then try this large meatball.

669
00:37:41,570 --> 00:37:42,690
They didn't add any salt at all.

670
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:46,940
You two can't make it any more obvious

671
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,480
when you're trying
to persuade someone to eat.

672
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:53,280
Li, I really admire you.

673
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:54,800
If there was something wrong
with this dish,

674
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,130
your cousin would have
flipped the table by now.

675
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,170
Li Xiaoyao, you...

676
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:08,410
I'm sorry

677
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,690
for causing you two to worry.

678
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,090
Don't flatter yourself.
Who's worried about you?

679
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,000
You're too concerned about Miss Zhao.

680
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,100
That's forgivable.

681
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:23,810
Sorry to bother you.

682
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:26,570
We're fully booked today.
Would you mind sharing a table?

683
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,960
If it's not too much trouble.

684
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,910
To accommodate others
is to accommodate oneself.

685
00:38:30,930 --> 00:38:31,550
Please, have a seat.

686
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,120
(Mr. Zhu, merchant)
Alright, thank you, thank you.

687
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:33,970
Sir, please sit here.

688
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:37,000
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

689
00:38:37,810 --> 00:38:40,450
It seems you three
are also from out of town.

690
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,620
Enjoy your meal.

691
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,220
This Treasure Appraisal Gathering

692
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,690
is truly a grand event for Yangzhou City.

693
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:47,260
I bet the inn's guests

694
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,980
are all here for the treasures.

695
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:50,130
Treasure Appraisal Gathering?

696
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,000
You don't know?

697
00:38:52,810 --> 00:38:54,460
There's a drought, right?

698
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,000
The Prefectural Governor of Yangzhou City

699
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,300
invited treasure collectors from everywhere

700
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:00,300
to exhibit their treasures

701
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,220
and to call for charitable donations.

702
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,740
The funds raised

703
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:05,090
will be used for disaster relief.

704
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:08,520
Such a good deed indeed.

705
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:11,000
May I ask if you're here
to donate as well?

706
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,560
I'm merely a humble man,

707
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,890
only interested in the treasures.

708
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:20,170
I have heard this event will showcase
numerous rare items,

709
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:21,610
I wish to see them and find out

710
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,240
if my treasure will stand out.

711
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,560
You seem quite confident
in your treasure.

712
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,960
Miss, you have keen insight.

713
00:39:31,330 --> 00:39:32,610
Those narrow-minded folks

714
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:35,940
bring anything they consider a treasure.

715
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:38,650
I came specifically
to broaden their horizons.

716
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:41,130
Since your treasure is so impressive,

717
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:43,330
why not show it to us now
and enlighten us?

718
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:44,170
Sure.

719
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:58,650
But my wife instructed me
not to flaunt wealth.

720
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,540
Besides,

721
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,740
I have heard Yangzhou has been troubled

722
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,320
by a skilled female thief recently.

723
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:06,940
Even the Governor can do nothing.

724
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:08,020
If you want to see it,

725
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:10,720
go to the event tomorrow.

726
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,800
I think your treasure is nothing special,

727
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,700
so you're afraid to show it
and embarrass yourself, right?

728
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,370
You dare question my treasure?

729
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,450
Let me tell you,

730
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:22,320
my Purple Gold Gourd
is the legendary treasure

731
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:25,090
used by the Grand Supreme Elder Lord
for his elixirs.

732
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:26,450
I dare not claim much,

733
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:27,740
but at tomorrow's exhibition,

734
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,890
I believe only the Governor's bead

735
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:31,850
can compete with it.

736
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:36,130
What treasure gourd or bead?

737
00:40:36,130 --> 00:40:37,330
You think we're country bumpkins?

738
00:40:37,330 --> 00:40:38,170
Let me tell you.

739
00:40:38,170 --> 00:40:40,320
I have seen more treasures
than you have eaten rice.

740
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:43,210
Tomorrow we're setting off.

741
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,610
Do you want to join us in searching
for the Five Spiritual Beads?

742
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,280
What kind of bead are you talking about?

743
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:50,930
I can't be bothered to explain.

744
00:40:51,650 --> 00:40:52,490
Tell me!

745
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,780
Want to see?

746
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:55,980
See for yourself
at the event tomorrow.

747
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,480
See who's eaten more rice.

748
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,890
But looking at your penniless appearance,

749
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:01,520
I don't think you can even
afford an invitation.

750
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,940
We wouldn't go to such a lousy event.

751
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,930
Just take good care
of your trashy treasure.

752
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,320
Beware that the female thief
might steal it before anyone sees it.

753
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,650
No.

754
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,060
A thief wouldn't steal worthless things.

755
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:14,410
I... You...

756
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,580
My apologies.

757
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:19,650
Sir.

758
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,620
Sir.

759
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:25,170
Yueru, why bother scaring him like that?

760
00:41:25,370 --> 00:41:27,410
I just can't stand his arrogance,

761
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,460
waving a trashy gourd around,

762
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,850
acting all mysterious.

763
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:34,780
Tomorrow,

764
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,410
let's go see his gourd.

765
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:40,410
Eat up.

766
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,250

00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,800
