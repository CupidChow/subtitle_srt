00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 39=

3
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,570
Thank you, sir, for saving my life.

4
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,350
I didn't expect Bai Yue's martial arts
to be so powerful.

5
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,690
Fortunately, your Spell
of the God of Wine was better.

6
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:02,090
Kid,

7
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,980
let me tell you,

8
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:06,940
the Spell of the God of Wine
should not be used carelessly.

9
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,540
Sir, slow down on the drinking.

10
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,940
Sir, what's wrong with you?

11
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,690
I'm fine.

12
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,850
I'm just getting old,

13
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,300
and I've wasted this fine wine.

14
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,690
Sir, you're injured.

15
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,250
I'll take you to see the Sacred Maid.

16
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,180
You know,

17
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,130
Bai Yue's strike

18
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:37,260
is quite formidable.

19
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:40,570
Sir, sir!

20
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,860
Don't talk now.

21
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,170
Let's go right away.

22
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:46,820
Kid, my time has come.

23
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,300
The Sacred Maid

24
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,100
can't save me anymore.

25
00:02:52,100 --> 00:02:53,580
Impossible, impossible. Sir, let's go!

26
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:54,660
Kid, kid,

27
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,740
listen to me. Listen to me.

28
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,580
Kid,

29
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,460
before,

30
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,020
I didn't let you call me master

31
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,540
because I really dislike

32
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,850
the cumbersome rituals of this world.

33
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,380
Also,

34
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:11,970
after you went

35
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,260
to Mount Shu,

36
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,100
you insisted on entering
the Demon-Locking Tower.

37
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,900
You were not my disciple,

38
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,460
so many things

39
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,900
were more convenient.

40
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,460
I understand. I understand it all, sir.

41
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:30,770
Ten years ago,

42
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:33,970
you found the chosen one for me.

43
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,180
Thank you.

44
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,140
Xiaoyao.

45
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,570
My judgment was not wrong.

46
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,210
I first set my eyes on you,

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:52,050
and so did my Senior Jiang.

48
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,050
He also wanted
to take you as a disciple,

49
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:57,410
proving our judgments were quite alike.

50
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,680
Master...

51
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:02,100
Sir, sir!

52
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,220
Kid,

53
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:11,130
today, there's nothing left
to worry about.

54
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,260
If you don't mind, today,

55
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:18,290
I will take you as my disciple.

56
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,260
Master.

57
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:26,820
Master, please accept my bow.

58
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:27,730
Kid,

59
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,700
don't be so formal.

60
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,330
Master, what are you doing?

61
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:45,420
Teaching you is too troublesome.

62
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:49,260
I'll pass on all my remaining power

63
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,010
to you.

64
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:57,610
Master!

65
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,050
No!

66
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,700
Master!

67
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,570
Master!

68
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,540
- Master!
- Kid,

69
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,890
listen to me.

70
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:23,540
The second thing

71
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,420
is this sword.

72
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:31,540
This

73
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,490
is the Dustless Sword,

74
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,860
and it's infinitely powerful.

75
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,330
Today,

76
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:39,610
I will give it to you.

77
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:59,730
Kid, alright, alright.

78
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:05,010
Now, I'll tell you the third thing.

79
00:06:08,010 --> 00:06:08,850
Master...

80
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,010
People

81
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,420
die someday.

82
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,660
It just so happens
that today is my time.

83
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:28,540
It happens to be today.

84
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,660
That's all.

85
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,130
Master.

86
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,770
Master, I will heed your words.

87
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,570
Master.

88
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:49,010
Riding the wind with my sword,

89
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:54,380
vanquishing demons
between heaven and earth.

90
00:06:55,660 --> 00:07:01,420
Joyous with wine, carefree.

91
00:07:02,330 --> 00:07:06,860
Without wine, it drives me mad.

92
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,580
One drink empties rivers and seas,

93
00:07:13,490 --> 00:07:17,610
another swallows the sun and moon.

94
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,700
Thousands of cups
don't bring me down,

95
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,140
only I, the Drunken Sword Immortal.

96
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:44,890
The Drunken Sword Immortal.

97
00:08:09,610 --> 00:08:10,450
Master!

98
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,330
Master!

99
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,500
Master!

100
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,100
Master!

101
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,930
Madam.

102
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,490
Xiaoyao.

103
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,220
Madam,

104
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm back.

105
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,340
How has Ling'er been
these past two days?

106
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,020
It's been over a month now.

107
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,060
Over a month?

108
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,980
How is Ling'er?

109
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,780
Go and see her for yourself.

110
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,060
Alright.

111
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,420
Xiaoyao.

112
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,820
Ling'er, you're awake!

113
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,740
Xiaoyao,

114
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,780
these days,

115
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,290
sorry to trouble you.

116
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:36,740
No trouble at all.

117
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,020
I'm glad that you're awake.

118
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,610
The Sacred Maid told me everything

119
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,460
that happened

120
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:50,530
after I passed out.

121
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:56,340
Yueru, she...

122
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,450
Ling'er,

123
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,530
stop grieving.

124
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:10,370
Yueru

125
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,460
didn't want this for you.

126
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,700
I owe Yueru

127
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,180
too much.

128
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,850
What's done is done.

129
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,410
We can't change it.

130
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,410
We can only remember

131
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:48,020
to honor

132
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,970
their sacrifice.

133
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,220
Right, Ling'er,

134
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,580
how are you feeling?

135
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:04,810
You're...

136
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:10,020
I want you

137
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,460
to meet someone.

138
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:14,180
Who?

139
00:12:28,050 --> 00:12:28,890
Ling'er,

140
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:31,860
she...

141
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,660
She is...

142
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,410
The person I wanted you to meet.

143
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:44,970
She's our daughter.

144
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
Our...

145
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:58,220
Our daughter?

146
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:01,820
After the Princess took the Qilin Horn,

147
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,970
she soon gave birth to her.

148
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,620
My daughter.

149
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:23,010
My daughter.

150
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,900
I have a daughter now.

151
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:33,300
Ling'er,

152
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,290
what's her name?

153
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:37,620
I

154
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,340
want to call her

155
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:45,890
Yiru.

156
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:52,010
Yiru?

157
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,780
If not for Yueru sacrificing herself,

158
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,900
we would've probably been separated
by life and death already.

159
00:14:07,170 --> 00:14:09,020
Her safe arrival into this world

160
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:12,580
was brought with Yueru's life.

161
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,740
So,

162
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:17,460
I hope Yueru's spirit in heaven

163
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,380
can protect her

164
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,460
to grow up safely.

165
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,330
Yiru.

166
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:35,930
Yiru is good.

167
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:39,980
Let's call her Yiru.

168
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,570
Li Yiru.

169
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,060
Xiaoyao,

170
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:59,820
about that thing
you asked me about before,

171
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,170
do you now have an answer?

172
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,260
Goddess Nuwa has enlightened me.

173
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,780
She wanted me to understand

174
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:09,090
that some things
are destined not to change.

175
00:15:10,610 --> 00:15:11,940
In ancient times,

176
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,090
Goddess Nuwa sacrificed herself

177
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:18,460
to repair the sky and save the people,

178
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,730
leaving behind the Nuwa clan

179
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,410
to continue protecting the earth.

180
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,850
This is their duty.

181
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,180
Yes.

182
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,090
Everyone can understand it,

183
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,490
but who can truly accept it?

184
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:48,780
Whatever happens next,

185
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,410
I will protect Ling'er,

186
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:53,250
advancing or retreating together.

187
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,610
Does Ling'er know?

188
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,780
No.

189
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:03,340
I won't tell her.

190
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,580
Xiaoyao,

191
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,780
why aren't you asleep so late?

192
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,010
I couldn't sleep,

193
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,940
so I came to check on you and Yiru.

194
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:38,980
Right,

195
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,300
Xiaoyao,

196
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,730
I heard from the Sacred Maid

197
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,410
you went to the Temple of Nuwa.

198
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,730
What did you do

199
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,820
all this time there?

200
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:51,780
Goddess Nuwa

201
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,610
took me to see you when you were a kid.

202
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,220
When I was a kid?

203
00:16:57,610 --> 00:16:58,490
Ten years ago?

204
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,700
It turns out that ten years ago,

205
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:05,210
in Nanzhao,

206
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,980
it really was you who saved me.

207
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,540
Later,

208
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,340
you went to the Fairy Island.

209
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,180
That's right,

210
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,100
but at that time,

211
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:24,170
I was foolish and dull,

212
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,010
unable to remember anything.

213
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,290
However, now,

214
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,340
we must still be thankful

215
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,770
for the protection of Goddess Nuwa.

216
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:52,860
Everything was arranged
by Goddess Nuwa.

217
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,980
She arranged for me
to meet you as a child,

218
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:01,370
took me to Fairy Island,

219
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:06,220
arranged our marriage,

220
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,460
brought us back to Nanzhao together,

221
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:16,700
and arranged for me...

222
00:18:19,370 --> 00:18:24,130
She probably didn't have the fortune
to grow old with you.

223
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:26,580
The result isn't what matters,

224
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:29,370
and the journey is more important.

225
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
Xiaoyao.

226
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,820
Xiaoyao,

227
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,100
what's wrong?

228
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,340
It's nothing.

229
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:51,420
Ling'er,

230
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,580
now that we have Yiru,

231
00:18:56,290 --> 00:18:57,700
no matter what we face in the future,

232
00:18:59,010 --> 00:18:59,890
our family of three

233
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,250
must stay safe together.

234
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:08,370
I've decided,

235
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,580
once we're done with Nanzhao's affairs,

236
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,370
we'll go to Fairy Island

237
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,410
and live there forever,

238
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:17,680
never to be separated again.

239
00:19:24,290 --> 00:19:25,130
Good.

240
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:45,610
Do you like it?

241
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,620
Our Yiru

242
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,340
is growing every day.

243
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:57,500
I really wish

244
00:19:58,410 --> 00:19:59,580
to just watch her grow up every day,

245
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,770
accompanying her step by step.

246
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,130
Ling'er!

247
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:24,370
A'nu!

248
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:31,490
Ling'er,

249
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:33,100
you're finally back.

250
00:20:33,980 --> 00:20:34,820
A'nu,

251
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:36,500
the Sacred Maid

252
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,980
has told me

253
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,620
everything.

254
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,060
Tang Yu...

255
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,250
Let's not mention him.

256
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:02,650
I will avenge Mr. Shi

257
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,740
and Luojiao.

258
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:07,090
A'nu...

259
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,410
I'm really fine.

260
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
You don't need to worry about me.

261
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,250
Everything will pass.

262
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,860
A'nu, come here.

263
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,770
Let me introduce someone to you.

264
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,860
This is...

265
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,500
This is our child.

266
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,410
How is she so adorable?

267
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:53,780
What about Yueru?

268
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:57,890
Yueru...

269
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:01,290
To save us
in the Demon-Locking Tower,

270
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,220
she is no longer with us.

271
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,650
It's only been a few months.

272
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:30,740
How could this happen?

273
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,820
Those who have left have left.

274
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:37,650
Grieving is of no use.

275
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:42,500
Death is not the end,

276
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,100
but forgetting is.

277
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,650
As long as we keep remembering them,

278
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:53,220
they will always be with us.

279
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,420
Madam,

280
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:09,050
how can we stop Bai Yue?

281
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:14,170
Ling'er, you are a descendant of Nuwa,

282
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,100
naturally endowed
with the power to save the world,

283
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:23,010
but your Nuwa power
is not yet fully awakened.

284
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,860
You need the Heavenly Snake Cane
in the Temple of Nuwa

285
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:28,010
and the Five Spiritual Beads

286
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,220
to fully awaken the Nuwa power

287
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,740
inside you.

288
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,530
This Heavenly Snake Cane

289
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,260
is in the Nuwa Temple,

290
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:44,050
but we currently have only four

291
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,470
of the Five Spiritual Beads.

292
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,540
Madam,

293
00:23:48,050 --> 00:23:50,580
do you know where
the Water Spiritual Bead is?

294
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:02,500
Xiaoyao.

295
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,940
The last Spiritual Bead

296
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:13,660
is here with me.

297
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:27,820
Xiaoyao,

298
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,390
why is this Water Spiritual Bead

299
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,980
with you?

300
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,820
Goddess Nuwa sent me back ten years ago

301
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:39,370
not only to take you and Grandmother
to Fairy Island

302
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,500
but also to find the lost
Water Spiritual Bead.

303
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,730
Ling'er,

304
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,630
I witnessed the Witch Queen suppressing
the Water Demon Beast with her body.

305
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,490
I...

306
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,340
Xiaoyao,

307
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:57,060
I know

308
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,340
you are worried about me,

309
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,370
but you should believe in me

310
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,130
and believe in us.

311
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,010
We can definitely defeat Bai Yue

312
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:06,700
and the Water Demon Beast.

313
00:25:07,130 --> 00:25:07,970
But Ling'er,

314
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,100
you just gave birth to Yiru,

315
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,980
your health and spiritual power
have not yet recovered.

316
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,820
Xiaoyao,

317
00:25:14,290 --> 00:25:15,130
I must

318
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,620
take up the responsibilities
I should bear.

319
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,420
Ling'er,

320
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:46,420
I believe in you.

321
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,700
No matter what, I will be with you.

322
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,460
Ling'er,

323
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,170
as long as we work together,

324
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,060
the rain prayer will surely succeed,

325
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:12,790
and Bai Yue's conspiracy
will be shattered.

326
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,250
Everything will go smoothly.

327
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,100
Tomorrow's matters

328
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,090
are for tomorrow.

329
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:23,770
No matter what,
we must make the most of today.

330
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,210
Right.

331
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,630
Then let's use tea instead of wine

332
00:26:29,650 --> 00:26:30,790
to fortify ourselves for tomorrow.

333
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:41,460
Let's toast to the past,

334
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,370
to today's gathering,

335
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,860
and to tomorrow's joint efforts.

336
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:01,740
Xiaoyao and I

337
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:04,400
were able to safely escape
from the Demon-Locking Tower

338
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:08,130
because Yueru

339
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,370
sacrificed her life.

340
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:16,460
She

341
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,980
is forever with us.

342
00:27:32,410 --> 00:27:33,460
Then let us

343
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,060
drink with Yueru.

344
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:56,250
I, Lin Yueru, want to be a heroine
admired across the martial world.

345
00:27:56,250 --> 00:28:00,340
I, Li Xiaoyao, want to be a hero
admired by all.

346
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,860
We shall live happily and safely!

347
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,370
From now on,

348
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,940
you will always
be my good friends, always.

349
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,410
Why haven't you left yet?

350
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,180
I don't want to see you.

351
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,370
My Lady,

352
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:28,500
my life is not important.

353
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:30,370
Please prioritize the bigger picture.

354
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,540
Tang Yu,

355
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,370
in the future, don't always
take yourself as a subordinate,

356
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,100
and don't call me "My Lady" anymore.

357
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,940
Just call me by my name.

358
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:41,780
A'nu.

359
00:29:43,370 --> 00:29:44,210
From now on,

360
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:46,500
you are my only good friend.

361
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:53,010
Whether it's tomorrow
or every day after,

362
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:54,740
just be by my side.

363
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:00,860
Luojiao!

364
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,340
It's because I trusted him.

365
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,980
Why did I fall for him? Why?

366
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:12,130
We will always be together,

367
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,740
always.

368
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,210
Xiaoyao,

369
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,700
if we put these two bells on Yiru,

370
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:07,100
won't she look adorable?

371
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,300
Ling'er,

372
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:18,290
why did you make so many all at once?

373
00:31:21,410 --> 00:31:22,250
These

374
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,290
are all gifts I've prepared for Yiru.

375
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,460
Gifts for her hundred days celebration

376
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,890
and for her first birthday.

377
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:32,820
For each of her birthday

378
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:34,890
and every festival,

379
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:38,580
I plan to prepare gifts for her.

380
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:44,890
Well,

381
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:46,820
there's no need to prepare so early.

382
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:50,100
Why not make them when the time comes?

383
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,580
Xiaoyao,

384
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,130
I just want to have everything ready
in advance.

385
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,940
Ling'er,

386
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,250
you...

387
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,460
I never thought

388
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,890
that one day

389
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,410
I could also live

390
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,370
the life of an ordinary person,

391
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,450
supporting a husband
and raising children.

392
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,410
Even if it's just for a moment,

393
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:33,100
I am completely content.

394
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,340
Ling'er, what are you thinking?

395
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,580
In the future,

396
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:50,370
I don't want to be a great hero anymore.

397
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:54,010
Let's live the life of ordinary people.

398
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:57,500
Our good days

399
00:32:58,530 --> 00:32:59,370
are long ahead of us.

400
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,940
I will keep our family's situation

401
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:22,940
firmly in my heart.

402
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:32,850
Xiaoyao,

403
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:35,340
if you

404
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,130
have any worries,

405
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,740
you can talk to me.

406
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:42,370
Nothing of the sort.

407
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,370
Really?

408
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:48,210
Really.

409
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,340
Don't overthink it.

410
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,010
Ling'er,

411
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:56,610
once everything is settled in Nanzhao,

412
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,620
we'll take Yiru

413
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,620
back to Fairy Island together,

414
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:03,170
away from worldly affairs.

415
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,460
We could also go back to Yuhang first

416
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,060
and stay with Auntie for a while.

417
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:15,300
Auntie would definitely be very happy

418
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,540
to know we've had a child.

419
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,060
Xiaoyao.

420
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:31,380
When the time comes,

421
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,700
we'll live

422
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:35,610
wherever you want us to.

423
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:37,540
We can go to Suzhou City,

424
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:39,540
Yangzhou City,

425
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,910
and see the revolving
scenic lanterns you love.

426
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,740
We'll travel the world

427
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,720
and appreciate the beautiful sights.

428
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,220
You'll watch Yiru

429
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,370
grow up slowly.

430
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,370
You'll watch her

431
00:35:00,130 --> 00:35:01,260
find the person she loves,

432
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:07,860
get married,

433
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:11,100
start a family,

434
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,330
and live a peaceful

435
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:19,940
and joyful life.

436
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,450
Yiru,

437
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,780
you must listen carefully
to the Sacred Maid.

438
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,140
Yiru,

439
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,060
I will

440
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,020
come back.

441
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,060
Be very careful

442
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,780
on this journey.

443
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,810
We will wait for you here.

444
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:45,860
Master,

445
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,300
we are leaving now.

446
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,650
Ling'er, we stay here.

447
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,900
You go into the Temple
to get the Heavenly Snake Cane now.

448
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,220
Child, you have come.

449
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,380
Goddess Nuwa,

450
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:28,980
please tell me

451
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:32,890
how exactly to stop Bai Yue

452
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:34,980
and save the people of Nanzhao.

453
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,700
The mortal world
is filled with illusions.

454
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,460
All laws are empty,

455
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:40,810
except for the law of cause and effect.

456
00:39:41,650 --> 00:39:43,810
Only the utmost good of human nature

457
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:47,260
can counteract the utmost evil.

458
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:49,010
The utmost good?

459
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,410
The utmost evil?

460
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,980
Love is hard to sustain.

461
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,410
There are threats everywhere,
while some are just like the morning dew.

462
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:59,450
Child,

463
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,410
I hope you can continue

464
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,020
to bear the responsibility
of the Nuwa clan.

465
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,250
Goddess Nuwa,

466
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,300
I am aware of my responsibility

467
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:08,570
and am prepared.

468
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:09,730
Child,

469
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,260
I will pass the spirit spells to you.

470
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:14,980
The responsibility
to eliminate suffering in the world

471
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:17,330
and rekindle hope

472
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:21,060
now rests on your shoulders.

473
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:22,540
I understand.

474
00:40:44,570 --> 00:40:45,740
It's the Sacred Mantle

475
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,440
and the Heavenly Snake Cane.

476
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,620
Chief.

477
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,490
The Princess has gone
to the Temple of Nuwa with her men

478
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:38,730
and obtained the Heavenly Snake Cane.

479
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:39,700
Our men failed to stop them.

480
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,090
Where is the Princess now?

481
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:43,810
They headed towards the altar.

482
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:45,250
Good.

483
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,740
Also, Chief,

484
00:41:47,150 --> 00:41:48,600
the people,
hearing of the Princess's return,

485
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,260
are following her in droves.
I am worried...

486
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:51,330
Worried about what?

487
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,260
A bunch of fools?

488
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,170
You may leave.

489
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,340
Yes.

490
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:13,060
Just one step away.

491
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,460
When you re-emerge,

492
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:19,330
