= Episode 16=

3
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,040
Xiaoyao, be careful!

4
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,820
Ling'er!

5
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,020
Li, to fight me,

6
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,040
you're still too inexperienced.

7
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:10,400
Who?

8
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,410
The mantis stalks the cicada,

9
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,200
unaware of the oriole behind.

10
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,130
Let's find the Governor's lost bead now

11
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,200
to save the savage girl.

12
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,380
What's that sound?

13
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,280
It should be inside.

14
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,450
Follow me closely.

15
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,120
This is the Spiritual Bead?

16
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,720
The Phoenix.

17
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:39,940
(Golden-winged Phoenix)

18
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,860
Ling'er, be careful!

19
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:41,900
Where did this demon come from?

20
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:42,920
You're the demon here!

21
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,380
I am the ancient mythical beast,
the Golden-winged Phoenix.

22
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,250
You mortals
should kneel before me at once.

23
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,810
Quite the big talk for such a small girl.

24
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,840
You, you, you're infuriating me!

25
00:03:57,490 --> 00:03:58,450
Little phoenix,

26
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:00,090
why are you here?

27
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,490
Our phoenix clan,
every five hundred years,

28
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,740
or after suffering a major injury,

29
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,920
would undergo nirvana,

30
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,660
rebirthing into an egg to hibernate,

31
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,330
awakening only
with the aid of spiritual power.

32
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,380
But why do you possess

33
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,030
the aura of the Spiritual Beads?

34
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,600
That's because
our phoenix's spiritual power

35
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,460
originates from the same source
as the Spiritual Beads.

36
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:17,210
For thousands of years,

37
00:04:17,210 --> 00:04:19,260
we have been blessed
by the Beads' energy for cultivation,

38
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,320
so I carry its aura.

39
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:24,970
From now on, you're my master.

40
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,730
Feels like you're trying
to pull a fast one on us.

41
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:33,490
Why am I your master?

42
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:35,810
It's a predestined response
passed down through bloodlines.

43
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,880
When I say it's you, it's you.

44
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:40,170
At such a young age,

45
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,890
and yet, no cuteness at all.

46
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,260
What do you mean by "young age"?

47
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,970
I'm thousands of years old, you know?

48
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:46,690
Such an ignorant human.

49
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,690
Little phoenix,

50
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:51,330
are you really willing to come with us?

51
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,820
It was you who revived me.

52
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,160
Of course, I'll follow you.

53
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,740
(Yamen of Yangzhou City)

54
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:24,890
Yueru!

55
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,290
- Yueru!
- Jinyuan!

56
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,940
I have come to get you out.

57
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,690
Quick, open the door, open the door!

58
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,890
You two,

59
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:34,570
we indeed wronged you earlier.

60
00:05:34,890 --> 00:05:37,490
The Governor has ordered me
to apologize on his behalf,

61
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,960
and he'll express
his apologies personally

62
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,690
after dealing with the female thief.

63
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:44,090
Miss Lin, I have also prepared a brazier
especially for you,

64
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,570
to purge and ward off evil.

65
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,480
If she doesn't take this out,

66
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,570
the consequences are unthinkable.

67
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,660
Scholar,

68
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,360
there's something else
I wish to inquire about.

69
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:05,610
Please, go ahead.

70
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:06,890
Are you

71
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:08,530
truly the Common Hermit?

72
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,660
Ling'er!

73
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,730
- Ling'er!
- Yueru!

74
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,660
Yueru,

75
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,690
it's such a relief you're safe.

76
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,090
Ling'er, we have finally found you.

77
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:49,580
You left without saying a word.

78
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,010
We were really worried about you.

79
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,410
Yueru, I'm sorry

80
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,130
for making you come
to Yangzhou City for me.

81
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,250
It's not your fault.

82
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,530
I blame that silly rat Li Xiaoyao.

83
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,980
It's all his fault.

84
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,330
How is this related to me?

85
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,440
Of course, it's related.

86
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:05,890
If your martial arts weren't so weak,

87
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:06,980
unable to catch the female thief,

88
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:08,130
I wouldn't have been captured.

89
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:10,810
If you hadn't covered my face,
could she have escaped?

90
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,730
Besides, haven't I caught the thief now?

91
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,730
You took your sweet time catching her

92
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,010
and made me wait so long inside.

93
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,170
Don't even start it.
You seem to be in good spirits.

94
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:21,820
The prison food must be quite nourishing.

95
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,250
- You!
- Why start fighting right after getting out?

96
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:28,320
Jinyuan, I heard
you caught the female thief.

97
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,260
All thanks to Li...

98
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,480
I knew it.

99
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,730
Some people
just don't have the brains for it.

100
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,180
Let's go, Ling'er, ignore him.

101
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,330
Let's check out the female thief

102
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:39,010
that Jinyuan caught.

103
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,210
Scholar, you really need to talk
to your cousin.

104
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,550
If it weren't for me
jumping into the well,

105
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,600
that female thief
wouldn't have escaped from it.

106
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,040
Thanks to your inability to fight,

107
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,600
I was able to catch the female thief.

108
00:07:54,450 --> 00:07:55,690
Let's clear this up!

109
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,530
I have done what needed to be done.

110
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:08,690
Don't come looking for me again.

111
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,450
Your Majesty,

112
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:22,820
the people I dispatched

113
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,360
have found the Princess's whereabouts.

114
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,700
Where is she now?

115
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,970
The Princess is in Yangzhou City.

116
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,250
Send your men to bring her back now.

117
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:33,290
Your Majesty,
I wish to pick up the Princess myself.

118
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,970
Good, I'll feel more at ease if you go.

119
00:08:36,290 --> 00:08:38,610
- Then...
- On this journey, besides that,

120
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,370
I have another important task
to accomplish.

121
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,820
My men have secretly discovered

122
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,580
the whereabouts
of the Witch Queen's statue

123
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,290
at the direction of Yunmeng Marsh.

124
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,730
Qing'er's statue...

125
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,560
Yes. Ten years ago, because...

126
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,850
The Witch Queen turned into a statue

127
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,090
and vanished.

128
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:02,170
Due to a secret rumor,

129
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:03,090
for ten years,

130
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,640
I have never ceased searching for it.

131
00:09:06,530 --> 00:09:07,610
What rumor?

132
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:09,610
The Princess can use the statue

133
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:11,560
to bring the Witch Queen back to life.

134
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,850
Is this true?

135
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,850
The specifics are still unclear to me,

136
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:18,290
so I plan to take the Princess
to see the truth for ourselves.

137
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:21,200
Mr. Shi, you should depart
as soon as possible.

138
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,880
Yes, I shall take my leave.

139
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,410
Qing'er.

140
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,200

(Yamen of Yangzhou City)

142
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:38,440
Don't rush. Don't rush.

143
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,090
The female thief has been captured.

144
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,220
Everyone, please rest assured.

145
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:43,930
Rest assured, rest assured.

146
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:47,760
We will handle this. Rest assured.

147
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,170
Silence, silence, silence.

148
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

149
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,170
the Governor appreciates your efforts
in capturing the female thief

150
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,290
and has instructed me to wait here

151
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:01,320
to take you all to the back hall to rest.

152
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,490
Sir,

153
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,580
even though
the female thief has been caught,

154
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,320
the case has not yet
been thoroughly reviewed.

155
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,610
As key witnesses,

156
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,800
we should be present during the trial.

157
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:14,640
Mr. Scholar, you need not worry,

158
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,200
nor does anyone else here need to.

159
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,490
The evidence is conclusive,

160
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:21,290
and the female thief will surely
not plead innocent anymore.

161
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,050
Let's all go to the back hall for tea.

162
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,120
We won't be kept from seeing the trial
if we want to.

163
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,730
Are you hiding something in your trial?

164
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:31,760
Of course not, of course not.

165
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,200
Then stop wasting time and step aside.

166
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,790
There must be something fishy.

167
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:44,860
(Impartial Enforcement,

168
00:10:50,970 --> 00:10:52,090
Who is there kneeling?

169
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,050
Who is there kneeling?

170
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,370
Are you speaking to me?

171
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,490
I thought you were performing an opera.

172
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:08,800
How bold, thief!

173
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,560
Today, you have been brought to justice,

174
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,730
yet you still refuse
to confess your crimes?

175
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,090
It's you who should be confessing.

176
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:17,780
Absurd!

177
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,880
What crimes have I committed?

178
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,240
And what crimes have I committed, then?

179
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,610
Let me ask you.

180
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,490
On the sixth day
of the first lunar month this year,

181
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:30,050
in Su Mansion's backyard garden
in the northern city,

182
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:31,410
a pot of gold was replaced

183
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,530
with urine and feces.

184
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,680
Was that your doing?

185
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,200
It's hilarious.

186
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,970
That old man Su

187
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:40,760
buried his gold underground,

188
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:42,880
clearly indicating he didn't need it.

189
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,940
I merely took it out

190
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,200
and distributed it to those in need.

191
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:47,780
What wrong have I done?

192
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,620
You...

193
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:50,940
Since you remain unrepentant,

194
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,490
there's no need for further trial.

195
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:55,090
Sign the confession and be taken to jail.

196
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,250
Sir.

197
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,780
Sir,

198
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,490
I believe, today,

199
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:07,680
besides reviewing past cases,

200
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:11,930
investigating the Treasure Pavilion theft
is the focus.

201
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,000
Mr. Scholar,

202
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,680
as for the Treasure Pavilion theft,

203
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,970
everyone present is very clear

204
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:20,120
about the facts.

205
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,200
There's really nothing left
to interrogate her about.

206
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,970
I haven't even started confessing.

207
00:12:26,970 --> 00:12:28,440
What are you so anxious about?

208
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:30,370
Let me ask you.

209
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:31,850
Don't you want to know

210
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,290
where your bead is?

211
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,560
Where is my bead?

212
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:41,050
Confess honestly.

213
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:42,490
I will confess.

214
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:43,930
Don't worry.

215
00:12:44,970 --> 00:12:46,490
But I wonder

216
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,650
why are you only concerned
about your bead,

217
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:51,170
and not about others' treasures?

218
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,370
I...

219
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,800
Sir, something's wrong.

220
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,530
All treasures on the second floor,

221
00:13:01,530 --> 00:13:03,940
including your bead, have all been lost!

222
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,800
What?

223
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,560
We need not inquire further.

224
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:12,340
I have sent people to your hideout
to recover the stolen goods.

225
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,290
The whereabouts of all treasures

226
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,900
will soon be revealed.

227
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,740
Alright.

228
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,780
Let's wait and see

229
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:23,610
how the truth unveils.

230
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:25,890
Sir,

231
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,930
this thief shows no remorse
before the law,

232
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,800
attempting to confuse and delay us.

233
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:34,730
We must not be deceived by her.

234
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:36,680
We shall execute her at once.

235
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,300
Execute?

236
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,490
You wish to kill
without a thorough investigation,

237
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,410
eager to silence someone?

238
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,680
Your accusations are baseless.

239
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,260
Guards, guards, guards!

240
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,320
Take her away!

241
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,490
Yes, sir.

242
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:50,980
Wait.

243
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,410
The stolen goods have been inventoried.

244
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,060
Sir,

245
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,200
all the stolen goods attributed to the thief
have been recovered.

246
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:05,650
However, when the owners
came to identify their property,

247
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,000
they found none of their belongings.

248
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,610
Who allowed them
to identify their belongings?

249
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,930
She...

250
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,780
She must have accomplices.

251
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,440
Those treasures
must be with her accomplices.

252
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,200
Haven't you heard

253
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,410
similar words before?

254
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:36,410
The person posing as a scholar
during the day

255
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:38,380
must be your accomplice.

256
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,170
Those treasures must be hidden by him.

257
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,880
Now that the stolen goods
have been recovered,

258
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,610
with both testimonial
and physical evidence,

259
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,780
the verdict in this case can be pronounced.

260
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:49,620
Wait.

261
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:51,170
Mr. Scholar,

262
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,640
do you still have objections?

263
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,090
Sir, according to trial procedures,

264
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,240
you need to interrogate her
about how she committed the crime,

265
00:14:58,490 --> 00:15:01,240
make her sign the confession,
and then you may deliver the verdict.

266
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,730
Mr. Scholar,

267
00:15:03,650 --> 00:15:05,370
everything is already clear.

268
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:07,580
She even tried to frame you.

269
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,370
The Governor is also trying
to seek justice for you.

270
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,490
What a joke!

271
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,050
At most, I'm guilty of framing them.

272
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:17,490
But you aim to take their lives.

273
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:20,260
Nonsense!

274
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,780
Take her away, take her away!

275
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:22,970
Sir, what's the rush?

276
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:24,410
Could there be another hidden agenda?

277
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,490
Let's just listen to her.

278
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,850
If she's making it all up,

279
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,000
she'll expose herself soon enough.

280
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:44,370
Sir,

281
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,470
if one's conscience is clear,
one needs not fear their shadow slanting.

282
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:48,640
She's just a female thief.
You're not intimidated by her, are you?

283
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,010
Fine.

284
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,970
Since you all want to hear,

285
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,120
I'll continue to "make it up".

286
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,560
This honorable Governor here

287
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,650
pretentiously held

288
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:00,560
a so-called Treasure Appraisal Gathering,

289
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,640
but in reality, it was his plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

290
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:08,530
Firstly, he intended to embezzle
a large portion of the donations.

291
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,370
Secondly, he spread
the word about his bead

292
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:13,460
to attract competitive participants,

293
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,790
bringing their treasures for display,

294
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,240
while he coveted their possessions.

295
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,560
Even without me,

296
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,200
he would have found a way

297
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,930
to have these treasures stolen

298
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,140
and then place the blame on me.

299
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,700
You're slandering!

300
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Take her away, take her away!

301
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,540
- Yes, sir!
- Sir.

302
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:34,490
She hasn't finished her story.

303
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:38,170
I believe she'll expose
her own lies soon.

304
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,170
Sir, you need not worry.

305
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,090
We won't allow her

306
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:43,940
to cause chaos in court.

307
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:45,610
Will we?

308
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,120
Well, who knows?

309
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,140
What happened next

310
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,850
is probably already known to all.

311
00:16:54,970 --> 00:16:56,200
I steal openly,

312
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,000
but they rob in the dark.

313
00:16:59,290 --> 00:17:01,120
Compared to their massive corruption,

314
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,580
what I have stolen is trivial,

315
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:04,680
a drop in the ocean.

316
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,920
Besides, there are rules to stealing.

317
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,340
Everything I took

318
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:11,890
was to rob the rich to aid the poor.

319
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,700
Even if that's the case,

320
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:14,920
it's still theft.

321
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,250
You, you...

322
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,090
Let me ask you.

323
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,090
Did you steal from others?

324
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:21,780
I did.

325
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,420
So what?

326
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,800
Stealing is stealing after all.

327
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:27,410
The things I have stolen...

328
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:29,160
Sir, why the hesitation?

329
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,010
The criminal has confessed.

330
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,680
Why not deliver the verdict now?

331
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,680
Jinyuan, what are you doing?

332
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,970
Mr. Scholar is right.

333
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,400
Robbing the rich
to aid the poor is one thing.

334
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:52,850
Stealing and framing others is another.

335
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:54,530
We can't just let her off

336
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,200
because she robbed the rich
to aid the poor, right?

337
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,160
Exactly, exactly.

338
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,920
You two really

339
00:18:05,170 --> 00:18:06,730
understand the essence of justice.

340
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:11,160
Now that the facts
of this case are clear,

341
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:13,000
(Writ of Yangzhou City Yamen)
and the criminal

342
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,920
has confessed.

343
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,890
According to the law,

344
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,610
the criminal will first be detained.

345
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,370
The case will be reported to the court.

346
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,860
After verification,

347
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:23,160
she'll be executed immediately.

348
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:31,730
Wait.

349
00:18:58,530 --> 00:18:59,650
I thought

350
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,920
you might be
deceived by the female thief.

351
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:04,620
But it turns out,

352
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:07,200
you're such role models

353
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:10,770
in discerning right from wrong.

354
00:19:10,770 --> 00:19:12,010
You're flattering us.

355
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,770
You two cleared our names.

356
00:19:14,770 --> 00:19:16,040
What I did

357
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,010
was merely my duty.

358
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:22,010
What a duty!

359
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,410
Today... It's getting late.

360
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,970
Tomorrow, at my residence,
I'll prepare a modest banquet

361
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:30,970
to properly host you.

362
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,920
Please be sure
to honor us with your presence.

363
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:34,850
Farewell.

364
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,440
What are you two doing?

365
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,370
Even I can see there's something off
with that Governor.

366
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,440
Why are you helping him?

367
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,370
Ling'er, Yangzhou City is bustling.

368
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,210
Let me take you around.

369
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:52,890
Let's go.

370
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:56,460
Scholar...

371
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:00,680
I'm done playing along.

372
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,400
Let's go. Let's also take a stroll.

373
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,970
- Yueru.
- You,

374
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:07,060
come with me.

375
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,050
Xiaoyao.

376
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,290
This is where I live.

377
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,130
Come on in.

378
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,180
Ling'er,

379
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,010
I can't believe we were living
right next to each other.

380
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,860
I'm so silly.

381
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,090
I didn't even think to shout out.

382
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,010
That way, you would have known
I was looking for you.

383
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:34,770
Xiaoyao,

384
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,680
it's all my fault.

385
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,410
It's okay.

386
00:20:39,410 --> 00:20:40,730
I have found you now, haven't I?

387
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,850
From now on,

388
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,440
you can't get rid of me.

389
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:46,420
Even if you won't take me,

390
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,770
I still need to go to Nanzhao.

391
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:50,700
Why?

392
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,770
Ji Sanniang told me

393
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,850
my parents are also in Nanzhao.

394
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,520
And they...

395
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,090
They died there.

396
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,280
That can't be true.

397
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,130
She must be trying to distract you,

398
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:12,250
so she could escape.

399
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,700
I also think she was lying.

400
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:16,200
My parents must be safe and sound.

401
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,210
So,

402
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,650
even if you avoid me, I have no choice

403
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:25,770
but to accompany you.

404
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,130
Ling'er,

405
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,320
I have a gift for you.

406
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:39,650
I bought it when Scholar and I

407
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,890
were investigating the female thief
at the rouge shop.

408
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,970
Not that I just happened to buy it,

409
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,650
nor is it...

410
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,240
Anyway, I bought it especially for you.

411
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,820
It just so happened
that day at the rouge shop.

412
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:52,660
Or rather...

413
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,520
What am I even saying?

414
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,420
Thank you,

415
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:06,650
Xiaoyao.

416
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,580
I...

417
00:22:14,010 --> 00:22:15,280
You haven't even looked at it yet.

418
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,280
I don't know if you'll like it.

419
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:25,970
I like it.

420
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,170
Ling'er, Ling'er, why are you crying?

421
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:32,650
Is it the color that's wrong?

422
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,040
Well, Scholar...

423
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,490
He said he knows about rouge.

424
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,250
Ling'er, don't cry.

425
00:22:38,530 --> 00:22:40,250
I'll go buy another one for you tomorrow.

426
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,200
Xiaoyao,

427
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
so much has happened

428
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:50,770
before.

429
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:53,400
I didn't know what to do,

430
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,250
so...

431
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,160
I had no choice but to leave.

432
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,610
Can you explain everything now?

433
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,050
Why are you looking at me like that?

434
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:35,890
Just speak.

435
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,850
Why are you so angry?

436
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,520
Because you can't tell right from wrong
and helped the oppressor.

437
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,610
What were you even thinking?

438
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,130
Isn't there any other reason?

439
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,970
What other reason could there be?

440
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:06,920
Then, Yueru, what are your plans?

441
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,210
Plans?

442
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:11,610
What plans?

443
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:15,010
Li and Miss Zhao have reunited.

444
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,370
They are surely going to set off together.
What about you?

445
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:19,010
Of course, I'm going with them.

446
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,860
I am determined to make my mark
in the martial world

447
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:27,920
to become a heroine.

448
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:29,250
No other thoughts.

449
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,700
Ah, stop it.

450
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:41,770
Let's get back to the main topic.

451
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,160
Why did you help that corrupt official?

452
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,780
Here's the thing.

453
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:58,770
Move them out now.

454
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,040
The sooner, the better.

455
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:01,460
Yes, yes, yes.

456
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,090
I understand.

457
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,340
I understand.

458
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,340
Miss Lin.

459
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,520
What are you doing here?

460
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:19,250
I am here to tally
the disaster relief funds for the people.

461
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,850
It's over now.

462
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,850
There are a total
of 56 boxes of silver.

463
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,890
Sir, you're here.

464
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,480
(Copper and Tin, Ceramics, Stationery, Leather)
Sir,

465
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:36,890
the disaster relief funds you have raised
for the people of Yangzhou

466
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:38,130
are indeed substantial.

467
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:40,730
Mr. Scholar,

468
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:42,440
what are you doing here?

469
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:44,320
I thought

470
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,730
in the past few days,

471
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,620
you're between the drought in Yangzhou

472
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,170
and the female thief problem.

473
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:51,130
You have been exhausted
mentally and physically.

474
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:52,500
Seeing this,

475
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,370
I felt I needed to help share the burden,

476
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,370
so I came to the warehouse overnight

477
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,610
to help tally the disaster relief funds.

478
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:00,850
I acted without prior consent.

479
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,770
I hope you don't mind.

480
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,130
No, no.

481
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:06,770
Sorry to trouble you.

482
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,610
Since the funds have been tallied,

483
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,860
and it's you who did it, Mr. Scholar,

484
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,580
there must be no mistake.

485
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:21,340
You have had a hard night.

486
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:24,090
Why not come to the front hall
for a cup of tea?

487
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,040
- Have a cup of tea, please.
- Let's go, let's go.

488
00:26:28,650 --> 00:26:31,530
You said that silly rat
understood your intentions.

489
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,400
I think he completely misunderstood.

490
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:36,170
Li seemed smart,

491
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,040
but I didn't expect him

492
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,300
to be just a facade.

493
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,490
This way, please, this way.

494
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,800
You're leaving?

495
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,560
Aren't you going to check the items
in this secret chamber?

496
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:55,090
Look, there are still
many items in the back.

497
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:01,850
Well...

498
00:27:03,010 --> 00:27:04,860
The Governor also only discovered
these treasures

499
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,730
of the Treasure Pavilion last night.

500
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,860
That's right.

501
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,980
They were stored in the secret chamber

502
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,440
just to prevent any mishaps.

503
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,800
We're just waiting for today

504
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:17,010
to notify the owners
to come and claim them.

505
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,560
I see.

506
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:28,940
Li Xiaoyao,

507
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,040
what are you doing here?

508
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:33,090
Here's the thing.

509
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,800
The Governor has been exhausted

510
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,500
from dealing with the thief
and the drought.

511
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,700
I, seeing this, couldn't bear it,

512
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:41,770
so I felt obligated
to help alleviate his concerns.

513
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,700
That's why I came to the secret chamber.

514
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,540
Stop babbling.

515
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,460
When did you get here?

516
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:46,490
Much earlier.

517
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:47,820
I got to the warehouse first

518
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,500
and discovered
the secret chamber right away.

519
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,700
After tallying the secret chamber,

520
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,710
I planned to catch up on sleep
before tallying the warehouse.

521
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,010
Then, two fools

522
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,490
rushed to the warehouse,
wanting to tally as well.

523
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,730
Who are you calling fools?

524
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:02,440
Luckily, I arrived early,

525
00:28:02,650 --> 00:28:03,650
otherwise, these two fools

526
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,620
would have missed
the treasures you, the Governor,

527
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,920
had found with great effort,

528
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:10,100
which would have been
a huge disservice to your sincerity.

529
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,400
Isn't that right, sir?

530
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,770
Yes, yes, yes.

531
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:17,560
What do you mean by "yes"?

532
00:28:18,580 --> 00:28:21,010
Li Xiaoyao, don't flatter yourself.

533
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:23,290
I was clearly heading
to that secret chamber just now.

534
00:28:23,290 --> 00:28:25,010
Weren't you going
to the front hall for tea?

535
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,100
Which of your eyes
saw me heading for tea?

536
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,170
I didn't see it.

537
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,740
But bad eyesight
can't beat stubborn words.

538
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,090
- You!
- Alright, alright.

539
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:32,610
It's all for the people of Yangzhou.

540
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,970
For the people of Yangzhou.

541
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:38,010
Now that the warehouse
and the secret chamber

542
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,410
have been tallied,

543
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,050
shouldn't we distribute the relief funds

544
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:45,010
and return the treasures
to their owners next?

545
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,200
Of course, of course.

546
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:01,010
But notifying the people
about the huge sum of relief funds

547
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:04,040
will take some time.

548
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,410
Let us plan a bit more.

549
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:08,940
No need.
I have already notified the people.

550
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,280
They're on their way to the yamen now.

551
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,680
Then let's start
the distribution immediately.

552
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,090
You...

553
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,370
You actually...

554
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,860
Sir, you came to the warehouse today

555
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,200
presumably also
to start the relief distribution, right?

556
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:28,320
Rest assured.

557
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,460
I will surely report your actions

558
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:32,160
to the court

559
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:33,970
at the right time.

560
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:40,700
Exactly.

561
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,490
That was the plan.

562
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,180
Come on.

563
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,940
Open the granaries.

564
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,040
Start the relief!

565
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,460
Boring.

566
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,180
Yueru!

567
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,250
Scholar,

568
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:08,290
we really think alike.

569
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,520
But compared to me,
you're still a step behind.

570
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:14,160
Mr. Li, how could you
have notified the people

571
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:15,800
while staying in the secret chamber?

572
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,580
You guess.

573
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:25,090
What good news is this?

574
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,490
A great philanthropist indeed.

575
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,770
Everyone, please calm down, calm down.

576
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,490
We have an important announcement.

577
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:47,250
Sir,

578
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:49,340
it might be best

579
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,650
if you personally oversee this.

580
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,970
Your good deeds
will surely spread far and wide.

581
00:30:55,370 --> 00:30:57,200
As for how to phrase it,

582
00:30:58,410 --> 00:30:59,460
you know best.

583
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,300
Understood, understood.

584
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,520
Thank you, Mr. Scholar, for the reminder.

585
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,970
Fellow citizens,

586
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,890
the recent drought has brought
severe hardship to our people.

587
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,300
As your Governor,

588
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,850
I specifically organized
the Treasure Appraisal Gathering.

589
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,040
Thanks to everyone's efforts,

590
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:24,440
we captured the notorious female thief gang
that plagued the Jiangbei region.

591
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,160
As long as I serve

592
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:30,730
as the Governor of Yangzhou,

593
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:33,980
(Yamen of Yangzhou City)
I will not allow a single citizen

594
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,250
to go hungry

595
00:31:35,530 --> 00:31:37,410
or be without clothes.

596
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:40,130
The money is taken from people,
and will surely be used to benefit the people.

597
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,650
The Governor will ensure every penny

598
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,580
is spent on
the disaster-stricken populace.

599
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,800
Good!

600
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:48,250
The Governor

601
00:31:48,460 --> 00:31:50,320
has yet another surprise for everyone.

602
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:54,890
Mr. Scholar,

603
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:58,320
you have practically emptied my coffers.

604
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:01,770
Why didn't you mention
this good idea sooner?

605
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:04,770
Fellow citizens,

606
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,860
the Dragon Boat Festival is coming,

607
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:10,530
so the Governor has decided
to host a fireworks display

608
00:32:10,530 --> 00:32:11,740
to celebrate the festival

609
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,010
and share joy with the people.

610
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:14,560
Good!

611
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:15,890
- Good!
- Sir,

612
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,940
gathering the people together
for a lively event

613
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:20,130
will surely spread your good name
further and wider,

614
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:20,970
right?

615
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,130
Right.

616
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,650
Fellow citizens,

617
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,770
I have decided

618
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,160
to use my personal salary

619
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,340
to hold a fireworks display.

620
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,920
Good!

621
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,010
Line up, line up.

622
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:47,650
Don't rush, don't rush.

623
00:32:47,650 --> 00:32:49,700
Return the items
to their rightful owners.

624
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,650
Come, register, and record.

625
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,280
Sir, with such compassion for the people,

626
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,940
you'll surely succeed

627
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,850
in relieving the people in disaster
in Yangzhou City.

628
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:04,210
I have always been pained

629
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,130
by the suffering of the people.

630
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,370
The relief efforts

631
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,160
will be personally overseen by me,

632
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,980
ensuring not a single citizen suffers.

633
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:15,650
The female thief only committed theft.

634
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,250
Her crimes do not warrant death.

635
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,090
I will

636
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:19,370
re-evaluate

637
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:21,520
according to the law.

638
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,980
I will personally see to this matter,

639
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,650
assuming you will follow through
on your word.

640
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,320
You're flattering me.

641
00:33:40,170 --> 00:33:41,370
A simple task.

642
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,610
- Doing righteous things is quite nice.
- Slow down.

643
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:48,160
By the way, I wonder if any of the people
are from Yuhang.

644
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,580
If Auntie knew
how famous I have become,

645
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,560
she'd be overjoyed.

646
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,090
Wake up.

647
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:55,700
The Governor being so obedient

648
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,730
is all thanks to my cousin's
Letter for the Number One Scholar.

649
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,130
But the Governor and Secretary General

650
00:34:00,130 --> 00:34:01,370
are so scheming.

651
00:34:01,370 --> 00:34:02,850
We just took some wealth as punishment.

652
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,490
It seems too lenient.

653
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:08,010
That depends on the official response
from Scholar.

654
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,380
Here's the thing.

655
00:34:10,810 --> 00:34:12,570
If we were to report them
to the authorities,

656
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,690
firstly, it would take time
to judge the case,

657
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:17,700
and secondly, it would take time for the court

658
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,690
to appoint a new Governor
to familiarize with the situation.

659
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:20,780
All this would delay

660
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,130
the distribution of relief funds

661
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,240
to the people.

662
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,610
So, we let them oversee
the relief fund distribution.

663
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:30,450
Then I'll report everything
to the court afterward.

664
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:31,960
They will be dismissed

665
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:33,890
and investigated immediately.

666
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,980
You scholars indeed...

667
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,040
Don't flatter me.

668
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,000
Are tricky.

669
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:44,370
A'nu, your words resonate with me deeply.

670
00:34:44,370 --> 00:34:46,560
- You think so too?
- I have felt that way from the start.

671
00:34:47,980 --> 00:34:50,410
This time in Yangzhou City,
Scholar should be credited.

672
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,890
But next time we act covertly,

673
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:54,220
make sure to bring the right people,

674
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,480
or it might slow us down.

675
00:34:56,850 --> 00:34:57,690
Li Xiaoyao!

676
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,610
Alright, alright, alright. Stop arguing.

677
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,890
The successful resolution of this matter

678
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:03,330
is entirely the result

679
00:35:03,330 --> 00:35:04,800
of our joint efforts.

680
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,740
Mr. Liu, you're right.

681
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,090
Since we're all so happy,

682
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:11,090
why not take advantage
of tonight's fireworks display

683
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:14,090
to go to the lakeside pavilion,
enjoy some wine, and watch the fireworks

684
00:35:14,090 --> 00:35:15,210
to celebrate?

685
00:35:15,370 --> 00:35:16,460
- I agree.
- Good idea.

686
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:17,650
We can drink a few more

687
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:18,800
to celebrate our reunion.

688
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,090
But it's still early now.

689
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:24,610
Tang Yu and I plan
to stroll around Yangzhou City. Bye.

690
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,410
Ling'er, let's also go for a walk.

691
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,250
Sure.

692
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:31,490
Let's go.

693
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,170
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

694
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:44,320
Jinyuan, let's go shopping.

695
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:57,060
Catch it!

696
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,650
I just wanted to say
that no matter what happens,

697
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,690
don't leave me again.

698
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:11,450
Even if we face great difficulties,

699
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,930
we can solve them together.

700
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:16,690
Thank you,

701
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:17,890
Xiaoyao.

702
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:52,520
Welcome.

703
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,090
Bring out the most beautiful

704
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,330
and best clothes in your store for me.

705
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,520
Alright, just a moment.

706
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,780
This rouge pink

707
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:01,260
is the most fashionable color
in Yangzhou City right now.

708
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:03,960
It can highlight a lady's gentle
and lovely charm.

709
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,170
Not pretty.

710
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,500
Look at this one.

711
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,130
The bow design is cute and adorable.

712
00:37:12,130 --> 00:37:12,970
Not beautiful.

713
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,370
Miss, take a look at this one.

714
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:21,130
This is the most expensive one
in our store.

715
00:37:21,130 --> 00:37:22,940
I purchased it from the capital.

716
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,980
Wearing it can accentuate

717
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:27,020
- your extraordinary elegance.
- All not pretty.

718
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:28,560
Do you have anything else?
Bring them all out.

719
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:29,780
Miss,

720
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,460
these are the best clothes in our store.

721
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,570
If you still find them unappealing,

722
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:35,890
- take a look at these...
- This shop is a rip-off!

723
00:37:36,370 --> 00:37:37,680
Be careful or I'll tear this place apart!

724
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,810
What's she doing?

725
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:40,760
Sorry, sorry.

726
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,520
This has nothing to do with your clothes.

727
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,370
She's looking for something

728
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,280
that's indeed a bit hard to get.

729
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,700
But she can't speak to me like that.

730
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:50,540
Sorry.

731
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,890
Thank you, sir.

732
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,890
Miss, feel free to browse.

733
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,570
- This is so cute.
- Yes, they're all newly made.

734
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:06,800
That one is cute too.

735
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,820
We'll take them all.

736
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:10,720
Okay, okay, I'll wrap them up for you.

737
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,960
Tang Yu, thank you.

738
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:17,340
My Lady,
you don't have to be polite with me.

739
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:21,890
I told you before.

740
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,090
Once I figure out
what you should call me,

741
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,520
you won't have to call me
"My Lady" anymore.

742
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:31,040
And now I have figured it out.

743
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,210
What?

744
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,690
Just call me by my name.

745
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:44,040
Call me now.

746
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:49,620
A...

747
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,340
Next time.

748
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,580
Madam, here's the money.

749
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:05,410
Such a fool.

750
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,090
A'nu, slow down.

751
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,210
Tang Yu,
you finally called me by my name.

752
00:39:18,330 --> 00:39:20,000
Sounds pretty good.

753
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,650

Look, the phoenix fireworks
are flying away.
