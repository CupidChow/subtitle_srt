2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 13=

3
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,130
Stop there. Invitation, please.

4
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,720
What invitation?

5
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,300
Only those who donate a thousand guan
or present a valuable treasure

6
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,570
receive an invitation.

7
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,580
One per person.

8
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,810
A thousand guan?

9
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,280
One thousand guan.

10
00:02:07,810 --> 00:02:09,120
That's one thousand guan.

11
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,410
Is that a lot?

12
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:11,660
Yes.

13
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:12,610
A lot?

14
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,300
Sorry.

15
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,180
I forgot you all have rich fathers.

16
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,170
But now, I only have
one thousand guan left.

17
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,920
So, how should the three of us get in?

18
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,480
I have an idea.

19
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,560
We could take advantage
of the dark and windy night,

20
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,690
knock out the guards,

21
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:40,920
and then...

22
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,090
Jinyuan, you have changed.

23
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,250
Scholar,

24
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,200
you have picked up some bad habits.

25
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:55,890
There's a saying, "If you lie down with dogs,
you will get up with fleas."

26
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,660
Having been with you two for so long,

27
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:59,200
it's hard not to pick up a bit
of the worldly ways.

28
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,560
No need for the cover of darkness.
Let's go.

29
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:14,690
Back to the inn first.

30
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:18,360
I have a way to get us in
fair and square.

31
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,890
Here's the money, sir.

32
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,920
- Here, here, here.
- Stop there.

33
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,970
Invitation, please.

34
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:45,890
Let's go.

35
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,780
(Yangzhou suffers a disastrous drought;
The Governor leads by donating treasures)

36
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:51,250
It's fake.

37
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:55,360
Fake? How could it be? I paid for this.

38
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:56,820
You must have been scammed.

39
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,920
The real invitations
are made from a special paper

40
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:01,690
only available at the Treasure Pavilion.

41
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:06,410
The real invitation is right here.

42
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,360
Can we go in now?

43
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,130
Please, sir.

44
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,940
(Treasure Pavilion)

45
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,880
You look too much like a maid.

46
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,450
Come on.

47
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,640
This is your grand plan?

48
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,290
The young master
of a high-ranking official,

49
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:23,600
accompanied by his servant and maid,

50
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,020
attends the Treasure Appraisal Gathering.

51
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:25,970
Doesn't it make perfect sense?

52
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,820
Li Xiaoyao.

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:34,250
I notice you enjoy
playing the servant role.

54
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,730
Why not join us at Lin Fortress

55
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,920
to fill the vacancy left by Changgui?

56
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,420
I think this maid outfit

57
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,420
suits you well.

58
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,290
Why don't you come work
as a maid at our inn?

59
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,130
I...

60
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,050
Li.

61
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,420
Li.

62
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,540
How about that?

63
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,810
The young master has arrived.

64
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,600
Li, you flatter me.

65
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:55,450
Scholar,

66
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,760
you're too kind.

67
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,540
Plainness over literariness
leads to vulgarity,

68
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,390
while literariness over plainness
leads to pedantry.

69
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:03,970
But a gentleman

70
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,410
balances both.

71
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:07,260
Enough, stop.

72
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,480
I'm not complimenting you.

73
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,570
I'm saying you're doing it wrong.

74
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,920
Where did I go wrong?

75
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,250
Come, please.

76
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:22,770
Now I'm your servant.

77
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,210
She's your maid.

78
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,730
How can you be so polite to us?

79
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:26,890
You're our young master.

80
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,640
You should command us,
make us work for you.

81
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,250
If we don't act convincingly,
it could all be for nothing.

82
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,260
Right.

83
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:45,410
Jinyuan, you're good at acting.

84
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,890
Remember how well you pretended

85
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,410
to be sick at Baihe Fort?

86
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:50,380
Right.

87
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
Thanks for the reminder, Yueru.

88
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,920
Don't say thanks.

89
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:54,760
Here, let me show you how.

90
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,600
Little maid.

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,250
Come give me a foot massage.

92
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,480
Remember your role.

93
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,600
Here, here, sir.

94
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,410
- Please.
- Sit.

95
00:07:32,610 --> 00:07:33,570
Little...

96
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,730
maid.

97
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:41,420
Pour me a tea, please.

98
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,290
Don't say please.

99
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,130
Tea, now!

100
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:48,480
Who are you going to scare?
Be quieter. Go.

101
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,600
Do I have to sit like this?

102
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,090
You'll get used to it.

103
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:57,920
Let's try again.

104
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,970
Little maid.

105
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,090
Give me a shoulder massage.

106
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,610
Sir, invitation, please.

107
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:41,410
It's right here. Please check.

108
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,540
(Yangzhou suffers a disastrous drought;
The Governor leads by donating treasures)

109
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:49,970
You are?

110
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:52,050
I'm the young master's servant.

111
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,220
What are you looking at? I'm his maid!

112
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,060
This...

113
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,410
This is the maid?

114
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,760
The new maid in our house.

115
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,090
Where are your manners?

116
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:03,610
Hurry up and bow to the official.

117
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,530
If the young master's appraisal is delayed,
you'll be in trouble.

118
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,240
Can we go in now?

119
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
Please, sir.

120
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,500
(Treasure Pavilion)

121
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:34,050
Good thing you were quick-witted, sir.

122
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:35,380
Otherwise, we almost couldn't get in

123
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:37,530
because of this clueless maid.

124
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,120
- I...
- You're flattering me.

125
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,780
If it weren't for you

126
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,640
promptly pushing down the maid's head,

127
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:46,640
how could we
have turned danger into safety?

128
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,610
You two seem to get along well.

129
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,450
Yueru.

130
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,700
I don't think you have grasped

131
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,090
the maid's mindset.

132
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:01,650
Maybe I should teach you privately later.

133
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,970
Wait till I deal with you back home.

134
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,220
There are many people here.

135
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,060
Let's split up

136
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:06,940
and see if Ling'er is here.

137
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,410
- Alright.
- That's easy.

138
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:10,050
Just shout "Ling'er"
and see if she responds.

139
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,890
No, that won't do.

140
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:15,560
We don't know why Ling'er suddenly left.

141
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,410
If she's intentionally avoiding us,

142
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:18,760
calling out would just expose us.

143
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:21,450
Li...

144
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:23,200
The servant makes a good point.

145
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:27,290
Then what are we waiting for?
Let's split up and search.

146
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:36,410
How did you convince the guard

147
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,740
- to let us in?
- Phantom insects.

148
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,760
Phantom insects?

149
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,220
That's amazing.

150
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:42,450
Give me one.

151
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,370
Just put it in my little pouch, quick.

152
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:46,570
I have some,

153
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,240
but I can't give you any.

154
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:52,090
I'm your young master.
You have to listen to me.

155
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,200
Hurry, put it in.

156
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,120
I'll catch my own in Nanzhao.

157
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:02,800
What's so great about that?

158
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,730
Ling'er, have you seen
the Spiritual Bead?

159
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:09,980
No.

160
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,440
A'nu, is there any reaction
from the Sacred Spiritual Bead?

161
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:14,640
The Sacred Spiritual Bead
can only sense the general direction.

162
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,850
I don't know exactly where.

163
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:19,540
I heard the important treasures
are on the second floor.

164
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,240
Let's split up and search there.

165
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:23,800
Don't you think I know that?

166
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,370
Let's go.

167
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,740
Any luck?

168
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,860
No.

169
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:55,850
I didn't expect

170
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,090
we'd see the landscape painting
by Common Hermit here.

171
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,800
Truly a visit not wasted.

172
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,340
I heard

173
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,610
it's collected by the Secretary General
of the Governor.

174
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:07,320
He prides himself as the No.1 fan
of Common Hermit.

175
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,240
I see.

176
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:11,460
- I see.
- Look, Jin...

177
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,490
This mountain
is full of spiritual energy.

178
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,560
Great, isn't it?

179
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:17,850
Sir, let's go.

180
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:21,500
Such a treasure.

181
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,290
I heard the bead donated by the Governor
is on the second floor.

182
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,260
Shall we go see it now?

183
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,730
Yes, let's go.

184
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,010
Let's go.

185
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,780
The bead...

186
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,320
That's not yours, is it?

187
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,220
(Ji Sanniang)

188
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,320
To notice that,

189
00:12:53,730 --> 00:12:54,610
not bad.

190
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,930
Give it back.

191
00:12:58,090 --> 00:12:59,970
What if I don't?

192
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:08,240
Looks like we're like-minded.

193
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,880
But your technique

194
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:12,680
reminds me of someone I used to know.

195
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:25,880
You're really like him.

196
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,970
The Purple Gold Gourd
is indeed exquisite.

197
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,910
- Please, please.
- Yes, look.

198
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:37,640
It's very smooth.

199
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:40,170
- Truly a fine piece.
- You're too kind.

200
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,370
Such a fine item.

201
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:53,930
This bead

202
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,120
looks nothing

203
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:58,730
like the Earth Spiritual Bead.

204
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,100
But

205
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,410
why would
the Sacred Spiritual Bead react?

206
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,970
It suggests only one possibility.

207
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,490
This bead

208
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,410
has been in contact with
the Spiritual Bead for a long time,

209
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,200
absorbing its aura.

210
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,930
That's why the Sacred Spiritual Bead's
reaction is so weak.

211
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,370
This bead has been cherished
by the Governor for years.

212
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,470
If it has been in contact
with the Spiritual Bead,

213
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,970
it's very likely that the Spiritual Bead
is at the Governor's residence.

214
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,530
That's what I was thinking too.

215
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:29,560
Why didn't you say so earlier?

216
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:32,090
Because you beat me to it.

217
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:35,050
Do you know what we have to do now?

218
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,610
Head straight to the Governor's residence.

219
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:39,180
Quick!

220
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,050
Look, look over here, look!

221
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,200
Miss, I'm so sorry.

222
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,300
Are you alright?

223
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,530
I'm fine.

224
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,170
Be more careful when walking.

225
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,410
I'm really sorry.

226
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:07,250
It's okay.

227
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,440
Are you okay?

228
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,620
I'm fine.

229
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:13,780
Let's go.

230
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,940
Look at this.

231
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:18,250
It's so beautiful.

232
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,230
I have seen one before.

233
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,540
We have one just like it at home.

234
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,200
Let's visit your place someday.

235
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
Sure.

236
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:52,570
Li.

237
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,680
We have searched the entire first floor

238
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:56,120
and haven't found Ling'er.

239
00:15:57,610 --> 00:15:59,560
Let's go check near the Governor's bead.

240
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:01,010
Let's go.

241
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,160
- Help! Help!
- There's been a murder!

242
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,530
- Stop!
- Murder!

243
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,100
Stop!

244
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,930
Don't run!

245
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,200
Go away. Go away.

246
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:21,250
What's going on?

247
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,120
- Run!
- Quick, quick!

248
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:39,930
Hurry, hurry!

249
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:41,690
Hurry!

250
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,240
Everyone stay put!

251
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,130
Lock the door!

252
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:47,410
No one leaves!

253
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,280
Hurry up!

254
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,680
Let us out, please!

255
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,380
Yes, let us go!

256
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:53,220
Sir,

257
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,850
a woman in black attempted

258
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,850
to steal the bead.

259
00:16:55,850 --> 00:16:57,000
What's going on here?

260
00:16:58,730 --> 00:17:00,130
- Continue the search.
- Yes.

261
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,490
You.

262
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,530
Let me have a look.

263
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:07,650
It's not related to me.

264
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:10,250
- What's in your hand?
- Not me, not me.

265
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,090
Turn around.

266
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,580
You.

267
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,860
What's this?

268
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:14,700
Raise your arms.

269
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,100
Let me check the back, come here.

270
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,580
Let me have a look.

271
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:22,400
You, don't move to the back.

272
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,820
Sir,

273
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:24,860
we have searched everyone.

274
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:25,890
The woman hasn't been found.

275
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,320
The bead is still here.

276
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,200
Perhaps it was a false alarm.

277
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,130
Everyone can leave.
It's okay now. Nothing to worry about.

278
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:40,130
My gourd!

279
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,250
My gourd!

280
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,460
Sir,

281
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,820
my Purple Gold Gourd

282
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,770
has been stolen.

283
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:49,440
Sir, please do justice for me.

284
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,010
It must have been someone here
who stole it.

285
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,440
- Why point at me?
- Not me.

286
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,420
Her!

287
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,440
They stole it.

288
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,610
What?

289
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,280
Nonsense, what are you talking about?

290
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,460
(Treasure Pavilion)
Move aside, move aside!

291
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,250
Let through, let through, let through!

292
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:13,370
Move! Move!

293
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,220
What happened?

294
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,800
Why are there so many officers
all of a sudden?

295
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:22,940
Sir,

296
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,130
it was them,

297
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,090
especially her.

298
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,220
She coveted
my Purple Gold Gourd yesterday

299
00:18:28,230 --> 00:18:30,500
(Prefectural Governor of Yangzhou City)
and came disguised today

300
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,370
to the appraisal event.

301
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:33,730
She's clearly after my Purple Gold Gourd.

302
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:35,770
Yueru... Maid, show some respect!

303
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:37,680
The Governor is here.

304
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:39,160
He will make his own judgment.

305
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:40,890
Rest assured.

306
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,920
I will surely catch the thief.

307
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,540
Of course,

308
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:50,040
I won't wrong a single innocent person.

309
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,440
Now, we're at an impasse.

310
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,560
How about this? Sorry to trouble you.

311
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:57,250
Please cooperate with the officers

312
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:58,680
and allow a search.

313
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,200
This gentleman,

314
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,610
what do you say?

315
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,620
It makes sense.

316
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,730
We will certainly cooperate.

317
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,610
Everything is up to your judgment.

318
00:19:15,170 --> 00:19:16,560
I dare anyone to touch me.

319
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,100
I said I didn't steal, and I meant it.

320
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:18,940
Sir,

321
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,090
she's clearly guilty of thievery.

322
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:23,280
Miss,

323
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:25,560
it was my oversight.

324
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:27,770
Go to the residence

325
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:29,650
and bring some maids here.

326
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,250
Yes.

327
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,730
Sir, the search has concluded
without finding anything.

328
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:48,040
This gathering here

329
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,160
claims to be appraising treasures,

330
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,680
but in reality, it's for disaster relief.

331
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,540
Now,

332
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:56,400
with the treasure gone,

333
00:19:57,290 --> 00:19:58,650
I bear the responsibility

334
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,200
to thoroughly investigate this matter.

335
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,920
The clear shall clear themselves;
the guilty shall reveal themselves.

336
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,340
Therefore, I ask everyone

337
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:09,610
to cooperate with the officials here

338
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,130
for a body search.

339
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:12,040
Any inconvenience caused,

340
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:15,520
please forgive us.

341
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,610
Sir, we will fully cooperate.

342
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:20,200
- We'll cooperate, cooperate.
- No problem.

343
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:21,780
Come.

344
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,730
Please cooperate.

345
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:26,680
- Turn around.
- Turn around.

346
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,090
You search over there.

347
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:31,700
Come here.

348
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:38,620
(Fu Chun Inn)

349
00:20:42,050 --> 00:20:42,890
Ling'er,

350
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,490
your hair tie is missing.

351
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,730
I must have lost it
at the Treasure Pavilion.

352
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,740
It's just a hair tie.

353
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,860
No need to go back for it, right?

354
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,800
That's not an ordinary hair tie, it's...

355
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,090
A'nu,

356
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,320
you're right.

357
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,440
It's just a hair tie.

358
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,180
Sir,

359
00:21:20,370 --> 00:21:22,010
all men here have been searched,

360
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,250
and the Purple Gold Gourd was not found.

361
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,340
Understood.

362
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,250
Sir, the maids have arrived.

363
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,010
Please search thoroughly.

364
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,010
If nothing is found,

365
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:42,440
I will have someone be punished today.

366
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,280
Well... Well...

367
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,370
How is it?

368
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:51,740
Do you have anything to say?

369
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,920
I truly lost it, the Purple Gold Gourd.

370
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,010
Sir, please stick to the truth.

371
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,680
Hair tie, oh hair tie,

372
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:05,770
thanks to you, I saw Ling'er again.

373
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,180
Sir,

374
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,580
this person, in public,

375
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:13,890
without any evidence,

376
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,940
repeatedly accuses us

377
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,580
of stealing his worthless gourd.

378
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,560
Please stick to the truth.

379
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,440
Punish him for falsely accusing others.

380
00:22:20,370 --> 00:22:22,680
Everyone, please calm down.

381
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,040
Miss,

382
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:27,200
everyone willing to donate treasures

383
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,650
is a benefactor to Yangzhou City.

384
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:31,250
And him,

385
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,800
losing his treasure

386
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,250
is indeed my personal responsibility.

387
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,200
If you are truly unsatisfied,

388
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,610
I am willing

389
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:44,160
to apologize to you.

390
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,160
Absolutely not.

391
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,010
You're right.

392
00:22:48,170 --> 00:22:50,090
My servants and I have no objections.

393
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,540
No objections.

394
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,040
Thank you, sir.

395
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:59,040
All the ladies present, please understand

396
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,090
and cooperate with the search.

397
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,370
Perhaps,

398
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:31,370
it's fate.

399
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,730
Ling'er.

400
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,500
You're okay, right?

401
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,340
I'm fine.

402
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:45,730
Really?

403
00:23:47,770 --> 00:23:49,200
Good, good.

404
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,010
I'm just

405
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,970
tired from traveling today
and want to rest.

406
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:58,170
Let's not visit
the Governor's residence tonight.

407
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,370
We'll go tomorrow, is that okay?

408
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,210
Okay.

409
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,250
We'll do as you say.

410
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:02,850
You should rest early too.

411
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,490
Sir, the Purple Gold Gourd was not found.

412
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:28,580
My... My Purple Gold Gourd, how could it...

413
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:30,370
How could it disappear itself?

414
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:33,850
Sir,

415
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,560
please do justice for me.

416
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:42,740
Found it, found it!

417
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:43,730
Where was it?

418
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,010
Where was it found?

419
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,860
Sir, I found the Purple Gold Gourd
in a corner near the window,

420
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,520
as if someone had taken it there.

421
00:24:58,370 --> 00:25:00,280
Is this your Purple Gold Gourd?

422
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:01,860
Indeed, indeed.

423
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,800
Thank you, sir.

424
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,730
What a false alarm.

425
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,680
Sorry to have startled you.

426
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,890
But,

427
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,850
you have wronged these guests.

428
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,250
Sorry,

429
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,400
sorry.

430
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,010
I was shortsighted

431
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,280
and misunderstood the three of you.

432
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:27,680
What kind of treasure is that?

433
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:29,010
It's just a worthless gourd.

434
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,440
What's so special about it?

435
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,370
- Sir.
- Yes?

436
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:39,200
I just want to take my gourd
and leave now.

437
00:25:40,170 --> 00:25:41,410
After this ordeal,

438
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:43,860
I can't take it anymore.

439
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,970
That makes sense.

440
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,370
Yes, with so many people here,

441
00:25:47,370 --> 00:25:49,010
it's better to be safe than sorry.

442
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,770
Everyone, everyone,

443
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:55,650
the time of the appraisal event given

444
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,170
by the Governor is three days.

445
00:25:58,170 --> 00:25:59,010
Now,

446
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:01,680
all the invitations have been sold,

447
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:06,050
and the funds raised will soon be distributed
to the suffering victims.

448
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:08,520
If everyone leaves
with their treasures now,

449
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,010
wouldn't we be breaking our promise

450
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:12,490
to those who bought invitations?

451
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:15,800
And all their good deeds
will be in vain.

452
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:17,020
If that's the case, I'll give an order.

453
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,320
Before the appraisal event ends,

454
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,920
Yangzhou City

455
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:24,970
will be open for entry but not for exit.

456
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:29,200
What do you all think about this?

457
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,130
Thank you for your consideration, sir.

458
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,130
Everyone,

459
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,700
please don't let today's minor incident

460
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,370
ruin your good time.

461
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,580
Let's continue appraising treasures.

462
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:45,440
Who's in the mood
for appraising treasures now?

463
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:56,010
If Ling'er is in Yangzhou City,

464
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,160
the Governor's lockdown policy

465
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,280
might actually help us.

466
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,730
Right.

467
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,700
But with so many people here,

468
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,250
where should we start looking?

469
00:27:18,370 --> 00:27:19,920
What's this silly rat up to now?

470
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,370
Li!

471
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:26,100
(Notice)

472
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,980
Order of the Governor.

473
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,800
(Notice)
The Treasure Appraisal Gathering

474
00:27:29,810 --> 00:27:31,010
shall last three days. Before it ends,

475
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:33,010
no one is allowed to leave Yangzhou City.

476
00:27:33,170 --> 00:27:34,010
This is bad.

477
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,010
Three days?

478
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:36,890
I have to delay my journey here
for three days.

479
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:38,090
Sanniang,

480
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:40,650
I saw the notice...

481
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:41,490
I know.

482
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:49,090
Silly rat, what are you looking at?

483
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,930
Shh.

484
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,970
That's Ling'er's hair tie.

485
00:27:58,250 --> 00:27:59,440
She's that female thief.

486
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,090
- Female thief?
- Female thief?

487
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:02,370
How did you find out?

488
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,730
Don't worry about it.

489
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:06,800
But this means Ling'er
is indeed in Yangzhou City.

490
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:12,580
Jinyuan, we'll be right back.

491
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,440
Be careful.

492
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:36,940
My Lady,

493
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,090
didn't you say we should rest tonight

494
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,920
and visit
the Governor's residence tomorrow?

495
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,610
I...

496
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,440
I was going to ask you the same.

497
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,250
Where are you heading so late at night?

498
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,250
I was...

499
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,890
I was thinking...

500
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:57,770
I understand.

501
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:00,520
Could it be that you also wanted

502
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,250
to sneak into
the Governor's residence alone?

503
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,560
Please forgive me, My Lady.

504
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,580
This time, you're quite astute,

505
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,770
and that suits my intentions.

506
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,890
But you mustn't tell Ling'er

507
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,770
about us sneaking
into the Governor's residence.

508
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,300
Why?

509
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:22,500
I saw how troubled Ling'er is.

510
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,280
She must still be thinking
about Li Xiaoyao.

511
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:27,370
So, I want to find
the Spiritual Beads quickly

512
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,320
and take her back to Nanzhao,

513
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:30,920
to spare her further worries.

514
00:29:34,050 --> 00:29:35,250
My Lady, you're thoughtful

515
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,340
and considerate.

516
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,370
I admire you.

517
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:41,090
You have just realized this?

518
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,130
Let's go.

519
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:50,300
(Yue Lai Inn)

520
00:29:56,300 --> 00:30:01,060
(Room No. 1)

521
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,970
Be discreet. Don't get caught.

522
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,320
I know what to do.

523
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:30,820
What are you doing? Let go!

524
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,200
She's changing.
What are you looking at?

525
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,820
If I don't keep an eye on her,
what if she runs away?

526
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,500
Quit your babbling.

527
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,780
You just want
to take advantage of her.

528
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,010
Who's taking advantage now?

529
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:41,130
Ruffian!

530
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,490
I...

531
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:45,850
This is bad.

532
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:50,460
Quick, after her!

533
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:21,160
Based on the direction,

534
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,490
she's probably headed
to the Treasure Pavilion.

535
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:26,850
Shh.

536
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,060
Let's go.

537
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:47,100
(Treasure Pavilion)

538
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:54,780
My Lady,

539
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:56,400
aren't we heading
to the Governor's residence?

540
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,580
Why are we back here?

541
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,950
Before going to the Governor's residence,

542
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,010
we need to find something first.

543
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,130
The Princess's hair tie?

544
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,400
Tang Yu,

545
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:09,770
I didn't expect you
to understand girls so well.

546
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:12,770
Didn't the Princess say
the hair tie wasn't important?

547
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,520
What do you know?

548
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:18,100
The more a girl says she doesn't care,

549
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,400
the more she actually does.

550
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:20,460
And,

551
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,090
I saw Ling'er secretly shedding tears.

552
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,130
Though I don't want her

553
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:27,290
to be sad over Li Xiaoyao anymore,

554
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:30,130
that hair tie is a keepsake to Ling'er.

555
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,250
So,

556
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:33,560
I must help her find it no matter what.

557
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:49,320
What are you doing?

558
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:14,770
Who could this be?

559
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,890
Let's observe for now.

560
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,440
Be careful not to startle it.

561
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:25,370
Tang Yu,

562
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,520
stop calling yourself a subordinate,

563
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,090
and don't call me "My Lady" anymore.

564
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:31,660
Why?

565
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,090
Because...

566
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,610
What? Are you questioning my orders?

567
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,680
Then, how should I address you?

568
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,820
Call me...

569
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:49,970
Never mind.

570
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,560
I'll think of something later.

571
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:54,210
Yes.

572
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:11,140
Look,

573
00:34:11,410 --> 00:34:12,370
two more have arrived.

574
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,320
It's Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yueru.

575
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,370
Why are they dressed like that?

576
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,040
What are they doing here?

577
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,040
That female thief clearly went this way.

578
00:34:25,260 --> 00:34:26,650
How did she vanish
in the blink of an eye?

579
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,430
She must have entered
the Treasure Pavilion.

580
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,260
But there are officials
guarding the entrance.

581
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:34,210
How did she get in?

582
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,250
There should be a skylight

583
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:38,650
on the roof.

584
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,060
Follow me.

585
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:43,930
Shouldn't we just wait here

586
00:34:44,090 --> 00:34:45,930
for her to come out
and catch her by surprise?

587
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,040
Wouldn't that be easier?

588
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,850
After what happened during the day,

589
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,300
she'll be brazen

590
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,480
but prepared.

591
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,220
Now, she's the only one
who knows about Ling'er.

592
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,170
We can't let her escape.

593
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,280
Right.

594
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,410
- Let's go.
- Go.

595
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,890
Where did she go?

596
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,170
Where's the bead?

597
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:35,930
Quick, after her!

598
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,620
Be careful!

599
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,890
Darn it. It's a trap.

600
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,700
Sir, quickly! Catch the thief.

601
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,650
She just escaped from here.

602
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,130
So, it was really you two.

603
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,220
What do you mean by "you two"?
Stop dawdling.

604
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,410
The female thief is nearby.

605
00:36:09,410 --> 00:36:10,650
Sir, if we don't act now,
it'll be too late.

606
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:11,490
Take them!

607
00:36:15,570 --> 00:36:17,090
We have been tricked.
We can't act rashly,

608
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,480
or we'll fall completely
into the female thief's trap.

609
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:33,620
(Treasure Pavilion)

610
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:48,280
So, they...

611
00:36:48,570 --> 00:36:49,780
So, they came here to steal.

612
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,760
It might not be that simple.

613
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,720
Someone escaped from the rooftop

614
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,040
just before they were caught.

615
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:56,890
They might have been made scapegoats.

616
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,960
Should we find the hair tie first,

617
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,890
then sneak into the Governor's residence
to look for the Spiritual Bead?

618
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,090
What do you think of my plan?

619
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,170
Not very good.

620
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,790
Now both the Treasure Pavilion
and the Governor's residence

621
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,170
are heavily guarded.

622
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,450
This matter definitely isn't simple.

623
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,800
Let's return to the inn
and wait for the right moment.

624
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,720
I think my plan is pretty good,

625
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,650
but let's go with your decision for now.

626
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,340
Let's go.

627
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:32,220
(Keen Insight, Impartial Enforcement,
Upholding Justice)

628
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:34,620
(Upright Governance, Law-based Administration)
Given the circumstances,

629
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:35,650
what do you have to say?

630
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:37,610
We have been framed by the female thief.

631
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,940
She fled before your arrival.

632
00:37:39,940 --> 00:37:43,280
But I apprehended both of you
at the scene.

633
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:45,090
If you don't believe us,
you can search us.

634
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,000
There's nothing
from the Treasure Pavilion on us.

635
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,240
Something's wrong, sir!

636
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,280
Sir, something's wrong!

637
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,620
Something's wrong!

638
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,210
Why the panic?

639
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,760
Sir, you commanded us

640
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,960
to take inventory.

641
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,610
Upon investigation,
all treasures on the second floor,

642
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:04,760
including your bead,

643
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,800
- have been lost.
- What?

644
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:09,690
Are you sure you have checked properly?

645
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,720
Absolutely.

646
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,930
Bold thieves!

647
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,890
Where have you hidden those treasures?

648
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:19,240
Speak the truth now.

649
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:21,130
We didn't steal anything.

650
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,130
The real thief took the treasures.

651
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,820
Let me ask you.

652
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,040
What were you doing
at the Treasure Pavilion?

653
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,040
We were looking for someone.

654
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,320
More lies?

655
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:38,000
You sneaked into the Treasure Pavilion

656
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,650
to scout the terrain,

657
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:43,800
preparing for a theft at night.

658
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,650
Let me ask you again.

659
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,240
In the middle of the night,

660
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,850
what were you doing
at the Treasure Pavilion?

661
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:55,320
That female thief
stays at the Yue Lai Inn.

662
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,330
Most likely,
the missing treasures are there too.

663
00:38:57,330 --> 00:38:58,220
You can investigate it.

664
00:38:58,220 --> 00:38:59,850
Still trying to frame others?

665
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:02,560
The reason I didn't expose you earlier

666
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,850
was to wait
for your true colors to show.

667
00:39:05,850 --> 00:39:07,060
We're not thieves.

668
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,000
All lies!

669
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:11,460
That female thief
has been causing havoc in Yangzhou,

670
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,650
leading to the loss of many treasures,

671
00:39:13,650 --> 00:39:15,170
and the people are in uproar.

672
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,040
But the Governor is wise.

673
00:39:17,050 --> 00:39:18,850
He organized
this Treasure Appraisal Gathering

674
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,060
to raise funds for disaster relief

675
00:39:21,060 --> 00:39:22,720
and to set a trap

676
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:25,410
for you thieves.

677
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:28,210
The one who pretended
to be a scholar during the day

678
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:30,810
is, no doubt, your accomplice.

679
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:33,690
Those treasures
must be hidden by him, right?

680
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,450
If you truly repent,

681
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,890
reveal his whereabouts,

682
00:39:38,330 --> 00:39:41,760
and perhaps I'll go easy on you.

683
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,740
I once thought you were a good official,

684
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,610
but now it seems

685
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:47,700
you can't tell right from wrong,

686
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,740
a truly inept official.

687
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,580
Outrageous!

688
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:52,480
The Governor
works tirelessly for the public,

689
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:54,370
only to be slandered by you.

690
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,860
Sir,

691
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,370
let's beat them each twenty times
with a cane first.

692
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,610
Otherwise, they won't reveal
the thief's whereabouts.

693
00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:04,520
Who dares to hit me?

694
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,780
My father is Lin Tiannan,
the Martial Leader of the South,

695
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,320
and my cousin
is the current Number One Scholar.

696
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:19,690
Bold criminals!

697
00:40:20,130 --> 00:40:21,610
Still spouting lies!

698
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,850
Impersonating the family member
of court officials

699
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,170
will only add to your crimes.

700
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,210
I have given you a chance
to defend yourselves,

701
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:31,220
but you're full of deceit,

702
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,480
stubbornly refusing to repent.

703
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:36,170
Then don't blame me
for resorting to punishment.

704
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:37,450
Beat them!

705
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,240
Since he wants to play the hero,

706
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,130
let's indulge him.

707
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,610
- Beat him.
- Li Xiaoyao!

708
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:53,240
Get up! What are you doing?

709
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,520
- Don't move.
- You corrupt official, release him!

710
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:58,690
Stop hitting him!

711
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:00,580
Li Xiaoyao!

712
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,410
Stop hitting him!

713
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,560
Don't hit him anymore!

714
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:08,210
Li Xiaoyao!

715
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,090
Stop it, please!

716
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:13,000
Stop hitting him!

717
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:19,650
Stop hitting him!

718
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,800
Stop hitting him!

719
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,210
Stop hitting him!

720
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:30,930
I'm fine.

721
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:34,170
Li Xiaoyao!

722
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,000
Detain both of them.

723
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,460
Intensify the hunt for their accomplice.

724
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,300
Yes, sir.

725
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:01,170
Chief,

726
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:04,370
the daughter of the Lady of the South
and the Princess have reunited.

727
00:42:04,370 --> 00:42:05,690
They have found the Earth Spiritual Bead.

728
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,240
They should be in Yangzhou City by now.

729
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:09,300
Yes.

730
00:42:09,310 --> 00:42:11,320
But the Princess and Li Xiaoyao
have separated.

731
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,610
She left him.

732
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,260
Should we do something about it?

733
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:18,760
I'll handle such trivial matters.

734
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,000
I'll follow your orders.

735
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,170
Look,

736
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,480
there's a severe drought
everywhere in Nanzhao.

737
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:25,370
Only here,

738
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:27,170
the water flows endlessly.

739
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,370
This is

740
00:42:30,610 --> 00:42:33,280
the opportunity I have been waiting for
for ten years.

741
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:36,760
Finally, it's here.

742
00:43:00,891 --> 00:43:04,481
