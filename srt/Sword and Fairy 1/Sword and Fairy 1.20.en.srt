=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,690
Savage girl!

4
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,900
What's wrong with you?

5
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:55,090
Li Xiaoyao, just go!

6
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,210
The toad demon must be nearby.

7
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,130
Don't worry about me. Hurry up and go!

8
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,980
Then, stay right here.

9
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,020
I'll go find the antidote for you.

10
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,580
Your jade pendant.

11
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:13,840
Don't lose it again.

12
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,610
Honey.

13
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:26,250
Honey.

14
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,410
I miss you so much.

15
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,840
All men should die.

16
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:37,050
They are all cheaters.

17
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,840
I don't believe

18
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:41,640
there are men in this world
who won't change their hearts.

19
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:45,100
You certainly didn't come to me

20
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,810
because of that disfigured woman.

21
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,770
She's disfigured.

22
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,610
You don't love her anymore.

23
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:53,660
What nonsense are you talking about?

24
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,570
Hand over the antidote now.

25
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:55,840
All men should die.

26
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,530
They're all cheaters.

27
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:00,570
Honey, I'm sorry. Sorry.

28
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:02,020
Honey, I'm sorry.

29
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,480
Did I disturb you?

30
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:09,170
I'll make sure no one bothers you.

31
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,660
Honey.

32
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,410
Honey.

33
00:04:18,170 --> 00:04:19,160
Give it back to me!

34
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:22,880
Give me back the mirror!

35
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,360
I see you cherish this mirror so much.

36
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,500
It depicts you

37
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,130
and your lover, doesn't it?

38
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:29,130
Don't touch it.

39
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:31,610
- Give it back to me.
- Hand over the antidote.

40
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,450
Don't!

41
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,810
Don't. You want the antidote, right?

42
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,130
I'll tell you.

43
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:38,690
I'll tell you.

44
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,640
Men are all heartless creatures.

45
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,480
He promised me not to leave me,

46
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:49,760
but it was just for my beauty.

47
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,290
Once my face was disfigured,

48
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,660
he despised me, avoided me,

49
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,600
and immediately married another woman.

50
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,570
Where exactly is the antidote
for the Five Poison bead?

51
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,500
Impossible!

52
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:04,130
Honey,

53
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,850
impossible. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,970
Sorry, honey.

55
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Honey. Honey.

56
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,010
Your lover left you
because of your identity and your looks.

57
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,480
That's his problem,

58
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:19,770
but it doesn't mean

59
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,810
all men in the world
are heartless like that.

60
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,490
Though the savage girl
is just a friend of mine,

61
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:25,360
I must save her.

62
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,440
Impossible.

63
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,570
Honey,

64
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,160
could it be that I

65
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,090
misunderstood you?

66
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,290
She ate my Five Poison bead.

67
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,410
Becoming ugly is just the first phase.

68
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:45,130
Next,

69
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,850
the toxin will permeate her organs,

70
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:50,640
and she will die in unbearable pain.

71
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,170
What?

72
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,920
Where exactly is the antidote?

73
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,290
The Heartbroken Grass

74
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,690
counteracts the Five Poison Bead.

75
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,700
Only the Heartbroken Grass

76
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:02,850
can cure the poison
of the Five Poison Bead.

77
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,360
Where is the Heartbroken Grass?

78
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:05,920
The Heartbroken Grass

79
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:10,250
is in the deep marsh behind the mountain.

80
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,570
Its color is peculiar,

81
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,440
surrounded by pink poisonous gas.

82
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:17,880
It can only be picked by hand,

83
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:22,690
but it is the most poisonous thing
in the world.

84
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,690
If there's no Five Poison Bead
on the body,

85
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,850
touching it,

86
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:30,010
within the time of an incense stick,

87
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,570
will result in death from the poison
spreading through the body.

88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,760
Are you sure

89
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:44,290
it's worth it

90
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,730
for a disfigured nobody?

91
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,130
Of course.

92
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,760
Impossible!

93
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:06,980
In this world,

94
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:09,160
there can't be such devoted men.

95
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:12,880
All men should die!

96
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,320
- Come with me quickly.
- My face hurts so much.

97
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,200
I know where the antidote is.

98
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,200
The Five Poison Bead and the
Heartbroken Grass counteract each other.

99
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,250
Heartbroken Grass can detoxify.

100
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,290
My face...

101
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,090
Li Xiaoyao, just kill me.

102
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,010
My face hurts so much.

103
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:09,860
Wait here for me to come back.

104
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:10,850
Wait here for me, alright?

105
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:16,200
My face hurts so much.

106
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,090
The Heartbroken Grass
is the most poisonous thing in the world.

107
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,240
If there's no Five Poison Bead
on the body,

108
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,560
touching it,

109
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,410
within the time of an incense stick,

110
00:09:19,630 --> 00:09:21,790
will result in death from the poison
spreading through the body.

111
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:24,800
Are you sure it's worth it

112
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:26,970
for a disfigured nobody?

113
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:29,730
Li Xiaoyao, what's wrong with you?

114
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,200
Li Xiaoyao, wake up.

115
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,300
Li Xiaoyao!

116
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,220
Li Xiaoyao!

117
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:39,970
The Heartbroken Grass
is in the deep marsh behind the mountain.

118
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:42,260
- The two counteract each other.
- Don't...

119
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:43,420
The Heartbroken Grass can detoxify.

120
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,530
Heartbroken Grass...

121
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
Counteract each other...

122
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,640
The Heartbroken Grass
is the most poisonous thing in the world.

123
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,490
If there's no Five Poison Bead
on the body,

124
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,820
touching it,

125
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:56,200
within the time of an incense stick,

126
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:58,530
will result in death from the poison
spreading through the body.

127
00:13:19,970 --> 00:13:20,810
Li Xiaoyao!

128
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,060
Li Xiaoyao!

129
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,530
Are you okay, Li Xiaoyao?

130
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:39,620
Are you alright?

131
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,170
Of course.

132
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,850
Someone risked his life
to find the antidote for me.

133
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,320
Luckily, it was in time.

134
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,370
You should thank me.

135
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,170
I was the one who gave you
the Five Poison Bead,

136
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,930
or else you were almost dead.

137
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,880
Then, I really do owe you a thank you,

138
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,800
savage girl.

139
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,760
No need to thank me.

140
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:19,640
After all, you need to pay back

141
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:20,860
what you owe me.

142
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,180
Let's go

143
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,570
to find Ling'er.

144
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,370
Chief,

145
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,850
Mr. Shi has already
taken Princess Ling'er

146
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:49,930
to Yunmeng Marsh.

147
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,240
There's another thing, Chief.

148
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,290
Why do you monitor every move

149
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,090
of Li Xiaoyao
and the Princess on one hand,

150
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:58,800
yet on the other,
you have repeatedly found help for them,

151
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,460
and even saved their lives?

152
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:03,930
Also, after all the trouble you went through
to find the Witch Queen's statue,

153
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,560
why did you secretly inform Mr. Shi,

154
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:09,760
letting him take the Princess
to Yunmeng Marsh to investigate?

155
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,000
To obtain,

156
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,240
one must first give.

157
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,970
It took me ten years

158
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:20,730
to thoroughly monitor

159
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,610
Li Xiaoyao and others.

160
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,800
Chief,

161
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,490
you do have the ability
to foresee the future.

162
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,730
Even though
I have comprehended everything,

163
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,050
this step

164
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:37,170
has exhausted ten years of my life.

165
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,530
Who in this world can understand

166
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:44,440
the loneliness of these ten years?

167
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,370
Chief,

168
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,240
I will do my utmost

169
00:15:48,970 --> 00:15:50,530
to fulfill your wishes.

170
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,060
Gui Ying.

171
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:53,180
Yes.

172
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:56,170
Come with me to Yunmeng Marsh.

173
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:57,810
Yes, Chief.

174
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,220
(Yunmeng Marsh)

175
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,120
How much longer?

176
00:16:19,410 --> 00:16:20,930
Mr. Shi, stop for a moment.

177
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,680
Don't you find it strange?

178
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,290
The more we walk,
the more desolate it gets.

179
00:16:26,290 --> 00:16:28,220
There's not even a hint
of Yunmeng Marsh here.

180
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,640
Did you take us to the wrong path?

181
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:32,060
Map.

182
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,180
(Map of Yunmeng Marsh)

183
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,700
Your Highness, if we keep going,

184
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,440
we'll enter a desert.

185
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:47,170
That's where Yunmeng Marsh is.

186
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:49,930
Desert?

187
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:51,810
Mr. Shi,

188
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,730
Yunmeng Marsh is known
for its abundant water.

189
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,170
Why would it be a desert?

190
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:59,340
Yunmeng Marsh
used to be as you described,

191
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:00,220
but ten years ago,

192
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,730
it started drying up
from the middle outward,

193
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,090
eventually turning into a desert.

194
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:07,010
Why would such a change happen?

195
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,560
I didn't understand before,

196
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,200
but now it seems,

197
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:11,560
perhaps...

198
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:15,770
It might be related
to the Witch Queen's statue.

199
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,770
What exactly happened

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,770
after I left Nanzhao?

201
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:24,970
Your Highness,

202
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,680
we should hurry on our way.

203
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:29,440
We must reach Yunmeng Marsh
before dark.

204
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,060
Ling'er,

205
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,130
this old man has always been stubborn.

206
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,100
It might be better to ask my mother

207
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,010
when we return to Nanzhao.

208
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:49,780
Let's go.

209
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,040
Did you ever feel afraid in Toad Valley?

210
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,180
Afraid of what?

211
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,490
Afraid of dying.

212
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:05,040
After all, we almost just...

213
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:07,200
Aren't you alive and well?

214
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,300
Li Xiaoyao,

215
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,400
if I had died from poisoning,

216
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,800
would you be sad?

217
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,090
If I died,

218
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,490
you would always remember me, right?

219
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,860
Silly rat, I'm talking to you.

220
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,920
Did you hear me?

221
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,340
I'll remember.

222
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:34,780
Really?

223
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,400
I'll remember

224
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,090
to burn paper for you every year.

225
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,980
So you're just waiting for me to die?

226
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,020
You're cursing yourself
and asking me about it.

227
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:44,980
Tell me. If you're dead,

228
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:45,980
what else can I do but mourn?

229
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,490
Okay, okay, I shouldn't have asked.

230
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:49,850
Exactly. It's nonsense
to think about dying.

231
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,250
I can't make you understand.

232
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,780
Idiot!

233
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,650
And you insult me again.

234
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,300
Your Highness,

235
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,320
we've arrived at Yunmeng Marsh.

236
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,520
According to the map,

237
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,160
there's an inn ahead.

238
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,850
We'll rest there tonight.

239
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,400
To avoid attention,

240
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,320
we need to disguise ourselves
as merchants.

241
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,440
Your Highness, you'll need to
pretend to be my granddaughter.

242
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,220
There are clothes prepared inside.

243
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,610
Please change into them, Your Highness.

244
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,560
And everyone
should conceal their weapons.

245
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,180
Mr. Shi,

246
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,340
if Ling'er is pretending
to be a young lady,

247
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,970
then I'll deign to be her little sister.

248
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,400
There's no dress prepared for you.

249
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,160
Then I'll wear my own.

250
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,610
Ling'er, let's go.

251
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:40,650
Are we lost?

252
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,130
This doesn't look like
Yunmeng Marsh at all.

253
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,680
The direction should be correct.

254
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:46,400
Just keep going forward.

255
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,340
Be careful.

256
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,280
I've changed into new clothes.
How do I look?

257
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:08,010
Like a maid.

258
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,490
You look like a maid, an old maid.

259
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,090
You didn't look like one before,

260
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,370
but standing next to the Princess,
you do now.

261
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:18,890
Really.

262
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,660
I won't talk to you.

263
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,490
Tang Yu, what do you think?

264
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:26,680
This is the inn.

265
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,060
Your Highness, please look.

266
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:30,890
What do you think?

267
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,370
Mr. Shi's words seem

268
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,700
to make some sense.

269
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,800
No sense at all.

270
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,220
Then, for Princess Ling'er's sake,

271
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,060
I won't argue with you.

272
00:21:47,050 --> 00:21:48,560
Miss, let's go.

273
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,370
Put it away.

274
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,210
Let's go.

275
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,220
Why is there a ship

276
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:16,770
in this desert?

277
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,410
It must have been stranded here

278
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,890
before Yunmeng Marsh
turned into a desert.

279
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:38,890
Landlord,

280
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,280
a group of merchants arrived.

281
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,610
Dressed quite convincingly.

282
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:45,250
Dressed up?

283
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,800
Do you recognize these people?

284
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,700
(Gai Luojiao)

285
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,560
Old acquaintances.

286
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:04,090
The girl dressed as a young lady...

287
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
She looks...

288
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,730
You go, try to find out
about her background.

289
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:09,890
Yes.

290
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:15,460
Your Highness,

291
00:23:15,650 --> 00:23:16,680
this is the inn.

292
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,920
Once we enter,
everyone should be careful.

293
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,490
If not necessary, try not to speak.

294
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,010
Alright, alright.

295
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:25,940
You'll be the only one who can talk,

296
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,410
and we'll all be mutes, right?

297
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:28,250
Mr. Shi,

298
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:31,250
it's not dark yet.

299
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:32,770
You guys go to the inn first.

300
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,520
I'll scout around.

301
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,280
Be careful.

302
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:37,820
Okay.

303
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,540
Come back early.

304
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:46,580
Don't get hurt.

305
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:09,800
Something seems odd.

306
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,090
Everyone, be cautious.

307
00:24:28,290 --> 00:24:29,130
Dear guests,

308
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:30,610
do you want to dine or stay?

309
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:31,730
Stay.

310
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,920
Serve us some food first.

311
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:35,580
Please, have a seat
and rest with some tea.

312
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,560
Please sit here.

313
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,040
Have a seat.

314
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,680
If I'm not mistaken,

315
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,610
you must be merchants.

316
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:47,730
Indeed.

317
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,440
May I know your name?

318
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:54,490
I am surnamed Shi.

319
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:56,490
Mr. Shi,

320
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,800
coming to such a remote place,

321
00:24:58,810 --> 00:24:59,890
what business are you conducting?

322
00:25:01,410 --> 00:25:03,680
We took a wrong turn and ended up here,

323
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,320
planning to stay just for the night.

324
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:08,250
I see.

325
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,250
This young lady carries herself
with extraordinary grace.

326
00:25:14,390 --> 00:25:15,850
May I know how
she should be addressed?

327
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,200
She's my granddaughter,

328
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,730
brought out to see the world.

329
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:27,580
Miss Shi.

330
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:29,130
Well,

331
00:25:29,410 --> 00:25:30,440
we're all hungry.

332
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,280
You'd better serve the food now.

333
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:34,370
Of course.

334
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:38,130
Coming right up.

335
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:45,520
This waiter seems to be probing.

336
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,650
If anything happens,

337
00:25:48,010 --> 00:25:49,770
everyone must protect the lady.

338
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,610
Needless to say.

339
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,040
The desert surrounds us,

340
00:25:58,620 --> 00:26:00,040
but there's a path behind the inn

341
00:26:00,740 --> 00:26:01,730
leading into the mountains.

342
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,170
It seems very likely

343
00:26:05,170 --> 00:26:07,650
that the Witch Queen's statue
might be there.

344
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,160
We'll explore the mountains
early tomorrow morning.

345
00:26:19,530 --> 00:26:20,370
Landlord,

346
00:26:20,530 --> 00:26:21,490
the food is ready.

347
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,130
The old man is very cautious,

348
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,520
even secretly tested.

349
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,890
Did you find out anything?

350
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,410
He only mentioned his surname as Shi

351
00:26:30,410 --> 00:26:31,970
and the girl beside him
as his granddaughter,

352
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,560
but it's unclear
whether that's true or not.

353
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:39,400
His surname Shi is true.

354
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,540
So,

355
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,090
what do we do next?

356
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,480
Gather everyone.

357
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,990
Ask them to wait for my signal
in the back hall.

358
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,200
I'll talk with them.

359
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,660
Understood.

360
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,010
I've just stepped out,

361
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:04,200
not realizing we had esteemed guests.

362
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,980
If our humble inn has shown any neglect,

363
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,220
I hope you can forgive us.

364
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,320
Landlord, you're too kind.

365
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,410
We have prepared a jar of wine

366
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:13,650
to relieve your fatigue.

367
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,820
Thanks for the hospitality,

368
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,290
but we need to set off early tomorrow,

369
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,200
so it's not wise to indulge.

370
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:26,090
Sir,

371
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,130
you're not suspecting our wine
has been tampered with, are you?

372
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,700
A misunderstanding, Landlord.

373
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,010
I have no such thoughts,

374
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:33,680
just preoccupied with matters.

375
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:35,440
In that case,

376
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,440
it's a shame about the wine.

377
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,130
Landlord,

378
00:27:40,370 --> 00:27:42,580
we've been on the road all day
and are quite tired.

379
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,090
Please show us to our rooms.

380
00:27:45,410 --> 00:27:46,700
My apologies.

381
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:49,130
The rooms are a bit dusty from the wind
and are currently being cleaned.

382
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:51,160
You might need to wait a moment.

383
00:27:53,770 --> 00:27:54,850
This young lady

384
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,320
looks quite familiar.

385
00:27:57,890 --> 00:27:59,680
I feel a sense of familiarity
upon seeing her.

386
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:03,200
May I have the honor
to know the young lady's name?

387
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,130
She's my granddaughter,

388
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:09,280
named Shi Xiu'er.

389
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,920
So, it's Miss Xiu'er.

390
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:17,920
Miss Xiu'er is acting

391
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,890
with extraordinary grace.

392
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:24,970
You seem quite interested
in my granddaughter.

393
00:28:28,220 --> 00:28:29,410
It's merely because

394
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:31,610
she greatly resembles

395
00:28:32,770 --> 00:28:33,610
someone I once knew.

396
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,250
It's common for people
to look alike in this world.

397
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,560
Just a coincidence.

398
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
Like now,

399
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:47,850
I also find you somewhat familiar,

400
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,610
as if reminding me
of someone I once knew.

401
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:57,200
Perhaps your wife?

402
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,850
That's a joke.

403
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,650
May I know your surname?

404
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,010
My surname is

405
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,090
Zhao,

406
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,160
a native of Nanzhao.

407
00:29:11,370 --> 00:29:12,210
Landlord Zhao,

408
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,730
how long has this inn been open?

409
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:20,040
Over ten years.

410
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:21,500
This place is remote

411
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,040
with few visitors.

412
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,280
Landlord Zhao, may I ask

413
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:27,970
why you travelled all the way
from Nanzhao to open an inn here,

414
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:29,850
and how you managed
to keep it running for ten years?

415
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,560
Just a personal preference.

416
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,560
I see.

417
00:29:39,010 --> 00:29:40,620
Please wait here a moment.

418
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,500
I'll check if the rooms are ready.

419
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,440
Thank you for your trouble.

420
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,090
By the way,

421
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:48,680
the winds are strong at night.

422
00:29:49,250 --> 00:29:51,400
Please don't venture out on your own.

423
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,890
Of course.

424
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:06,340
The landlord said
Ling'er resembled someone she knew,

425
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:08,810
so he followed along. Quite fake, right?

426
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
But,

427
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:14,200
she does look somewhat familiar.

428
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,730
Here.

429
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,540
Give me the whip.

430
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,610
What do you need my whip for?

431
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,420
What are you doing?

432
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,620
You don't need to help me,

433
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,730
I can walk on my own.

434
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,610
I'm afraid I'll be blown away.

435
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,370
At crucial times,
you still have to rely on me.

436
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:04,130
Indeed, you're heavier and more stable.

437
00:31:05,090 --> 00:31:05,940
Li Xiaoyao,

438
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:07,730
you really can't say anything nice.

439
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,160
The landlord has been probing repeatedly.

440
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,400
She seems to know the Princess's identity.

441
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,730
To avoid complications,

442
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,400
we'll head into the mountains tonight.

443
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:32,890
Mr. Shi,

444
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:35,320
since she knows my identity,

445
00:31:35,770 --> 00:31:36,850
she's likely

446
00:31:37,250 --> 00:31:38,400
related to my mother.

447
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,680
Could she be

448
00:31:41,050 --> 00:31:42,970
an old friend of my mother's?

449
00:31:43,530 --> 00:31:44,610
No, she shouldn't be.

450
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,500
She claimed to be from Nanzhao

451
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,820
and had stayed in this desolate place
for ten years.

452
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,220
Running the inn is just an excuse.

453
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,220
There must be a connection
to the Witch Queen's statue behind it.

454
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,730
We need to be more cautious.

455
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:02,440
But I feel

456
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:04,560
that lady seems quite nice.

457
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,340
She's not like a bad person.

458
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,250
What do you know?

459
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,250
Tonight, you must stay close
to the Princess at all times.

460
00:32:13,250 --> 00:32:14,440
Keep your guard up.

461
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:19,680
I don't need your orders to do my job.

462
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,420
Tang Yu,

463
00:32:21,450 --> 00:32:23,350
you're also responsible
for protecting the Princess.

464
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,400
Tang Yu only listens to me.

465
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,580
Tonight,

466
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,090
you'll protect the Princess with me.

467
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,770
Yes, My Lady.

468
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,730
Everyone, rest in your rooms for now.

469
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:41,040
We'll meet in the inn's lobby
at midnight.

470
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:43,130
Yes.

471
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:44,490
Let's go.

472
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,490
I can now confirm

473
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,850
that girl is the Princess.

474
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,130
Then,

475
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,290
since she's the Princess,

476
00:33:05,290 --> 00:33:06,220
they must have come

477
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,680
for the Witch Queen's statue.

478
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:08,890
Exactly.

479
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:12,090
Although the Princess

480
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,920
seems uncoerced,

481
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,850
she has been missing for ten years,

482
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,220
unaware of the changes

483
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:20,320
that occurred in Nanzhao.

484
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,130
I worry

485
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:23,730
she might be misled

486
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,650
or even exploited.

487
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:26,170
Then, Landlord,

488
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,500
shall we try to rescue the Princess?

489
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,250
No, that could alert them prematurely.

490
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,460
Here's the plan.

491
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,490
After nightfall,
you all prepare for an ambush.

492
00:33:39,620 --> 00:33:41,370
If there's any movement,

493
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:42,490
encircle them

494
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:43,370
and resolve it all at once.

495
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,200
Understood. I'll prepare now.

496
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,820
Let's go.

497
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,210
Why stop?

498
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,690
I'm tired and need to rest a bit.

499
00:34:16,170 --> 00:34:17,090
Then sit for a while.

500
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,410
What happened between you and Ling'er?

501
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,040
You can tell me now, right?

502
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:33,090
She thought

503
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:35,860
her mother was responsible
for my parents' deaths.

504
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:37,930
As it turned out,
it was all a misunderstanding.

505
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,370
Since it's a misunderstanding,
you should clear it up quickly.

506
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,720
Were your parents heroes?

507
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,170
Ever since I can remember,

508
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:57,450
they've been wandering the martial world.

509
00:34:59,810 --> 00:35:02,130
No wonder you aspire to be a hero.

510
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
What about you?

511
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,520
You want to be a heroine.

512
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:06,960
Is it because of your father?

513
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:08,930
Not exactly.

514
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,040
Then I'm curious.

515
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,690
Why not be a proper young lady

516
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,040
but venture into the martial world?

517
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:20,090
It's related to a hero

518
00:35:20,780 --> 00:35:23,130
who saved me ten years ago.

519
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:25,040
Who?

520
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,760
I didn't get a clear look at him.

521
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,450
But since then,

522
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:33,960
I've been determined

523
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,280
to become a hero like him.

524
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,610
Now I understand

525
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,450
why you're so against
the combat for marriage.

526
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:45,850
Now you see my dilemma, right?

527
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,500
As friends,

528
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,340
Ling'er and I

529
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:50,410
will help you
find that person in your heart.

530
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:51,860
You...

531
00:35:55,330 --> 00:35:56,170
But

532
00:35:56,650 --> 00:35:57,960
we need to find Ling'er first.

533
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,240
Silly rat.

534
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:28,210
My dear guests, where are you headed?

535
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:33,610
The room was stuffy.

536
00:36:33,610 --> 00:36:34,800
We wanted some fresh air.

537
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:37,480
Landlord Zhao, why the big fuss?

538
00:36:40,650 --> 00:36:42,320
Mr. Shi,

539
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,890
I didn't expect you to become so adept

540
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,930
at lying after ten years.

541
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,000
Who are you really?

542
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:54,800
Gai Luojiao from the Witch Moon Sect.

543
00:36:55,570 --> 00:36:56,800
Gai Luojiao?

544
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,280
You're Miss Gai, my senior?

545
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,210
Your senior?

546
00:37:04,850 --> 00:37:05,720
Could it be you are...

547
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,610
Miss Gai, I'm A'nu.

548
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,240
A'nu? Really you?

549
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:10,720
Sure.

550
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,960
Seeing you is truly wonderful.

551
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:15,720
Master always mentioned you.

552
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:17,580
A'nu,

553
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,520
bring the Princess to me.

554
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,330
Ling'er, Miss Gai is one of us.

555
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,170
Your Highness.

556
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,610
I wondered who it could be.

557
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:32,890
Turns out it's General Gai.

558
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,300
I've long ceased to be General Gai.

559
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,980
You vanished from Nanzhao
ten years ago,

560
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:39,850
and now you appear here.

561
00:37:39,850 --> 00:37:42,500
You hid your name
and lived in the desert for ten years.

562
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:45,040
It must be because
of the Witch Queen's statue here.

563
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,460
Indeed, you came for her statue.

564
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,170
I was commanded by the Witch King.

565
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,810
After what happened ten years ago,

566
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:53,020
how can you still have the face

567
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,760
to bring the Princess
for the Queen's statue?

568
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:00,930
General Gai.

569
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,780
Your Highness.

570
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,170
Is my mother's statue

571
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,720
truly here?

572
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,250
Yes.

573
00:38:13,850 --> 00:38:14,690
Could you

574
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:16,800
take me to see her?

575
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,170
Yes, Your Highness.

576
00:38:20,610 --> 00:38:22,610
But we need to plan carefully.

577
00:38:23,130 --> 00:38:24,240
I have another request.

578
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,000
Please, command me.

579
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,370
Could you tell me

580
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:30,410
what exactly happened in Nanzhao

581
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,650
ten years ago?

582
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,610
General Gai, do you know,

583
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:42,320
ten years ago,

584
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,170
why did the Water Demon Beast
suddenly appear in Nanzhao?

585
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,690
Your Highness,

586
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,650
the Water Demon Beast was sealed

587
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,480
by Nuwa in ancient times.

588
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:53,000
Its appearance in Nanzhao

589
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,040
must be related to Bai Yue.

590
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,410
Why are you so sure, General Gai?

591
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:04,090
Back then, Bai Yue

592
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,280
slandered the Queen as a snake demon,

593
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,500
creating widespread controversy

594
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:09,890
in the court.

595
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:13,000
Then, the Water Demon Beast appeared,

596
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,850
causing floods and calamities.

597
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:18,850
Unfortunately, it's indestructible.

598
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,170
Only the descendants of Nuwa
can seal it.

599
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,170
The Queen, a descendant of Nuwa,

600
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,850
sacrificed herself to seal the beast

601
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:30,610
to save everyone in the world,

602
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,810
exposing her snake form

603
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:33,780
in front of everyone

604
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:35,280
due to unleashing Nuwa's power,

605
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,690
and was thus

606
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,370
accused of being a snake demon.

607
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,560
By this logic,

608
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,930
the appearance of the Water Demon Beast

609
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:53,130
is undoubtedly linked to Bai Yue.

610
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,410
These people are utterly stupid.

611
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,500
The Queen saved them,

612
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,130
yet they accused her
of being a snake demon.

613
00:40:15,090 --> 00:40:15,930
Mr. Shi,

614
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:18,000
if what General Gai said is true,

615
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,240
the greatest villain in Nanzhao

616
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,850
should be Bai Yue.

617
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:23,450
Why

618
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:26,090
do people hate Li Sansi and his wife?

619
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:29,730
Your Highness,

620
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,520
I've mentioned this before.

621
00:40:31,850 --> 00:40:34,500
They stole the Water Spiritual Bead,

622
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,000
leading to the flood.

623
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:40,210
Rumors say the Water Demon Beast
grows stronger with water,

624
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,500
and Nanzhao was flooded,

625
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:46,000
hence the Lis were detested.

626
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,930
General Gai, have you heard of this?

627
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,300
Your Highness,

628
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:52,930
at that time, the Lady of the South and I
were dispatched to the frontier.

629
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:54,450
By the time we returned,

630
00:40:54,610 --> 00:40:56,650
the Queen had already sealed
the Water Demon Beast.

631
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,450
As for the Li couple,

632
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,650
although we heard rumors,

633
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:06,280
I'd rather believe
that all of this was Bai Yue's doing.

634
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,320
However, within the Nanzhao court,

635
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,650
there were those who turned a blind eye.

636
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,060
General Gai,

637
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,130
my views have always
clashed with Bai Yue's,

638
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:18,370
and I never agreed

639
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:20,000
with his actions
towards the Queen back then.

640
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,610
The matter of the Water Demon Beast

641
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:24,780
has yet to be linked
to him by any evidence.

642
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,320
Even though he is my political adversary,

643
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:28,220
I cannot unjustly attribute

644
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,940
uncertain accusations to him.

645
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,650
This would not be the conduct
of a righteous person.

646
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:32,890
How noble it sounds.

647
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,020
Then, Mr. Shi, please return.

648
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,700
The Princess will be better off
with us from now on.

649
00:41:36,700 --> 00:41:37,650
Absolutely not.

650
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:39,780
I was commanded by the Witch King
to come here specifically

651
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,370
to bring the Princess back to court.

652
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,800
Back to court?

653
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:45,130
Do you intend for the Princess

654
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,780
to possibly repeat the tragic fate
of the Queen?

655
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,800
You're being too arbitrary, General Gai.

656
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,060
The Princess holds a position
of high respect, second only to the king.

657
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,720
Who would dare to harm her?

658
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,090
Oh, Mr. Shi,

659
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,170
you're still so naive.

660
00:41:56,170 --> 00:41:58,780
Ten years ago, Bai Yue was able
to slander the Queen as a demon,

661
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:01,210
and even the Witch King
could do nothing about it.

662
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:03,540
In these ten years, his
Moon Worship Sect has rapidly grown,

663
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:05,260
now wielding significant influence.

664
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,610
What if they were to repeat their tactics

665
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:08,090
and slander the Princess as a demon?

666
00:42:08,090 --> 00:42:09,460
If what General Gai says is true,

667
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,090
with just one order from the King,

668
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,500
even if I have to lay down my life,

669
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,060
I will ensure the Princess's safety.

670
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,460
I believe your words,

671
00:42:16,460 --> 00:42:18,460
but given the current state
of the Nanzhao court,

672
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,230
I absolutely cannot let the Princess
take such a risk.

673
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:20,970
Alright.

674
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,040
Whether I stay or go,

675
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:28,240
after I clarify the matter
regarding my mother's statue,

676
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,450
I will make my own decision.
