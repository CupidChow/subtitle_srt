3
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,610
Tang Yu.

4
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,220
A'nu,

5
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:11,970
why are you here?

6
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:15,000
The Sacred Maid said
you shouldn't be walking around.

7
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,250
I just came to see
how the medicine you brew is doing.

8
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,140
I'll fan it for you.

9
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:25,610
It'll be ready soon.

10
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,330
You should go back and rest.

11
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:28,690
I don't want to.

12
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,120
I finally got out.

13
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,000
Let me enjoy it a little longer.

14
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,140
Tang Yu,

15
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,970
what's wrong? You look pale.

16
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,690
Are you sick?

17
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,250
Maybe

18
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:53,050
thinking about how to get you
to take your medicine was too stressful.

19
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:58,690
Nonsense. I really like taking medicine.

20
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,050
Really?

21
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,050
That's good.

22
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,560
Have the first dose of medicine then.

23
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,500
No rush.

24
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,890
I have something to ask you.

25
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,250
What is it?

26
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,760
Didn't you say I saved you
when we were kids?

27
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:36,170
Tell me

28
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,840
about how I saved you.

29
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,170
Can you tell me now?

30
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,040
I'm from the Central Plains.

31
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,290
As a child, I followed my parents

32
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,250
to Nanzhao to do business,

33
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:36,250
and we settled there.

34
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,530
For some reason,

35
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,730
we moved a lot,

36
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,760
unable to stay long in any place.

37
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,380
Because of this,

38
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,130
I never had friends

39
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:55,040
and was afraid to make any.

40
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,570
That Chinese New Year's Eve,

41
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,640
the streets were filled with lanterns,

42
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:05,530
so lively.

43
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,850
We were about to move again,

44
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,810
but I really wanted to go out and play.

45
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,450
So,

46
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,320
I quietly slipped out to the street,

47
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,360
played for a very long time,

48
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,160
and went home until late at night.

49
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:26,810
When I got home,

50
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,010
I saw my mother

51
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,480
had made a whole table
of my favorite foods,

52
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:37,810
especially

53
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,090
sesame pancakes,

54
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,940
so fragrant

55
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:46,730
and crispy,

56
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:50,290
covered in sesame seeds.

57
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,730
I was so hungry,

58
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,570
so I just focused on eating.

59
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,480
While eating,

60
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,760
I noticed blood at the doorway,

61
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,410
slowly flowing towards me.

62
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,850
Following the trail of blood,

63
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:20,570
I found

64
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,880
their bodies.

65
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,880
After that,

66
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:50,040
I begged on the streets to survive.

67
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,810
Sometimes kind-hearted people
gave me food,

68
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:56,090
but most of the time,

69
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,480
I lived on what I could scavenge.

70
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,360
The day I met you,

71
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,040
I found a pancake,

72
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,880
just like the ones my mother made,

73
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,810
fragrant and crispy,

74
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,530
covered with sesame seeds.

75
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,360
How dare you to beg on our turf?

76
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:31,610
Beat him!

77
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,550
- They outnumbered me. I couldn't fight back.
- Don't hit me!

78
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,410
Don't hit me!

79
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,360
I could only protect that pancake.

80
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,160
When I was dazed,

81
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,320
I heard a little girl's voice.

82
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:55,170
In broad daylight,

83
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,250
you're ganging up on a child.

84
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,610
What kind of skill is that?

85
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:00,360
Another nosy one.

86
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Are you leaving or not?

87
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:03,260
If not, we'll beat you too.

88
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,760
Come on, come on.

89
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,530
She saw I was okay,

90
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,480
so she then pulled me up.

91
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,410
But there were too many people that day,

92
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:28,730
and we got separated.

93
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:42,560
I couldn't see her face clearly,

94
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:46,880
but I heard the sound of bells on her.

95
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,320
It's the most beautiful sound

96
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,530
I've ever heard in my life.

97
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,090
Tang Yu,

98
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,850
I won't let anyone bully you again.

99
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,800
Anyone.

100
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,100
Hurry up!

101
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,530
Slow down.

102
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:46,010
Slow down.

103
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,130
Sit here.

104
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,800
I'm finally out.

105
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,090
Look what I brought.

106
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,180
A'nu.

107
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,540
What's wrong?

108
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,050
Did you hear that eagle call?

109
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,170
It sounds so familiar

110
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:19,050
like I've heard it somewhere before.

111
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,540
A'nu,

112
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,290
I'll take you back to rest.

113
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,260
We've only just come out.

114
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,370
Let's play a little longer.

115
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,640
I want to hear you play it a bit more.

116
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,330
Hurry up.

117
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,980
I...

118
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:43,680
I suddenly feel a bit unwell.

119
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,850
Then let's hurry back.

120
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,540
Okay.

121
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:51,060
Wait.

122
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,200
I still think
that eagle call sounds familiar

123
00:11:55,650 --> 00:11:57,170
like I've heard it somewhere.

124
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:03,530
Maybe when I was with you.

125
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:04,730
Do you remember?

126
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:08,170
I don't remember.

127
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,490
A'nu, A'nu,

128
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,490
I'll take you back.

129
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,330
Okay.

130
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,420
(Lizhao Residence)

131
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,380
Mr. Liu, this is what you ordered.

132
00:12:37,380 --> 00:12:38,440
It's all been taken care of.

133
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,690
Put it here.

134
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,330
Scholar,

135
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:44,610
why are you up so early?

136
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:45,530
Are you feeling better?

137
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,680
Much better.

138
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:48,810
Come,

139
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:53,970
Li, tell me. How are our relations?

140
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
We're alright.

141
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:58,050
We just faced death together. That's all.

142
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,290
Here, take this.

143
00:13:04,030 --> 00:13:04,900
This...

144
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,800
(Wanfu Gold Store)
What's this? Why the mystery?

145
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,800
Wanfu Gold Store.

146
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:13,120
Jinxiuyuan Embroidery Shop.

147
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,640
Jinling Spring Restaurant.

148
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,370
I've called you here to ask you

149
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:22,200
to help me collect some items
from these places.

150
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,970
Collect some items?

151
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,370
What items?

152
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,700
Alright, I'll go now.

153
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,560
You rest well.

154
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:32,890
Hold on, hold on.

155
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,000
Yueru knows the capital better.

156
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:37,050
Wait for her to come with you.

157
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,530
Jinyuan wants me to go shopping with you?

158
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:42,650
Let me see.

159
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,640
What is it?

160
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,200
Let me see.

161
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,850
- Stop messing around.
- Are you going to show me?

162
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,530
You won't show me?
I'm taking out the whip.

163
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:51,260
Are you going to show me?

164
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:52,560
What's the whip for? Here, here, here.

165
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:58,900
Gold bracelets, gold earrings,
and gold necklaces.

166
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,930
Why are you buying these?

167
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:15,800
You really don't see the point.

168
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:19,050
These items
are clearly gifts for Mrs. Cai.

169
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,440
Scholar really cares

170
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,930
for his wife.

171
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:24,090
I can't be bothered with you.

172
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:30,440
The latest ones. You can take a look.

173
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:31,930
- Please wait a moment.
- Miss,

174
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:32,970
we're here to pick up an order.

175
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,140
Please hold on a moment.

176
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,490
Our landlord will be right with you.

177
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:40,170
It's a good opportunity to see

178
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,530
if there are any new designs.

179
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:43,970
You don't need stuff meant for girls.

180
00:14:44,410 --> 00:14:45,490
Why do I not need it?

181
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:47,760
This embroidery is really exquisite.

182
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:49,100
Look at this one.

183
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,300
It fits,

184
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:51,930
but the price is a bit...

185
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,440
What are you staring at?

186
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,560
It looks familiar.

187
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,850
I feel like
I've seen it somewhere before.

188
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,850
Dear guests,

189
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:15,090
these are the embroidered shoes

190
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,930
prepared by the Lius
for the Scholar's wife.

191
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,370
- Feel free to look around.
- They are quite nice.

192
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:26,930
Where have I seen these before?

193
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:31,170
A gold necklace
for the bond of good fortune.

194
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:33,370
A pair of gold earrings
for the perfect date.

195
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:35,640
A pair of gold bracelets
for the blessed couple.

196
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,320
They are really beautiful.

197
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:43,530
I'm here to give you both best wishes.

198
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,290
May you be a heavenly couple

199
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:47,370
and be happily married.

200
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,090
Landlord, you're mistaken.

201
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:49,970
This set was intended

202
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:51,850
for the young master
and mistress of the Lius.

203
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:55,740
I'm sorry.

204
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,140
Sorry, my mistake.

205
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,490
We'll package these up for you right now.

206
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,330
Please wait a moment.

207
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,010
Alright, alright.

208
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:06,930
Dear guests.

209
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,640
Landlord, we're here
for the Nu'er Hong Wine.

210
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,380
Please, have a seat over here.

211
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,220
Alright.

212
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,440
Let me tell you.

213
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:17,970
We suddenly

214
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:21,260
have a mysterious beauty here.

215
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,490
Do you know who she is?

216
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:24,120
No need to tell us.

217
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,320
Everyone knows.

218
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,370
It's Mrs. Cai of the Lius.

219
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:30,370
Everyone's guessing about her background

220
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:31,730
and her origins,

221
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:35,440
but nobody knows where she's from.

222
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:38,370
Except for me.

223
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,640
Then do tell us.

224
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:44,640
She's the Emperor's sister.

225
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,440
Stop making things up here.

226
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:48,050
She's not any princess.

227
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,200
She's a demon.

228
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,330
A demon?

229
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,900
No need to argue with a bunch of drunks.

230
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,440
It might affect your family's reputation.

231
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,760
You're the one talking nonsense.

232
00:16:58,170 --> 00:16:59,370
You say she's not a demon.

233
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:02,610
Then why has the Scholar
been getting weaker

234
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:05,040
by the day since marrying her?

235
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,610
I heard

236
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,890
she's a demon from the back mountain,

237
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,400
living by sucking the vitality of men.

238
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:15,200
You're all wrong.

239
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,090
I've seen Miss Cai Yi in Luoyang.

240
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,920
She's the top courtesan
of Yingchun Brothel.

241
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,920
She and I go way back.

242
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:27,800
- Here, here.
- Right, right.

243
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,970
Be gentle.

244
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,440
Stop fighting!

245
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,060
This...

246
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,680
What's going on here?

247
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,860
They got drunk

248
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,890
and tried to sneak away,

249
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,010
so we just stopped them.

250
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,300
Good.

251
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:03,040
Good. Thank you both.

252
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,700
Waiter, come down here.

253
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,060
Coming!

254
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,620
(Lizhao Residence)

255
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,490
We're back.

256
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:24,370
You're back.

257
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:25,890
Scholar,

258
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:28,130
I've brought your items back for you.

259
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,130
(Nu'er Hong Wine)

260
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:30,200
Thank you.

261
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:33,250
Jinyuan.

262
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,520
You two are really good together.

263
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,490
You two are naturally a match.

264
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,520
Newlyweds in harmony.

265
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,850
You could have this too.

266
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:53,170
Jinyuan, what are you saying?

267
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,200
I don't understand.

268
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,040
Right, Mrs. Scholar,

269
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,410
what exactly is the illness Scholar has?

270
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,280
Tell us. Maybe we can help.

271
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:11,520
I'm not well-versed in medicine,

272
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,770
unsure of the exact disease,

273
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,890
but I've learned some nourishing recipes

274
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:17,280
from my grandfather at home,

275
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:20,010
which can help alleviate his pain.

276
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:22,850
Honey, you're too modest.

277
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:25,040
Thanks to your medicine,

278
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:27,400
I've felt much better lately.

279
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:29,820
Go sit down.

280
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,650
Marrying you

281
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,560
is Jinyuan's good fortune.

282
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:38,090
Have some tea.

283
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,520
Honey, have some tea.

284
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:52,130
Honey, is this a new batch of flower tea?

285
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,040
You tasted it out.

286
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,520
I vaguely remember

287
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,400
I've also been to a place full of flowers.

288
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,610
Is it you?

289
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:14,890
Xiaoyao?

290
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,890
There was also

291
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
a girl there.

292
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,050
What girl?

293
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,530
You mention a girl several times a day.

294
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:26,970
Have you taken a fancy to some girl?

295
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,580
I...

296
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:32,050
It doesn't matter who I fancy,

297
00:20:32,050 --> 00:20:34,040
but I definitely won't fancy you,
you savage girl.

298
00:20:34,370 --> 00:20:36,160
Are you asking for a beating?

299
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,520
Alright, alright.

300
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,010
Alright.

301
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,800
Your relationship is really good.

302
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,730
- Who's good with her?
- Who's good with him?

303
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,090
Alright, move aside and stand there.

304
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:49,850
Come on, come on.

305
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:53,370
I've already found a good match.

306
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:56,130
You two should also hurry up.

307
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,800
Honey, it's getting windy.

308
00:21:01,980 --> 00:21:03,680
I'll go get you a cloak.

309
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,800
I'll go with you.

310
00:21:06,370 --> 00:21:07,210
Okay.

311
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:26,970
Yueru,

312
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,850
I see you and Mr. Li...

313
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,610
We're just friends.

314
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:34,680
Where do you pick herbs?

315
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,520
Tell me, and next time I'll help you.

316
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:40,410
No need to go recently.

317
00:21:40,410 --> 00:21:41,970
I haven't used up
the last batch I picked.

318
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:46,200
Yueru,

319
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,610
I know

320
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,680
Jinyuan likes you.

321
00:21:52,890 --> 00:21:53,960
Please don't misunderstand.

322
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,350
Jinyuan and I have only brotherly
and sisterly affection for each other.

323
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:57,650
I have no improper thoughts towards him.

324
00:21:58,650 --> 00:21:59,730
I'm not overthinking.

325
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,890
I just

326
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:05,250
feel sorry for him.

327
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:09,620
The affection of childhood friends

328
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,520
is indeed rare and precious.

329
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,520
Now that Jinyuan is unwell,

330
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,890
the one he can't let go of is you.

331
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:21,920
Yueru,

332
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:24,770
if you could settle down soon

333
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,040
and have someone by your side,

334
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:27,780
I think

335
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,400
Jinyuan could also feel more at ease.

336
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,010
Mrs. Cai,

337
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,680
both you and Jinyuan
are kind and considerate,

338
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,490
always thinking of others.

339
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,580
I believe

340
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,130
I will also find
the perfect person for me

341
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:45,680
and be just like you two.

342
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,280
Jinyuan and I

343
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:57,010
are like

344
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,370
a butterfly and a flower.

345
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:09,250
The butterfly's life is short,

346
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:13,610
but it seeks to flutter
around the most beautiful flowers,

347
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:17,200
witnessing the bloom

348
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,400
and withering.

349
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,040
In this life,

350
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,650
that would be enough for me.

351
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,560
It's a good thing
that lovers get together.

352
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,890
But it's strange

353
00:23:42,290 --> 00:23:43,920
that though we seem close,

354
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,280
neither of us can take a step forward.

355
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,520
I don't know

356
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,890
why exactly.

357
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,560
It's just not the right time yet.

358
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:01,370
I can tell

359
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,160
Mr. Li cares about you a lot.

360
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:05,460
Really?

361
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:11,370
Let's go.

362
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,980
She hopes Xiaoyao

363
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,200
and Yueru can be together.

364
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,650
Please

365
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,370
don't mention Miss Fairy

366
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,850
in front of them.

367
00:24:34,050 --> 00:24:34,890
Li.

368
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,490
Scholar,

369
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,010
you look like you have something to say
but are holding back.

370
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,280
Is there some secret you want to tell me?

371
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,280
Not really.

372
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,440
I've just been sick at home for so long.

373
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:55,400
Suddenly seeing you all

374
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,520
reminds me of the old days.

375
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:00,490
Then you better rest up.

376
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,700
When you're better,

377
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,250
we'll hit the road together,

378
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:04,380
and adventure in the martial world.

379
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:08,010
I'm afraid I can't.

380
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,090
What did you just say?

381
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:11,890
I mean

382
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,680
I'm a married man now.

383
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,610
It's not suitable to travel far.

384
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,040
Scholar,

385
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,130
I didn't expect

386
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,680
to hear such words from you.

387
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,490
Indeed, once you're caught up in love,
heroism fades.

388
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,800
These items

389
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,520
were bought for your wife, right?

390
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,250
They are for you.

391
00:25:36,530 --> 00:25:37,890
Why are you giving me these things?

392
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:41,770
I hope you use these
as betrothed presents

393
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,490
to propose to Yueru.

394
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,460
You...

395
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:52,010
You like her, don't you?

396
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,920
I've already married the one
destined for me.

397
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,650
I wouldn't dwell on the past.

398
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,680
I hope

399
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,370
you do the same.

400
00:26:08,250 --> 00:26:09,370
Forget the past,

401
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,850
and start anew.

402
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:13,490
Start anew?

403
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,920
Cherish the one before you,

404
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,770
and don't miss out again.

405
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,300
Again?

406
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:22,320
Why do you say "again"?

407
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,340
Honey.

408
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,010
Put this on.

409
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,340
Alright.

410
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:33,370
Let's go see the flowers.

411
00:26:33,370 --> 00:26:34,490
Let's rest in the room for a bit.

412
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:49,610
What's wrong?

413
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,090
You left for a while,

414
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,490
and you're not acting normal.

415
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:56,560
Nothing really.

416
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:00,740
Haven't you noticed?

417
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,770
Ever since Scholar fell ill,
he's been acting weird.

418
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,170
You're the strangest one.

419
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:05,370
What's so strange about me?

420
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,280
Are you pretending to be confused?

421
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,680
Pretending?

422
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:18,400
Confused?

423
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,170
You talk so strangely here.

424
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:23,090
No, no, no.

425
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,400
I better hide.

426
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,410
I better hide.

427
00:27:26,410 --> 00:27:28,010
Li Xiaoyao, you stop right there!

428
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,170
Stop, Li Xiaoyao!

429
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:30,010
Don't follow me anymore!

430
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:30,920
You stop!

431
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,820
(Shuimu Residence)

432
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,340
Tang Yu,

433
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,560
I remembered.

434
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:45,160
That persistent eagle

435
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,090
is very likely related to Bai Yue.

436
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:51,460
Right there by the Queen's statue
in Yunmeng Marsh.

437
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,300
Do you remember?

438
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:59,200
First, we heard an eagle's cry,

439
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,920
and then Bai Yue suddenly appeared.

440
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,370
By this logic,

441
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,500
that eagle

442
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,770
must be sent by Bai Yue to monitor us.

443
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,580
I wondered why Bai Yue
seemed so well-informed

444
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,730
about our movements.

445
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
I...

446
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:13,940
I can't remember.

447
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,680
But how does Bai Yue manage,

448
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:20,610
using just an eagle,

449
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,610
to spy and send messages?

450
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:30,940
A'nu.

451
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,420
What's wrong?

452
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,420
Nothing.

453
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,610
Your wounds haven't healed.

454
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,090
I'll take you back to rest.

455
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,650
But I really feel...

456
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,780
Let's go.

457
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:10,520
Xiaoyao.

458
00:29:12,650 --> 00:29:13,610
Xiaoyao.

459
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,650
Xiaoyao.

460
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,400
Do you remember me?

461
00:29:27,050 --> 00:29:28,040
Xiaoyao.

462
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,160
Xiaoyao!

463
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:58,920
I clearly remember

464
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,010
you were covered in injuries.

465
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,730
How come they are gone now?

466
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:13,010
Ling'er...

467
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:15,160
How come it's just you guys coming back?

468
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:16,770
Did you find Miss Ling'er?

469
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,680
Who are you talking about?

470
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,970
Who exactly are you?

471
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:41,560
With such skill,

472
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:43,730
who could it be?

473
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,340
(Lizhao Residence)

474
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,300
Mrs. Liu,

475
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:58,890
the toxins

476
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:00,970
in your son's body are building up,

477
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,090
and this poison is no ordinary thing.

478
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:06,130
It seems demonic,

479
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,770
endangering his life.

480
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,130
What should we do then?

481
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:19,890
Physician Xue, please do your utmost
to treat Jinyuan.

482
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:24,730
I'll write some prescriptions
to stabilize the vital energy first.

483
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,920
Perhaps there might be a turnaround.

484
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:30,050
Alright, Physician Xue,
just write the prescriptions,

485
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,420
and I'll do my best
to prepare everything.

486
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:34,010
This medicine needs
to be brewed by me personally.

487
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,650
Mrs. Liu,

488
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,410
please prepare a small kitchen for me.

489
00:31:37,410 --> 00:31:39,520
All equipment must be brand new

490
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,040
and must not be tainted with any grease.

491
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,370
Alright, alright.

492
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:44,730
Someone,

493
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:46,820
follow Physician Xue to prepare.

494
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,660
Thank you, Mrs. Liu.

495
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:49,090
Please stay.

496
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,500
Tiannan,

497
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:54,970
thank you for bringing Physician Xue here
to treat Jinyuan.

498
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,160
I don't know how to thank you enough.

499
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,650
We're all family here.

500
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:02,520
This child never causes trouble
for anyone,

501
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,440
unlike that naughty girl.

502
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,200
Don't say that.

503
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:10,440
I think she's matured a lot
since she came back this time.

504
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,090
Whenever she caused trouble,
she would hide here.

505
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,970
This time

506
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:18,890
I came to bring her home.

507
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,740
If you take her back alone,

508
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:22,680
it might not work.

509
00:32:23,130 --> 00:32:25,250
You might need to take them both back.

510
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:26,890
What?

511
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,370
Is she still mingling with that brat?

512
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:34,090
No way.

513
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:36,520
That boy has another woman in his heart.

514
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,090
My daughter shouldn't have
to suffer this indignity.

515
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,610
But I see they get along quite well.

516
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,680
Mr. Li has not mentioned any other girl.

517
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,820
Jinyuan,

518
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:50,920
is this true?

519
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,010
Uncle,

520
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,370
in this life,

521
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:02,800
Li probably won't be concerned
with Miss Zhao anymore.

522
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,440
Then I am relieved.

523
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:05,970
Auntie, Jinyuan.

524
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,940
Master Lin.

525
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,730
Dad, how can you just show up like this?

526
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,370
Auntie,

527
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:16,200
why didn't you tell me in advance?

528
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,200
If I hadn't come,

529
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,090
would you have completely
forgotten about me?

530
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,280
We're all family.

531
00:33:30,170 --> 00:33:32,730
Yueru, speak gently.

532
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:42,490
Yueru, you've been away
from home for so long.

533
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:44,650
I've come to the capital
with Physician Xue

534
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,610
to treat Jinyuan,

535
00:33:47,370 --> 00:33:49,680
and afterward,
you'll come home with me.

536
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:50,740
I don't want to go back.

537
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,580
Nonsense!

538
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,440
You promised me

539
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,090
that once you found Miss Zhao,

540
00:33:55,770 --> 00:33:57,010
you would come home immediately.

541
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,890
What Miss Zhao?

542
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,490
Uncle,

543
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:09,610
I'm a bit tired.

544
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,040
You've had a long journey.

545
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,370
Why not go back to your room
to rest first?

546
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:18,560
We can talk later.

547
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:20,170
Mother,

548
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:24,450
prepare some food and drink
for Uncle and Physician Xue.

549
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:27,610
Rest assured. I will do it immediately.

550
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:29,690
Alright.

551
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,090
We'll do as Jinyuan says.

552
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,450
Li,

553
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:35,130
help me back to my room.

554
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,380
Alright.

555
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:41,250
Yueru.

556
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:51,890
Give me some money.

557
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,800
Go away, go away.

558
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:56,000
What's wrong with you? Why hit me?

559
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:01,650
Come see this.

560
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,780
You've broken my family heirloom.

561
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,620
You have to compensate me!

562
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:09,960
Sorry, I didn't mean to.

563
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,210
How much do you want?

564
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,000
How much do you have?

565
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,760
I don't have money,

566
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:20,800
but I do have a lot

567
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,060
of these heirloom bowls.

568
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,490
I can compensate you
with as many as you want.

569
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:27,850
Kind sir, please be generous,

570
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,930
and give me some money.

571
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:33,970
Sir,

572
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:36,000
in these times,

573
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,650
this little money

574
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,280
can't even buy a block of tofu.

575
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,960
So, how much do you really want?

576
00:35:42,850 --> 00:35:44,850
Look, I'm not just asking
for your money for nothing.

577
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,020
If you're willing to give me

578
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,320
half the money you have on you,

579
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:53,800
I'll tell you a shocking secret.

580
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,060
How about that?

581
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:58,320
Let's hear it.

582
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,540
The son of Mr. Liu

583
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,090
married a gentle

584
00:36:03,090 --> 00:36:04,690
and compliant wife recently, right?

585
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,410
But since getting married,

586
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:09,410
his health has worsened day by day.

587
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:12,240
So, everyone outside says,

588
00:36:12,810 --> 00:36:14,370
she is a demon

589
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:16,810
who sucks the vital energy from people.

590
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,760
You're talking nonsense!

591
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,800
I saw it with my own eyes.

592
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:22,650
One night,

593
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,410
as I was passing by the back gate
of the Lius' garden,

594
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,800
I saw Mrs. Cai
fly out from the back garden

595
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:30,760
towards the forest,

596
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,650
almost as if she had wings on her back.

597
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,410
And there were a bunch
of butterflies around her.

598
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,000
Here are the two coins I have.

599
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,170
Weren't you asking for half?

600
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:53,410
Here you go.

601
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:55,970
I...

602
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,170
I've really wasted my time.

603
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:07,380
It smells so good.

604
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:08,900
Yueru,

605
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:11,930
what were you and Uncle
talking about just now?

606
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,370
What else could it be?

607
00:37:16,130 --> 00:37:17,800
He just wants me to go back.

608
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,720
And what did you say?

609
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,320
I have more important things to do,

610
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,940
and if I'm to go back, it won't be now.

611
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,560
Uncle is just looking out for you.

612
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,850
Stop being childish.

613
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:33,490
I know.

614
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,090
Don't worry, Jinyuan.

615
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,790
The most important thing
for you now is to recover.

616
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:46,170
You little rat,
where have you sneaked off to again?

617
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,410
What do you mean by "sneaked off"?

618
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:49,650
I just couldn't stand
the stuffiness here,

619
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:51,130
so I went for a stroll in the street.

620
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,320
Given the cold weather,

621
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,090
I've prepared some floral tea.

622
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,130
Mr. Li, have a few sips

623
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,960
to warm up.

624
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,720
Please, Mr. Li.

625
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,320
In all my years at Xiaoyao Inn,

626
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,410
I've never seen such delicate floral tea.

627
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,850
This peony is so well cared for.

628
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:17,350
Mrs. Scholar, it seems you're quite adept
at planting and tending to flowers.

629
00:38:17,370 --> 00:38:18,520
Mr. Li, you must be joking.

630
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:21,240
These peonies are just casually planted.

631
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,700
It's Jinyuan who loves
and cares for the flowers.

632
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:24,700
He often tells me

633
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:26,850
the stories and origins of these flowers,

634
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,980
which is how I know
there is much to learn about them.

635
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,930
You can grow them so well even casually?

636
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,500
That's really impressive.

637
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,170
It's just about caring for the flowers.

638
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,930
Cai Yi may not have learned floriculture,

639
00:38:40,310 --> 00:38:42,090
but she understands the nature
of flowers quite well.

640
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,720
After she came,

641
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,890
she cultivated many famous varieties
of peonies.

642
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:49,760
When the flowers bloom,

643
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,170
the fragrance

644
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,560
fills the garden,

645
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,480
and colorful butterflies flutter about,
just like a fairyland.

646
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,610
At this moment,

647
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,890
I truly understood

648
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,750
the delight of Zhuangzi's dream
about the butterfly.

649
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,170
You've had a hard time lately.

650
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,690
Why are you peeking at my sister-in-law?

651
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,540
It's nothing.

652
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:24,890
I just think that Mrs. Scholar

653
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,760
knows a lot about plants and insects.

654
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,890
You think she's like you,

655
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,000
knowing nothing and being clumsy?

656
00:39:43,650 --> 00:39:44,490
You're flattering me.

657
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:47,210
Let me add some more tea for you.

658
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:55,170
Miss Yueru and Mr. Li,

659
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:56,570
the meal is ready.

660
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,690
Mrs. Liu is calling you over.

661
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,060
Alright.

662
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:01,850
Jinyuan, Mrs. Cai, we'll go ahead then.

663
00:40:01,850 --> 00:40:02,690
Go ahead.

664
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,210
Where's my dad?

665
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:23,930
Your father went
to meet friends in the capital.

666
00:40:24,170 --> 00:40:25,240
You go ahead and eat.

667
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,930
Let's eat, Auntie.

668
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:34,730
Mrs. Yun,

669
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:36,720
where

670
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,210
is Mrs. Scholar from?

671
00:40:38,410 --> 00:40:39,480
She's from Suzhou City.

672
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:40,540
Suzhou City?

673
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:42,410
Then you must be quite familiar.

674
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:43,890
I haven't met her.

675
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,740
She's so outstanding,

676
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,280
and you haven't even heard of her?

677
00:40:48,410 --> 00:40:49,650
That's not strange.

678
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:51,890
It means she is a lady of a noble family,

679
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:53,000
seldom stepping out of the house.

680
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,300
Mrs. Yun,

681
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:58,090
how did Scholar and Mrs. Scholar

682
00:40:58,090 --> 00:40:59,210
get married?

683
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:01,720
Why so many questions?

684
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,930
Just curious.

685
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:06,850
Cai Yi

686
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,090
was traveling with her family

687
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:12,280
when they were attacked by bandits.

688
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:15,000
She was the only one
who fortuitously escaped.

689
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:19,520
Later, she ended up in the capital

690
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,320
and became a servant in our house.

691
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,090
So,

692
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:26,650
it sounds like her experience
is quite pitiable.

693
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:30,720
I never thought she could
be such a perfect match for Jinyuan.

694
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:32,380
Ideally,

695
00:41:33,170 --> 00:41:34,520
if Jinyuan were well,

696
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:36,130
they could

697
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:38,480
have had a happy life together.

698
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,170
- Auntie...
- But...

699
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,460
Since Physician Xue is here,

700
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:45,060
Jinyuan is blessed by good fortune

701
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:46,610
and should recover soon.

702
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:51,860
Good child.

703
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:56,690
Today,

704
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:58,700
I've invited a Taoist priest
from Sanqing Abbey

705
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:00,170
to our home to remove evil spirits.

706
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:02,240
It's time for him to arrive.

707
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,520
You go ahead and eat.

708
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,960
I need to go greet him.

709
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,040
With such skill,

710
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:17,970
who could it be?

711
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,560
Did Cai Yi ask you
to pick herbs last night?

712
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:27,650
Li Xiaoyao, why do you keep asking
about my sister-in-law?

713
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:28,860
What are you implying?

714
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:32,650
Come on.

715
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:33,890
Let's see how this Taoist priest

716
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:35,410
exorcises demons.

717
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:36,740
Don't go yet.

718
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,210
