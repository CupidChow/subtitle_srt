00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 14=

3
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,140
Chief.

4
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:52,970
Look,

5
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,280
there's a severe drought
everywhere in Nanzhao.

6
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,130
Only here,

7
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:58,850
the water flows endlessly.

8
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,250
This is

9
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,210
the opportunity I have been waiting for
for ten years.

10
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,600
Finally, it's here.

11
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,690
Ling'er, why are you in my room?

12
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,530
A'nu,

13
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:38,450
did you and Tang Yu
go to the Governor's residence?

14
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,450
Yes, we did.

15
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,250
Are you hiding something from me?

16
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,770
No, Ling'er.

17
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,640
What could I possibly hide from you?

18
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,450
Then I'll ask Tang Yu.

19
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,940
Ling'er,

20
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,810
actually, we didn't go
to the Governor's residence.

21
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,170
We went to the Treasure Pavilion

22
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,450
to find the hair tie for you.

23
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,660
Thank you,

24
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,300
A'nu.

25
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,690
That hair tie

26
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,920
was given to me by Xiaoyao.

27
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,100
Losing it

28
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,410
might just be fate.

29
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,180
We also saw Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yueru

30
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,690
being taken to the yamen as thieves.

31
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:40,220
Ling'er!

32
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:41,840
Get inside, quickly.

33
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,250
Take it slow.

34
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,580
How are you doing?

35
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:48,960
What could possibly happen to me?

36
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,940
Just minor injuries.

37
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:53,050
Okay, okay.

38
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,280
It's nothing compared to the wound
when you stabbed me that time. Look.

39
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,640
Stop showing off and sit down.

40
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,530
Take off your clothes.

41
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,360
Take off my clothes? Why?

42
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,850
How can I apply medicine
if you don't take off your clothes?

43
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,050
This is a special medicine
from the Lin Fortress.

44
00:04:22,050 --> 00:04:23,570
My dad always makes me carry it.

45
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,600
Thank you, Miss Lin.

46
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,690
But I can apply the medicine myself.

47
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,440
Why are you dilly-dallying?

48
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,700
Li Xiaoyao, I'll help you take it off.

49
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,540
No, no,

50
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,010
I'll do it.

51
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:36,570
I'll do it myself.

52
00:04:56,890 --> 00:04:57,810
Let me help you.

53
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:14,970
Just apply medicine.

54
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,680
Don't take this
as an opportunity for revenge.

55
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,410
Why would I seek revenge?

56
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,880
You're quite enduring, aren't you?

57
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,760
I'm just getting started.

58
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,570
Stop hitting him!

59
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,410
Li Xiaoyao!

60
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,160
Stop hitting him!

61
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,160
Did you get hurt?

62
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:56,810
If so, apply some to yourself too.

63
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,170
Ling'er!

64
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:16,730
Ling'er!

65
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,860
Ling'er, don't be too anxious.

66
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,700
Li Xiaoyao was just caught
by the Governor.

67
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,940
With his martial arts, he'll be fine.

68
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,130
Let's go back, okay?

69
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,120
Besides, I believe,

70
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,580
since Li Xiaoyao could follow us here,

71
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,090
he must care about you.

72
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,010
(Maybe he'll end up
carrying too many burdens)

73
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,410
(and won't be able to act freely
as a hero anymore.)

74
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,260
A'nu,

75
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,760
I want to go see

76
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:56,970
if they're alright.

77
00:07:07,730 --> 00:07:08,690
This little bug

78
00:07:09,050 --> 00:07:11,420
is what Tang Yu used last time
to confuse the official

79
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,700
and let us into the Treasure Pavilion.

80
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,760
With it, we'll surely be able
to enter the yamen.

81
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,530
Thank you, A'nu.

82
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,040
I'll be right back.

83
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,320
I'll go with you.

84
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:25,850
Your Highness,

85
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,290
we'll wait for you at the door.

86
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:37,980
Li Xiaoyao,

87
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,810
are you asleep?

88
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:51,780
What's wrong?

89
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,220
Cold...

90
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,320
Cold...

91
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,810
It's so hot.

92
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,540
Don't go,

93
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,730
Ling'er.

94
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:20,660
Don't go.

95
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,130
Get up.

96
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:33,130
Come on.

97
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:35,980
Slow down, slow down.

98
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,180
Don't go.

99
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,090
Ling'er.

100
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,660
Li Xiaoyao,

101
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,050
what am I to you

102
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,050
in your heart?

103
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,680
I finally understand

104
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:30,220
how important
that hair tie was to Ling'er.

105
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,240
These feelings

106
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,640
can't just be put aside so easily.

107
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,560
You talk as if you know all about it.

108
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,880
Why have you
always played only one tune?

109
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,930
I'm your young master.
You must answer me.

110
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,890
Because I like it.

111
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,240
Do you like this tune,

112
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,440
or is it

113
00:10:20,290 --> 00:10:21,800
a girl

114
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:23,020
who taught you?

115
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
Yes.

116
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,730
That girl is so unfortunate

117
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:36,320
to be liked by someone
as cold as you.

118
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:39,370
My Lady, what does the girl I like
have to do with you?

119
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,370
In the future, I'll treat her
a hundred times better,

120
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,440
so you needn't worry.

121
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,780
Here you go.

122
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,780
Ling'er,

123
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,800
how are they?

124
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,760
Xiaoyao

125
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,440
is injured.

126
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,730
It's okay, it's okay. They'll be alright.

127
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:14,120
Let's go back and think of a solution.

128
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,420
Let's go.

129
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,290
Have you heard?

130
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,780
Just now,

131
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:24,490
they said a thief sneaked
into the Treasure Pavilion tonight

132
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,120
and looted all their treasures.

133
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,460
It's said that even the Governor's bead

134
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,640
was stolen.

135
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:31,290
Fortunately, he and his men

136
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:33,340
caught two thieves on the spot.

137
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:35,930
The Governor, out of desperation,

138
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,490
had to promise

139
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:40,730
to execute the two thieves in three days

140
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,000
to calm the public outrage.

141
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,100
Really?

142
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,410
Absolutely true.

143
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,530
But after all this commotion,

144
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:52,320
how did the female thief turn out
to be a male thief and a female thief?

145
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,580
That female thief

146
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,440
must have a lover, right?

147
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,680
A man and a woman...

148
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:09,760
Dear gentlemen,

149
00:12:10,290 --> 00:12:12,930
it's said that Yangzhou City
is troubled by a female thief,

150
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,530
so where do these male
and female thieves come from?

151
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,780
Well, come.

152
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,010
Waiter,

153
00:12:22,820 --> 00:12:24,800
bring any good wine and dishes
straight to this table.

154
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,260
All on me.

155
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,880
Alright, sir, just a moment.

156
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:30,410
Come, have a seat.

157
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:32,970
Nice to meet you.

158
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:33,810
Nice to meet you too.

159
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,440
The capture of the thieves
is indeed a cause for celebration,

160
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,850
but I,

161
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,850
have loved hearing stories
of heroes and thieves.

162
00:12:47,650 --> 00:12:49,440
Hearing about this thief
in Yangzhou City,

163
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:51,000
I specifically came

164
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,140
to see what a real thief

165
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,490
looks like.

166
00:12:55,530 --> 00:12:56,370
Tell me.

167
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,290
What sort of extraordinary skills

168
00:12:58,290 --> 00:13:00,050
does this notorious thief have?

169
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,560
My friend who works there said

170
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,090
that the female thief

171
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:08,290
was disguised as an ordinary maid.

172
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:12,850
What about the male thief?

173
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,000
The male thief

174
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,640
looked just like

175
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,320
a servant.

176
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:25,880
I wonder

177
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:29,200
if you could possibly do me a favor.

178
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,610
You're not asking me

179
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:41,490
to help you rescue them, are you?

180
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,240
I'm not capable of doing that.

181
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,760
How could that be?

182
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:51,490
I only hope you can introduce me

183
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,530
to your friend who works at the yamen.

184
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,580
If possible,

185
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,970
I'd like to visit the jail

186
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,640
to meet those thieves in person.

187
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:00,320
It would

188
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,410
fulfill a dream of mine.

189
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,880
To tell you the truth,

190
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,730
even if you asked our friend,
it wouldn't work.

191
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:13,340
He's a clerk under the Secretary General

192
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,120
and doesn't have jurisdiction
over the prison.

193
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:18,290
Then what should I do?

194
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:31,760
However, there might be a way.

195
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:33,680
Yes, yes, yes.

196
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:36,930
Please enlighten me.

197
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:40,120
I can have my friend pass a message
to the Secretary General.

198
00:14:40,290 --> 00:14:41,320
In that way,

199
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:44,000
your dream might come true.

200
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,170
Yes, yes, yes.

201
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,320
Thank you so much.

202
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:50,970
May I ask how much money
would be appropriate

203
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:53,200
for the gift to this Secretary General?

204
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,320
That's where you're mistaken.

205
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:59,320
The Secretary General is most fond
of Common Hermit's calligraphy.

206
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,370
To get him to do something,

207
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:02,730
ordinary items

208
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,370
won't catch his eye.

209
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:06,800
Is this Hermit's calligraphy
very precious?

210
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,120
Extremely rare.

211
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,780
Only a few pieces of his calligraphy

212
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,850
are circulated in the market,

213
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:14,760
and no one has ever seen his true face.

214
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,680
What should I do then?

215
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,050
That's why

216
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:25,560
we can only pass the message.

217
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:29,530
You'll have to figure out what to do
about the calligraphy.

218
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:33,760
Alright, thank you for your help.

219
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,170
Of course, of course.

220
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,410
Thank you, all three of you.

221
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:51,940
Liu Jinyuan, Mr. Liu!

222
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:53,050
Miss A'nu.

223
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,000
Miss Ling'er.

224
00:15:55,530 --> 00:15:56,370
Mr. Tang.

225
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,530
You're indeed in Yangzhou City.

226
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:00,610
Enjoy your meal.

227
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,200
Li went to great lengths
to find Miss Zhao.

228
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:07,330
Unexpectedly,

229
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:09,200
we're staying in the same inn.

230
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,580
Mr. Liu, do you know

231
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,700
that Li Xiaoyao and Lin Yueru

232
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,450
were arrested
by the Yangzhou authorities?

233
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,730
I have heard.

234
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,730
The Governor ordered them

235
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:23,090
to be executed in three days.

236
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,320
Execute in three days?

237
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,370
What kind of official is this?

238
00:16:30,530 --> 00:16:32,090
Without a proper inquiry,
he decides to execute.

239
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,490
Right now, the urgent task

240
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,200
is to devise a plan to save them.

241
00:16:35,850 --> 00:16:37,800
I have a good idea.

242
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,850
Would you like to hear it?

243
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:43,980
My Lady,

244
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,120
storming the jail is not a good idea.

245
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,380
I haven't even spoken yet.

246
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:52,170
How do you know
it's about storming the jail?

247
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:53,810
Just guessing.

248
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,650
I think you're just scared
and dare not storm the jail.

249
00:16:56,650 --> 00:16:57,680
The layout of the yamen

250
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,370
has been explored by Princess Ling'er.

251
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:02,410
The jail is underground
with several doors,

252
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,250
each guarded by numerous soldiers.

253
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:06,770
Though the phantom insects
can bewitch the soldiers,

254
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:07,850
its effect is limited.

255
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,700
If we attack forcefully,

256
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,250
we'll surely draw
more officials and soldiers.

257
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:12,460
By then,

258
00:17:12,820 --> 00:17:14,680
it would only further prove
their identity as thieves.

259
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:20,610
Tang Yu makes sense.

260
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:21,920
Let's not rush.

261
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,400
Storming the jail is the last resort.

262
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:25,730
I think

263
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,890
we should find the real female thief

264
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:30,770
to clear Li and Yueru's names.

265
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,160
That said,

266
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,010
Yangzhou City is so vast,

267
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:40,040
and the female thief's whereabouts
are unknown.

268
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,890
How do we find her?

269
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,800
Now that the treasures have been stolen,

270
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:55,130
I guess

271
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,010
the female thief must have
hidden the treasures somewhere.

272
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,650
If we can find those stolen treasures,

273
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,400
we can find the female thief.

274
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:07,610
The Spiritual Bead!

275
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,000
We can use the Sacred Spiritual Bead
to find the Spiritual Bead.

276
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:11,850
This way,

277
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,850
we'll know where
the treasures are hidden.

278
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,730
Good idea.

279
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:19,280
Let's split up.

280
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:21,490
Mr. Liu, you're the current
Number One Scholar.

281
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,200
The Governor will surely
have some apprehensions.

282
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:26,050
Maybe you can buy us some time
to find the Spiritual Bead.

283
00:18:26,050 --> 00:18:27,010
Mr. Tang is right.

284
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,010
I'll meet with the Governor.

285
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,970
Why isn't the Sacred
Spiritual Bead reacting?

286
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,730
This is already the highest place
in Yangzhou City.

287
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:49,010
The aura should be very pure,

288
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,010
so why can't it sense the wind spirit?

289
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,850
Could it be that it was broken?

290
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,800
You saw that female thief

291
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,250
steal the Spiritual Bead.

292
00:19:00,010 --> 00:19:02,200
Yangzhou is currently under lockdown,

293
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,440
the Spiritual Bead should still be
within the city.

294
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:06,650
Where exactly did that female thief

295
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,400
hide the Spiritual Bead?

296
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,970
Whether intentionally or unintentionally,

297
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:14,090
the person who stole it
must have used some method

298
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,560
to block the wind spirit.

299
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:20,800
What could block spiritual energy?

300
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:33,090
Why can't I think of anything?

301
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,370
Bold thief!

302
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:06,740
How dare you still be in the mood
to paint at death's door?

303
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,200
- Search here!
- Yes.

304
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,130
This...

305
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,520
Everyone, out!

306
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,400
Out! Out!

307
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,460
- Yes.
- Yes.

308
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,730
Common...

309
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,680
Common Hermit.

310
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:54,280
That's me.

311
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:55,890
Sir,

312
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,490
are you truly the Common Hermit?

313
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,440
Please forgive my ignorance.

314
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,520
I deeply admire

315
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,010
your splashed-ink landscapes,

316
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,970
truly unparalleled in this world.

317
00:21:07,050 --> 00:21:08,010
Your calligraphy

318
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,970
has captivated people far and wide.

319
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,680
To meet you here

320
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,920
is indeed

321
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,340
a fortunate event in my life.

322
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:20,330
If at dawn I learn of and tread the way,
I can face death at dusk.

323
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:21,500
You're flattering me.

324
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,250
Since you admire it so much,

325
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,890
how about I gift this painting to you?

326
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,440
I am unworthy
of such a treasure from you.

327
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:35,730
Upon my return,

328
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:40,680
I will surely worship this treasure
with incense and a bath.

329
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,010
However,

330
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,010
with such a reputation,

331
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,250
how come you're seen
with those two thieves?

332
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,580
This...

333
00:22:01,650 --> 00:22:02,730
After all,

334
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:04,970
I am serving the court,

335
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,490
and everything requires an explanation.

336
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,680
What are you thinking?

337
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:18,850
A couple of days ago, on my way
from Suzhou to Yangzhou,

338
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,400
I was attacked by bandits.

339
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:23,010
It was those two who rescued me.

340
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:25,920
Their character is clear to me,
more than anyone's.

341
00:22:26,290 --> 00:22:29,130
Moreover, the chaos caused by the female thief
in Yangzhou City has lasted long.

342
00:22:29,410 --> 00:22:30,370
How could those two

343
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:33,770
be the male and female thieves?

344
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,700
But,

345
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:47,890
the Governor set a trap
in the Treasure Pavilion

346
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,730
and captured them on the spot.

347
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:51,770
How could this be false?

348
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:56,400
While that may be true,

349
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,680
those two

350
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,220
have saved my life after all.

351
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,340
Sir,

352
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,730
you seem to be a person of understanding.

353
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:07,770
Could you possibly do me a favor?

354
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,340
(Fu Chun Inn)

355
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,440
Sir,

356
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:19,090
I'm just carrying out my duties

357
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,730
and have no real power.

358
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:24,130
Moreover, this matter
is of great importance.

359
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,890
Please forgive

360
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,890
my inability to help.

361
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:30,610
What are you thinking, sir?

362
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:34,680
I merely wish to see
the Governor privately,

363
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,820
to plead for a favor

364
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:38,280
and meet those two,

365
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,090
so I can express my gratitude

366
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:42,320
and repay

367
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,970
the life-saving grace.

368
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,660
(Common Hermit)

369
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:56,650
Sir, you truly are kind-hearted.

370
00:23:58,340 --> 00:23:59,370
Then, I entrust this matter

371
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,800
to you, sir.

372
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,400
It's nothing, nothing at all.

373
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:06,660
Since

374
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,560
you have put it that way,

375
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,920
I'll definitely help you with this.

376
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:24,730
When do you
and your boss plan to release us?

377
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,680
I'm talking to you.
Are you listening to me?

378
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:32,860
You have kept us here without a word.

379
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,730
What's the meaning of this?

380
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,280
Hurry up and release us.

381
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,010
Is anyone there?

382
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:40,090
Release us! Do you hear me?

383
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,730
Li Xiaoyao,

384
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:45,160
what time is it,

385
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,090
and you still have the appetite to eat?

386
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,610
If you don't eat, you'll be hungry.
You should eat something too.

387
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,130
I have no appetite.

388
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,700
It's truly Yangzhou City.

389
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,370
Even the food for prisoners is so great.

390
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:55,210
There's even wine.

391
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,800
This can't be...

392
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:11,850
It's impossible.

393
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,130
Even if it's theft,
it would only lead to imprisonment,

394
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:15,100
not beheading.

395
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,040
But nothing happened for so long.

396
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:19,850
Could it be my cousin
has been captured as well?

397
00:25:20,650 --> 00:25:21,920
That would certainly not happen.

398
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:23,460
Once Scholar reveals his identity,

399
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:25,440
the Governor will surely listen.

400
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:41,580
(Yamen of Yangzhou City)

401
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,820
Is the Governor here?

402
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,250
Yes, he's in the back hall.

403
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:45,250
Sir, please follow me.

404
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,700
(Yamen of Yangzhou City)

405
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,280
I wonder where Ling'er is.

406
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,200
Could she also be in Yangzhou City?

407
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,890
If Ling'er is in Yangzhou City,

408
00:25:57,050 --> 00:25:58,800
knowing we have been imprisoned
trying to find her,

409
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,090
she would definitely come to save me.

410
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,980
Stop flattering yourself.

411
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,250
If anyone is to be saved, it would be me.

412
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,410
The one flattering themselves
is clearly you.

413
00:26:05,410 --> 00:26:06,650
If Ling'er really cared about you,

414
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:07,650
why would she leave without...

415
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,680
Li Xiaoyao,

416
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,680
do you really like Ling'er?

417
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,400
Isn't it obvious?

418
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,980
Then,

419
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:38,920
does Ling'er

420
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,040
like you too?

421
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,250
Naturally.

422
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,430
Can't you see that, or is there
something wrong with your eyes?

423
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,890
I... I have a question.

424
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:57,890
But let me make it clear first.

425
00:26:58,170 --> 00:26:59,610
I'm just curious.

426
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,730
Go ahead.

427
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:06,610
If...

428
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,200
I mean if,

429
00:27:08,890 --> 00:27:09,890
in the future,

430
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,850
someone else happens to

431
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:14,320
like you too...

432
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,410
Impossible.

433
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:18,160
Someone like me
could only be liked by Ling'er.

434
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:21,400
But what if that happens?

435
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,700
If that happens,

436
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,160
I can only say that person
has made a mistake.

437
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:32,280
They shouldn't waste
their feelings on me.

438
00:27:34,770 --> 00:27:36,160
My feelings for Ling'er

439
00:27:37,010 --> 00:27:38,160
will never change.

440
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,920
You're right.

441
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:07,370
Please come in.

442
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,920
So, you caught
the accomplice of the thieves?

443
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:13,800
Sir.

444
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,770
It's you?

445
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,440
Why did you bring him to the back hall?

446
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,820
Sir, I have something to say.

447
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,740
Speak in the main hall.

448
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:27,400
Guards, take him to the main hall.

449
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,180
Sir,

450
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,740
this gentleman is the Common Hermit.

451
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,050
What Common Hermit?

452
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,850
I only know
he's the accomplice of the thieves.

453
00:28:36,050 --> 00:28:36,970
Tie him up.

454
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,200
Sir, in that case,

455
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:42,970
I shall take my leave.

456
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,380
(Liu Jinyuan, Ministry of Rites)

457
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,450
This is the Letter
for the Number One Scholar.

458
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,090
How did you come into possession of this?

459
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,280
Tell me the truth.

460
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,970
Initially,

461
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,890
this wasn't mine.

462
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,130
It became mine

463
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,280
after it was bestowed by His Majesty.

464
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:23,010
Sir, this...

465
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,730
I have indeed met the Number One Scholar

466
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,200
at the imperial court.

467
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,040
This person

468
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,090
does resemble him somewhat.

469
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:38,130
Sir, if you don't believe me,

470
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,850
you can punish me.

471
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:41,970
However, this document

472
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,010
will eventually reach my father,

473
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,890
the Minister of Justice.

474
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:52,770
Mr. Scholar,

475
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,250
my apologies.

476
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,090
I hope you can forgive me.

477
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:02,250
However, I did capture those two

478
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,090
after seeing them with you.

479
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,130
They were indeed captured

480
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:12,410
at the Treasure Pavilion

481
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:14,680
when the treasures were lost.

482
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,370
I wonder

483
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,400
what the misunderstanding here is.

484
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,540
Sir,

485
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:24,200
one of them is my close friend,

486
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:26,970
and the other is my cousin
from Lin Fortress.

487
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:29,850
I can guarantee with this letter

488
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,890
that they are not thieves.

489
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,730
Mr. Scholar,

490
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,440
do you have evidence

491
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:39,700
that can lead us
to find the stolen treasures?

492
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,540
I...

493
00:30:42,370 --> 00:30:43,610
I will definitely find them.

494
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,250
Mr. Scholar,

495
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,340
the case

496
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:50,520
is clear.

497
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,370
I conduct investigations impartially.

498
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:58,400
Even if they are your close friends,

499
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:02,560
I cannot disregard our dynasty's laws.

500
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:05,610
However,

501
00:31:06,650 --> 00:31:11,370
I understand your loyalty
and righteousness.

502
00:31:11,890 --> 00:31:15,090
If you can find those treasures

503
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,180
and

504
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:19,410
capture the real female thief

505
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,700
that you claim to be,

506
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,010
I will release them.

507
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:27,320
But my decree has been distributed.

508
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:31,340
If you can't find evidence
within three days,

509
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:34,130
I will have to
uphold the original verdict.

510
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:37,460
Fine.

511
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,970
Let's do it as you say.

512
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,820
But I have one condition.

513
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:41,660
Please speak.

514
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,250
Release those two first,

515
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,940
so they can help me
find the stolen treasures.

516
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,780
That's not possible,

517
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,170
especially not when I'm the Governor here.

518
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:50,370
Releasing suspects is breaking the law.

519
00:31:50,890 --> 00:31:52,400
Don't make it difficult for me.

520
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,010
If you refuse,

521
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:55,980
I will return to the capital

522
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,780
to petition His Majesty
to investigate this matter.

523
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,050
Even if I lose my title
and end up in prison,

524
00:32:00,050 --> 00:32:02,160
I will ensure His Majesty
investigates this thoroughly

525
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,700
and clearly.

526
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,610
Are you threatening me?

527
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,280
If you think so,

528
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:08,850
then yes.

529
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,320
Fine. As you wish.

530
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,610
- Thank you, Governor.
- Wait.

531
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,920
I agree to release the man.

532
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:31,800
The female thief in Yangzhou City
is notorious.

533
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
If I release those two,

534
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,460
especially the woman,
without clearing her suspicion,

535
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,130
wouldn't that stain my reputation

536
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,290
for bending the law

537
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,280
for personal gain?

538
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,440
- Sir!
- Sir,

539
00:32:47,290 --> 00:32:50,410
the Governor agreeing to release one
is already an exception.

540
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:52,160
Please be satisfied with that.

541
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,200
Fine. Let's do it as you say.

542
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:08,650
- Yueru!
- Behave.

543
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:09,490
Yueru!

544
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,130
Jinyuan, you finally came.

545
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:12,970
- Yueru!
- Scholar.

546
00:33:12,980 --> 00:33:14,740
I told you my cousin
would come to save us.

547
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,600
What do you mean by "you told me"?
I was the one who said it.

548
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,340
Why?

549
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:21,250
Open the door.

550
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:23,050
Yueru, Yueru, it's my incompetence.

551
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:24,400
I can't free you yet.

552
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:25,920
What's happening?

553
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:29,770
The Governor

554
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:32,040
only allowed Li to be released

555
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,250
to find the stolen treasures with me.

556
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,800
Why? How can this unjust official
make such an arbitrary decision?

557
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,890
With the female thief
causing trouble in Yangzhou City,

558
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,040
they have concluded the thief

559
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,800
is a woman.

560
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,610
These corrupt officials!

561
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,860
Savage girl,

562
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,370
stay calm,
and just hold on a little longer.

563
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,580
Scholar and I

564
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,940
will capture the female thief soon.

565
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:53,010
Yueru, it's my fault.

566
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:54,520
I can't free you yet.

567
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:00,820
Silly rat,

568
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,490
you better catch
that female thief quickly.

569
00:34:04,010 --> 00:34:04,850
Don't worry.

570
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,520
You go first.

571
00:34:07,890 --> 00:34:09,170
I want to talk to my cousin a bit more.

572
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:10,900
Alright.

573
00:34:15,810 --> 00:34:16,800
Yueru, rest assured.

574
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:18,540
I will catch the female thief
as soon as possible,

575
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,090
clear your name, and rescue you.

576
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:21,900
Jinyuan,

577
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:23,410
go help Li Xiaoyao.

578
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:24,800
He's injured.

579
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:31,610
What I mean is that with his injuries,

580
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,170
he might not be able
to catch the female thief.

581
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,490
Yueru,

582
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:40,090
you have been pampered at Lin Fortress
since you were young,

583
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,480
never having suffered such indignities.

584
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,780
Don't worry.

585
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,960
I will ensure your safety.

586
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,240
You too, take care.

587
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:03,170
Come, come, have a look!

588
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,700
- New sketchbooks, very interesting!
- Osmanthus cake! Red bean cake!

589
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,810
- Come, have a look!
- Hunma cake!

590
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:10,450
Fascinating sketchbooks
you can't put down!

591
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,560
Sir, have two...

592
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:15,210
Red bean cake! Hunma cake!

593
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,650
It's you guys.

594
00:35:19,650 --> 00:35:21,930
I was thinking of visiting the inn
to ask you

595
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:24,260
about the grandeur
of the Treasure Appraisal Gathering.

596
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,100
Really.

597
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:26,930
Scammer!

598
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,300
The invitations you gave us
were all fake.

599
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,940
How could that be?

600
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,540
I paid money for them!

601
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,380
Beat him up!

602
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,410
Maybe the person who sold the invitations

603
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,220
tricked me and sold me fake invitations.

604
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,130
Such a terrible person.

605
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:45,700
I'm going to get my money back

606
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,540
and return it to you.

607
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,450
Good thing I'm fast at running.

608
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,960
Running fast?

609
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:18,410
Do you want to continue?

610
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:19,250
No, no.

611
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,000
You're great heroes.

612
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:22,580
Please spare me.

613
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,820
Sir,

614
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,240
you must also know

615
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:27,890
all the treasures from
the appraisal event have been stolen.

616
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:30,960
Our friends have been framed
and imprisoned.

617
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:33,850
Please, help us out.

618
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:35,130
Tell us

619
00:36:35,500 --> 00:36:37,890
where we can find those treasures.

620
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,850
Tell us everything you know.

621
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,410
If you can help us,

622
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,370
you won't need to repay
the money you owe us.

623
00:36:47,330 --> 00:36:48,170
I'll tell you.

624
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:49,650
I'll tell you.

625
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:52,370
With the thief's extraordinary power,

626
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,370
if she really hid those treasures,

627
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,450
it wouldn't be easy to find them.

628
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:01,240
But...

629
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:02,450
But what?

630
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:05,280
I bought this information
from someone else.

631
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,610
I can sell it to you for a lower price.

632
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,090
My Lady, beat him up.

633
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,260
Wait, wait!

634
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,610
I was just joking.

635
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,890
Just joking.

636
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:17,650
Ordinary people

637
00:37:17,890 --> 00:37:19,740
wouldn't know
where the treasures are hidden,

638
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:21,450
but I know someone

639
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,240
who can definitely help you.

640
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,060
But,

641
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,800
this person

642
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,130
is even more terrifying than the thief.

643
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,610
Who?

644
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,320
Mr. Jinba.

645
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,410
Who's Mr. Jinba?

646
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,240
He's a remarkable man in Yangzhou City.

647
00:37:45,940 --> 00:37:47,480
He has four eyes

648
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,500
and six ears,

649
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,220
and can see in all directions
and hear everything.

650
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,130
Nothing in Yangzhou City

651
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:54,060
can be kept secret from him.

652
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:56,000
It's said he can even talk to mice.

653
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,460
You're making this up again.

654
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,460
That's not a person.

655
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,650
That's a monster.

656
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:02,480
I'm going to teach you a lesson
for all this nonsense.

657
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,820
Don't!

658
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,780
It's true.

659
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,480
Is everything you said true?

660
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:18,240
If you dare to lie to us again,

661
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,850
I'll make sure you can't speak anymore.

662
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:22,370
It's true.

663
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,130
It's true.

664
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:27,090
If you don't believe me,
you can ask others.

665
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:29,780
It's true.

666
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:32,450
Where can we find this Mr. Jinba?

667
00:38:33,260 --> 00:38:35,800
It's said that
inside the city's East Gate,

668
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,760
at the southern corner of the street,
there's a Temple of the Earth God.

669
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,980
When you get there,

670
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:44,130
offer something valuable and rare,

671
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,850
and he will appear.

672
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,410
Alright, you lead us there.

673
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,300
Sure thing, sir.

674
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,760
If you need anything, just tell me.

675
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,800
Scholar, give me some money.

676
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:05,650
Mr. Li,

677
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,740
isn't it appropriate for us

678
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,130
to search a woman's room?

679
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,370
Scholar,

680
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,890
your cousin will be executed in two days.

681
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,280
Which is more important,
appropriateness or your cousin's life?

682
00:39:17,810 --> 00:39:20,040
Sir, are you to dine or stay?

683
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,410
Sir, you look familiar.

684
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,610
Were you here
with a female guest yesterday?

685
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,860
Good memory.

686
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,890
Is the guest
from Room No. 1 still here?

687
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,170
We can't disclose

688
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,650
our guests' information.

689
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,720
You are...

690
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,220
My friend here

691
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,240
is the husband
of the guest in Room No. 1.

692
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,650
He's been going out to screw around,

693
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:47,280
so his wife left in anger.

694
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,610
Knowing she's staying here,

695
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:51,370
he's come today to apologize

696
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:52,450
and mend their relationship.

697
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:55,730
Right.

698
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,650
I'm ashamed.

699
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,060
Ashamed.

700
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:01,170
Understood.

701
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,130
Rest assured. While she stayed here,

702
00:40:03,130 --> 00:40:04,560
no man came looking for her.

703
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:06,720
Thank you for your care.

704
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,610
Is my wife

705
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,370
currently in her room?

706
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,090
When we cleaned up just now,

707
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:13,650
we saw your wife in the room.

708
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,240
- Lead the way.
- Sure.

709
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,210
Let's go.

710
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:29,900
Be careful!

711
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:14,780
Scholar.

712
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:15,620
What happened?

713
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,850
She escaped.

714
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,890
It seems they're trying to silence us

715
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,850
to prevent us from
investigating further.

716
00:41:22,850 --> 00:41:24,760
Did you find anything in the room?

717
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:26,930
I have checked. Nothing unusual.

718
00:41:27,890 --> 00:41:29,260
Think back carefully.

719
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,850
When you were following her that day,

720
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:32,040
did you see anything?

721
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,930
That day,

722
00:41:35,260 --> 00:41:36,260
savage girl and I

723
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,130
followed the female thief here.

724
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:39,000
She was

725
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,480
about to undress...

726
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,140
And then?

727
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:48,130
Then your cousin covered my eyes.

728
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,450
By the time she let go,
the thief was gone.

729
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:51,500
We followed her to the Treasure Pavilion,

730
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:52,760
and you know the rest.

731
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:57,060
What are you doing?

732
00:41:57,410 --> 00:41:58,960
She covered my eyes!

733
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:07,650
You have a faint fragrance on you.

734
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:09,700
I? Fragrance? How could I possibly...

735
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,540
Stop.

736
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,170
What are you doing?

737
00:42:16,850 --> 00:42:18,680
You have picked up the scent
of the person in black.

738
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:29,720
We have a clue now.
Remember this scent.
