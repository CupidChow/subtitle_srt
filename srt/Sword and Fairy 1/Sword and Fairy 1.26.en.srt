00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,780
=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,890
This has exhausted me completely.

4
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,850
I wonder if I owed you in the past life.

5
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,810
No, no.

6
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,000
I'm already like this. Please don't rain.

7
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,100
(Xingtang Temple)
Is there anyone here?

8
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:16,720
Is there anyone here?

9
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:18,900
Is there anyone here?

10
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,250
Could someone please open the door?

11
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,840
Is there anyone here?

12
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,920
(Xingtang Temple)
Hang in there a bit longer.

13
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,850
Sir, could you let us in
to shelter from the rain?

14
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,990
We need a place to stay for the night.

15
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,720
You may come in,

16
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,840
but it's not very convenient

17
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,100
for this lady to stay in the temple.

18
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:41,210
Sir, my friend is sick
and got caught in the rain.

19
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,890
Please make an exception. Please.

20
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:46,760
Amitabha Buddha.

21
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,300
Then come in.

22
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,170
Thank you, sir.

23
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,250
A'nu,

24
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,530
Tang Yu,

26
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:54,840
you've finally returned.

27
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,860
A'nu,

28
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:08,480
how are you?

29
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,250
I'm fine. It's good that you're back.

30
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,450
You...

31
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:25,440
Don't cry.

32
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,530
Look, I'm really fine.

33
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:30,660
Master miraculously healed me

34
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,790
with the Golden Silkworm King,

35
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,410
otherwise, I would have been dead.

36
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:37,730
A'nu,

37
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,200
it's all my fault.

38
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,250
What does it have to do with you?

39
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,210
It's all because
of that ruthless Bai Yue.

40
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,360
That old man Mr. Shi...

41
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,660
Alright.

42
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:01,920
Drink your medicine.

43
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
No.

44
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,090
It's so bitter.

45
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:13,390
You can have orange peel candy
after you take the medicine.

46
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:27,760
It's really sweet.

47
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:37,010
Drink your medicine.

48
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:43,880
You traitor.

49
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:55,570
I thought you came to see me,

50
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,320
but it turns out
you're my master's envoy.

51
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:04,090
The Sacred Maid had no choice,

52
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,260
so...

53
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,760
Put down the medicine.
I have something to ask you.

54
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:19,330
What is it?

55
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:27,940
Are you

56
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,810
keeping something from me?

57
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,530
Thank you, Master,
for granting me spiritual power.

58
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:36,200
I am willing to search
for the other Spiritual Beads for you.

59
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,360
Please let me out of the tower.

60
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,820
Master,

61
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:45,160
searching for the Spiritual Beads
is crucial.

62
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,040
I dare not delay.

63
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,760
Please guide me
on how to leave the tower.

64
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:54,540
By accepting my magical power,

65
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,810
you will become half-human
and half-demon.

66
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,980
No demon

67
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,530
can leave this Demon-Locking Tower.

68
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:05,040
This was your choice.

69
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,810
From now on,

70
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,140
you will stay with me,

71
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,570
guarding this Demon-Locking Tower.

72
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,940
What?

73
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,130
Master!

74
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,010
Master!

75
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,290
Master!

76
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:38,180
(Xingtang Temple)

77
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,200
I'm going to kill you!

78
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,730
I'm going to kill you!

79
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,320
This poison shows no signs of weakening.

80
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:13,560
What should I do?

81
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:14,690
Water...

82
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,640
Water...

83
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,440
You were just now shouting to kill,

84
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,680
and now you've got a fever?

85
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,320
Water...

86
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,570
Hot water.

87
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:36,980
- Hot water.
- Water...

88
00:09:58,650 --> 00:10:00,120
I'm turning into your maid.

89
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,860
Water.

90
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,780
Water.

91
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,740
Alright, alright.

92
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:20,970
This water is very hot.

93
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,170
Be careful that it's hot.

94
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,640
- Careful.
- No more. No more.

95
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:27,860
No more.

96
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:31,090
You're the one asking for water,

97
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,290
and you're the one who's refusing it.

98
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,760
It saves you from making a fuss later.

99
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:13,000
Why do I always feel

100
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:17,240
like something's missing?

101
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,100
A'nu,

102
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,540
I...

103
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,530
If you can't remember,

104
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:39,370
then let me help you recall.

105
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,880
You once said

106
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,240
that a girl about six
or seven years old saved you.

107
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,780
How could such a small girl

108
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,800
save you?

109
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,090
Are you making it up?

110
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:50,890
A'nu,

111
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,170
that was ten years ago.

112
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,730
- Ten years ago?
- At that time...

113
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,170
I thought I would never find her again.

114
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,800
Isn't she now about sixteen or seventeen?

115
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:08,970
Definitely a liar.

116
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:17,880
You're still laughing.

117
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,610
Alright then, go find her.

118
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:22,970
Go find your beloved,

119
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:24,340
and play the leaf whistle
to her every day.

120
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,060
A'nu,

121
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,730
that girl I've been thinking about

122
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,970
is right in front of me now.

123
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,090
What now? What in front of you?

124
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,000
What are you saying?

125
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,240
That girl I've been thinking about

126
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,300
is you.

127
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,620
Me?

128
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:34,200
You're not just

129
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,880
saying this to make me

130
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,290
take my medicine, are you?

131
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,170
When you saved me back then,

132
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,240
you hummed a little tune.

133
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:53,290
Only you know that tune.

134
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,800
What's wrong?

135
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,540
Nothing.

136
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:29,730
Tang Yu, come help me
prepare the medicine.

137
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:30,570
Alright.

138
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,800
You haven't finished it.

139
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,250
A'nu,

140
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,730
you rest well for now.

141
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:39,050
Tang Yu...

142
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:09,260
(Xingtang Temple)

143
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:10,100
Miss!

144
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,930
- Stop!
- Amitabha Buddha.

145
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,800
- Amitabha Buddha.
- I'm going to kill you!

146
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,090
Miss! Miss!

147
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:18,090
I'm going to kill you!

148
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:20,560
- I'm going to kill you!
- Amitabha Buddha.

149
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,170
I'm going to kill you!

150
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,290
Savage girl, why are you...

151
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:25,140
Kill you!

152
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,140
Sir! Sir! Get out of the way!

153
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,920
- Savage girl, are you ever going to stop?
- Come back here!

154
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,090
- Sir, what's wrong with your friend?
- Stop!

155
00:15:30,090 --> 00:15:31,420
- I'm going to kill you!
- That's right.

156
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,000
I'm going to kill you!

157
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,170
Amitabha Buddha.

158
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,880
We have to do this.

159
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:42,060
Sir,

160
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,240
is there a skilled physician nearby?

161
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,530
May I ask

162
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:48,090
what illness has she contracted?

163
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,760
She's not ill.

164
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:53,120
She's been poisoned

165
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:54,620
by someone.

166
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,880
If it's poison,

167
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:58,090
then perhaps Master Juewu
can detoxify her.

168
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,580
Who is Master Juewu?

169
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,880
Could you please introduce us to him?

170
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:17,690
Master.

171
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,890
Master,

172
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,730
please save my friend.

173
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,020
Tell me. What happened?

174
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,170
My friend has been poisoned
by Purple Poppy.

175
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,370
Purple Poppy, huh?

176
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,300
How many days has it been?

177
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:38,810
Three days.

178
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,330
Three days?

179
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,410
Then there's no need to treat it.

180
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:44,800
Master, please think of something...

181
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,320
There must be a way.

182
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
What's going on?

183
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,650
It's all my fault
for not protecting you well,

184
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,970
letting you get poisoned
by that despicable Taoist priest.

185
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,280
I will find a way to cure you.

186
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,610
Even if you remain like this,

187
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,800
I won't leave you.

188
00:18:08,050 --> 00:18:09,130
Silly rat,

189
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:13,370
who needs your care?

190
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,400
Why are you panicking?

191
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,580
You...

192
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,210
You're alright?

193
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,440
I'm fine, yeah.

194
00:18:25,130 --> 00:18:26,130
Just let me go.

195
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,890
That's not right.

196
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,130
You savage girl,

197
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:32,490
you're never this polite.

198
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,820
Am I usually harsh to you?

199
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,660
Of course.

200
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,760
You think you're gentle?

201
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,800
If it weren't for me tying you up,

202
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,560
you'd be biting people.

203
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:41,580
Li Xiaoyao!

204
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,370
It was you who tied me up.

205
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:45,280
Let me go now,
or I'll break your legs.

206
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,610
This tone.

207
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,130
This attitude.

208
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:52,460
You're really okay?

209
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,820
Hurry up.

210
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:55,800
So, when the master said
no need for treatment,

211
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,890
it meant the Purple Poppy
would heal by itself after three days.

212
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,400
What are you muttering?

213
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,940
Let me untie you.

214
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,200
What have you done to me?

215
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:19,250
What have I done to you?

216
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:22,320
Ever since you were poisoned
by the Purple Poppy,

217
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,470
your temperament changed drastically,
attacking anyone you see.

218
00:19:24,470 --> 00:19:25,610
I am the real victim here.

219
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:28,680
Nonsense.

220
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,040
Pretending to be mad before,
now acting dumb.

221
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,490
Your tricks really are endless.

222
00:19:36,170 --> 00:19:37,010
Say that again.

223
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:38,970
I'll say it again,

224
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,210
so what?

225
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,250
Nothing.

226
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,040
Li Xiaoyao!

227
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,700
(Buddha)

228
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,010
Li Xiaoyao, stop right there!

229
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,460
Are you okay now or still ill?

230
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,300
Move!

231
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:50,780
Move aside!

232
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,850
Madam, are you alright?

233
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,010
Auntie?

234
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,850
Mrs. Liu?

235
00:19:57,580 --> 00:19:58,440
Yueru.

236
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,820
What are you doing here?

237
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,370
Mr. Li, how come you're here?

238
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,300
Auntie,

239
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,130
did you come here to pray for blessings?

240
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:17,770
What's going on? What happened?

241
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,060
Yueru,

242
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,920
your cousin...

243
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,560
He's sick.

244
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,050
Auntie, don't panic.

245
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:30,160
What illness does my cousin have?

246
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,370
Miss Yueru, you may not know

247
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:38,370
ever since Mr. Liu returned to the capital,
he's contracted a strange illness.

248
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,580
Mr. and Mrs. Liu have sought
all the famous physicians

249
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,770
but to no avail.

250
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,770
The young master's condition
worsens by the day.

251
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,820
Madam has prayed

252
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,280
in every temple in the capital,

253
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,680
hoping for his early recovery.

254
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,770
How is my cousin now?

255
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,970
His wife is taking care of him.

256
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:57,920
His wife?

257
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,250
Scholar got married?

258
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,970
That's enough.

259
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:03,920
Let's not talk about that.

260
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:06,440
Jinyuan would be so happy

261
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,130
to know you're here.

262
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,970
Maybe seeing you

263
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:12,040
will help him recover faster.

264
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:15,010
Yueru, will you come back with me now?

265
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:15,850
Okay.

266
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:18,580
Let's go.

267
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,280
It's only been a few days,

268
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,130
and Scholar got married.

269
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:32,490
What?

270
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,730
Are you jealous?

271
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,700
Of course, I'm jealous.

272
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:37,370
Being as smart as he is,

273
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,520
he must have found
a virtuous and good girl,

274
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,200
not like some people.

275
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,370
Who are you calling "some people"?

276
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,610
Don't do this.

277
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,710
Save yourself the heartache.

278
00:21:46,530 --> 00:21:47,490
Okay, okay, okay.

279
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,200
Do you still remember

280
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,770
what you said in the room before?

281
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,320
I didn't say anything.

282
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,040
You did.

283
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:01,170
You said you wouldn't leave me.

284
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:02,250
I heard it all.

285
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,050
When Master Juewu said
you didn't need treatment,

286
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:06,730
I thought you were going
to be crazy forever.

287
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,460
When I get the chance,

288
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,530
I'll definitely go to Mount Shu

289
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:12,850
to have a word with those Taoist priests.

290
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,250
The Wind Spiritual Bead
is still in that Taoist priest's possession.

291
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,560
What should we do next?

292
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,680
First, let's go to the capital
to see Scholar,

293
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,490
and then we'll go to Mount Shu
to retrieve the Wind Spiritual Bead.

294
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,280
Do you know how to get to Mount Shu?

295
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,320
Let's find my master
and ask him to take us to Mount Shu.

296
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,660
The Drunken Sword Immortal?

297
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,730
Right.

298
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,850
That's as good as not saying anything.

299
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,340
He's like a roaming immortal.

300
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:37,530
Finding him is even harder
than going to Mount Shu.

301
00:22:37,530 --> 00:22:38,520
That might not be true.

302
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,730
We might find him
in the capital this time.

303
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,300
The capital?

304
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,210
Right.

305
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,090
The capital.

306
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,970
Greetings, Lady of the South.

307
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:56,850
Here's your subordinate, Gai Luojiao.

308
00:22:57,340 --> 00:22:58,770
General Gai, please rise.

309
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,400
These ten years,

310
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:02,770
you've worked hard.

311
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:04,040
I am at fault.

312
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,370
I failed to protect the Queen's statue

313
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:08,440
and also caused
the young master to be injured.

314
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,970
Please punish me.

315
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,090
General Gai, you need not blame yourself.

316
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:14,280
We all fell into Bai Yue's trap.

317
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:16,200
He used Mr. Shi

318
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:18,250
and the rumor of reviving the Queen

319
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,010
to lure the Princess
to break the magical barrier,

320
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,990
and then took the opportunity
to destroy the statue.

321
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,650
Bai Yue has spies all over the court.

322
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:26,520
The Nanzhao court

323
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,560
is under his control.

324
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:30,460
This is why

325
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,160
we are meeting here.

326
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,130
We should meet with the Witch King

327
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,650
to expose Bai Yue's conspiracy

328
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,890
and ask the Witch King to order

329
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:38,540
the eradication of the Moon Worship Sect.

330
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:42,700
By the way,

331
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,160
how is A'nu?

332
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:45,970
After being treated by the Sacred Maid,

333
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:47,320
A'nu is fine now.

334
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:53,660
My Lady,

335
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,130
won't you go and see A'nu?

336
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,250
No.

337
00:23:59,010 --> 00:24:00,680
A'nu is mischievous.

338
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,400
If she sees me,

339
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,230
she will definitely want to return
with us to Nanzhao.

340
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,250
Nanzhao is fraught with crises.

341
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,090
A'nu is the only hope
of the Witch Moon Sect.

342
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,800
We cannot endanger her again.

343
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,060
Understood.

344
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,370
Chief.

345
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,820
Gui Ying.

346
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,730
Yes.

347
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:25,320
Come look.

348
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:27,340
Yes.

349
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,090
This...

350
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:35,020
(Water Demon Beast)
This is...

351
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,200
This is the Water Demon Beast

352
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,200
ten years ago.

353
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,210
Chief.

354
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,650
The Water Demon Beast was sealed
by the demon queen back then.

355
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:49,160
May it now be reborn?

356
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:51,850
You are the only one

357
00:24:52,130 --> 00:24:54,160
who has seen this little creature.

358
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,090
Anyone else would surely
have been killed without question.

359
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,610
Yes, Chief.

360
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,940
Right, Chief,

361
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,730
I've learned

362
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:07,620
that Gai Luojiao, along with Tang Yu
and the Lady of the South's daughter,

363
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,730
has already returned to Nanzhao.

364
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,040
Now, there is no one
from our side with them.

365
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,500
Just in case,

366
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,700
shall we send someone to follow them?

367
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,770
I need them to return to Nanzhao.

368
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,520
They can help me complete my great cause.

369
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,580
Chief,

370
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:25,560
I have contacted Tang Yu.

371
00:25:26,050 --> 00:25:27,290
Should I ask him...

372
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,770
He will return.

373
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:52,100
(Lizhao Residence)

374
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:54,250
Auntie,

375
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:56,130
what exactly is wrong with Jinyuan?

376
00:25:57,170 --> 00:25:58,280
After you left,

377
00:25:58,580 --> 00:26:00,010
he fell ill and has not recovered.

378
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,890
Your uncle invited famous physicians,

379
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,800
and even summoned imperial physicians
from the palace,

380
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:07,210
but...

381
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,490
But the cause of the illness
remains undiscovered.

382
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,520
How could this be?

383
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:19,200
Some say he's been cursed.

384
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,040
Just at that time,

385
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,160
Jinyuan met Cai Yi,

386
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,890
and they were quite
taken with each other,

387
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,250
so we thought

388
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:34,730
perhaps getting married

389
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,400
might benefit him.

390
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,920
Did that help?

391
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,610
Though Jinyuan is not getting better,

392
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,280
Cai Yi

393
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,730
is truly devoted to Jinyuan.

394
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,680
Lately, with many affairs at the border,

395
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:52,440
your uncle is rarely home
due to being summoned to the palace.

396
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,250
I have to go to many temples
to pray for blessings.

397
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:58,200
Fortunately,
she's taking good care of Jinyuan,

398
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,400
so I can be a bit relieved.

399
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:02,730
Mrs. Liu,

400
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:04,400
where is Scholar now?

401
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,560
Ever since they got married,

402
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,130
Cai Yi said

403
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,920
Jinyuan should rest in a quiet place.

404
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:14,040
They moved to the chamber
in the back garden.

405
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:16,520
Can we go see him now?

406
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:17,940
Go ahead.

407
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:28,920
Your cousin loves flowers?

408
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,130
Maybe.

409
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,610
Look.

410
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,780
(Cai Yi)

411
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,320
This is...

412
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,460
Miss Yueru,

413
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,800
this is Mrs. Cai.

414
00:27:58,700 --> 00:27:59,610
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Cai.

415
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,560
You must be Yueru.

416
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:08,770
Jinyuan often talks about you.

417
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,820
I always wondered

418
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,890
what kind of woman
would be worthy of my cousin.

419
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:16,890
You're indeed as beautiful as they say.

420
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:19,560
Yueru,

421
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,490
I often hear Jinyuan speak of you,

422
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,160
saying you're brave and yet charming.

423
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:25,460
Now I've seen you today,

424
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,460
and you're just as I imagined.

425
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:30,400
Oh no, Mrs. Cai, you're flattering me.

426
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,100
Just call me Cai Yi.

427
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,250
That won't do.
You're my sister-in-law after all.

428
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:37,440
It's late. Where are you going?

429
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,230
The Forest of Toxic Herbs
in the back mountain.

430
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:44,200
I was just about to go there
to pick some fresh herbs for Jinyuan.

431
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,770
Picking herbs?

432
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:48,850
Mrs. Cai is familiar
with plants and herbs.

433
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,460
Some herbs in the medicine
for the young master

434
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,650
need to be picked at night.

435
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:54,050
These days,

436
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,730
Mrs. Cai goes to pick them
every evening herself.

437
00:28:56,890 --> 00:28:58,010
That's a lot of work.

438
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,050
This garden full of peonies

439
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:01,890
was also planted by Mrs. Cai herself,

440
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,340
just to add some vitality
for the young master

441
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,610
while he recuperates.

442
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:06,850
Mrs. Cai,

443
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,160
you're really good to Jinyuan.

444
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,490
I haven't done much.

445
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,650
I just hope that Jinyuan

446
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,010
can recover soon.

447
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:21,890
This must be Mr. Li, right?

448
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,010
Mrs. Cai, nice to meet you.

449
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:25,250
Mr. Li,

450
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,560
Jinyuan also often mentions you,

451
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,580
calling you a great hero

452
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:30,690
with formidable martial skills.

453
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,490
Scholar really has an eye

454
00:29:34,650 --> 00:29:35,490
for people.

455
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,970
Stop flattering yourself.

456
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:42,440
Exactly as Jinyuan said.

457
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,680
What did he say?

458
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,410
He said you two

459
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,160
are a pair of handsome
and beautiful lovers.

460
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:50,320
Don't listen to his nonsense.

461
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,130
Let's go see him now.

462
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:54,730
Mrs. Cai,

463
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,010
if you go to the back mountain
to pick herbs,

464
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:58,730
tell me. I can protect you.

465
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:01,490
Okay.

466
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:03,560
Next time I go,
I will definitely tell you.

467
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:13,540
Jinyuan.

468
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:14,540
Jinyuan.

469
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,580
You guys...

470
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,970
What are you doing here?

471
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:21,970
Take it slow.

472
00:30:26,010 --> 00:30:26,850
Jinyuan, you...

473
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,820
Jinyuan,

474
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,410
I'll let you talk.

475
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:32,800
- I'll go prepare the medicine.
- Alright.

476
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,340
Please, sit down.

477
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,300
Come here.

478
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,400
Sit down, so we can have a chat.

479
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,700
Come.

480
00:30:43,250 --> 00:30:44,090
Come, come.

481
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,060
Jinyuan,

482
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,440
how did you suddenly become so ill?

483
00:30:53,170 --> 00:30:54,280
It's not serious.

484
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,970
Ever since we parted,

485
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,320
somehow,

486
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,400
my body has become weaker.

487
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:02,730
Scholar,

488
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,530
I remember on our last trip back,

489
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,160
we didn't encounter any evil beings.

490
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,400
It's alright.

491
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:11,610
Ever since I started
taking the medicine Yi prepares,

492
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,250
I've been better.

493
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,520
She is really good to you.

494
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,040
How come it's just you guys
who came back?

495
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:20,610
Did you find Miss Ling'er?

496
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,320
Who are you talking about?

497
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:22,850
Indeed, you're a descendant of Nuwa.

498
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,820
With the power of Nuwa,

499
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:27,560
combined with the Spiritual Bead
containing the essence of heaven and earth,

500
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,730
great things can be achieved.

501
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:46,850
The power of Nuwa
truly has such strength?

502
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,400
The power of Nuwa?

503
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,200
It's you.

504
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:12,770
How did you become like this?

505
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,400
It's all because of you.

506
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:20,690
Your name Bao Pu indicates living plainly
and embracing simplicity

507
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,490
with fewer personal desires.

508
00:33:23,170 --> 00:33:26,400
It was your own greed
that has harmed you.

509
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,680
Detestable!

510
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,730
If I absorb the power of Nuwa,

511
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,320
even King of Prison
would have to respect me.

512
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,450
You can't escape.

513
00:34:28,170 --> 00:34:29,010
I...

514
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:30,280
Maybe it's because

515
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,410
I've been bedridden for so long.

516
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:33,720
I remembered the wrong person.

517
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:35,690
Tang Yu...

518
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:39,240
Have Tang Yu and A'nu
returned to Nanzhao?

519
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,480
A'nu was injured.

520
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:44,650
Tang Yu accompanied her
back to Nanzhao to heal.

521
00:34:45,070 --> 00:34:47,050
Li Xiaoyao and I continued
to search for the Spiritual Beads.

522
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,620
I see.

523
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:50,520
Then I understand.

524
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,010
Scholar,

525
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,610
the person you just mentioned...

526
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,210
Sir,

527
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,410
Mrs. Liu asked Miss Lin and Mr. Li
to come for a meal.

528
00:35:02,410 --> 00:35:03,450
Then you should go.

529
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,740
My mother will be worried
if you don't.

530
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,370
Jinyuan, you should rest well.

531
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,210
Alright.

532
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,610
- Rest well, okay?
- Alright.

533
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:25,970
Come out.

534
00:35:33,170 --> 00:35:34,010
Little Stone.

535
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,800
What exactly is going on with those two?

536
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,720
When I asked earlier,

537
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,850
why did they have no recollection
of Miss Ling'er?

538
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,960
If it wasn't for your hint just now,

539
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:45,850
I might have pressed on.

540
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,760
How come it's just you guys
who came back?

541
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,320
Did you find Miss Ling'er?

542
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,760
Who are you talking about?

543
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:56,930
Mr. Liu, please don't mention Miss Fairy.

544
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,760
I'll explain more to you later.

545
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:09,170
Maybe it's because
I've been bedridden for so long.

546
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,720
I remembered the wrong person.

547
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,890
Mr. Liu,

548
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:18,000
you seem deeply poisoned.

549
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,290
Your condition looks quite serious.

550
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:20,130
I'm fine.

551
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:21,850
What exactly is going on?

552
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,280
Miss Fairy asked me to use
the Jade Buddha Magical Formation

553
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:30,330
to erase all their memories
related to her.

554
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:31,410
Why is that?

555
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,140
That's right.

556
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,240
Miss Ling'er

557
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,370
has always been worried

558
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:46,410
that she might

559
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,320
burden everyone.

560
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:51,280
After leaving twice before,

561
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:52,760
Li and Yueru

562
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,720
both went after her.

563
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,410
It seems this time,

564
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,320
she's made up her mind.

565
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:06,450
Where is Miss Ling'er now?

566
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,760
Miss Fairy...

567
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:14,960
She returned to Nanzhao.

568
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,960
She asked me to tell you

569
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,280
that she's glad to have known you

570
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:25,370
and thank you for your help.

571
00:37:26,330 --> 00:37:28,280
She said you should not worry about her,

572
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,370
that she would take good care of herself,

573
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,450
and that she would be alright.

574
00:37:35,810 --> 00:37:36,650
She...

575
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:39,410
She...

576
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:45,280
She hopes Xiaoyao

577
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:47,890
and Yueru can be together.

578
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:51,000
It's also the best outcome for everyone.

579
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,370
So,

580
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,520
please,

581
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,410
don't mention Miss Fairy

582
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,800
in front of them.

583
00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:08,930
Too much of anything

584
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:12,610
is harmful.

585
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,800
Destiny must

586
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:17,850
run its course naturally.

587
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:21,240
Whether it's meant to be or not,

588
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:23,450
there is always a reason.

589
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,040
I understand

590
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,090
Miss Ling'er's decision.

591
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,480
Thank you, Mr. Liu.

592
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:44,210
Miss Ling'er,

593
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,650
you're too considerate.

594
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,800
Your Majesty,

595
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,460
the Lady of the South
is asking to meet you.

596
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,450
What is she doing here?

597
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,600
I don't know.

598
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:01,710
She has brought someone with her.

599
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,240
It seems to be General Gai Luojiao.

600
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,690
General Gai? Let them in.

601
00:39:06,060 --> 00:39:06,900
Yes.

602
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,960
Greetings, Your Majesty.

603
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:15,450
No need for formalities.

604
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,300
General Gai,

605
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,540
where have you been these ten years?

606
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:22,210
I've been guarding the Queen's statue.

607
00:39:23,060 --> 00:39:24,690
Did you see Mr. Shi?

608
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,930
Mr. Shi

609
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,210
was killed by Bai Yue.

610
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:30,850
Is that true?

611
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,610
Absolutely true.

612
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,040
I guarded the Queen's statue
for ten years,

613
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:37,240
never to think

614
00:39:37,810 --> 00:39:39,610
now it would be destroyed
by the traitor Bai Yue.

615
00:39:40,330 --> 00:39:41,570
He also harmed the Princess

616
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,760
and killed Mr. Shi.

617
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:46,020
Bai Yue's treacherous purpose
is clear for all to see.

618
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:46,860
Ling'er?

619
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:49,410
Is it really my Ling'er?

620
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:52,560
- It is.
- Where is Ling'er now?

621
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,100
Your Majesty,

622
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,320
after the battle at Yunmeng Marsh,

623
00:39:56,610 --> 00:39:57,740
there were heavy casualties.

624
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:58,890
Fortunately, with your protection,

625
00:39:59,810 --> 00:40:01,650
Princess Ling'er,
although injured by Bai Yue,

626
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:02,610
was not seriously harmed.

627
00:40:05,090 --> 00:40:08,280
Unfortunately, Lady of the South's daughter
was seriously injured.

628
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,020
Princess Ling'er, concerned about Nanzhao,

629
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:13,390
took A'nu's place and continued on her journey
to find the Spiritual Beads,

630
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:14,960
to pray for rain
and blessings for Nanzhao.

631
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:20,450
Lady of the South, how is A'nu now?

632
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:22,450
Your Majesty, thank you for your concern.

633
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:26,090
A'nu, under the care of the Sacred Maid
of the Witch Moon Sect,

634
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:27,560
has recovered considerably.

635
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:30,850
A'nu is loyal and devoted.

636
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:32,040
Once she returns to Nanzhao,

637
00:40:32,370 --> 00:40:33,610
I will surely reward her generously.

638
00:40:35,020 --> 00:40:35,930
Thank you, Your Majesty.

639
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,650
Send someone
to the Central Plains immediately

640
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:40,720
to find the Princess.

641
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:43,090
I cannot afford to lose Ling'er again.

642
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,760
- Hurry!
- Yes.

643
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:46,720
However, Your Majesty,

644
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,240
this incident proves

645
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,810
that the news that the Princess

646
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:52,500
could revive the Queen through her statue

647
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,410
was concocted by Bai Yue.

648
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,610
His aim was to use Mr. Shi

649
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,410
to find Princess Ling'er
and the Queen's statue,

650
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:01,560
to destroy the statue.

651
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:03,410
Bai Yue's actions

652
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:05,460
surely have a bigger conspiracy
behind them.

653
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,300
Your Majesty,

654
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,170
we must be cautious.

655
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,000
Your Majesty,

656
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:11,850
please order the capture of Bai Yue

657
00:41:11,850 --> 00:41:12,960
and the eradication of his sect.

658
00:41:19,330 --> 00:41:21,960
The Moon Worship Sect
is deep-rooted and widespread.

659
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:25,320
This matter requires further discussion.

660
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:28,560
The urgent task
is to find Princess Ling'er.

661
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:31,320
I am tired.

662
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,280
You may all leave now.

663
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,010
Yes.

664
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:51,060
My Lady,

665
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,610
please forgive my frankness.

666
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:58,450
Bai Yue's treason

667
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,800
and his myriad misdeeds
are clear for all to see.

668
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,210
Why does His Majesty not punish him?

669
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:09,130
His Majesty's evident hesitation
towards Bai Yue

670
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:12,760
suggests that this is far more complex
than we imagined.

671
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,250
My Lady,

672
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:21,040
I have a vague feeling

673
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:24,000
that there's an unspeakable secret
hidden within this palace.

674
00:42:26,330 --> 00:42:27,170
