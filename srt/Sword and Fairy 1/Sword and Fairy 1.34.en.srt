=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 34=

3
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:03,260
Yueru!

4
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,330
Blessed by Nuwa,

5
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:37,560
you have finally awakened.

6
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,690
Madam,

7
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:42,410
where am I?

8
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,330
This is the Sacred Woods in Nanzhao.

9
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,760
You were severely injured

10
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:50,330
and brought here for healing.

11
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,810
What about the two ladies?

12
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,810
Where are they?

13
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,410
They were brought here together.

14
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,220
That's good.

15
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:04,860
That's good.

16
00:03:06,330 --> 00:03:07,450
Are they all right?

17
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,810
You should take your medicine first.

18
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,140
Madam,

19
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,970
please answer me.

20
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,450
How are they?

21
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,050
Did they get hurt?

22
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:26,540
Mr. Li, you were severely injured.

23
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:29,120
You should take your medicine
before discussing further.

24
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,740
Madam,

25
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,170
where are they?

26
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,770
Your wounds have not yet healed.

27
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,100
It's not advisable for you
to move around.

28
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:49,860
I'm fine.

29
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,890
I've already recovered.

30
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,100
Ling'er!

31
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,700
Ling'er!

32
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,440
Madam, how is Ling'er?

33
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,090
Princess Ling'er
used her spiritual power excessively.

34
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,260
Her body is very weak,

35
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,130
but her life is not in danger for now.

36
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,610
Madam,

37
00:05:09,730 --> 00:05:10,730
what about the other lady?

38
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,260
Is she...

39
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,440
Is she seriously injured?

40
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,260
Where is she?

41
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,200
You said they were both here.

42
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,440
Follow me.

43
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,600
Madam,

44
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,640
savage girl...

45
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,690
She's not here, right?

46
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:43,780
She...

47
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,250
This... This is...

48
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,640
It can't be.

49
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,100
It can't be.

50
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,250
You must be mistaken.

51
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,480
You don't even know her.

52
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:05,290
How could you know...

53
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,760
Her organs

54
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,420
and bones

55
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:15,920
were all shattered.

56
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,330
When she was brought here,

57
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,090
she was not breathing.

58
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,380
Yueru!

59
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,570
Savage girl!

60
00:07:30,890 --> 00:07:31,880
Yueru!

61
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:38,570
It can't be...

62
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:40,730
No, no.

63
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:42,450
It can't be her.

64
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,700
It can't be her.

65
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,690
She must still be
in the Demon-Locking Tower.

66
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,440
I'm going to save her now.

67
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:35,220
Savage girl!

68
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,440
Li Xiaoyao.

69
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,320
I don't believe it. I don't believe it.

70
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,300
It can't be.

71
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:20,570
It can't be.

72
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,000
How could it be her?

73
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,560
How could it be her?

74
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:29,330
It's impossible.

75
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,170
I don't believe you.

76
00:10:39,290 --> 00:10:40,130
It's impossible.

77
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,300
Dugu,

78
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,530
so many demons have escaped
from the Demon-Locking Tower.

79
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,120
What should we do?

80
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,090
Why don't you say something?

81
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,860
Madam.

82
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:06,130
Madam,

83
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,880
how are they doing?

84
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,120
Luckily, they were brought here in time.

85
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,970
The young couple's lives were saved,

86
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,930
but

87
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,370
Miss Lin...

88
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:20,880
Does Xiaoyao know?

89
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,940
If only you had known,
why did you bother in the first place?

90
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,440
If you hadn't imprisoned the Princess
in the Demon-Locking Tower

91
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:30,680
without thorough investigation,

92
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:32,880
we wouldn't have been
in this situation today.

93
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:35,890
Madam,

94
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,930
indeed, we were wrong.

95
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,680
Is it true

96
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,490
that Yueru is beyond cure?

97
00:11:47,730 --> 00:11:50,800
It's impossible
to bring her back to life,

98
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,560
however,

99
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,880
I might

100
00:11:58,650 --> 00:12:01,120
find a way to keep her from dying.

101
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:03,660
Madam,

102
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,610
please do everything you can.

103
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,140
Many demons have escaped
from the Demon-Locking Tower,

104
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:19,000
and I need to return to Mount Shu now.

105
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:21,200
Dugu, I'll go with you.

106
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,970
To only tell good from evil,

107
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:28,880
not humans from demons.

108
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,740
Situ,

109
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,880
you stay here to take care of them.

110
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,940
Consider that jade pendant

111
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,970
my payment for hiring you

112
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,290
to find my friend.

113
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,860
Here you are.

114
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,370
It's not broken.

115
00:14:05,090 --> 00:14:05,930
It's not broken.

116
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,060
It's not broken.

117
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:09,130
It's not broken.

118
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,240
It's not broken, not broken.

119
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,370
It's not broken.

120
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:14,330
It's not broken.

121
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,570
It's not broken.

122
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,290
I'm here.

123
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,970
You go rest.

124
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,200
Madam,

125
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,060
I...

126
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,530
I'm already fine.

127
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,440
Is there anything I can do?

128
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:56,700
I'll start right now.

129
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,540
No need.

130
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,930
Or maybe I can stay here
and help you take care of Ling'er and...

131
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,570
And...

132
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,000
You being here

133
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,900
won't help

134
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,440
and might even disturb them.

135
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,930
Then let me help you grind the herbs.

136
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,660
Alright then.

137
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,330
Sir.

138
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,640
Sir, why are you here?

139
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,220
Sir.

140
00:16:20,650 --> 00:16:22,320
This gourd is good

141
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:25,410
but doesn't hold enough wine.

142
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,050
The wine's finished.

143
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,170
I should get back to work.

144
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,290
Xiaoyao, Xiaoyao.

145
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,610
You can't keep going on like this.

146
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,010
What's wrong with me?

147
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:00,170
I'm fine.

148
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,930
I got a bit hurt before,

149
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,520
but the Sacred Maid already healed me.

150
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,420
I'm fine.

151
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,130
She's already dead!

152
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:12,320
No one's dead.

153
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,700
No one.

154
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,160
Ling'er's also fine.

155
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,680
The Sacred Maid said

156
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,010
that Ling'er's recovering well,

157
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:30,010
and she'll wake up soon.

158
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,090
Yueru...

159
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,320
I haven't seen her yet.

160
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:39,490
Haven't seen her.

161
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,820
Haven't seen her.

162
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:43,440
I haven't seen her.

163
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,060
Xiaoyao.

164
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,210
Xiaoyao!

165
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:12,130
Ling'er,

166
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:16,770
please wake up soon.

167
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,490
Nothing can happen to you.

168
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:28,130
I need you.

169
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,340
Yueru!

170
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:35,580
Yueru!

171
00:19:37,530 --> 00:19:38,970
Madam, where's Yueru?

172
00:19:39,370 --> 00:19:40,210
Where is she?

173
00:19:41,370 --> 00:19:42,970
Calm down now.

174
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:45,170
No, I can't.

175
00:19:45,170 --> 00:19:46,280
I haven't seen her yet.

176
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,100
Come with me.

177
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:52,940
Alright.

178
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:22,920
Yueru...

179
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,280
Why do you never

180
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:45,820
call me by my name?

181
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,410
Did you change your name?
What's your name now?

182
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,040
Lin Bingru, Lin Xingru, Lin Fengru...

183
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:51,320
"Lin Fengru" suits you quite well.

184
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,680
Yueru.

185
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,420
Yueru.

186
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:06,730
Yueru.

187
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,490
Yueru.

188
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,730
Yueru.

189
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,490
Li Xiaoyao.

190
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:49,200
This is a map of Sacred Woods.

191
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,920
At the deepest part of the forest,

192
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:55,320
there's a cave
called the Rakshasa Ghost Cave.

193
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,850
Rakshasa Ghost Cave?

194
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,130
There's a peculiar creature inside

195
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:02,920
called the puppet bug.

196
00:23:03,770 --> 00:23:05,650
Can you help me retrieve it?

197
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:08,440
It concerns Miss Lin.

198
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,160
I need you to go.

199
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,420
I'll go.

200
00:23:13,770 --> 00:23:15,040
I'll go. I can go.

201
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,890
Good. Remember

202
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:18,610
that the Rakshasa Ghost Cave

203
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,890
is dangerous,

204
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:24,130
so you must stay alert at all times.

205
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,320
It's okay. I can do it.

206
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,860
(Shuimu Residence)

207
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:25,400
No matter if you are a human or a ghost,

208
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,420
come out.

209
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:54,180
Yueru!

210
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,320
Little rat, I will never spare you.

211
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,420
Yueru?

212
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:20,890
It's really you.

213
00:26:21,130 --> 00:26:22,650
How dare you come back?

214
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,370
What do you want?

215
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:28,580
Let go!

216
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,220
Yueru, let me explain.

217
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:31,230
Don't you dare call my name again!

218
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,890
I'm not dreaming, am I?

219
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:41,160
- Yueru!
- You lecher!

220
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:54,490
Why didn't you dodge?

221
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,890
It's my debt to you.

222
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,860
If taking a sword from you

223
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,200
clears your anger,

224
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,660
then

225
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,700
it's worth it.

226
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,090
I'll spare you today.

227
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:08,770
I'm telling you.

228
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:10,160
Don't let me see you again next time.

229
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:11,580
I'll remember it well.

230
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,730
From now on, you'll never see me again.

231
00:27:22,650 --> 00:27:23,490
Yueru,

232
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,890
I hope you'll never see me again.

233
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:31,700
(Combat for Marriage)
Bravo!

234
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:32,540
Next one.

235
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,040
Why did I come here again?

236
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,440
It's him.

237
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,730
Stop right there!

238
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,280
You little rat.

239
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:50,920
How dare you come here?

240
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,980
- Yueru.
- Don't call my name!

241
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,820
Listen to me.

242
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,770
I came here by accident,

243
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:57,610
with no other intention.

244
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,850
I'll leave right now.

245
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,250
- I'm leaving now.
- Wait a moment.

246
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,980
You bullied me before,
and now you followed me?

247
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:05,940
Alright, I'll give you a chance.

248
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,530
Come up here and fight it out with me.

249
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:09,090
I'm sorry. I can't fight.

250
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,780
Yueru,

251
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,620
I truly have urgent matters.
Please let me leave.

252
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,370
Alright. You can leave after the fight.

253
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,220
I've lost.

254
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,850
- You did it on purpose.
- Absolutely not.

255
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,370
I truly am no match.

256
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,400
Since I lost, please let me leave.

257
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,160
Coward.

258
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Madam,

259
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,440
this kid is still injured.

260
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,160
If he goes alone,

261
00:29:11,650 --> 00:29:14,170
what if he encounters
that Rakshasa Ghost?

262
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:16,370
That would be very dangerous.

263
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,130
The Rakshasa Ghost Cave

264
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:21,490
is merely a cave
with unusual geological features.

265
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,400
Inside, there are exotic flowers

266
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:26,250
and sulfur springs

267
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:28,770
that emit a hallucinogenic fog,

268
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,090
causing people to lose their minds.

269
00:29:32,460 --> 00:29:33,970
Those who stay in the cave too long,

270
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:36,490
poisoned by the fog,

271
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,010
will die inside.

272
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,090
Over time, it has turned into a legend.

273
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,940
Now that he's going alone,

274
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,610
isn't it even more dangerous?

275
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,350
(Shuimu Residence)

276
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:55,160
If he cannot move
past his emotional wounds,

277
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,040
even if his physical injuries heal,

278
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:00,970
the emotional wounds
will accompany him for life.

279
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:05,400
Then it's up to his fate.

280
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,820
Wait.

281
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,180
Li Xiaoyao!

282
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,300
Yueru.

283
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,040
Weren't we supposed
to enter the Tower together?

284
00:30:39,370 --> 00:30:40,940
What does it mean
for you to run here alone?

285
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
I...

286
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:45,050
I didn't have time to tell you

287
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:46,620
that my master
ultimately couldn't bear it,

288
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,680
and he told me a way
to rescue Ling'er from the Tower.

289
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:50,250
That's simple then.

290
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,170
Just tell me the method,

291
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,100
and I'll go in myself.

292
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,940
Yueru,

293
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,130
for Ling'er and me,

294
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,010
you should go back.

295
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:02,620
Then you guys hurry out.

296
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:03,490
I'll wait for you here.

297
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,580
Alright.

298
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,560
I'll bring Ling'er out
as soon as I see her.

299
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:09,050
If you guys don't come out,

300
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,440
I'll enter the Tower no matter what.

301
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:19,730
I promise you.

302
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,060
Yueru,

303
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,200
just wait here for us.

304
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,250
When we come out,

305
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,520
let's

306
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,490
eat, play,

307
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,800
- and grow old together.
- Good.

308
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,820
Let's eat, play,

309
00:31:44,290 --> 00:31:45,130
and grow old together.

310
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:46,820
Go back.

311
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,540
This time,

312
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,160
I must be able to change it completely.

313
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,180
Li Xiaoyao,

314
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:08,160
wake up.

315
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:11,770
Wake up.

316
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,730
Li Xiaoyao.

317
00:32:20,530 --> 00:32:21,440
Wake up.

318
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,040
Li Xiaoyao.

319
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,800
Wake up, Li Xiaoyao.

320
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:34,040
Yueru.

321
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:46,920
Yueru,

322
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:49,210
you're alright.

323
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,320
That's wonderful.

324
00:32:52,530 --> 00:32:53,680
Silly rat,

325
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,970
what are you doing here?

326
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:04,610
Yueru,

327
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,090
I came here to find you,

328
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,280
and I made it.

329
00:33:15,010 --> 00:33:16,160
Now, leave this place.

330
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,440
Ling'er is still waiting for you.

331
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:20,610
You didn't die.

332
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,010
Yueru.

333
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:25,780
Yueru.

334
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,300
You didn't die.

335
00:33:29,890 --> 00:33:30,730
Yueru,

336
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,940
wait for me.

337
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:33,680
I'll take you to see Ling'er, Yueru.

338
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,770
Yueru, wait for me.

339
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,370
I'll take you to see Ling'er.

340
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
Yueru.

341
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,240

00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,690
Yueru!

381
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,690
I have just one wish.

382
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,370
Once we rescue Ling'er,

383
00:37:17,170 --> 00:37:18,280
let's eat,

384
00:37:19,410 --> 00:37:20,370
play,

385
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:21,800
grow old together,

386
00:37:22,370 --> 00:37:23,800
and be good friends forever.

392
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:08,980
(Shuimu Residence)

393
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:20,970
Tang Yu,

394
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:23,800
you're back.

395
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:30,620
Madam.

396
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,490
Madam,

397
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,410
I'm sorry.

398
00:38:44,980 --> 00:38:47,370
You don't owe an apology to me.

399
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,580
A'nu...

400
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,130
How is she?

401
00:38:56,090 --> 00:38:57,610
She returned to Nanzhao.

402
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,010
Madam,

403
00:39:01,170 --> 00:39:02,210
if there's a chance,

404
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,240
please tell A'nu for me

405
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:08,340
that I'm sorry.

406
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:09,300
Tang Yu,

407
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,720
why did you make such a choice?

408
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:15,690
Madam,

409
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,450
do you think I am a good person

410
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,100
or a bad person?

411
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:24,800
What is good?

412
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:27,890
What is bad?

413
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,320
What is good?

414
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,930
What is bad?

415
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:37,560
Can we use these rules

416
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,210
to conquer Nanzhao

417
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,760
and rule the people?

418
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:46,610
Saving the masses

419
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,410
is good.

420
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,170
What does it mean to save the masses?

421
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,650
The phrase "saving the masses"

422
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,130
can be used for good

423
00:39:59,610 --> 00:40:00,760
or for evil.

424
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,100
Madam,

425
00:40:10,850 --> 00:40:11,850
I don't understand.

426
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,540
Tang Yu,

427
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:15,520
the masses

428
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:17,650
seem vast,

429
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:19,000
but in reality,

430
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:22,210
they are made up of every person

431
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,850
that appears in our lives.

432
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:30,090
Only by holding their lives in awe

433
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:34,280
can we truly talk about
saving the masses.

434
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:37,130
Your parents are among the masses.

435
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:39,410
A'nu is among the masses.

436
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,320
The Princess is among the masses.

437
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:44,210
Gai Luojiao is also among the masses.

438
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,650
If you can't protect their lives,

439
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,610
how can you save the masses?

440
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,300
No.

441
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:00,210
Why is it like this?

442
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,890
In the world,
nothing inherently is good or evil,

443
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:35,090
but people insist on dividing
everything into good and evil.

444
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:38,170
Goodness and evilness
reside in people's hearts.

445
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:41,570
I want to travel
through famous mountains and rivers,

446
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,130
and taste every delicacy!

447
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:46,450
I just want to complete my mission soon.

448
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:51,800
What is good?

449
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,960
What is bad?

450
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:06,690
If you can't protect their lives,

451
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:09,690
how can you save the masses?

452
00:42:22,170 --> 00:42:23,480
We must always,

453
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:26,850
always be together.
