2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,210
You can't go to the Water Moon Palace,

4
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,190
and you can't go to Fairy Island,

5
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,100
because it's not good for Ling'er,

6
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,570
you, and the Water Moon Palace.

7
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,210
Moon Worshippers

8
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,960
will soon follow you to Fairy Island.

9
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,060
I can't explain in detail,

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,100
but you must trust me.

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,250
I won't harm you.

12
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:10,810
Mr. Li,

13
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,000
I believe you.

14
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:15,170
Good.

15
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,580
Thank you, Grandmother.

16
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:17,860
Thank you.

17
00:02:19,210 --> 00:02:20,200
I will definitely find

18
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:21,720
a safer place for you.

19
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,810
Fairy Island

20
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:25,610
is that safer place.

21
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,220
Who are you?

22
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:31,690
Who exactly are you?

23
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,970
Benevolent indeed.

24
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,610
Lady Lingyue.

25
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,840
I have come to pick you up.

26
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,840
Lady Lingyue, that's wonderful!

27
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:53,690
Lady Lingyue,

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:58,170
Mr. Li said he lost the token.

29
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,690
How did you find us then?

30
00:03:02,770 --> 00:03:05,690
A kid found this handkerchief

31
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:06,810
and brought it to the riverbank.

32
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,610
That's how I knew
you had arrived in Yuhang

33
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,760
and hurried over.

34
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,410
I see.

35
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:17,760
I see.

36
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,760
Your injuries are fine now.

37
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,330
Thank you, Lady Lingyue.

38
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,940
Lady Lingyue,

39
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:36,260
your magic is impressive.

40
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,380
If I learn your magic,

41
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,330
can I teach a lesson

42
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,890
to those who bully my mother?

43
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,690
Your Highness,

44
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,000
learning magic is for saving people,

45
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,690
not for fighting with others.

46
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,450
Do you still want to learn it?

47
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,300
I do.

48
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:51,690
Then I can go and help those

49
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:52,970
who are bullied by villains.

50
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:57,560
Then I'll be your master from now on.

51
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,610
Is that okay?

52
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,140
Yes, yes!

53
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,970
But you have to promise me one thing.

54
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:07,690
You and Grandmother must come
with me to Fairy Island

55
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:10,050
and live there forever.

56
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,970
You must never leave. Is that okay?

57
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:13,690
You mean

58
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:16,850
we cannot return to Nanzhao
to see Mother?

59
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,260
Yes.

60
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,690
This is arranged by your mother.

61
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,600
It was her plan.

62
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,040
Did she send the phoenix
to take me to you?

63
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Yes.

64
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,820
Then

65
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,480
will she come to find me?

66
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:45,290
Yes.

67
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,940
Your Highness,

68
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,730
don't worry.

69
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:54,850
I will always be with you,

70
00:04:56,010 --> 00:04:57,200
waiting for your mother.

71
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,970
Then I will listen to my mother.

72
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,610
Madam,

73
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,380
forgive my directness, but they cannot...

74
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,250
Sir,

75
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,200
everything

76
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:14,640
has its cause and effect.

77
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,260
What do you mean?

78
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,130
Everything

79
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,690
has its cause and effect.

80
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,480
Was all this arranged by Goddess Nuwa?

81
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,480
Your Highness, let's go.

82
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,700
Let's go.

83
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,440
Xiaoyao,

84
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:56,980
let's go.

85
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:21,530
Take it slow.

86
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:23,610
- Careful.
- Madam,

87
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,730
may I have a word?

88
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:25,600
It's okay, Grandma.

89
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:27,360
Take your time coming down.

90
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,010
Grandma, how much longer?

91
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:32,160
Soon.

92
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,130
Mr. Li, I know what you're going to say.

93
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,250
For the Princess,

94
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,660
Fairy Island is the safest place
in the world.

95
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,690
Will we ever return?

96
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:45,330
Probably not.

97
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,170
Madam,

98
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,290
I want to ask you a question.

99
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,730
Do you believe someone
can return to the past?

100
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,920
You are the one who returned.

101
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,920
You knew it all along?

102
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,440
Goddess Nuwa has a magic skill

103
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:01,480
called Returning Dream,

104
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,690
which allows one
to briefly return to the past.

105
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,400
- I see.
- You must learn well.

106
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:07,970
Can you do that?

107
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,220
To be honest,

108
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,980
in ten years, Ling'er and Grandmother
will face a calamity.

109
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:17,380
Can I

110
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,220
change that?

111
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,920
Mr. Li,

112
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:24,530
the law of nature is eternal.

113
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:25,920
There is no turning back.

114
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:28,100
Everything

115
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,290
has its cause and effect.

116
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,450
The so-called future
is the best outcome.

117
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:33,730
Trying to change it

118
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:36,690
will only make the outcome worse.

119
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,850
Do you mean

120
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,640
that trying to change the future

121
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:47,290
is futile?

122
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:50,160
Mr. Li,

123
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:53,010
the future is not yet decided,

124
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,140
and you are the trigger for the future.

125
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,290
Only your efforts

126
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:59,090
can bring about the best present.

127
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,660
Follow your heart,

128
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,920
make the most of the present,

129
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,200
and that will bring
the best outcome for Ling'er.

130
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:08,570
Do you understand?

131
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:19,100
Then I will always be with you.

132
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,610
- I was confused before.
- Is that okay?

133
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,450
Of course.

134
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:22,450
But now...

135
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:23,730
We will always be together.

136
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,250
It seems I understand.

137
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,810
The result is not the endpoint,

138
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:34,050
and the process is more important.

139
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,320
Your Highness,

140
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,050
the boat is about to dock.

141
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:47,120
Get ready.

142
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,130
Okay.

143
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,610
Xiaoyao,

144
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,060
let's go.

145
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,850
Grandmother, it's beautiful here.

146
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:27,690
Yes.

147
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,100
Xiaoyao,

148
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,060
what's wrong?

149
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,490
I'm fine.

150
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,540
Ling'er,

151
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,370
do you like it here?

152
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,680
I really like it.

153
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,370
Do you like it?

154
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,860
I like it too.

155
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,090
Then, that's great.

156
00:09:58,530 --> 00:10:01,000
Xiaoyao also likes it here.

157
00:10:01,170 --> 00:10:02,610
So from now on, Xiaoyao

158
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,530
can live here with us.

159
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,740
Grandmother,

160
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,530
Xiaoyao likes it here too.

161
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:11,170
He will live here with us.

162
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,890
Ling'er,

163
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,640
you must listen to Grandmother,

164
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,890
okay?

165
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,450
I know.

166
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:29,970
I need

167
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:33,530
to leave now.

168
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,690
No way.

169
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
Ling'er, listen to me.

170
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,170
When I say no, it means no.

171
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,570
I promise

172
00:10:40,970 --> 00:10:42,220
that I'm just leaving temporarily.

173
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:43,560
- No way.
- I will come back for you.

174
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:45,300
- No way.
- Ling'er.

175
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,290
No, no, no!

176
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:53,180
Your Highness,

177
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,560
Xiaoyao said

178
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,410
he would definitely come back.

179
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:01,120
Let's let him go for now, okay?

180
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:02,570
Not okay.

181
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,050
Not okay.

182
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,860
Grandmother,

183
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,970
is it that everyone I care about

184
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:11,970
will leave me?

185
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:16,330
Not at all.

186
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:20,240
Your Highness, not at all.

187
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,490
They won't.

188
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,800
Then Grandmother,

189
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:26,200
why did my mother leave me?

190
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:27,780
And why

191
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:30,170
is Xiaoyao leaving too?

192
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:37,900
Xiaoyao, tell me.

193
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,410
How can you not leave?

194
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,320
Tell me.

195
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,980
Ling'er...

196
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:54,810
Xiaoyao,

197
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:57,800
will you marry me?

198
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,450
Your Highness.

199
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,370
I heard from my mother before

200
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,930
that those who are married

201
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,850
will always be together.

202
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,540
Your Highness,

203
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,200
you are still a child.

204
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,880
Promise me.

205
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:23,240
Promise me.

206
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:36,180
Ling'er,

207
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,860
listen to me.

208
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,560
I have more important things
to do right now.

209
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:46,850
When I return,

210
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,440
I will come for you.

211
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:53,370
Really?

212
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,690
Really.

213
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,740
Then, pinky promise.

214
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,420
Ling'er,

215
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,970
I'll take you to a place.

216
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,410
This is the blue jacaranda in Nanzhao.

217
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,090
Xiaoyao,

218
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,610
how did you know this tree was here?

219
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,970
Because I've been here before.

220
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:45,930
Maybe

221
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:48,440
I will come again in the future.

222
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,760
Xiaoyao,

223
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,340
didn't you say

224
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,970
this was your first time on Fairy Island?

225
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,640
I, Li Xiaoyao,

226
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:43,440
take Zhao Ling'er as my wife,

227
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:45,050
for life,

228
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:46,640
unwavering in this vow.

229
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:14,690
Ling'er,

230
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,800
I made a vow.

231
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:18,970
It's all carved into this stone.

232
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:20,370
I want to see it.

233
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,680
Wait to see it when I come back.

234
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,290
Seeing it now won't make it come true.

235
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,130
Ling'er,

236
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,000
let's bury it here.

237
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:36,760
If I don't remember you by then,

238
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:38,610
you can bring me here to dig it out.

239
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:40,410
Xiaoyao,

240
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,640
will you forget me?

241
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:47,690
No.

242
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,490
Never.

243
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:55,890
Come on.

244
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,680
Xiaoyao,

245
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,490
when will you come back?

246
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,340
When...

247
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,040
When the blue jacaranda

248
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,730
blooms and withers for the tenth time,

249
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,520
I will return.

250
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:56,280
When the blue jacaranda
blooms and withers

251
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,890
for the tenth time,

252
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,520
you would return.

253
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:04,280
I will wait for you on Fairy Island.

254
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,650
I will definitely come back.

255
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:38,370
Grandmother.

256
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,540
Madam.

257
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,280
Mr. Li,

258
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:44,770
I have no way

259
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:46,280
to repay your great kindness.

260
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,650
Here, I...

261
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,490
Grandmother,

262
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,440
I will never forget

263
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,160
your great kindness later on.

264
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,370
Please accept my bow.

265
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:58,040
Mr. Li,

266
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,320
what does this mean?

267
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:03,250
Anyway,

268
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,660
thank you.

269
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:08,850
Thank you for always remembering me.

270
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:10,770
Thank you for...

271
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,210
Ling'er...

272
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,550
Lady Lingyue,

273
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,550
the Moon Worship Sect will not rest
until they are satisfied.

274
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,300
Please ensure the safety
of Ling'er and Grandmother.

275
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:27,290
Mr. Li, rest assured.

276
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:29,400
I will set up a magical barrier
on Fairy Island.

277
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:31,160
Ordinary people cannot discover it.

278
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,740
If discovered,

279
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:34,450
without knowing the method
of the Water Moon Palace,

280
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,800
no one can break the barrier
to the island.

281
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,970
Then Xiaoyao

282
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,920
will not be able to come to the island?

283
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,650
He can't come back?

284
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,800
No one can come to the island,

285
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:57,680
except for Li Xiaoyao.

286
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,540
Thank you, Madam.

287
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:12,090
Ling'er,

288
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,490
I will be back soon.

289
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,490
Xiaoyao,

290
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:19,010
you must not forget our promise.

291
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,160
If not looking back,

292
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,920
why not forget?

293
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,730
If it's not destiny,

294
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,250
why make promises?

295
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:58,010
Today's matters,

296
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,560
like water, leave no trace.

297
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,040
Tomorrow, what of tomorrow?

298
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,400
You'll be a stranger on a different path.

299
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,730
Xiaoyao,

300
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,370
is this what you wanted to tell me?

301
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:11,610
Ling'er,

302
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,850
I once heard you...

303
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:17,890
A very important person

304
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,920
once told me the first four lines

305
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,130
and asked me what the next four were.

306
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,400
Unfortunately,
I couldn't answer at the time.

307
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:27,920
Now I know the answer.

308
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:29,040
You must remember it.

309
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:31,440
Next time you see me,

310
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,040
you can test me with it.

311
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,250
I've noted it down.

312
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:39,770
If not looking back,

313
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,440
why not forget?

314
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:43,400
If it's not destiny,

315
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,920
why make promises?

316
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,970
Today's matters,

317
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,440
like water, leave no trace.

318
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,090
Tomorrow, what of tomorrow?

319
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,970
You'll be a stranger on a different path.

320
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,800
(Yuhang Town)
Fresh shrimp!

321
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,650
Sir, a bowl of porridge, please.

322
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:53,970
Okay, okay.

323
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,940
Kid,

324
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,010
I've been looking for you for a long time.
Where have you been?

325
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:02,850
Sir.

326
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:03,850
Where are they?

327
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:05,130
They...

328
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,560
They've gone where they needed to go.

329
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,860
You're being elusive, kid.

330
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,700
By the way, sir,

331
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:14,320
have you seen
any Moon Worshippers here?

332
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,280
I was just about to go into town
to find them.

333
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,790
- Let's go, let's go!
- Put some effort into it!

334
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,970
If you don't finish moving these,
you can't rest.

335
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:22,850
Hurry up.

336
00:23:23,370 --> 00:23:24,280
It seems

337
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,890
that I left Yuhang yesterday.

338
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:28,200
Why does it feel so long ago?

339
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,680
Kid, are you from Yuhang?

340
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,290
Where is your home?

341
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,610
Where are your parents?

342
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:40,820
They...

343
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,520
They should still be there.

344
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:44,820
Still there.

345
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,160
It's hard to believe
that before more than ten years,

346
00:23:57,650 --> 00:23:58,970
Yuhang Town hasn't changed much.

347
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,090
(Cao Blacksmith Shop)
This is the blacksmith shop.

348
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,040
That over there is the tavern,

349
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,100
but the owner is a bit snobbish,

350
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,730
only serving good wine
to the rich and powerful.

351
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,220
Then I must go and meet him properly.

352
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:12,010
I must act on behalf of justice.

353
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,740
What are you doing?

354
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:20,890
- I'm sorry.
- Are you blind?

355
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,970
Sorry, sorry.

356
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,200
Such bad luck.

357
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,110
Watch where you're going next time.

358
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,040
- Go now.
- Moon Worshippers

359
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,400
came here so quickly.

360
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Li!

361
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,130
Xiaohu's father?

362
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,210
Sorry.

363
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,490
I mistook you for someone else.

364
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,940
Everything okay just now?

365
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:50,050
My Guanyin statue is safe.
That's good enough.

366
00:24:50,050 --> 00:24:51,730
I just got it today.

367
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:53,060
Don't worry.

368
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:55,400
You'll definitely have a strong,
healthy boy.

369
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,490
I hope your words come true.

370
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:58,090
I'll be going now.

371
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,700
Get in.

372
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,250
You audacious rat, do you know who I am?

373
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,940
How dare you make trouble on my turf?

374
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,920
- Do you know who I am?
- Do you know who I am?

375
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,970
I

376
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,860
am the Leader of Jiangnan Sub-sect

377
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,400
of the Moon Worship Sect of Nanzhao.

378
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:18,410
If you dare to touch me,
I'll make sure you die painfully.

379
00:25:18,410 --> 00:25:20,160
What Moon Worship Sect?
I'll deal with you now!

380
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:24,220
Wait, wait.
Let's talk this out like gentlemen.

381
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:25,920
I was too foolish to realize
you're a hero.

382
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:27,010
Spare my life,

383
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,730
spare my life.

384
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,170
Let me ask you.

385
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:31,740
What does your sect want here?

386
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,200
We came to Yuhang to find someone.

387
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:35,970
Find someone?

388
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,010
Who are you looking for?

389
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,970
I don't know.

390
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,370
Just heard from Nanzhao

391
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:44,560
that two envoys were coming to Yuhang
to find someone.

392
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:46,850
I'm just here to help them.

393
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,300
(Oh, no.)

394
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,800
(Is it because of my arrival)

395
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,580
(that the Moon Worship Sect)

396
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:53,050
(discovered Ling'er's whereabouts
so quickly?)

397
00:25:54,290 --> 00:25:55,130
Sir,

398
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:57,250
if you could help our two envoys

399
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,090
complete their mission,

400
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,200
our chief will reward you handsomely.

401
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,300
Is that so?

402
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,280
Where did you arrange
to meet these envoys?

403
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:06,300
How about this?

404
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,860
I'll meet those two envoys.

405
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,340
If we come to an agreement,
I'll let you go.

406
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,460
It's in the town's tea house.

407
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,370
We agreed

408
00:26:11,370 --> 00:26:13,130
to meet there at noon today.

409
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,280
You said the two envoys
are from Nanzhao.

410
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:17,890
Have you met them before?

411
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,280
Not yet,

412
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:21,610
but

413
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:23,340
I have a token

414
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,800
of the Moon Worship Sect.

415
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,090
We recognize each other by this token.

416
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,650
Here, here. It's here.

417
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:31,730
Turn around a bit.

418
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,130
Here, here, here.

419
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,820
The Ghost Emperor
leads a horde of demons

420
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,040
to invade the human world.

421
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:49,800
Alas, these demons are too powerful.

422
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,410
(Spring Tea House)
Thousands of disciples from Mount Shu

423
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:53,940
could not withstand him.

424
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,780
Everyone,

425
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,730
to know whether Mount Shu
can overcome this demon,

426
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,130
let's wait

427
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,890
for the next time.

428
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,490
Tell us more! Tell us more!

429
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,340
- I haven't had enough yet.
- Keep talking!

430
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,370
Okay, okay.

431
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,650
- Good story!
- Everyone, everyone.

432
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,320
Haven't had enough yet.

433
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,650
Why are you hiding here,

434
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,340
making it difficult for us to find you?

435
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,320
You are the Leader
of the Jiangnan Sub-sect?

436
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,460
That's right.

437
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,440
You two envoys have come a long way.

438
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,460
It's truly a tough journey.

439
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,280
I wonder why you two have come
to this little Yuhang Town.

440
00:27:41,620 --> 00:27:43,520
We came here to find someone.

441
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,780
Who?

442
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:48,730
Li Sansi.

443
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:53,920
So, it's Li Sansi.

444
00:27:54,370 --> 00:27:55,520
Do you know where this person is?

445
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,540
Of course, I know.

446
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,890
Forgive my bluntness.

447
00:27:59,130 --> 00:28:00,700
What did Li Sansi do?

448
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,440
Li Sansi stole a treasure from Nanzhao.

449
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,250
Chief ordered us
to find this person at all costs.

450
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:06,130
I see.

451
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:07,610
Please come with me.

452
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,780
- Okay.
- Let's go.

453
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,100
You can't do this. You...

454
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,460
Sir, if you do this,

455
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,040
my wine can't be sold anymore.

456
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,560
Come, come. Here he is.

457
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,770
This is Li Sansi.

458
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,090
Li Sansi?

459
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,090
Who... Who?

460
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,580
Who's looking for Li Sansi?

461
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,420
Li Sansi,

462
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:33,010
surrender now!

463
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,170
Capture him!

464
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,320
- Me?
- Right.

465
00:28:45,530 --> 00:28:46,370
Then I'm going.

466
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:47,490
Go!

467
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,820
Don't go!

468
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,200
Stop there.

469
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,890
Tell me. Who is Li Sansi?

470
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:58,770
A very important person.

471
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,050
No need to chase them. Don't worry.

472
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,280
They won't live long

473
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:04,680
after being hit by me.

474
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,490
His fine wine is under the counter.

475
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:24,380
Li Xiaoyao, you thief's son!

476
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,980
- He's a hero!
- You're a thief's son!

477
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,890
You're a thief's son!

478
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:27,740
He's a hero!

479
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,220
You're a thief's son!

480
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,280
He's a hero!

481
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,610
He's a thief!

482
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,770
You kids are ganging up on him.

483
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:34,890
What kind of skill is that?

484
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:36,370
What's wrong with
fighting a bad man's child?

485
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:38,420
You can't tell right from wrong
and are ganging up on him.

486
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,400
Are you good or bad?

487
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:40,610
Say it!

488
00:29:48,860 --> 00:29:49,700
Slow down.

489
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:51,490
Are you okay?

490
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:55,770
I don't need it. I wasn't crying.

491
00:29:58,820 --> 00:29:59,660
Who said you were crying?

492
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,370
I'm just telling you
to wipe the dirt off your face,

493
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,690
so your aunt won't scold you again.

494
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:15,160
Didn't you hear them earlier?

495
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:17,280
They called me the thief's son.

496
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,540
Shouldn't you stay away from me?

497
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,160
They say your dad is a thief.

498
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,250
- Do you believe that?
- Of course not.

499
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,130
My aunt says my dad is a hero,

500
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,610
but no one believes it.

501
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:28,010
Do you believe it yourself?

502
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,160
Of course, I do.

503
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,250
Well, that settles it then.

504
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,320
What others think doesn't matter.

505
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:34,400
Your opinion is what matters, you know?

506
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,800
Your dad is definitely not a bad person.

507
00:30:40,530 --> 00:30:42,520
He is a hero with a heart
full of courage and righteousness.

508
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:44,300
Sir,

509
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,650
you know my dad?

510
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,400
I came here to find him.

511
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,730
Could you take me to him?

512
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,730
My dad hasn't been home
for a long time.

513
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,890
I don't even know where he is now.

514
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,250
Why don't you come home with me
and ask my aunt?

515
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,800
Xiaoyao Inn?

516
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:04,820
Sir,

517
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,650
you know my home is Xiaoyao Inn?

518
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,700
I've heard of it.

519
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:12,400
So, our Xiaoyao Inn is so famous

520
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,200
that even you, a stranger, know of it.

521
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:16,440
Yes, I also heard

522
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:18,850
that there's the fiercest landlady
in all of Yuhang there.

523
00:31:20,410 --> 00:31:22,740
You must never
let my aunt hear you say that,

524
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,160
but I think you're right.

525
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,940
Just make sure you don't...

526
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,440
Don't tell your aunt

527
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:29,860
that you were fighting with other kids.

528
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,700
Right.

529
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,680
How did you know?

530
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,730
Because when I was a kid,

531
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,010
I was just like you.

532
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,920
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

533
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,580
Why didn't you fight back just now?

534
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,090
He just pinned me down.

535
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:48,890
This is it.

536
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:53,700
(Xiaoyao Inn)

537
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:56,940
Sir,

538
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,400
why aren't you going in?

539
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:06,490
Are you afraid of my aunt?

540
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:07,890
Don't worry.

541
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,770
She's not really that scary.

542
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,770
Li Xiaoyao!

543
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,120
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival these days.

544
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,370
The inn is so busy
with so many guests

545
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:17,780
and only a few of us
handling everything.

546
00:32:17,790 --> 00:32:19,040
I'm exhausted. Where have you been?

547
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,200
Go in and attend to the guests!

548
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:25,370
Right, Auntie, there's a guest.

549
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,940
Get in!

550
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,280
Sorry, sorry.

551
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,440
Li Xiaoyao,
you'll see how I deal with you.

552
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,520
Dear guest, please come inside.

553
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,160
Auntie, after you.

554
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,890
Okay.

555
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,280
So, the inn was so new before.

556
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,860
Good for you.

557
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:59,220
My inn was just built a few years ago.

558
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,460
Come. Don't just stand there.
Have a seat.

559
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,300
I'll serve you some water.

560
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,130
- Auntie, I'll do it.
- No.

561
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:08,970
It's not right to let guests
do it themselves.

562
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,460
Everyone here calls me Mrs. Li.

563
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,400
You can call me that too.

564
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:14,970
Mrs. Li.

565
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,220
Madam, I'd like to pay.

566
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,060
Coming.

567
00:33:18,410 --> 00:33:19,370
I stayed for three days, right?

568
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,530
Yes, yes. That's enough.

569
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,250
Where's the wine? Bring the wine.

570
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,340
- Take care, sir.
- Coming, coming.

571
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,100
Madam, I need a deluxe room.

572
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:26,250
A deluxe room? Okay.

573
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,610
Hurry up with the wine.

574
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,740
- Hurry up.
- Stay calm.

575
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,130
Stay calm. Wait a minute.

576
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:44,370
Don't drink too much.

577
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,320
The sun has just reached its peak.

578
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,200
It's fine. I haven't drunk much.

579
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,490
What are you daydreaming about?
Do you still have deluxe rooms?

580
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,340
Yes, yes, we do.

581
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,620
Our inn is clean and tidy,

582
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:55,520
and the deluxe rooms are especially quiet.
This way, please.

583
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:57,280
Sir, go up and rest first.

584
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:58,900
If there's anything you want to eat,
I'll bring it up.

585
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,890
The dishes are quite tasty.

586
00:33:59,890 --> 00:34:01,620
How about a big silverfish,
a specialty of Yuhang?

587
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:02,850
- I'll have one.
- Okay.

588
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,050
There's one deluxe room
with sunlight and one without.

589
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,900
The one without has a better view.
Which one will you take?

590
00:34:06,950 --> 00:34:08,040
I'll take the one with sunlight.

591
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,170
Alright.

592
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,560
Madam, then we'll be going.

593
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,300
- Take care, dear guests.
- We're leaving now.

594
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,590
(Xiaoyao Inn)
Okay.

595
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,720
Welcome to come again.

596
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,280
I wonder why

597
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,130
you're so familiar with my little inn.

598
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,980
Because my family also runs an inn,

599
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,820
so I know a bit about it.

600
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,960
Sir, how may I address you?

601
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,340
I...

602
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,320
My last name is Xiao. Just call me that.

603
00:34:42,650 --> 00:34:43,760
Xiao.

604
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:46,940
Thank you

605
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:48,690
for helping me out of a tight spot today.

606
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:50,650
It's no big deal, really.

607
00:34:50,890 --> 00:34:52,390
I haven't even had the chance
to serve you yet.

608
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,280
Tell me what you want to eat,
and I'll make it.

609
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,820
(Bazhen Noodles, Mutton Pancakes, Cuilv Noodles,
Furong Pancakes, Plain Noodles, Millet Rice)

610
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:02,090
Then let me decide.

611
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:04,040
I'll make some of my signature dishes.

612
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:05,970
Can you

613
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,130
make me a bowl of noodles?

614
00:35:08,410 --> 00:35:09,250
Noodles?

615
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:10,690
Of course, I can.

616
00:35:11,170 --> 00:35:12,320
Look at our menu here.

617
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,800
Cuilv noodles, yujian noodles,
and bazhen noodles.

618
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,140
Which one would you like?

619
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,560
I just want a bowl of plain noodles
with an egg.

620
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,960
Not a boiled egg, but a fried one.

621
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,480
If it's inconvenient,

622
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:27,410
- it's okay.
- No trouble at all.

623
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:29,610
I'll go cook it right now.

624
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,620
Good.

625
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,410
I just want a bowl of plain noodles
with an egg.

626
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,930
Not a boiled egg, but a fried one.

627
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,930
Auntie, Auntie, I'm hungry.

628
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,140
Hungry?

629
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,610
Didn't you just eat?

630
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,960
I didn't eat enough.

631
00:35:58,330 --> 00:36:00,000
I want to eat your plain noodles.

632
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:02,170
You're not hungry. You're just craving.

633
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,720
Auntie's plain noodles
are the best in the world.

634
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,720
Alright, I'll make some for you.

635
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:09,450
Auntie,

636
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,450
I don't want a boiled egg.
I want a fried egg.

637
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:12,760
You little rascal,

638
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,500
having food is already good enough,

639
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,620
and you're still making requests?

640
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:16,760
Fried eggs?

641
00:36:17,170 --> 00:36:18,130
Oil is very expensive!

642
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,650
Little rascal,

643
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,410
didn't you want to eat a fried egg?

644
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,000
I made it for you,
but why aren't you eating it?

645
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,220
Don't you dare waste it.

646
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:38,410
How could I possibly waste
anything you make?

647
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,170
I'm saving this fried egg to eat last.

648
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,740
When the egg has absorbed the broth,

649
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,850
that's when it tastes the best.

650
00:37:03,410 --> 00:37:04,610
Xiao, your noodles are here.

651
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:10,580
Eat up.

652
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:15,580
What's wrong?

653
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,520
Nothing, nothing.

654
00:37:34,810 --> 00:37:35,650
Xiao,

655
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:38,890
have we met somewhere before?

656
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,370
Because

657
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:47,480
you look very familiar.

658
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:50,130
No, we haven't met.

659
00:37:55,460 --> 00:37:56,300
Well,

660
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,620
Mrs. Li,

661
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,240
I'd like to ask about someone.

662
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,780
Go ahead.

663
00:38:01,170 --> 00:38:02,800
There's no one in Yuhang Town
I don't know.

664
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:07,690
Li Sansi.

665
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:11,780
Li Sansi?

666
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:15,820
Sorry,

667
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:18,170
I've never heard of this person.

668
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:20,930
Is that so?

669
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,040
He's a notorious bandit
wanted by the authorities.

670
00:38:24,330 --> 00:38:26,130
Posters of him
are posted all over Jiangnan.

671
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,370
I just saw one at the gate
of the yamen of Yuhang.

672
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:29,650
You don't remember him at all?

673
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:32,040
I'm just an owner of an inn.

674
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:35,320
I only care about my business.

675
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,410
I don't meddle in external affairs.

676
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,210
Don't be nervous,

677
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,320
I'm not from the government.

678
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:41,580
I...

679
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,650
I'm just an old friend of Mr. Li Sansi,

680
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,370
who once did me a great favor.

681
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:47,210
He's my confidant.

682
00:38:47,850 --> 00:38:49,290
I came specifically
to have a drink with him.

683
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,320
I truly don't know this person.

684
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:53,330
This is a remote place.

685
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:54,890
A notorious bandit

686
00:38:54,890 --> 00:38:56,170
wouldn't bother coming here.

687
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,300
Mrs. Li,

688
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,720
I've had a hard journey here.

689
00:39:02,890 --> 00:39:04,410
I really want to see him again.

690
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,280
Li Sansi is very important

691
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:15,540
to me.

692
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,410
Sir,

693
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,170
why don't you try looking
in Yangzhou City?

694
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:23,410
He might be there.

695
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:25,300
There are more
wealthy people there after all,

696
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,690
with more lucrative opportunities.

697
00:39:26,850 --> 00:39:28,690
Mrs. Li, I really want to meet Li Sansi.

698
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:32,890
You little rascal,
you know how to come back?

699
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:36,040
You know to come back?

700
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,090
So what if I came back a little late?

701
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,410
Why such a temper?

702
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:40,280
Talking back now?

703
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:42,460
Do you know what work
needs to be done in the inn?

704
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:44,060
You spend all day
playing in the streets.

705
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:46,060
Work, work.
You just know to make me work.

706
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,320
I'm not someone you hired.

707
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,540
You..

708
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:51,090
I'll beat you to death!
I'll beat you to death!

709
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,520
- I...
- Who are you? Who are you now?

710
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,100
I kind of want to be hit by her
a couple more times.

711
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,020
Who are you? Who are you now?

712
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:58,040
You just know to hit me!
I'm not coming back!

713
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:59,500
You little rascal,

714
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,340
come back!

715
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:03,780
I stepped on the skirt.

716
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,240
You little rascal, come back!

717
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,410
Mrs. Li, I'll go after him.

718
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,040
Don't be mad at your aunt.

719
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,610
She's doing this for your own good.

720
00:40:46,130 --> 00:40:47,090
Sir.

721
00:40:49,650 --> 00:40:50,650
You really have a big heart.

722
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,750
You just got scolded by your aunt,

723
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:52,960
and now you're playing marbles?

724
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,780
Eat less salty fish,
so you'll be less thirsty.

725
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:56,850
Mind your own business.

726
00:40:59,610 --> 00:41:00,850
Your aunt scolded you, and you ran away.

727
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:01,930
She'll worry about you.

728
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,480
No, she won't.

729
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,370
She just scolds and beats me.

730
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:08,410
Your aunt only seems fierce,

731
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,560
but she cares about you deeply inside.

732
00:41:12,260 --> 00:41:13,100
Tell me.

733
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,630
Every time you want plain noodles
with a fried egg,

734
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,700
does she scold you for being wasteful
because oil is expensive?

735
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,500
But doesn't she always serve it
with a fried egg anyway?

736
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,210
Isn't that right?

737
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:24,650
How... How do you know?

738
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,320
Of course, I know.
I know a lot more than that.

739
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,090
Your aunt might hit you,

740
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:29,850
but it's all bark and no bite, right?

741
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,780
When you help out in the inn,

742
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,740
if a customer bullies you,

743
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,370
your aunt would protect you
over doing business.

744
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,930
You know that, right?

745
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:43,450
When I came out just now,

746
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,130
I saw your aunt was really angry.

747
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,170
She even twisted her ankle.

748
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:49,240
What? What should I do then?

749
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:51,690
You're so clever.

750
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:54,130
You shouldn't need me to teach you
how to appease her.

751
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,140
Then,

752
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,090
I'll massage her legs,
rub her shoulders,

753
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,240
and make her a cup of tea.

754
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:02,210
Auntie really falls for that.

755
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,240
How do you know?

756
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,370
Are you close with my aunt?

757
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,480
How come I've never seen you before?

758
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:13,000
Aren't all aunts
around the world the same?

759
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,060
You better go back.

760
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,000
I'll pick up the marbles first.

761
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:18,210
There are so many marbles here.

762
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:31,370
