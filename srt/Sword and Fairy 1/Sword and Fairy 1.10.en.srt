3
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,840
Where's my hairpin?

4
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,250
Tang Yu,

5
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,720
I feel at ease with you here.

6
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,480
Where are we?

7
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,020
Tang Yu,

8
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,640
you're not injured, are you?

9
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:43,840
I am fine.

10
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,480
In that case,

11
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,690
let's hurry and find the Spiritual Beads.

12
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,220
Tang Yu,

13
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,170
what's wrong with you?

14
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:05,610
Still pretending to be tough?

15
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,920
Clearly, you have been seriously injured.

16
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,560
- Lie down.
- My Lady.

17
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:11,480
Go find the Earth Spiritual Bead.

18
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:13,890
It might be too late otherwise.

19
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,770
I do want to find the Spiritual Bead,

20
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:17,330
but with you so seriously injured...

21
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:18,610
What will you do if I leave?

22
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,450
My Lady,

23
00:03:21,490 --> 00:03:23,120
your task is to find the Spiritual Bead.

24
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,690
My life is not important.

25
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,300
Please, My Lady,
consider the bigger picture.

26
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,140
No.

27
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:29,940
We'll find it together.

28
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,050
I won't leave you behind.

29
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:33,120
Quick, lie down.

30
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,100
Go!

31
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,640
Protecting you is my duty.

32
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,810
My Lady, think no more of it.

33
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,100
Since you're unwilling

34
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,500
to go in search of the Spiritual Bead,

35
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,560
I shall go on your behalf.

36
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,410
You're right.

37
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,120
I am your master.

38
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,220
You are my guard.

39
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:15,760
Your life is none of my concern.

40
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,850
- Go.
- Go.

41
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:36,130
Come.

42
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,820
Get up.

43
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,570
Are you alright?

44
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:42,940
Come, pull him up.

45
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,900
Forget those for now.

46
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:49,290
Let's deal with the corpse demons first.

47
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,130
Follow me.

48
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,880
- Slow down, Jinyuan.
- It's alright. It's alright.

49
00:04:59,050 --> 00:04:59,890
Sit here.

50
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,250
Sit, come sit.

51
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:08,890
It's okay.

52
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,610
Chief,

53
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:18,820
the men you sent out

54
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,160
have searched everywhere,

55
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,530
but haven't found Physician Han.

56
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:26,140
- Search again.
- Yes.

57
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,920
Sending more people is useless.

58
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,260
Physician Han is in cahoots
with the leader of corpse demons.

59
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,160
Why keep looking for him?

60
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:32,610
Impossible.

61
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,730
My father could never

62
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,810
be in league with corpse demons.

63
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:36,850
Then why did he take the leader away?

64
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,530
Could it be
he's so benevolent as a physician

65
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,320
that he even wants to cure the leader?

66
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,730
Now,

67
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,600
there are some things
I can no longer conceal.

68
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:05,040
Mount Guiyin was originally a land
of extreme yin and malevolence.

69
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:09,440
Hundreds of years ago,
a corpse demon outbreak occurred,

70
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:12,290
causing great harm
to the surrounding villagers

71
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:13,920
who were powerless to stop it.

72
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,010
Later,

73
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:18,250
a hero known as the Ghost General
used his body as a formation

74
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:19,730
to suppress the corpse demons.

75
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,140
But the Ghost General was infected
by the corpse demons,

76
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,260
turning into one himself.

77
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,770
To prevent corpse demons from reappearing,

78
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:26,530
we voluntarily built the General's Tomb

79
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:28,010
and established Baihe Fort,

80
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,850
vowing to guard it for generations.

81
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:31,940
We are now

82
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:33,850
the third generation.

83
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,760
You disguised as corpse demons

84
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:38,530
to protect the General's Tomb?

85
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,780
Exactly.

86
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,480
The General's Tomb
had always been impregnable,

87
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,040
and corpse demons never reappeared.

88
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,290
Later generations took it as a legend,

89
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:49,850
never expecting...

90
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,640
The legend came true.

91
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,040
Chief,

92
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,290
excuse me for asking you this.

93
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,660
If you are tomb guardians,

94
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:05,730
and you said
the Ghost General was a hero,

95
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,880
why has he now become
the leader of corpse demons?

96
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,130
And why did Physician Han save him?

97
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,200
I will ask my father about it.

98
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,200
Of course, you must ask him.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,920
Otherwise, how will you explain
to the villagers of Baihe Village?

100
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,170
Our chief doesn't need to explain.

101
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,760
- Explain what?
- Exactly. We support Chief.

102
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:28,140
She would never harm us.

103
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,600
She would never hurt us.

104
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,420
Everyone,

105
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:39,570
I will investigate this matter
thoroughly.

106
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,200
If my father really...

107
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,200
I will not let familial affection
affect my judgment.

108
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:50,730
I will give everyone an explanation.

109
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,130
Chief, we believe in you.

110
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,010
Regardless of whether Physician Han
is in league with the corpse demons,

111
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:07,090
now that the leader has appeared

112
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,450
and the corpse demon threat
is escalating,

113
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,250
we need to resolve this quickly.

114
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,330
Correct.

115
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,500
The terrain here is complicated,
and there are many corpse demons.

116
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,160
Our defensive capabilities are limited.

117
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:19,320
Moreover, defending
is not a long-term solution.

118
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:21,970
Seeking a way

119
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,760
to defeat the enemy is the best strategy.

120
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,920
To completely resolve this

121
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:30,600
won't be easy.

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,940
Chief,

123
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,170
do you know of anything
that the corpse demon fears?

124
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,240
I have never heard of such a thing,

125
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,610
but it's said
there's a place in Mount Guiyin

126
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,410
where the corpse demons never approach.

127
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,660
Where is that?

128
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:47,320
Deep within Mount Guiyin,

129
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,730
there is the Jade Buddha Temple.

130
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,050
In that case,

131
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,730
why haven't you gone to this temple

132
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,170
to seek a solution?

133
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:03,540
Actually,

134
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,410
some of us had secretly
gone there before.

135
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,530
I was injured by a corpse demon,

136
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,000
and my father couldn't cure me.

137
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,610
The Second Chief of our fort
went there to seek a cure for me

138
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,930
but has not returned since.

139
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,930
The Third Chief also sent people
to look for him,

140
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:23,320
but they too, never returned.

141
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,760
Never returned?

142
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,370
Could it be that the temple
devours people?

143
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,120
Xiaoyao,

144
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:34,090
let's go to the Jade Buddha Temple.

145
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,340
If there really is a way
to solve this there,

146
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,370
nothing could be better.

147
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,800
If not,

148
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,900
we can also go there to see

149
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,440
what exactly happened to those people.

150
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,490
Miss Zhao,

151
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,970
I'm very sorry

152
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,240
to involve you all.

153
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,600
The situation of the Jade Buddha Temple
is uncertain.

154
00:09:53,410 --> 00:09:55,050
You must not rashly go there.

155
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:56,330
Chief,

156
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,880
since we have gotten involved,

157
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,120
we should see it through to the end.

158
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,050
What are we waiting for?

159
00:10:05,050 --> 00:10:06,440
Let's go to the Jade Buddha Temple now.

160
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:07,570
Good.

161
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:08,810
Scholar,

162
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,650
you don't need to come with us.

163
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,790
Stay and take care of everyone here.

164
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:13,530
The more people, the more strength.

165
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:15,090
- I'm coming with you. No need to say more.
- Jinyuan.

166
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:18,570
As expected.

167
00:10:22,090 --> 00:10:22,930
Then,

168
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,000
you all must be extra careful.

169
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:34,970
Are you okay? Let's go.

170
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,490
Miss Zhao.

171
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,730
Chief.

172
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,450
Miss Zhao,

173
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:46,170
our Second Chief
is named Jiang Shaoyun.

174
00:10:47,140 --> 00:10:48,440
If you come across him,

175
00:10:51,090 --> 00:10:52,530
please give this to him.

176
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:01,440
Chief, I understand.

177
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,320
We will definitely bring him back.

178
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,300
Mr Li.

179
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:19,980
Chief,

180
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:21,180
rest assured.

181
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,090
If we encounter Physician Han,

182
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,290
we'll first clarify things
before deciding whether to fight.

183
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,420
Thank you.

184
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:51,610
Who does he think he is?

185
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,900
Even if he saved me,

186
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,680
he's just a guard.

187
00:11:55,090 --> 00:11:57,050
Besides, I didn't ask him to save me.

188
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,120
Anyway,

189
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,880
he always annoys me.

190
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,050
He deserves to get hurt.

191
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,190
Nanzhao is still waiting for
the Water Spiritual Bead to pray for rain.

192
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,880
His life is nothing compared

193
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:26,680
to the Five Spiritual Beads.

194
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,090
He's just a guard.

195
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:37,120
His life is not your concern.

196
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,660
Right.

197
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,000
Not your concern.

198
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,610
Don't think that by doing this,

199
00:13:33,170 --> 00:13:34,610
I'll be grateful to you.

200
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,100
My Lady.

201
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,050
I forgot this.

202
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,440
It's just a small effort.

203
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,970
I'm also just making a small effort.

204
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,580
This is the Zijing Yurong Pill
given to me

205
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,610
by my master, the Sacred Maid.

206
00:15:59,140 --> 00:16:00,370
No matter how severe the injury,

207
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,970
it will heal in several days.

208
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,320
Thank you, My Lady.

209
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:06,330
Don't move.

210
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,440
You're injured.

211
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,610
And,

212
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,970
don't sacrifice the big picture
for something small again.

213
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,970
This hairpin

214
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:26,130
is not important.

215
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,410
Your teachings,

216
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:34,370
I will definitely bear in mind, My Lady.

217
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,120
My Lady, you...

218
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,580
It's nothing.

219
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,770
Then you should rest a bit.

220
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,970
We'll leave in a while.

221
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
Yes.

222
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:41,490
Look,

223
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,060
we have arrived.

224
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,540
(Jade Buddha Temple)

225
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,370
Baihe Fort lies in ruins,

226
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,420
yet here lies tranquility
under the green shade.

227
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,010
Doesn't that seem a bit odd?

228
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,890
Maybe it's the Buddha's protection.

229
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,280
Or it could be an illusion.

230
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,680
We should still be cautious.

231
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,980
Sir, may I ask where your abbot is?

232
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,920
Amitabha.

233
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:27,220
We are...

234
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,090
Amitabha.

235
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,500
No, we want to...

236
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,400
Amitabha.

237
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,090
Amitabha.

238
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,620
If you say "Amitabha" again,
I'll fight you.

239
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,890
I'm asking where your abbot is.

240
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,770
Amitabha.

241
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,200
Amitabha.

242
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:52,520
Amitabha.

243
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:53,730
Amitabha.

244
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,890
Amitabha.

245
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:58,850
This monk seems silly

246
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,180
and odd.

247
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:04,280
I also faintly feel
a trace of demonic aura.

248
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:06,770
How could that be?

249
00:19:07,050 --> 00:19:08,580
This is a thousand-year-old temple.

250
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,610
Why would there be demons?

251
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,980
(Shakya ManiHall)

252
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:20,010
Let's go in and see.

253
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,610
Amitabha.

254
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:47,090
Master,

255
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,440
are you the abbot here?

256
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:51,010
Indeed.

257
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,730
I am Zhixiu.

258
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,490
May I ask why the three of you are here?

259
00:19:56,890 --> 00:19:58,040
Greetings, Master Zhixiu.

260
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,460
I am Li Xiaoyao.

261
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,610
These two are my friends.

262
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:05,090
Corpse demons from Mount Guiyin
have suddenly surged,

263
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,040
causing great harm
to the surrounding people.

264
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:08,770
Hearing of your high spiritual power,

265
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:10,700
we came to request you
to go and subdue the demons

266
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,900
and eliminate the harm for the people.

267
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,280
I am a follower

268
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,520
of Buddhism

269
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,730
and do not concern myself
with the secular affairs.

270
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:23,440
You should return.

271
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:25,200
Master, that is not right.

272
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:27,730
It is the natural duty of monks
to exorcise demons and maintain justice.

273
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,650
How can this be considered
a secular affair?

274
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,250
Mr. Li, you believe that

275
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:40,890
it is the duty of monks
to exorcise demons and maintain justice.

276
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:41,730
So,

277
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,090
are you willing to do that?

278
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,540
Of course.

279
00:20:46,550 --> 00:20:47,860
As long as it's within my capabilities,

280
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,700
I will do my utmost.

281
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,490
So, do you agree

282
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:55,370
that one should maintain a compassionate heart
to liberate the world from calamity?

283
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:56,610
It should be so.

284
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,850
Good. It seems that

285
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,130
Mr. Li is indeed a person
with the roots of wisdom and Buddha-nature.

286
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,730
You're flattering me.

287
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,780
Please accompany us down
the mountain to subdue the demons.

288
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:12,730
Zhize,

289
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:15,850
quickly fetch me the razor
and monk's robe.

290
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,210
Yes.

291
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,370
Master,

292
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,970
what do you need
the razor and monk's robe for?

293
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,620
Of course, to ordain you.

294
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:28,200
Otherwise, should it be
for me and Ling'er?

295
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:32,130
You have good roots of wisdom, too.

296
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:35,280
Master, I... I didn't say
I wanted to become a monk.

297
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,130
Mr. Li, since you have agreed,

298
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:39,090
how can you
go back on your word so quickly?

299
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,560
When did I agree?

300
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,890
You just said

301
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,090
it's the natural duty of monks
to exorcise demons and maintain justice.

302
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:48,010
I asked if you were willing to do so,

303
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:49,650
and you agreed.

304
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:50,490
This...

305
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,610
Xiaoyao.

306
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,370
Well, monks can't get married
or have children.

307
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,040
I... I'm not yet married.

308
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,610
It is said, "Of the three unfilial acts,
the worst is to have no descendants."

309
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,850
I cannot become a monk.

310
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,340
Mr. Li,

311
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:08,970
Buddha says, "Form is emptiness,
and emptiness is form.

312
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:11,890
Everything that appears is illusory."

313
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,520
Why cling to them?

314
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,440
You monk, stop spouting nonsense.

315
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,500
Just tell us the method
to exorcise the demons.

316
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,650
Yueru, Xiaoyao,

317
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:27,250
I think there's no method
to exorcise demons here.

318
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,440
Let's leave quickly.

319
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,490
Right.

320
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,680
Oh, Master Zhixiu,

321
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:33,560
do you have someone
named Jiang Shaoyun here?

322
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:35,850
If he's here,
please let us take him back.

323
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:42,650
Any man who steps
into the Jade Buddha Temple,

324
00:22:42,650 --> 00:22:44,200
no matter what his purpose is,

325
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,340
must stay and become a monk.

326
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:47,370
No exceptions.

327
00:22:47,620 --> 00:22:49,610
Then we'll see if you
have the ability to enforce that.

328
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,160
In that case,

329
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,730
please be patient.

330
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:03,650
There's something wrong with this bell.
Be careful.

331
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:06,130
Quick, cover your ears!

332
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,460
Savage girl!

333
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,340
Ling'er!

334
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:40,970
Sleep.

335
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,770
Sleep.

336
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:01,490
All beings suffer.

337
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,370
It's difficult to escape
their inner demons.

338
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:07,090
Only through cultivation

339
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,850
can one follow the right path.

340
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,250
Who else wants to try?

341
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,820
Get on.

342
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,560
Get on. Get on.

343
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:19,160
Get on. Get on.

344
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,680
I'll give it a try.

345
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:27,010
Look, look!

346
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:28,440
It's a phoenix, a phoenix!

347
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:30,370
And there's someone sitting on it.

348
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:31,890
Who is that?

349
00:24:32,030 --> 00:24:34,160
That must be a great hero
who cultivates immortality.

350
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:35,520
So impressive!

351
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:37,200
Impressive!

352
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,040
So majestic!

353
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:49,040
Could it be him?

354
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,280
Li Xiaoyao, it's you!

355
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:01,490
Of course, it's me.

356
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,730
Who else could it be?

357
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:05,770
What are you here for?

358
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,250
To combat for marriage.

359
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,170
Dream on.

360
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,890
We'll see about that after the combat.

361
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,850
(I knew you would use this move.)

362
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:58,530
Alright.

363
00:25:58,530 --> 00:25:59,920
Li Xiaoyao, admit it.

364
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,040
You're defeated by me.

365
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:03,800
- Great!
- Great!

366
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,010
What are you looking at?

367
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,490
Miss Lin is highly skilled.

368
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:18,850
I am inferior.

369
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,730
Though I am defeated by you.

370
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,410
I have admired you for a long time.

371
00:26:25,410 --> 00:26:26,560
I hope you will fulfill my wish.

372
00:26:29,770 --> 00:26:30,610
Li Xiaoyao,

373
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,130
let me make it clear.

374
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,370
It's not me marrying into your family.

375
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,370
It's you marrying into my family.

376
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,800
As it should be.

377
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,280
His bride is also beautiful, right?

378
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,300
Yes.

379
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,010
Xiaoyao hasn't returned
for many years,

380
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:56,890
and now he comes back
as Xiaoyao, the Hero,

381
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,770
bringing such a beautiful girl with him.

382
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,210
Auntie.

383
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:03,130
Xiaoyao, you're back.

384
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,650
Auntie, I have been unruly
and ignorant in the past,

385
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:06,970
causing you to worry.

386
00:27:07,410 --> 00:27:08,400
It's good that you're back.

387
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:09,890
Xiaoyao,

388
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:12,290
I've heard about your deeds

389
00:27:12,290 --> 00:27:13,820
in the martial world over these years.

390
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:16,610
You haven't dishonored
your parents' good name.

391
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,490
You and Ling'er...

392
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,170
I have met Ling'er's parents.

393
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:24,010
They have agreed

394
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,850
to betroth Ling'er to me.

395
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,500
Let's hold the wedding for you now.

396
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:33,800
Good, good, good.

397
00:27:35,170 --> 00:27:37,460
First bow. May the two families unite.

398
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:41,770
Great! Bravo! Wonderful!

399
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:46,460
Second bow.
May the husband and wife join hands.

400
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:50,440
- Great! Bravo!
- Wonderful!

401
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,490
May you receive the world's blessings

402
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:58,920
and happiness fill your bridal chamber.

403
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,130
Good, good, good!

404
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,680
Congratulations, congratulations.

405
00:28:03,370 --> 00:28:04,280
Congratulations.

406
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,340
Good!

407
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,620
Congratulations.

408
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,770
Good!

409
00:28:38,770 --> 00:28:39,610
Where's the snake demon?

410
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,460
Who dares to wreak havoc here?

411
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,250
- Surrender now!
- Why waste words on a snake demon?

412
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,890
Xiaoyao.

413
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,090
Ling'er?

414
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,580
Zhao Ling'er.

415
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:04,160
You turned out to be a snake demon.

416
00:29:04,940 --> 00:29:06,370
After all the effort
to have me follow you,

417
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,290
what are you plotting?

418
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,490
What else could she plot?

419
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:11,200
Snake demons are just
trying to bewitch people.

420
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,780
I was stupid to treat you
like a sister before.

421
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,770
What dark plot do you have
by infiltrating the Lin Fortress?

422
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,200
Xiaoyao,

423
00:29:17,370 --> 00:29:18,770
I don't know why either.

424
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:20,100
I don't know why

425
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,490
I turned into this.

426
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:22,540
Zhao Ling'er,

427
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,040
the truth is right before our eyes.

428
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,890
You're a snake demon.
Stop making excuses.

429
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,820
You snake demon,

430
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,280
we won't be bewitched
by you anymore.

431
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,580
Xiaoyao,

432
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:32,440
Yueru, let me explain.

433
00:29:33,010 --> 00:29:34,290
I'm not a snake demon.

434
00:29:34,290 --> 00:29:35,800
Demons should be eliminated
by everyone.

435
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:36,970
Snake demon,

436
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,610
I'll end you now,
to rid the people of harm.

437
00:30:10,010 --> 00:30:11,040
Who are you

438
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,850
to break my Jade Buddha
Magical Formation?

439
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,490
Are you the one who trapped us here?

440
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,610
Where are Xiaoyao and Yueru?

441
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,700
They

442
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:23,770
are enjoying themselves
in the formation.

443
00:30:23,770 --> 00:30:25,040
Release them now!

444
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:30,970
Miss Lin is highly skilled.

445
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,250
I am inferior.

446
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,040
Though I am defeated by you.

447
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,610
I have admired you for a long time.

448
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:39,890
I hope you will fulfill my wish.

449
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,010
Xiaoyao...

450
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,530
Yueru...

451
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:46,320
These are projections of their desires.

452
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:48,890
The more they want something,

453
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,130
the more they'll dream of it.

454
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:58,920
Xiaoyao, Yueru,

455
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,610
wake up, please!

456
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,680
It's no use.

457
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:04,780
Unless

458
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,560
they want to wake up themselves,

459
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,970
nobody can wake them.

460
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:12,320
I'll wake them up no matter what.

461
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,650
No wonder you can break my formation.

462
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,560
Turns out you're not an ordinary person.

463
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,250
To break my formation,

464
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,730
you'll use up all your spiritual power.

465
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,800
If you exhaust your spiritual power,

466
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,040
then your secret

467
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:32,250
will no longer be hidden.

468
00:31:35,650 --> 00:31:36,490
Secret?

469
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:38,320
If you break this formation,

470
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,850
your secret will be exposed.

471
00:31:48,530 --> 00:31:49,490
Then,

472
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,200
the thing you fear the most

473
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:55,610
will become true.

474
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,890
Demons should be eliminated
by everyone.

475
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,340
Snake demon,

476
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll end you now,
to rid the people of harm.

477
00:32:10,290 --> 00:32:11,130
Are others

478
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,440
also trapped in this dream by you?

479
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,400
I'm converting people.

480
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:18,040
Buddhism is not like this.

481
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:20,400
Desires in dreams

482
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,090
are also illusory.

483
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,890
Even if you make the dream beautiful,

484
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:27,400
it's all just an illusion.

485
00:33:06,530 --> 00:33:08,010
All the gods and Buddhas...

486
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:18,090
This is...

487
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,010
The Jade Buddha Temple.

488
00:33:23,010 --> 00:33:23,850
Ling'er.

489
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,540
Ling'er.

490
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:31,090
Ling'er, Ling'er, what's wrong?

491
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,940
Wine...

492
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,680
I can still drink.

493
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,920
Savage girl, come to your senses.

494
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:41,540
Ling'er.

495
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,180
Ling'er.

496
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,210
Ling'er.

497
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,580
Li Xiaoyao,

498
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,560
am I dreaming?

499
00:33:50,010 --> 00:33:51,370
Savage girl, come to your senses.

500
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,460
We were all caught
in the old monk's illusion

501
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:54,300
and passed out.

502
00:33:58,250 --> 00:33:59,490
So, it was all a dream.

503
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,420
Ling'er.

504
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:05,890
Ling'er.

505
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,730
Xiaoyao.

506
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,580
That's great.

507
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,890
I was so scared just now.

508
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,850
Don't look at me.

509
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:18,800
Ling'er, what's wrong?

510
00:34:19,370 --> 00:34:20,210
Don't look at me.

511
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,140
Don't look at me.

512
00:34:21,890 --> 00:34:22,730
- Ling'er.
- Don't look at me.

513
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,060
Don't look at me.

514
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,040
Ling'er, did you have a nightmare?

515
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:30,330
Don't be scared.
We were just under an illusion.

516
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:31,240
It's all right now.

517
00:34:31,650 --> 00:34:33,170
To break my formation,

518
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,210
you'll use up all your spiritual power.

519
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,560
Then your secret

520
00:34:36,740 --> 00:34:38,410
will no longer be hidden.

521
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:48,060
So,

522
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:49,890
it was all fake.

523
00:34:51,650 --> 00:34:52,490
Ling'er,

524
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:53,580
don't be afraid.

525
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:54,560
I'm here to protect you.

526
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:08,210
No.

527
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,170
I have to settle this with that monk.

528
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:13,410
You monk, come out!

529
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:17,450
Xiaoyao.

530
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,450
Don't worry, I'm here.

531
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,540
Let's go.

532
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,740
(Shakya ManiHall)

533
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:27,720
You monk, come out!

534
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:29,900
Come out!

535
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,490
I can't take it anymore.

536
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,720
I don't want to be a monk anymore.

537
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,650
I don't want to be a monk anymore.

538
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,020
I don't want to be a monk anymore.

539
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:38,170
I can't take it anymore!

540
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,480
What's wrong with him?

541
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:49,040
He must have also been affected
by that demon monk's spell.

542
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:55,930
Who am I?

543
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,370
I seem to have forgotten
something important

544
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,000
and an important person.

545
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,000
Who is it?

546
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:07,410
Who is it?

547
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:09,720
She is...

548
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,000
Who is she?

549
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,450
Who are you?

550
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:48,090
This is the token of love
I gave to Mengci.

551
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:56,090
I remember now.

552
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,650
- I am...
- Jiang Shaoyun?

553
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:05,280
I am Jiang Shaoyun.

554
00:37:08,170 --> 00:37:10,280
I am Jiang Shaoyun.

555
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,370
He's the Second Chief of Baihe Fort.

556
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,240
How is Mengci?

557
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:24,410
Is her illness cured?

558
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,370
Yes, she's fine now.

559
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:28,610
Quickly wake the others trapped here,

560
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,760
so they can go home.

561
00:37:30,090 --> 00:37:31,720
Then come back to Baihe Fort with us.

562
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,140
Alright.

563
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,380
I'll do it right now.

564
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:40,240
No wonder they said the Second Chief
of Baihe Fort disappeared.

565
00:37:41,060 --> 00:37:42,960
He was trapped by this demon monk.

566
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,410
Let's see how I'll deal with him later.

567
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,370
Since you're here,

568
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,520
don't think about leaving.

569
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:55,850
Amitabha.

570
00:37:57,090 --> 00:37:58,260
Unexpectedly,

571
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,610
you managed to escape

572
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,450
from my Wujin Bell's illusion.

573
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:04,130
It won't be so easy this time.

574
00:38:04,130 --> 00:38:05,240
Be careful of his bell.

575
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:16,450
Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me!

576
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:19,610
Stop hitting me. Stop hitting me!

577
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,720
Please spare my life.
I won't dare do it again.

578
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,850
Don't think I won't beat you

579
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,070
just because you turned into a child.

580
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,620
Tell me.

581
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,780
Why are you harming people?

582
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,180
(Little Stone)
I didn't harm anyone.

583
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,540
I just wanted them to become monks.

584
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,130
I didn't force them to do bad things.

585
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,850
Then what kind of demon are you?

586
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,760
I'm not a demon.

587
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:46,090
I'm transformed from the Buddha beads
on Buddha's desk.

588
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,240
I have been cultivating for 9,999 years.

589
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,560
If that's the case,

590
00:38:54,410 --> 00:38:56,170
you should focus on the cultivation

591
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:57,650
to seek enlightenment,

592
00:38:58,330 --> 00:39:00,560
not force others to become monks.

593
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,240
The scriptures say
all beings can be saved.

594
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:12,130
The scriptures also say
everyone has Buddha-nature,

595
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,940
so I thought

596
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:17,220
if I could make many people
become disciples of Buddhism,

597
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,690
the Buddha would be moved

598
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:24,000
and would take me to heaven
to become a Buddha.

599
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:28,850
What kind of cultivation method is this?

600
00:39:28,850 --> 00:39:29,690
Who taught you this?

601
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,580
I...

602
00:39:31,850 --> 00:39:33,690
I thought of it
while reading the scriptures.

603
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:38,890
The essence of cultivation
lies in selflessness and helping others.

604
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:41,320
Buddha said
forsaking one's self is selflessness,

605
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,610
and compassion is helping others.

606
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,890
Yet, your actions are the opposite,

607
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,690
destroying your merit.

608
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,000
It's a pity you have
a thousand years of cultivation

609
00:39:51,370 --> 00:39:53,090
but only the wisdom of a child.

610
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,850
Continuing this way,

611
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,540
you might not become a Buddha

612
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,890
but fall into the demonic path instead.

613
00:40:00,220 --> 00:40:01,210
I understand now.

614
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,090
I finally understand
why you could break

615
00:40:04,090 --> 00:40:05,520
my Jade Buddha Magical Formation.

616
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,540
Bodhisattva...

617
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:10,890
You are a Bodhisattva.

618
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:14,370
I... I... I'm not a Bodhisattva.

619
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,850
Then you're a fairy.

620
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,090
I... I'm not a fairy either.

621
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:20,500
Miss, I'm really moved.

622
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,410
No one has ever taught me
these principles before.

623
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:25,960
Please take me as your disciple.

624
00:40:26,170 --> 00:40:27,800
I won't take anyone as a disciple.

625
00:40:28,130 --> 00:40:29,370
And these principles

626
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:30,940
are just something I read in books.

627
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:33,020
If you won't take me as a disciple,

628
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:34,850
I'll just kneel here and not get up.

629
00:40:37,220 --> 00:40:38,480
Let him atone for his actions.

630
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,450
We need to subdue the corpse demons.

631
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,000
Maybe this little one can be of use.

632
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:45,800
Let me follow you.

633
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:49,130
I can help you
subdue the corpse demons.

634
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,320
In that case,

635
00:40:53,890 --> 00:40:54,960
follow me.

636
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,520
From now on, I'll call you Little Stone.

637
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:59,410
You can come out when you're called.

638
00:41:02,370 --> 00:41:04,040
May I ask how to call you?

639
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,620
I'm Zhao Ling'er.

640
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:08,650
Then I'll call you
Miss Fairy from now on.

641
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,850
You slick talker.

642
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:35,930
Ling'er,

643
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:37,370
you look pale.

644
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:38,890
Let's rest a bit before moving on.

645
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,170
Ling'er, what did you
dream about just now?

646
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,720
Just a common nightmare.

647
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:01,170
If it's a nightmare, forget it quickly.

648
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:03,410
Silly rat,

649
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,650
tell me. What did you dream about?

650
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,690
Of course, a beautiful dream.

651
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:09,220
So beautiful I didn't want to wake up.

652
00:42:09,220 --> 00:42:10,370
Tell me. What did you dream about?

653
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,410
Nothing.

654
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,720
Seeing you like this,

655
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:15,980
you must have dreamed
something shameful.

656
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:18,410
Right, I dreamed about you,
the most shameful thing.

657
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,480
The most venomous is in women's hearts.

658
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,500
You probably
stabbed me again in the dream.

659
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,890
Not just stabbed you once,

660
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:25,020
I killed you eight hundred times.

661
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,780
After all, you can only imagine
such things in dreams.

662
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,980
In reality, you can't beat me.

663
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,980
- I...
- What about you?

664
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,820
You just can't beat me.

665
00:42:29,830 --> 00:42:30,690
