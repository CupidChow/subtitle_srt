3
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,050
General Gai,

4
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,090
when exactly did you

5
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:49,920
find my mother's statue?

6
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,250
Your Highness, ten years ago,
after learning about the changes in Nanzhao,

7
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:55,490
the Lady of the South and I
started searching for your whereabouts.

8
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,000
Unfortunately,

9
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,360
we didn't find you.

10
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,570
Later, we heard about the Queen's statue

11
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,890
appearing in Yunmeng Marsh,

12
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:03,850
so we came here to investigate carefully.

13
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,250
Upon inspection, it was indeed true,

14
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,970
so we decided to stay.

15
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,300
Then,

16
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,000
could the disappearance
of Yunmeng Marsh's waterways

17
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:18,480
be related to my mother's statue?

18
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:21,200
It's very likely.

19
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,970
When the water here disappeared,

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,100
a magical zone appeared
around the Queen's statue,

21
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,480
preventing anyone from approaching.

22
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,000
However, I believe
you might be an exception.

23
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:36,090
General Gai, have you heard
about how to revive my mother?

24
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,050
Revive the Queen?

25
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,090
Your Highness, who told you about this?

26
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:50,410
General Gai,

27
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,530
my people obtained this information
after much investigation.

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,820
Only the Princess

29
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:56,890
can revive the Queen.

30
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,720
The Witch King did what he did back then

31
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,690
out of necessity.

32
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,900
He has missed the Witch Queen

33
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:03,490
and the Princess greatly
over the past ten years.

34
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,300
If the Queen could indeed be revived,

35
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:06,860
it would not only be a fortune
for the Witch King

36
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,640
but also a blessing for Nanzhao.

37
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,690
General Gai,

38
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,330
I beg of you.

39
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,170
If it's

40
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,000
really possible to revive my mother,

41
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,050
I have very important questions to ask her.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,720
Alright, I'll take you there.

43
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,120
We will set off early tomorrow morning.

44
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:41,120
Now, everyone should return
to their rooms to rest.

45
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,450
Thank you, General Gai.

46
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,280
Is there anyone there?

47
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:52,360
Could you let us stay for the night?

48
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,120
In this desert,

49
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,760
why is there an inn?

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,580
Be careful.

51
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,530
This inn

52
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,120
looks a bit strange.

53
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,740
Go behind me.

54
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:19,170
This...

55
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:20,890
My dear guests,

56
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:22,810
are you stopping to dine or stay?

57
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:24,810
It really is an inn.

58
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,890
Put away the sword.

59
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,980
Sir,

60
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,800
we are passing by

61
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,400
and wondering if
there are any rooms available.

62
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
Come in.

63
00:04:45,210 --> 00:04:46,410
Please, come inside.

64
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,730
Please, take a seat inside.

65
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,170
Sir,

66
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,200
it seems your inn
doesn't do much business.

67
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,290
This place is remote,

68
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,090
and indeed, not many guests stay over.

69
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,570
Business is just getting by.

70
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:09,200
Please, have a seat, have a seat.

71
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,210
Given this,

72
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:14,040
you must have a good memory

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:15,320
of the guests who do stay.

74
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,690
You two

75
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,980
made quite an impression on me.

76
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,970
Nonsense.

77
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,570
Sir,

78
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,880
may I ask

79
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,360
if there was an odd-looking old man
with two young ladies and some men staying here?

80
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,850
I'm a friend of theirs.

81
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,780
No.

82
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:41,320
In the past few days,
it's only been you two.

83
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:45,290
We're a bit hungry.

84
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,640
Do you have anything to eat?

85
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,730
What would you like to eat?

86
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,610
Two bowls of noodles
without toppings will do.

87
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,570
Wouldn't you want
some wine and side dishes

88
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:54,730
to warm up and relieve the fatigue?

89
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,690
- No need.
- Alright then.

90
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:00,260
We've indeed been tired
from traveling these days.

91
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,100
Please serve it quickly.

92
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,200
Coming right up.

93
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,680
Don't you have any experience
traveling the martial world?

94
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,010
In this wild and desolate place,

95
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,880
aren't you afraid this is a trap,
yet you still want wine?

96
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,890
Let's make peace with being here.

97
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:16,770
Besides, we neither
have wealth nor looks.

98
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:17,760
What's there to fear?

99
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,130
Ling'er,

100
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,480
I told you Li Xiaoyao
would catch up to find you.

101
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,530
Don't avoid him anymore. Go meet him.

102
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,500
Your Highness,

103
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,850
don't forget

104
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,010
that Li Xiaoyao can't go to Nanzhao.

105
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,600
Why can't he go to Nanzhao?

106
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,050
General Gai,

107
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,880
have you heard

108
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,500
my mother

109
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,090
used the Shadowless Poison

110
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,130
to kill Li Sansi and his wife?

111
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,220
What?

112
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,810
That's impossible.

113
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,760
Though the Shadowless Poison
is unique to the Queen,

114
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,760
she would never use it to harm others.

115
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,640
You can trust her in this matter.

116
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:32,780
Your Highness,

117
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,760
you care so much about the Li couple.

118
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:36,500
Could it be

119
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,130
related to Li Xiaoyao?

120
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,780
They

121
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,920
are Xiaoyao's parents.

122
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:56,380
Ling'er,

123
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,130
I finally understand why you left.

124
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:02,810
A'nu, on this matter,

125
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,640
Mr. Shi is right.

126
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,090
Many in Nanzhao's court

127
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,610
still despise

128
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,130
the Li couple.

129
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,780
Your Highness,

130
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,850
if you really care about Li Xiaoyao,

131
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,130
it's better not to let him go to Nanzhao.

132
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,810
But we can't stop him.

133
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:21,580
Even if you avoid him,

134
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,970
he will continue to find you.

135
00:08:23,290 --> 00:08:24,130
Look.

136
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:26,010
Don't worry.

137
00:08:26,490 --> 00:08:27,730
I've already instructed Panzi.

138
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:32,880
Here it comes.

139
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:34,320
The wine and dishes are here.

140
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,060
Enjoy your meal.

141
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,420
Please enjoy.

142
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,890
Sir,

143
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:48,410
I see your inn
is built against the mountain.

144
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:51,170
May I ask if there are other places
to rest within this mountain?

145
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,410
No, no, no.

146
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,530
That's just a barren hill.

147
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,680
Then, please enjoy your meal.

148
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,090
I'll go and prepare the rooms.

149
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,810
Thank you for your trouble.

150
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,860
Thank you.

151
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,640
You better not drink for now.

152
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
Then I'll eat the noodles.

153
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,540
Landlord.

154
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:24,570
Landlord.

155
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,260
The dishes and wine are served,

156
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,320
with lots of drugs.

157
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:29,060
General Gai...

158
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,200
Your Highness, don't worry.

159
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,200
It'll just make them sleep for a day,

160
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,490
harmless to their health.

161
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,170
After they fall asleep,

162
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:43,320
have someone help them
back to their rooms to rest properly.

163
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:44,370
Understood.

164
00:09:51,410 --> 00:09:52,580
The noodles are fine.

165
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,420
You can eat them.

166
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,490
Today we have wine and shall be merry.

167
00:10:09,050 --> 00:10:12,490
Tomorrow's worries are for tomorrow.

168
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:13,330
Got them.

169
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:19,570
Savage girl,

170
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,050
if Ling'er isn't in Yunmeng Marsh,

171
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,970
you should go back first.

172
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,220
Why should I?

173
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,200
Ling'er is my friend too,

174
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,490
I'm looking for her. What's it to you?

175
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:47,530
It's the noodles.

176
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,060
Savage girl?

177
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:53,980
Savage girl?

178
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,680
Xiaoyao.

179
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,810
Ling'er.

180
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,610
Aren't you...

181
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,810
Ling'er,

182
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,000
it's really you, Ling'er.

183
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,320
I've finally found you.

184
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,220
Ling'er.

185
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:04,890
Ling'er.

186
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:07,900
Xiaoyao, there are
many Nanzhao people here.

187
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,530
It's too dangerous. You must leave.

188
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:13,930
Come with me.

189
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:23,120
Mr. Huangfu Ying

190
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,730
already told me

191
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,760
what happened to my parents.

192
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:28,890
Ling'er,

193
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,170
since no one can explain
my parents' death,

194
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,190
I should investigate further
to find the truth.

195
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,170
Xiaoyao,

196
00:13:41,170 --> 00:13:42,170
now in Nanzhao,

197
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,370
many people

198
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,970
still hate your parents

199
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,170
to the bone.

200
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,860
They

201
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:52,680
might harm you.

202
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
Ling'er,

203
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:56,580
now I believe in my parents,

204
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,640
and you believe in your mother.

205
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,090
We should investigate together

206
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,560
to clear their names.

207
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,170
- But I'm still worried.
- What joy is there in living,

208
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,170
and what fear in dying?

209
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:09,420
Ling'er,

210
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:13,240
if I can't be with you,

211
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,640
being alive

212
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,930
is no different from being dead.

213
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,440
Xiaoyao.

214
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:47,410
We must face

215
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,240
what we have to face eventually.

216
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,930
At this point,

217
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,410
we have no choice anymore.

218
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,800
We can't back down.

219
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,000
Even if we have to die,

220
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:02,640
we must make things clear.

221
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,560
Greetings, Chief.

222
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,930
You're back.

223
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,170
It's been three years.

224
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,000
You've done well.

225
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,680
Thank you, Chief.

226
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,880
You may rise.

227
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,100
Yes.

228
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,560
Tang Yu,

229
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,680
what are you thinking?

230
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:26,970
I just

231
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,050
have some doubts.

232
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:34,610
Doubts?

233
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,200
For three years,

234
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,050
I ordered you
to infiltrate the Witch Moon Sect.

235
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,120
Did I ever ask you to kill or set fires?

236
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,420
No.

237
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,000
You just asked me to pay attention

238
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,850
to whether they had
rebellious intentions.

239
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:54,800
I asked you to secretly monitor
Li Xiaoyao and others,

240
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,970
but did I ask you to harm them?

241
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,740
No.

242
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,800
Then your doubts do not exist.

243
00:17:05,290 --> 00:17:06,400
Go back.

244
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:10,850
Yes.

245
00:17:19,770 --> 00:17:20,610
Chief,

246
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,090
there's one more thing.

247
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,130
Tell me.

248
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,130
Will those people

249
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,890
be harmed tomorrow?

250
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,610
What I mean is

251
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,370
that they aren't bad people.

252
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,680
Am I a bad person?

253
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,320
You're obviously a good person.

254
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,800
What is good?

255
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,250
What is bad?

256
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:14,650
Those mundane feelings

257
00:18:14,650 --> 00:18:16,130
and simple emotions,

258
00:18:16,130 --> 00:18:18,440
they are the laws of the mortal world.

259
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,320
With these laws,

260
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,250
can we conquer Nanzhao?

261
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,250
Can we rule the masses?

262
00:18:28,530 --> 00:18:31,100
Ten years ago,
the Witch Queen stopped me.

263
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,040
Now,

264
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:35,560
Li Xiaoyao and others

265
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:38,920
think they can oppose me
with just a few beads.

266
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,400
It's utterly delusional.

267
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:43,610
No one

268
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,770
can stop me from ruling the world.

269
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:49,320
Whoever dares to be an enemy

270
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,890
of the Moon Worship Sect

271
00:18:53,370 --> 00:18:56,370
will die without a place for burial.

272
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,700
Mr. Shi.

273
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,180
Tang Yu,

274
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:24,320
where have you just been?

275
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:29,560
I heard some disturbances outside

276
00:19:29,890 --> 00:19:30,860
and went to check.

277
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,890
What disturbance?

278
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,220
A hawk's cry.

279
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,250
What's unusual about that?

280
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,440
Besides the hawk's cry,

281
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,580
nothing unusual.

282
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,540
Tang Yu,

283
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,400
is what you said true?

284
00:19:51,770 --> 00:19:52,800
Of course, it's true.

285
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,890
The hawk cried so loudly
that I heard it too,

286
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,200
so I let him check.

287
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,770
Is there a problem?

288
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:04,730
Mr. Shi,

289
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:06,700
Tang Yu has been working tirelessly

290
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:08,700
for us all this way,
without any complaints.

291
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,560
Why are you pressing him here?
What are your intentions?

292
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,890
I didn't mean anything by it.

293
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,800
I was just passing by
and noticed Tang Yu was missing,

294
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,340
so I asked a few questions.

295
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,980
It concerns the Queen's stone statue.

296
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,920
Being extra cautious is necessary.

297
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,280
You can be cautious,

298
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,320
but you shouldn't be so cautious
as to doubt my people.

299
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,990
If you want to doubt someone,
doubt your own people.

300
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:26,800
- My people are trustworthy.
- So are mine.

301
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,010
Good then.

302
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:50,160
- I'm furious.
- A'nu.

303
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,370
Why are you here?

304
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,040
I couldn't sleep,
so I came to ask you a question.

305
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,090
Come here.

306
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,940
A'nu,

307
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,320
what question do you want to ask me?

308
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,200
The leaf whistle

309
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,800
you always blew before,

310
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,400
was it because of a girl?

311
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,780
A'nu,

312
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,280
she's no longer important to me.

313
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,160
Who exactly is she?

314
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:41,040
A little girl who once saved my life.

315
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,130
A little girl?

316
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,370
About

317
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:51,800
six or seven years old.

318
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,200
Then you must not think about her.

319
00:22:05,290 --> 00:22:06,410
I am your young master.

320
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,400
You belong to me.

321
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,700
From now on,

322
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,160
you must only think about me
in your heart.

323
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,610
Understood?

324
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,340
A'nu,

325
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,490
no matter what happens tomorrow,

326
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,680
you must take care of yourself.

327
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:26,970
Tomorrow?

328
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,100
Aren't we all setting off
together tomorrow

329
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,090
to find the statue?

330
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:33,650
With you by my side,

331
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,800
what could happen to me?

332
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,370
A'nu.

333
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,610
A'nu,

334
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,560
if one day,

335
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:44,130
I...

336
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:44,970
Are you worried about me?

337
00:22:47,530 --> 00:22:48,370
Fine.

338
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,920
Then let me tell you.

339
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,010
Whether it's tomorrow
or every day after,

340
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,730
with you by my side,
I'll be safe and sound.

341
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,340
A'nu,

342
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,300
I'm sorry.

343
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,490
Xiaoyao,

344
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:20,560
why didn't the sleeping drug affect you?

345
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,160
I ate the Five Poison Bead,
which neutralizes all poisons.

346
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:24,800
The sleeping drug has no effect on me.

347
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,920
It stinks.

348
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:46,610
Li Xiaoyao,

349
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:48,300
let's go.

350
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,090
This is a trap.

351
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,200
Still not awake,

352
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:55,420
Miss Lin?

353
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,180
Ling'er.

354
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,700
Ling'er,

355
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,770
we've finally found you.

356
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,090
Yueru,

357
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,180
I'm sorry

358
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,040
for making you worry.

359
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,660
Ling'er,

360
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,680
promise me.

361
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:18,740
No matter what happens,

362
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,850
never leave us again.

363
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,160
Everything can be solved.

364
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,940
Yueru,

365
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,620
so much has happened

366
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,440
in a moment,

367
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:29,680
pushing me forward.

368
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,160
Sometimes,

369
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,130
I don't even know what to do.

370
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:36,610
I'm sorry.

371
00:24:38,290 --> 00:24:39,370
What are you saying?

372
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,170
No matter what misunderstandings

373
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:43,410
you and Li Xiaoyao encounter,

374
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:45,040
we can investigate
and solve them together.

375
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:51,440
It is we who will investigate
and solve them.

376
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:53,920
While you, an experienced wanderer,
were knocked out,

377
00:24:54,530 --> 00:24:55,770
Ling'er and I have agreed

378
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:58,010
that from now on,
we won't be separated again.

379
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:10,370
Everyone,

380
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:12,290
the entrance down here

381
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,440
leads to the underground city
towards the Witch Queen's Temple.

382
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,700
General Gai,

383
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:16,970
let's set off.

384
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,130
This is the underground city.

385
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,400
The path is not easy to navigate.

386
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,890
Everyone, watch your step.

387
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:52,090
The statue of the Queen
is within this magical zone.

388
00:25:59,050 --> 00:25:59,890
A'nu!

389
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,490
A'nu.

390
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,340
Are you alright?

391
00:26:03,890 --> 00:26:04,730
I'm fine.

392
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,090
Luojiao, why is it like this?

393
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,460
Ten years ago,

394
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,400
the Lady of the South and I
found the Witch Queen's statue

395
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,280
in this underground city.

396
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:18,970
We then built a temple for her.

397
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:22,040
Afterward, Yunmeng Marsh
suddenly dried up,

398
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:24,170
and this magical barrier appeared.

399
00:26:24,170 --> 00:26:25,800
We also tried to pass through,

400
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,730
but touching it

401
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,440
would cause a backlash by its force.

402
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,970
However, it's strange

403
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:36,680
that the candles in this temple
have never gone out.

404
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:38,060
Maybe,

405
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:40,800
it's the Queen manifesting her power,
waiting for the Princess.

406
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:43,850
Your Highness,

407
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,160
if what General Gai said is true,

408
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:50,460
and this magical barrier is set
by the Witch Queen's consciousness,

409
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,820
then with your connection
with your mother,

410
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,400
this magical barrier
should not affect you.

411
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,210
Ling'er.

412
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,320
Xiaoyao,

413
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,400
that's my mother's statue inside.

414
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:12,890
It should be safe.

415
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,180
Your Highness,

416
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,650
be careful on your own.

417
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:07,730
Mother,

418
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,490
how can I revive you?

419
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,890
Can you tell me

420
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:23,850
how I can revive you?

421
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:50,440
Mother,

422
00:31:53,890 --> 00:31:55,490
what exactly should I do?

423
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,010
How can I revive you?

424
00:32:24,370 --> 00:32:25,400
Mother.

425
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,210
Chief, unexpectedly,

426
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,400
after searching for so many years,

427
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:31,560
Gai Luojiao was hiding here.

428
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:34,010
They just left.

429
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,200
The air still carries their scent.

430
00:33:39,410 --> 00:33:40,250
Chief,

431
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,860
all of them have already headed

432
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,890
to the Witch Queen's Temple.

433
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,520
The Witch Queen's temple?

434
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:11,780
Ling'er has been inside for so long.

435
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,000
Why is it so quiet?

436
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,410
Could something have happened to her?

437
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,300
Since the Princess could pass
through the magical barrier,

438
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,960
the previous speculation should be right.

439
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,210
She won't be harmed?

440
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:25,800
Then I'll look around elsewhere.

441
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,100
Let's go.

442
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,450
Ling'er.

443
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,450
Ling'er!

444
00:34:51,850 --> 00:34:53,000
Ling'er.

445
00:34:57,890 --> 00:34:59,170
Ling'er.

446
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,170
Mother.

447
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:03,410
Mother.

448
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:06,240
Mother, where are you, Mother?

449
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,320
Ling'er.

450
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:39,690
Mother.

451
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:01,780
Ling'er,

452
00:36:02,890 --> 00:36:04,280
are you my Ling'er?

453
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,170
You're really my Ling'er?

454
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,960
Ling'er, you've grown so much.

455
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,340
Ling'er,

456
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,650
you must have suffered a lot

457
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,000
in these ten years.

458
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,780
No.

459
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,210
I...

460
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,130
I didn't suffer.

461
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:47,980
Mother, it's okay now.

462
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,240
You've finally been revived.

463
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,090
I'll take you away from here.

464
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:51,930
Ling'er,

465
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:56,040
you are now within my consciousness.

466
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:59,690
My last bit of spiritual power
is about to dissipate.

467
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,000
I'll return to the embrace of Nuwa.

468
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:08,090
Seeing you one last time

469
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,370
leaves me without regrets.

470
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:12,780
No.

471
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,170
That can't be true.

472
00:37:14,570 --> 00:37:15,720
You won't leave me.

473
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,300
You won't.

474
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:18,930
You won't.

475
00:37:27,850 --> 00:37:28,690
Ling'er!

476
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:30,960
There's not much time left.

477
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,650
Listen to me.

478
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,280
Mother, there must be a way.

479
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,090
There must be a way.

480
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,460
There must be a way
to prevent you from leaving me.

481
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,320
Ling'er!

482
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:46,370
Protecting the world's people

483
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:48,720
is the duty of us,

484
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,760
the descendants of Nuwa.

485
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:56,090
As for the suffering
of the common people,

486
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:59,690
you must do your utmost to help them.

487
00:38:02,370 --> 00:38:03,210
Mother,

488
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,100
I...

489
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:09,210
Can I really do it?

490
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:19,580
Ling'er,

491
00:38:23,330 --> 00:38:24,370
I know

492
00:38:26,810 --> 00:38:28,760
this is a path filled with thorns

493
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,560
and sufferings without returns.

494
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,650
I wish you could escape it.

495
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,410
But we, the descendants of Nuwa,

496
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,800
must face it.

497
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,140
Mother,

498
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:54,560
I'll try my best.

499
00:38:57,370 --> 00:38:58,560
I beg you.

500
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:02,800
Please don't leave me.

501
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,780
Ling'er...

502
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,820
No.

503
00:39:14,220 --> 00:39:15,060
Don't.

504
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:16,480
Don't!

505
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,690
Ling'er, don't be afraid.

506
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,800
I will protect you from the heaven.

507
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,560
No!

508
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,490
Mother?

509
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,860
Mother.

510
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,210
Mother!

511
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:15,730
Mother!

512
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,450
Ling'er, what happened?

513
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:09,240
Xiaoyao,

514
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,240
I couldn't revive my mother.

515
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,320
She's gone forever.

516
00:41:21,170 --> 00:41:22,010
Ling'er,

517
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:23,100
don't worry.

518
00:41:23,370 --> 00:41:24,240
You still have me.

519
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:25,690
You still have me.

520
00:41:27,370 --> 00:41:28,210
Your Highness,

521
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,090
you just said the Witch Queen has left?

522
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:40,090
My mother couldn't be revived at all.

523
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:42,610
Inside the statue,

524
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:46,130
only her consciousness remained,

525
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:49,560
but upon seeing me,

526
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,800
it also dissipated.

527
00:41:59,090 --> 00:41:59,930
Could it be

528
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,370
the rumors we heard were false?

529
00:42:09,740 --> 00:42:10,580
Everyone,

530
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:12,210
now that the magical zone has dissipated,

531
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:13,540
we must find a way

532
00:42:13,540 --> 00:42:14,700
to transfer or hide

533
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,610
the Queen's statue now.

534
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:16,900
That's right.

535
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,410
The timing

536
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:22,240
is just right.

537
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,900
