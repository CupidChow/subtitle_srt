=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,660
(Lin Fortress)

4
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,700
Please, go ahead.

5
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,780
(Lin Fortress)

6
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:22,540
Mr. Li,

7
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:25,900
if I'm not mistaken,

8
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:29,490
you just used
the Shushan Swordsmanship.

9
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,130
That means you must be a disciple
of Mr. Dugu, Saint of Sword.

10
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,140
Interestingly,

11
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,110
he and I

12
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,700
decided to be brothers
more than a decade ago.

13
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,620
By that logic,

14
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,060
you should be my nephew.

15
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:48,930
I have never heard of him,

16
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,010
nor do I know who he is.

17
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,340
Where did you learn your swordsmanship?

18
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,270
From a drunk Taoist
who knows only to drink.

19
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,780
Mr. Lin, any more questions?

20
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,350
Please hurry up.
We'll be leaving once you're done.

21
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,730
That must be Mr. Dugu's junior,

22
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,420
the Drunken Sword Immortal.

23
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,180
Since you have learned
the Shushan Swordsmanship,

24
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,130
we're practically family.

25
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:17,590
In the future,

26
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:20,700
if you also learn the Lin Swordsmanship
and our finger techniques,

27
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,900
you could become an unmatched expert.

28
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:26,750
Mr. Lin,

29
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,860
no need for kinship formalities.

30
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,130
Let's speak plainly.

31
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:30,900
Alright.

32
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,100
My family has been having
only one child for three generations,

33
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,340
and Yueru is my only daughter.

34
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,770
I hope

35
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,730
you would consider
joining the Lin family.

36
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,650
I told you it was a misunderstanding.

37
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:45,900
Your daughter was the one
challenging me to a duel.

38
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,060
This seems like a set-up.

39
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,800
The Lin family

40
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,730
is a renowned household
in the Jiangnan region.

41
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,260
Though not rich enough to rival a country,

42
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,210
we are considered local magnates.

43
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,370
My daughter

44
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,460
may not be gorgeous,

45
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:11,130
but she certainly is lovely.

46
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:15,210
Many wealthy young men
wish to marry her but can't.

47
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,930
Why would you refuse this marriage?

48
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:22,820
Can't you see it's a misunderstanding?

49
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,140
Does it have anything to do

50
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,610
with this young lady?

51
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:43,830
I plan to take Ling'er

52
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,670
to Nanzhao.

53
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,540
Do you two

54
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,300
have a marriage arrangement?

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,210
Have her parents consented?

56
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,670
Not yet.

57
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,270
But...

58
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,890
As they say, marriages are decided

59
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:05,610
by parents and matchmakers.

60
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,500
Without their arrangement
or betrothal presents,

61
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,330
this means

62
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,420
you and this young lady

63
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,370
have no ties.

64
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,050
Why haven't you left yet?

65
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,820
I don't want to see you.

66
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,420
This is pretty too.

67
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:44,980
Hard to choose.

68
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:46,390
My Lady,

69
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,170
please don't waste time
on meaningless matters.

70
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,740
Don't think buying this

71
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:57,300
will make me forgive you.

72
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:00,900
Then I'll return it.

73
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:14,870
Once I return to the Witch Moon Sect,

74
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:16,300
I'll still kick you out.

75
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,450
By then, I'll leave on my own.

76
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,140
I can marry her.

77
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:33,490
But I have conditions.

78
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,230
Name it.

79
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,140
First,

80
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:39,500
I'm an orphan.

81
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,670
I have no house, no money, no savings.

82
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:42,780
I can't afford betrothal presents,

83
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,060
though I doubt that you need them.

84
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,900
Second,

85
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,390
since I'm marrying into your family,

86
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:48,890
you should give me betrothal presents.

87
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,890
The Lin Fortress seems fine to me.

88
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,170
Xiaoyao...

89
00:07:03,670 --> 00:07:04,540
Is that all?

90
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,620
There's more.

91
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,860
Third,

92
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,880
your daughter is too willful and unruly.

93
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,150
To compensate for the mental anguish

94
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:13,500
of living with her,

95
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,460
it's only right

96
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,780
if I take four to nine concubines, right?

97
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,500
If not, then it's impossible.

98
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,900
After all, this is my first marriage.

99
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,420
I can't lower my standards.

100
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,020
As you wish.

101
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:55,000
Mr. Lin, please reconsider.

102
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,140
These terms seem too harsh.

103
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,700
A gentleman's word is his bond.

104
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,210
I, Lin Tiannan, never jest.

105
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:06,110
Jinyuan,

106
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,700
what do you think?

107
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,020
I...

108
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,210
Uncle.

109
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,930
Mr. Li.

110
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:31,330
Since the duel has been settled,

111
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,980
though Mr. Li may look ordinary,

112
00:08:35,230 --> 00:08:37,810
his intelligence and martial skills
are exceptional.

113
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,830
Joining the Lin Fortress and becoming the heir
to the Martial Leader of the South

114
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,740
couldn't be more fitting.

115
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,580
Mr. Liu, you...

116
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:44,900
Mr. Li,

117
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:47,500
as close friends,

118
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,010
I wouldn't deceive you.

119
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:51,330
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

120
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,100
Scholar, what do you mean?

121
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,380
It's decided then.

122
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:01,060
Having Mr. Li as a husband

123
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,180
is indeed my daughter's fortune.

124
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,690
Good. Mr. Li, please sit.

125
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,420
Mr. Lin,

126
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:14,690
marriages are about
formalities and rituals.

127
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,810
I came in a hurry
without preparing anything.

128
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,250
Joining the Lin family like this

129
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,060
seems rather hasty.

130
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,500
Mr. Li,

131
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,740
didn't you just say
you had no betrothal presents?

132
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,650
I was joking.

133
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,710
We still need to prepare.

134
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,860
Alright, what do you need?

135
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:35,500
We have everything here.

136
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,500
That won't do.

137
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,420
Even if I'm marrying in your family,

138
00:09:39,740 --> 00:09:41,450
a dowry is still needed, right?

139
00:09:41,620 --> 00:09:42,460
Otherwise,

140
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,180
- it's bad luck.
- Bad luck.

141
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:48,180
I'd rather buy some things I like myself.

142
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,620
Then remember,

143
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,420
make the travel quick.

144
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,650
I'll be here,

145
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,500
waiting for you to dine.

146
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:55,670
Alright.

147
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,500
Come, take a look.
Fragrance pouches, fragrance bags.

148
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,740
Fragrance pouches, fragrance bags!

149
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,830
Buns! Steaming hot buns!

150
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:12,940
Xiaoyao,

151
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,060
you...

152
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,180
Everyone, take a look!
Oil-paper umbrellas!

153
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,130
I mean

154
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,570
I could go to Nanzhao on my own.

155
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,450
You don't have to accompany me.

156
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,010
It's no trouble.

157
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,690
How can this be?

158
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,060
We agreed I'd take you to Nanzhao.

159
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:38,990
Ling'er,

160
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,300
you don't really think
I'd marry that shrew, do you?

161
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:46,500
Aren't we out buying your dowry?

162
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,650
Silly girl.

163
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:50,860
Why would a man like me buy a dowry?

164
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:54,390
Mr. Liu secretly told me just now

165
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,470
that Mr. Lin is currently preoccupied
with important matters.

166
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,150
Moreover, he's a formidable martial artist,

167
00:10:58,150 --> 00:10:59,590
so I had to resort to this trick,

168
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,210
slipping away unnoticed.

169
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:02,500
Really?

170
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,940
Am I crazy? I'd marry her? She wishes.

171
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:10,380
Ling'er,

172
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,100
I will absolutely not leave you.

173
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,180
I will not let you be alone.

174
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,980
Good thing they didn't follow us.

175
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,060
Mr. Li!

176
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,570
Mr. Li!

177
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,060
Mr. Lin,

178
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,890
why are you here suddenly?

179
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:47,100
Aren't you going to buy a dowry?

180
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,060
I was worried
you didn't have enough money,

181
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,690
so I came to bring you some.

182
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,230
This could have been done by a servant.

183
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,100
Why trouble yourself?

184
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,890
The disciples of the Lin Fortress

185
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,420
- have more important matters to attend to.
- Come take a look!

186
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,450
I had to come myself.

187
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,690
Watch carefully.

188
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,660
Yes, Mr. Lin.

189
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,500
Mr. Lin,

190
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,580
this is...

191
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,130
Suzhou City is plagued by snakes.

192
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:30,330
I must fulfill my responsibility
to protect the people.

193
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,140
Mr. Li,

194
00:12:38,390 --> 00:12:40,740
why are you at the city gate?

195
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,590
I came to get money
for the dowry from you.

196
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,860
I forgot money just now, right?

197
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,500
I see.

198
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:53,330
Then, I'll take my leave first.

199
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:05,010
Xiaoyao, what do we do?

200
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,860
Since Mr. Lin is so generous,

201
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,980
let's have fun in Suzhou City then.

202
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,100
I'll just refuse him.
I don't believe he can force me

203
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,100
to marry that barbaric girl.

204
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,020
Let's go.

205
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,460
(Lin Fortress)

206
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:27,190
Cousin,

207
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:30,690
are you seeking a duel to the death?

208
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:31,900
Of course.

209
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,180
That rat

210
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,690
made me a laughingstock
in front of everyone in Suzhou City.

211
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,940
Today, it's either him or me.

212
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,100
Luckily, Li fled the marriage.

213
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,810
Otherwise, it'd be another huge fight.

214
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,230
What?

215
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,340
Fled the marriage?

216
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:47,660
Thankfully, Mr. Li escaped quickly,

217
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:49,250
solving this urgent problem.

218
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:53,030
That rat dared to flee!

219
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,210
I'll break his legs!

220
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:57,210
Cousin, didn't you not want to marry him?

221
00:13:58,030 --> 00:13:59,330
Of course, I don't want to marry him,

222
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,770
but his actions
have disgraced me once again.

223
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,420
No, I must seek revenge.

224
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,870
Cousin!

225
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:16,860
A girl's hands as tender as kindling
will surely bring wealth.

226
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:19,500
(Fortune Telling Through Palmistry)
You two will definitely make a fortune.

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,340
You two.

228
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,650
- Quite amusing.
- You two.

229
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:28,690
- Let's go.
- Stop right there.

230
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:30,810
Are you calling us?

231
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:34,500
Young master, young lady, please wait.

232
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,740
I'm the Iron-Mouthed Fortune Teller.

233
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,300
If I'm not right,
you'll get your money back.

234
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,380
You two,

235
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:39,780
would you like a fortune told?

236
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,790
If you're not right,
we'll get our money back?

237
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,500
Alright.

238
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:45,450
Tell me about my recent luck.

239
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,010
Young master,

240
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:51,210
your aura is glowing red,
and you have a peach blossom aura.

241
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:53,180
You're on a streak of romantic luck.

242
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,300
Then tell me about my romantic luck.

243
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:56,550
Young master,

244
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:58,450
women are like water,

245
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:01,300
which can carry a boat or overturn it.

246
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:03,300
You must be cautious.

247
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,770
Remember, remember.

248
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,540
Water can carry or overturn a boat?

249
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,330
Young lady,

250
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,540
I see your aura shining brightly,

251
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,060
with an overwhelming spiritual presence,

252
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,390
rare in this world.

253
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,100
You'll be an empress in court

254
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,010
or a heroine outside the court.

255
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,540
However,

256
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,890
the aura around your brows

257
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:31,740
hints at impending trouble.

258
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:33,210
Trouble?

259
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,300
Nothing but nonsense. Ling'er, let's go.

260
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,180
Just ten taels,

261
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
and I can solve all your problems.

262
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,270
I knew you were a scam.

263
00:15:46,270 --> 00:15:47,110
Look.

264
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:51,570
If not ten, five taels will do.

265
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,500
Young master,

266
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:59,060
since your wife is so beautiful,

267
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,380
buy her some jewelry.

268
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:02,380
Ling'er, see anything you like?

269
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:08,500
Look at this hairpin, it's selling well.

270
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,340
Look.

271
00:16:17,030 --> 00:16:18,470
Ling'er, this silver hairpin

272
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:19,690
suits you, let me...

273
00:16:20,590 --> 00:16:21,890
Miss Lin.

274
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:23,130
I'll take it.

275
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,060
I misjudged that fortune teller.

276
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,900
There really was trouble.

277
00:16:33,030 --> 00:16:34,390
You rat!

278
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,540
Dare to fight me again?

279
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,770
I'll show you my strength.

280
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,980
You're always looking for a fight.

281
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,210
Don't you have anything else to do?

282
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,030
Kidnapping a young girl
in broad daylight,

283
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:48,450
you're utterly despicable.

284
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,980
Miss Lin, listen to me.

285
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,940
- Xiaoyao and I...
- Stop, stop, stop.

286
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,020
Miss,

287
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,030
this has nothing to do with you.

288
00:16:56,030 --> 00:16:57,540
It's a personal vendetta
between him and me.

289
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,500
You should stay away
to avoid getting hurt.

290
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,340
You barbaric girl.

291
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,910
It's not your place to interfere
in our matters.

292
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,130
How is it not my place?

293
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,110
You're about to join the Lin Fortress.

294
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,170
I obviously have a say.

295
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,930
If your father hadn't guarded the city gate,
I'd have run away already.

296
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,810
Just fight me,

297
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,200
or you can forget about running away.

298
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,660
What are you doing?

299
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,170
Miss Lin, by stopping me like this,

300
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,210
are you so eager to marry me?

301
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,100
Well, let me tell you now.

302
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:36,980
I already have someone I like,

303
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,380
and I have no plans to take concubines.

304
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,300
You shameless rat!

305
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,660
How dare you humiliate me in public!

306
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,820
It was you who came to me insisting
on stopping me from running away.

307
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:50,490
If you don't want to marry me,
what else could it be?

308
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,530
- I...
- Ling'er, let's go.

309
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,260
You're not allowed to leave!

310
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:01,180
We should try to avoid conflicts
with Miss Lin in the future.

311
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,780
Explaining clearly will solve everything.

312
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,990
Haven't I explained clearly enough?

313
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,260
It's always her picking fights with me.

314
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,380
Then we'll just leave quickly.

315
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:11,860
Why are you following us?

316
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,470
Who's following you?

317
00:18:13,470 --> 00:18:14,660
Is this road owned by your family?

318
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,710
Mind your own business
if I want to walk here.

319
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:17,550
Fine, follow if you want.

320
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,830
- Let's go.
- He's here with another woman

321
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,900
in front of the top shrew
with the worst temper in Suzhou City.

322
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,590
Would you two like something to eat?

323
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:26,460
A pot of good tea

324
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:28,140
and some of Suzhou's
most famous pastries.

325
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,100
Alright. Please wait.

326
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:33,570
Xiaoyao,

327
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,740
Miss Lin just wants a way
to maintain her dignity.

328
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:39,570
Why not offer her a chance
to step down gracefully?

329
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,930
Let me think about it.

330
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:47,570
Miss Lin is here.

331
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:53,100
Miss Lin, this table is already taken.

332
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,810
How about I find you a more private spot?

333
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,210
I want to sit here.

334
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:57,660
Yes, yes.

335
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,780
Miss Lin, don't be angry.

336
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:09,690
Xiaoyao didn't mean
to target you specifically.

337
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:11,980
If there was any offense,

338
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:13,230
I apologize on his behalf.

339
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:14,930
- Ling'er, you...
- Stop, stop, stop.

340
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,530
Miss,

341
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,350
as I said before,

342
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,950
this matter doesn't concern you.

343
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,260
You don't need to apologize for him.

344
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,570
However, I must warn you.

345
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,180
You're better off staying away from him.

346
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:30,330
- But Miss Lin...
- Ling'er, ignore her.

347
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,300
This isn't her family's restaurant.

348
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,140
We'll just eat our meal.

349
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,380
Sorry.

350
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,140
This restaurant is indeed
owned by the Lin Fortress.

351
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:52,180
This is also one
of the Lin family's properties?

352
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,020
Of course.

353
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,780
Doesn't that make it mine as well?

354
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,660
What are you daydreaming about?

355
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,950
How could it possibly be yours?

356
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:03,790
Think about it.

357
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:05,870
Everyone in Suzhou City knows
that I, Li Xiaoyao,

358
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:07,230
am the son-in-law of your father.

359
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,740
Yours is mine, isn't it?

360
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:13,980
Li, how can you be so shameless?

361
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm just stating the facts.

362
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,710
After all, it was your family
who forced the marriage first.

363
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:21,020
I was merely forced to accept

364
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:23,050
your family's properties and...

365
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,050
you.

366
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,290
Are you asking for a beating again?

367
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,260
To fight a tomboy,

368
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,450
I'm not interested.

369
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,740
What?

370
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:35,690
Xiaoyao...

371
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,410
You scoundrel! Dare to call me a tomboy?

372
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,540
Look at yourself. What kind of lady

373
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:42,830
wears armor, steps on a stool,

374
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:43,900
and grabs a man's clothes?

375
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:50,100
Yeah. Who would dare
to provoke Miss Lin?

376
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,380
Exactly.

377
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
Let go already.

378
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,750
You might not care about your reputation,
but Mr. Lin does.

379
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:57,660
Everyone's watching.

380
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,500
What are you all looking at?

381
00:21:03,190 --> 00:21:04,060
You just wait.

382
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,410
- The money is left here.
- Alright, alright.

383
00:21:06,230 --> 00:21:07,070
Let's go.

384
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,050
Finally left.

385
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,260
Make way!

386
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:15,950
Let's go.

387
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:21,100
Ling'er, let's go eat somewhere else.

388
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:25,210
Sir, your noodles.

389
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,780
Thank you, sir. Enjoy your meal.

390
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,900
It smells so good, Ling'er, eat up.

391
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,900
Ling'er, why aren't you eating?

392
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:46,790
I...

393
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,100
Ling'er, what's wrong?

394
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,380
You look a bit pale.

395
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,950
I...

396
00:21:56,350 --> 00:21:57,330
I'm fine.

397
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:02,210
Seems a bit feverish.

398
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:05,210
Let's go, I'll take you to see a physician.

399
00:22:05,710 --> 00:22:06,620
Xiaoyao,

400
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:09,140
no need. I'm really fine.

401
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,020
Maybe I'm just a bit tired.

402
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,100
Then let's find an inn to rest first.

403
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:17,710
Let's go.

404
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:19,980
Young master,

405
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,090
Mr. Lin has prepared everything

406
00:22:21,230 --> 00:22:22,690
and asked us to invite you both back.

407
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,530
This father and daughter
really are persistent.

408
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,660
(Ding Tailor Shop)

409
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,590
Cousin.

410
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:41,660
Cousin, you're finally back.

411
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,900
It seems Mr. Li has successfully escaped.

412
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:46,530
Congratulations.

413
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,780
You're still here congratulating me.

414
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,020
It's all your fault,

415
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,380
daring to conspire
with outsiders against me.

416
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:56,750
And you dared to participate
in the combat for marriage.

417
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,630
What were you thinking?

418
00:22:57,630 --> 00:22:58,810
Cousin, forgive me, forgive me.

419
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:01,180
I only wished you...

420
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,020
Enough.

421
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,170
Now, I'll give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

422
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,570
But it depends on your performance.

423
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,950
If you don't do well,

424
00:23:07,950 --> 00:23:09,140
you'll no longer be my cousin.

425
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:09,980
Please tell me.

426
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:11,800
I'm willing to go
through all the trouble for you,

427
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:14,240
even if it means climbing a mountain of swords
or diving into a sea of flames.

428
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:14,780
Stop, stop, stop.

429
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,140
Enough with your bluster.

430
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:19,540
With your frail physique,

431
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,010
you think you can
climb a mountain of swords?

432
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:23,500
Just come up with some strategies for me.

433
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,780
Alright.

434
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,570
What troubles you, Cousin?

435
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,100
That rat Li Xiaoyao,

436
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:33,110
in front of all the citizens of Suzhou,

437
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:34,660
humiliated me
during the combat for marriage.

438
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,530
It's infuriating.

439
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,660
So, you want to regain your honor?

440
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,140
Right, it must be regained.

441
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,060
Instead of letting Mr. Li
escape the marriage,

442
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,570
we should take the initiative

443
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,780
and break off the engagement.

444
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:45,710
Break off the engagement?

445
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:48,210
Cousin, think about it.
If Mr. Li receives your divorce letter,

446
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,410
it would be a great humiliation for him.

447
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:07,860
Slow down.

448
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:14,470
Here.

449
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,100
Ling'er, are you alright?

450
00:24:22,350 --> 00:24:23,290
Xiaoyao,

451
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,410
don't worry. I'm fine.

452
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:31,430
You're really fine?

453
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,570
Xiaoyao,

454
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,020
these past few days,

455
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,860
I have been feeling

456
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,550
afraid.

457
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,170
Afraid of what?

458
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:51,530
Xiaoyao,

459
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:53,310
are you

460
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:55,170
afraid of snake demons?

461
00:24:56,710 --> 00:24:57,740
Snake demons?

462
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,690
Ling'er, why would you suddenly ask that?

463
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:03,900
I aim to be a hero,

464
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:05,690
and heroes are meant to vanquish demons.

465
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:06,860
Why would I be afraid?

466
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:10,410
But what if

467
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,690
I were a snake demon?

468
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,260
Ling'er, what are you talking about?

469
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:18,290
You're so gentle, lovely, and beautiful.

470
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,660
How could you be a snake demon?

471
00:25:20,510 --> 00:25:22,330
Ling'er, you must be really tired.

472
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,660
Rest early,

473
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,780
and stop worrying
about nonsensical things.

474
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:31,690
Mr. Li, Miss Lin invites you
to the back garden for a chat.

475
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:34,900
I'm not going.

476
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,740
She's definitely up to no good
looking for me.

477
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:43,620
Xiaoyao, do you remember what I said?

478
00:25:43,870 --> 00:25:45,780
Better to resolve enmity
than to let it fester.

479
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,570
Maybe if you meet Miss Lin,

480
00:25:48,900 --> 00:25:50,780
you could turn hostility into friendship.

481
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,660
Perhaps

482
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:53,450
we could leave Suzhou City sooner.

483
00:25:58,990 --> 00:25:59,830
Alright.

484
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,740
I'll listen to you.

485
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,020
Then I'll go see Miss Lin.

486
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,170
Mr. Li, Miss Lin is waiting for you
in the pavilion.

487
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:13,790
Li Xiaoyao,

488
00:27:14,510 --> 00:27:18,660
do you think I look good in this outfit?

489
00:27:23,590 --> 00:27:26,210
It's rare for me to wear it.

490
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,070
You...

491
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:34,660
Under the moonlight,

492
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,050
do I seem especially beautiful?

493
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:39,620
Are you traumatized?

494
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,190
Li Xiaoyao.

495
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,590
What do you want?

496
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,020
Speak frankly.

497
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,210
I know

498
00:28:00,110 --> 00:28:01,100
you have been

499
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,140
stunned by the top beauty

500
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,410
in Suzhou City.

501
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,450
More like a big shock.

502
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,380
Stop saying against your heart.

503
00:28:19,750 --> 00:28:20,860
Your eyes

504
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:22,930
have already told me

505
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,260
you have fallen in love with me.

506
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,220
Li...

507
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,210
My eyes tell you
that you seem to have gone mad.

508
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,260
Although the combat for marriage

509
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,980
has been held five times,

510
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:00,620
no one has ever defeated me.

511
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,290
The reason isn't

512
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,930
that my martial skills are superior,

513
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,530
but because

514
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:09,900
I have never met

515
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,620
the man of my dreams.

516
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,860
But you're different.

517
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,660
What do you mean?

518
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,100
These past few days,

519
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,140
I have been chasing you

520
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,810
not because I want to bully you,

521
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:33,710
but because

522
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,330
I suddenly realized

523
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:41,140
I might

524
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,380
like you.

525
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:56,990
Miss Lin,

526
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,060
your lying skills

527
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:59,810
need more practice.

528
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:04,230
Are you trying to make me fall for you

529
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,100
just to dump me later?

530
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,900
Well, it's indeed a strategy.

531
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,570
But there's a fatal flaw.

532
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,690
What flaw?

533
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,260
I

534
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:20,780
have someone else in my heart.

535
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,140
She

536
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,450
is gentle and kind.

537
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,830
Such qualities are innate,

538
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:27,020
and pretense can only lead

539
00:30:27,350 --> 00:30:29,050
to failure.

540
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:31,570
Li Xiaoyao, you jerk!

541
00:30:36,780 --> 00:30:38,660
Miss Lin, this is more like you.

542
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:40,260
But why such a grand gesture?

543
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,220
Alright, alright.

544
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,140
I'll be the bigger person

545
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,570
and forgive your previous actions.

546
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,450
Don't cry, okay?

547
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:11,170
Ling'er, why are you here?

548
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,670
Miss Lin,

549
00:31:14,750 --> 00:31:16,530
did Xiaoyao bully you?

550
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:17,950
I didn't bully her.

551
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,330
She just fell accidentally by herself.

552
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
Miss Lin,

553
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:27,830
if Xiaoyao did bully you,

554
00:31:27,830 --> 00:31:29,100
I'll make him apologize.

555
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,660
I don't need anyone's pity.

556
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:34,570
I really didn't do anything.

557
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,570
Alright, alright, stop crying.

558
00:31:42,140 --> 00:31:42,980
Well...

559
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,140
It's my fault.

560
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:46,220
I spoke out of turn.

561
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,210
You're the bigger person
and will forgive me, okay?

562
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,780
I don't care for your apology.

563
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:52,570
Miss Lin,

564
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:55,300
sometimes Xiaoyao's words

565
00:31:55,300 --> 00:31:57,110
can be quite harsh,

566
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,410
but he means no harm.

567
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,290
Please don't take it to heart.

568
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,870
Ling'er, why are you siding with her now?

569
00:32:03,870 --> 00:32:04,860
Xiaoyao...

570
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,430
Miss Zhao,

571
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,980
you're so kind

572
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:13,020
and good-looking.

573
00:32:13,750 --> 00:32:15,570
How can you be with this rat?

574
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,050
He's not worthy of you.

575
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,140
You're just looking for trouble.

576
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:22,780
Why do you two start arguing
every time you meet?

577
00:32:23,630 --> 00:32:24,690
My grandma always said

578
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,000
meeting in this life

579
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:28,790
means we have cultivated ties
over several lifetimes.

580
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,260
Moreover, we have such deep connections.

581
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:35,780
I have known her for several lifetimes?
Please, spare me.

582
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,510
Knowing you is three lifetimes' misfortune.

583
00:32:37,510 --> 00:32:39,210
- You...
- Alright, alright.

584
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,170
Since we're fated to meet,

585
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,530
let's be good friends.

586
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:49,790
Miss Lin,

587
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:52,860
I have never really had any friends
from childhood till now.

588
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:56,530
Xiaoyao

589
00:32:58,060 --> 00:32:58,980
is one,

590
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:00,690
and I hope

591
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,050
you can be another.

592
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,630
Ling'er, you're such a good person.

593
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,110
I'd also like to be friends with you.

594
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,290
From now on, just call me Yueru.

595
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,380
Let's go. I'll take you somewhere fun.

596
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,530
- You'll definitely like it.
- Okay.

597
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:22,790
Cousin.

598
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,100
Cousin, come with us.

599
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:30,500
I need to change out of these clothes.
They're so uncomfortable.

600
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:39,990
The little show
that barbaric girl put on just now

601
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:40,930
was taught by you, right?

602
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,950
Mr. Liu,

603
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:46,140
you may look refined,

604
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:47,750
but you're full of sly ideas.

605
00:33:47,750 --> 00:33:48,620
Not at all, not at all.

606
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:50,900
She misunderstood my intentions.

607
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:54,020
Indeed, the idea was cunning,

608
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,660
but she used it on the wrong person.

609
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,190
Such a pity.

610
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:04,140
Miss Zhao, Mr. Li,

611
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:07,740
this is the largest tavern with music
in Suzhou City.

612
00:34:08,270 --> 00:34:10,220
You boys enjoy yourselves.
Let's go, Ling'er.

613
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,220
Okay.

614
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,620
- Good.
- Impressive.

615
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,510
How about it? This place isn't bad, right?

616
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:18,510
If you like it, I'll bring you here often.

617
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,750
Since we're fated to meet,

618
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,100
here's a toast to you.

619
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:26,180
You have never drunk alcohol?

620
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,490
Everyone in the world always says
women shouldn't drink,

621
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:34,290
but who decided that
alcohol is only for men?

622
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:36,420
If they say we can't drink,
we'll drink just to spite them.

623
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,660
To you, I'll drink first.

624
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,620
Take it slow.

625
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:48,820
That's more like it.

626
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:51,050
Tonight, we won't return
until we're drunk.

627
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,350
Here.

628
00:34:58,230 --> 00:34:59,070
Mr. Li, Mr. Li!

629
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,810
Good.

630
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,140
Have you played this before?

631
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,980
No.

632
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:05,140
This is called chess flipping.
It's very popular in Suzhou City now.

633
00:35:05,750 --> 00:35:08,700
Look, if your piece
hits the opponent's piece

634
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:10,460
after passing through the gate, you win.

635
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,420
You're not good at this.

636
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,860
Stop blaming the equipment.

637
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,900
Any more challengers?

638
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:17,530
Here, here!

639
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:19,660
- Me!
- Go ahead, it's on me if you lose.

640
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,500
It's on me if you lose.

641
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:21,580
Come on, come on, set up the pieces.

642
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,420
Let's go.

643
00:35:25,550 --> 00:35:26,390
What's wrong?

644
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:27,730
Why are you looking at me?

645
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:30,460
The Yueru in front of me

646
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:32,010
doesn't seem fierce at all.

647
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:35,940
But that girl outside the city

648
00:35:36,710 --> 00:35:38,940
did scare people a bit.

649
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,810
I was just mad that day.

650
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,660
I only wanted to scare her a bit.

651
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,810
Why scare her?

652
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,050
It's because of that jerk Changgui.

653
00:35:49,470 --> 00:35:51,100
He was already married
and had children,

654
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:53,100
yet he deceived Yinhua
into eloping with him.

655
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:54,530
It's also our fault

656
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:56,490
for acting without asking clearly.

657
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,970
No fight, no acquaintance, right?
Come on.

658
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:06,950
Mr. Li, not bad, Mr. Li!

659
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,310
Good, good, good, let's play again.

660
00:36:08,310 --> 00:36:09,660
Did Xiaoyao win?

661
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,490
Oh, it can be played this way.

662
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,550
I just wanted
to show those Central Plains folks

663
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:51,250
what real chess flipping is.

664
00:36:57,790 --> 00:36:58,630
Let's go.

665
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,350
You're going too?

666
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,900
Great, let's go together.

667
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,590
To find the Spiritual Beads.

668
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:09,940
Can't you just say everything at once?

669
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,150
I did.

670
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:12,220
Let's go.

671
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,250
I haven't eaten enough yet.

672
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,180
My Lady,

673
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:21,140
please don't force me to take action.

674
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,940
Well done.

675
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:28,940
Who's making all that noise,
bothering my ears?

676
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,510
If you don't like the noise, don't come here.
What are you shouting about?

677
00:37:32,510 --> 00:37:33,730
Who are you?

678
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,940
I...

679
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,010
Yueru, let's continue drinking.

680
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,660
I don't want to deal with you.

681
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,050
If you're capable,
come out and let's argue face to face.

682
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,940
Have you heard?

683
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,310
The other night, a snake demon

684
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:51,220
went to Li He Village
on the western side of Suzhou City.

685
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,420
Not only did it steal a lot of wealth,

686
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:56,290
but it also took away the granddaughter

687
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,550
of Zhang, who sells pears.

688
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,860
Poor Zhang, already in his seventies,

689
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,570
probably won't survive this.

690
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:02,510
Last month,

691
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,900
Mr. Lin took a dozen strong men
to exorcise the demon,

692
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,700
but they didn't even see its shadow

693
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,700
and lost seven or eight lives.

694
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,050
How can humans beat demons?

695
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:12,180
This time, I reckon

696
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,140
Mr. Lin is powerless too.

697
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,260
Mr. Li,

698
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,700
I have a favor to ask.

699
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,940
Want to get rid of the snake demon, right?

700
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:24,470
But for this, you'll need to lead.

701
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,530
Only then can we
kill three birds with one stone.

702
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:28,250
Kill three birds with one stone?

703
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:31,010
- Follow me.
- Impressive, impressive, impressive.

704
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:40,420
Mr. Li, tell me. What does that mean?

705
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:44,180
First, to relieve the people of Suzhou City
from the snake menace.

706
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,420
Second, to show Mr. Lin

707
00:38:46,430 --> 00:38:48,150
that even though you're not skilled
in martial arts,

708
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,700
your strategies are superior.

709
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,660
- Third...
- Third,

710
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,900
it can solve the urgent issue
of your forced marriage.

711
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,900
What are you guys talking about?

712
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,700
Cousin, why have you drunk so much?

713
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,900
Ling'er, you have been drinking too?

714
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,010
- Not much.
- It's okay.

715
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:06,570
Take it easy, easy.

716
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:08,710
Be careful.

717
00:39:08,710 --> 00:39:10,690
Don't drink with such people.
You might pick up bad habits.

718
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:13,250
Women drinking

719
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,940
shouldn't concern men.

720
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,330
Look, have some snacks.

721
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:18,940
Ling'er,

722
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:20,900
you're so gentle and pretty.

723
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,820
Why are you with this rat every day?

724
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:24,750
Who are you calling a rat?

725
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:25,590
You!

726
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,620
- You're the barbarian!
- You're the barbarian!

727
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:30,860
Because Xiaoyao
is taking me back to Nanzhao.

728
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,100
Nanzhao?

729
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,990
Now I'm not just envious of you both.

730
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:39,050
I'm jealous.

731
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:43,970
I also want to travel the world
with a sword in my hands.

732
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:45,830
Li Xiaoyao,

733
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,860
you go back to Yuhang.

734
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:48,250
I'll take Ling'er back to Nanzhao.

735
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:50,700
Why should you?
What right do you have?

736
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:52,290
Because my martial skills
are better than yours.

737
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,100
Yet you always lose to me.

738
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:55,900
Seems like you talk bigger than me.

739
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:59,330
Miss Zhao, why do you
want to go to Nanzhao?

740
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,490
Because I'm from Nanzhao.

741
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,220
I was separated from my mother
since I was young.

742
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,310
Later, I came to the Central Plains
with my grandma and encountered a disaster.

743
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,860
Fortunately, I met Xiaoyao,

744
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:11,460
or I would have
been kidnapped by villains.

745
00:40:16,270 --> 00:40:17,110
Ling'er,

746
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:19,940
I have also been without a mother
since I was young.

747
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:21,620
I have had no sisters.

748
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:23,180
From now on,

749
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,660
you're my sister.

750
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:26,590
Okay.

751
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,990
Ling'er, let's go.
I'll take you somewhere nice.

752
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:30,830
Where to?

753
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,770
You'll know when we get there. Let's go.

754
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,570
We're going with you. Let's go.

755
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,940
Ling'er, look!

756
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:44,810
I, Lin Yueru,

757
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:47,790
aim to be a well-known
formidable heroine in the martial world!

758
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,310
I, Li Xiaoyao,

759
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:51,820
aspire to be a hero admired by everyone!

760
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,420
You? Dream on.

761
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,830
You...

762
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,900
Ling'er, it's your turn.

763
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,740
I...

764
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,250
I hope everyone

765
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:06,220
lives happily and safely!

766
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,940
May there be good weather for the crops,

767
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,900
and peace and prosperity for the country!

768
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:15,100
May my cousin achieve her wish soon.

769
00:41:17,510 --> 00:41:18,350
Go away.

770
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,140
I want to try too. I want to try.

771
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:26,470
I want to travel
through famous mountains and rivers

772
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,940
and taste all the delicacies.

773
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,620
And I want to find
the Spiritual Beads on the way.

774
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:34,810
Your turn, your turn.

775
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,810
I just want to complete my task
as soon as possible.

776
00:41:40,990 --> 00:41:41,940
Boring.

777
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,530
So beautiful.

778
00:41:48,310 --> 00:41:49,150
