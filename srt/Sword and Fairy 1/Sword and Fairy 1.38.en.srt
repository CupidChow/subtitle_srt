=Episode 38=

3
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,320
The Water Spiritual Bead.

4
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,570
You found it.

5
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,410
Little guy,

6
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,960
I really like this bead.

7
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,280
Could you give it to me?

8
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,770
Of course not.

9
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,810
How about this?

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,380
I'll compete with you by playing marbles.

11
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,640
If I win, you give me the bead.

12
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:13,280
Why should I? I don't want to compete.

13
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,820
What exactly do you want, then?

14
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,850
I'll give you anything I can.

15
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:16,690
Let's trade instead.

16
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,530
How about you give me
the sword on your back?

17
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:24,890
This...

18
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,300
If you don't want to, never mind.

19
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:29,740
- Don't go!
- Don't run!

20
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,200
Where have you been,
making me wait so long?

21
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,610
Little guy, little guy,

22
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:41,410
this is a real sword.

23
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,740
It can hurt people. It's dangerous.

24
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,690
I'm not afraid.

25
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,640
What's the point if it's not a real one?

26
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,020
If your aunt knows,

27
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,170
she definitely won't let you keep it.

28
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,280
You don't have to worry about that.

29
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,610
How about this?

30
00:02:57,090 --> 00:02:58,130
I'll make you one just like mine,

31
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,330
a wooden sword.

32
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,380
How about that?

33
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:01,530
Really?

34
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,000
Exactly the same?

35
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:06,640
Can't you see?

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:10,170
This kid has a look similar to you.

37
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:12,690
Do you mean

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:14,210
you'll make any sword I want?

39
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:15,050
Of course.

40
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:17,280
Then I want his sword.

41
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,690
That sword of his

42
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:20,000
looks more formidable.

43
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,050
You really have an eye for quality.

44
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:25,330
I want his sword.

45
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,850
Sir,

46
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,480
can you really make one just like it?

47
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,250
The wooden sword in my childhood

48
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,760
turns out to be the Dustless Sword.

49
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:40,480
What? What did you say?

50
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,890
I mean...

51
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:45,640
Your wooden sword
will be the Dustless Sword.

52
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:47,200
That's so enviable.

53
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,840
Of course.

54
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,380
When I grow up,

55
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,610
I also want to find

56
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,790
one of those ancient divine swords.

57
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,610
That's settled then.

58
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,280
I'll make the wooden sword
in exchange for your bead.

59
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:58,860
Wait.

60
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:00,610
Weren't we supposed to compete?

61
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,270
We needed that before,
but now it's not needed, right?

62
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,120
We must compete.

63
00:04:04,770 --> 00:04:07,810
If I win, you give me the wooden sword.

64
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,480
If I lose,

65
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,720
I'll trade my bead
for your wooden sword.

66
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:13,450
Alright.

67
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,640
You pick the game.
Pick what you're best at.

68
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,760
Then let's play marbles.

69
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:22,250
Marbles?

70
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:24,160
Marbles, well...

71
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,810
The thing I'm worst at
is playing marbles.

72
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:28,890
Can we change the game?

73
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:29,980
No.

74
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,940
It has to be marbles.

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,660
Please, let's play marbles.

76
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,500
Alright, alright.

77
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,160
I'm an adult.
I won't take advantage of you.

78
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,730
We'll play marbles.

79
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,440
People indeed get slier
while getting older.

80
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,290
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

81
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:52,290
Ten marbles each.

82
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,130
Those three are mine,
and the distant ones are yours.

83
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,260
Alright then.

84
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:38,170
You...

85
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:41,920
You're cheating.

86
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:44,050
You can't accuse me of that.

87
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:45,640
- Where did I cheat?
- You deceived me!

88
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:46,980
Little guy,

89
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,210
that's a strategy to confuse the enemy.

90
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,920
Don't trust people too easily
in the future.

91
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,050
Now you have to keep your word.

92
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,530
Give me your bead.

93
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,200
I won't give it to you.

94
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,320
I'm trading it for your wooden sword.

95
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:02,610
Then let's set a time for the exchange.

96
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:04,890
Alright, I'll come
after I eat mooncakes with my aunt.

97
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:05,730
Go then.

98
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,780
Still good at this.

99
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,880
Good wine.

100
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,290
You think that bead is very special.

101
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,690
It's important to many people.

102
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,480
You think that kid is also special.

103
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:46,170
Sir, by the way,

104
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,320
have you ever thought

105
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:49,980
about taking a disciple?

106
00:06:55,050 --> 00:06:56,200
Stop, stop, stop.

107
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,820
I really don't have the time
to take a disciple.

108
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,450
Taking a disciple is so much trouble.

109
00:07:01,450 --> 00:07:02,940
It's laborious.

110
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,730
How free and unrestrained it is
to be alone.

111
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:17,170
Sir,

112
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,690
I performed divination for you.

113
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:20,490
You can perform divination?

114
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:23,480
You will have a chosen one
as your disciple in the future.

115
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,360
A chosen one?

116
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,160
You're kidding me, right?

117
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,530
I'm serious.

118
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,260
This person

119
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,250
has extraordinary talents,

120
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,490
high comprehension,

121
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:35,660
and exceptional spiritual roots.

122
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,040
From what you're saying,

123
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:38,170
in the future,

124
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,610
when I meet a young lad,

125
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,200
I should tell him,

126
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,940
"Kid,

127
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,130
don't move.

128
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,810
You are the chosen one."

129
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,760
The chosen one.

130
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,660
You are chosen by heaven

131
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,200
to end this calamity on earth.

132
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:00,410
Speaking of which,

133
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,320
it really seems to be so.

134
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,690
Are you sick?

135
00:08:08,290 --> 00:08:09,880
About things of this world,

136
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,810
if they don't actually happen,

137
00:08:13,170 --> 00:08:14,760
no one knows what will occur.

138
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,530
Where has this kid gone?

139
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,730
Why hasn't he come yet?

140
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,730
That kid

141
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,730
must have gone looking for mooncakes.

142
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:42,090
When I was a kid,
I wasn't greedy for mooncakes.

143
00:08:46,850 --> 00:08:47,850
Let's go to the inn first

144
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,690
and give him a surprise.

145
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,410
- Let's go.
- I... I'm not going.

146
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,250
Let's go. Let's go.

147
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,440
- I really don't want to go.
- Let's go.

148
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,300
(Xiaoyao Inn)

149
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,530
Why is there no one here?

150
00:08:57,530 --> 00:08:58,580
Innkeeper!

151
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,420
Mrs. Li!

152
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,380
- Where is everyone?
- Mrs. Li!

153
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,220
Xiaoyao?

154
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,020
(Xiaoyao Inn)
Xiaoyao, is that you?

155
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,430
- Mrs. Li!
- Xiao!

156
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,090
Have you seen my nephew?

157
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,220
He's missing?

158
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,530
After dinner,

159
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,050
he said he wanted to see the lanterns.

160
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,530
It's the Mid-Autumn Festival today,

161
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,730
so I let him go.

162
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,170
He hasn't come back since then.

163
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:20,850
Don't worry. Don't worry.

164
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,290
The kid must have gone
out of town to play.

165
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:24,130
No way.

166
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,850
My nephew may be naughty,

167
00:09:25,850 --> 00:09:28,240
but he would never disappear
for so long.

168
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,000
I... I'll go look for him again.

169
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:34,170
Mrs. Li, we'll go.

170
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:35,800
You stay at the inn,
just in case he comes back.

171
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,970
We'll help you look for him.

172
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,880
Thank you.

173
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:42,000
We will definitely
bring your nephew back.

174
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:48,370
Why does his silhouette

175
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:51,800
look so much like Sansi?

176
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,300
Mother!

177
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,800
Slow down. Take it easy.

178
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,000
Mrs. Wang,

179
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:01,410
have you seen that boy from Xiaoyao Inn?

180
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:04,170
No, I haven't seen that little naughty boy.

181
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:05,930
You are...

182
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:07,580
- Slow down.
- Sir,

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,050
have you seen Mrs. Li's nephew?

184
00:10:09,610 --> 00:10:10,530
Haven't seen him.

185
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,120
Don't worry so much.

186
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,370
He's probably gone

187
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,610
to play

188
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:20,970
with other kids.

189
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,530
That's unlikely. He's had few friends
since he was young.

190
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:33,320
Slow down. Slow down.

191
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,560
Look at them. Am I right?

192
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,090
Wait for me.

193
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,540
Look at them.

194
00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:52,020
Mine is the most beautiful.

195
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,490
Yours isn't as nice as mine.
Mine is the best.

196
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:54,530
Li Xiaoyao,

197
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:55,730
you don't have a lantern, do you?

198
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,320
Do you want to touch my lantern?

199
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,490
These are children's toys.
I don't want it.

200
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:01,970
You don't have parents
to buy you a lantern,

201
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:03,290
and we don't care to play with you.

202
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,700
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival.

203
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:05,900
My parents are coming back soon.

204
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,950
When they come back, we'll go
on adventures in the martial world.

205
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,090
You're bragging! Bragging!

206
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,260
- Bragging.
- Bragging.

207
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,700
I'm not bragging!

208
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,880
- Bragging.
- Bragging.

209
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,640
- Bragging.
- Bragging.

210
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,640
When my parents come back,

211
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:19,810
you'll want to play with me,

212
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,970
and I won't play with you!

213
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:35,010
Oh, no.

214
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,580
That boy has been kidnapped.

215
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:37,530
How do you know?

216
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:38,370
I just know.

217
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:40,200
How do you know?

218
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,880
How are you sure he was kidnapped?

219
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,620
Tell me!

220
00:11:48,340 --> 00:11:49,780
Where exactly is Li Sansi?

221
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,930
I've told you I don't know.

222
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,900
Even if I did know, I wouldn't tell.

223
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,200
Just like Li Sansi,

224
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:56,050
all stubborn to the bone.

225
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,140
Your dad is a thief,

226
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,980
and you

227
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,170
will be a thief too.

228
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,170
My dad is not a thief.

229
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:02,760
- My dad is a great hero!
- What a joke!

230
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:05,490
Have you ever seen a fugitive
being a hero?

231
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,610
Why waste words with him?

232
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,240
Just beat him up.

233
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:19,880
Why are we back
at this Shanshen Temple?

234
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:21,410
Could it be that the kid

235
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,620
is inside?

236
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:31,060
Tell me!

237
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:32,730
Where is Li Sansi?

238
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:33,980
I won't tell!

239
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,400
Are you going to speak or not?

240
00:12:42,050 --> 00:12:43,610
- Just wait a bit more.
- Wait for what?

241
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:45,260
This child can't hold it any longer.

242
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,290
Li Sansi will come to save him.

243
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,130
What?

244
00:12:47,730 --> 00:12:48,640
How do you know?

245
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,090
He will definitely come.

246
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,200
- Are you going to speak or not?
- I won't tell!

247
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,490
He's in bad shape. The child is dying!

248
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,330
Just wait a bit longer.

249
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,490
Wait a bit.

250
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,760
He... He will definitely come.

251
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,250
Definitely.

252
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,790
- Are you going to speak or not?
- I won't tell!

253
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,700
Where exactly is Li Sansi?

254
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,540
I won't tell!

255
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,850
If you won't go, I will.

256
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,620
Li Sansi!

257
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:44,010
Dad...

258
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:46,290
Dad...

259
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,560
(When I was little,)

260
00:13:52,530 --> 00:13:54,490
(what I saw was actually myself.)

261
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:25,090
Dad.

262
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,090
You are a hero.

263
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,680
You are a hero.

264
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,800
Today,

265
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,490
fortunately, you two saved Xiaoyao.

266
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,930
Thank you, thank you.

267
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:09,850
Why are you thanking him?

268
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,650
You should be thanking me.
If it weren't for me,

269
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,930
that child would have died long ago.

270
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,300
It's all my fault,

271
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,050
for not intervening earlier to save him.

272
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:23,320
Xiao, don't say that.

273
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,530
You risked your life to save Xiaoyao,

274
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,490
and that's Xiaoyao's good fortune.

275
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:41,970
This is the room
originally belonging to Sansi.

276
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:46,220
Mrs. Li,

277
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,370
may I go in and take a look?

278
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:26,290
Dad, Mom,

279
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,640
why do you have to leave again?

280
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:31,780
Just this last time.

281
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:34,120
I promise it's the last time, okay?

282
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,640
When we return from Nanzhao,

283
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:38,930
the three of us will always be together

284
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,240
and never part again.

285
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,810
Mrs. Li,

286
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:52,610
I heard Xiaoyao say

287
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,120
his parents would return
around the Mid-Autumn Festival.

288
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,370
Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival,
and they...

289
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:02,570
Xiao,

290
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:06,130
weren't you looking for Li Sansi?

291
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,370
I won't hide it from you anymore.

292
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:12,970
His parents

293
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,770
can't come back anymore.

294
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,580
That can't be.

295
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:27,850
That's impossible.

296
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,890
The Witch Queen said
there was no news of them yet.

297
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:38,770
Sansi and his wife

298
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,440
went to Nanzhao

299
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,320
to find an antidote

300
00:17:45,650 --> 00:17:47,010
for a friend.

301
00:17:48,050 --> 00:17:48,920
Unexpectedly,

302
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,970
something happened on the way,

303
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,440
and they were chased
by the Chief of the Moon Worship Sect.

304
00:17:56,770 --> 00:17:57,920
That Chief

305
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,130
is cruel and ruthless

306
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,040
and resorted to using poison,
a despicable method.

307
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,400
Both of them

308
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,370
were poisoned.

309
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,820
That can't be. That can't be.

310
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,920
They just haven't returned yet.

311
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,680
It's said the poison they encountered

312
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:21,520
is Nanzhao's Shadowless Poison.

313
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:24,890
This poison

314
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,560
is colorless and tasteless,

315
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:30,010
and kills upon entering the bloodstream,

316
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,650
without an antidote.

317
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,100
It's said

318
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:40,200
that the Shadowless Poison
is the most potent poison of Nanzhao.

319
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:42,980
Anyone poisoned by it
must suffer terribly

320
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,220
as if being bitten by thousands of ants.

321
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,650
The Shadowless Poison
was indeed my unique creation,

322
00:18:46,650 --> 00:18:48,130
but it was later stolen by someone.

323
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:52,920
It's my fault your parents died.

324
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:55,850
It's my fault.

325
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,540
Recently,

326
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,610
one of their friends,

327
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,090
Iron-armed Eagle, found me

328
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,090
and told me of their death.

329
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,680
He also brought back their belongings

330
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,440
and Sansi's

331
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,040
sword.

332
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,400
This is your father's...

333
00:19:28,410 --> 00:19:29,400
used sword.

334
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,490
No, no.

335
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:37,520
It can't be.

336
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:42,490
I haven't seen them yet.

337
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:45,200
I still haven't seen...

338
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,660
I...

339
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:48,730
I haven't...

340
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,370
I haven't been able to tell Xiaoyao

341
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:04,200
about this news

342
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:08,160
because he waits every day

343
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:10,320
at the dock for his parents

344
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,770
to return.

345
00:20:17,290 --> 00:20:18,370
I really don't know

346
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,560
how to bring up

347
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,250
this matter.

348
00:20:58,370 --> 00:21:00,040
How long will you be gone this time?

349
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,610
We'll be back by the next
Mid-Autumn Festival.

350
00:21:05,890 --> 00:21:06,980
Then let's make a pinky swear.

351
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,440
Okay, a pinky swear it is.

352
00:21:58,010 --> 00:21:58,890
Sir!

353
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,770
- Sir!
- Is your face okay?

354
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,340
I'm fine.

355
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,250
Sir,

356
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,800
I'll tell you a secret.

357
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,160
My dad came back.

358
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,130
Your dad?

359
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,970
Yesterday, a group of bad guys
kidnapped me.

360
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:21,090
My dad personally came to rescue me.

361
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,090
He was like this.

362
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,740
Just like this.

363
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,970
And he easily beat up
all those bad guys.

364
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:28,010
It was really amazing.

365
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:29,770
Sir,

366
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,800
is that wooden sword for me?

367
00:23:05,370 --> 00:23:06,610
Then I'll take you to get the bead.

368
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:23,370
This is my treasure chest.

369
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,890
I have hidden many treasures inside,

370
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:27,040
along with my parents' belongings.

371
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:31,280
Look at this.
This is my mother's hairpin.

372
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,520
And this is my father's wristguard.

373
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,490
Sir,

374
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,850
here is the bead.

375
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:04,210
OK.

376
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,090
This is great!

377
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,530
With my own sword,

378
00:24:14,530 --> 00:24:15,890
I can become a hero.

379
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,780
Sir,

380
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,200
what are you looking at?

381
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
I think

382
00:24:52,890 --> 00:24:53,730
I should go now.

383
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:57,490
Li Xiaoyao,

384
00:24:58,410 --> 00:24:59,540
you must be obedient in the future.

385
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,130
Don't always anger your aunt

386
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,890
and cause trouble.

387
00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:04,370
I didn't cause any trouble.

388
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,040
It's troubles that find me.

389
00:25:06,410 --> 00:25:07,940
You want to become a hero, right?

390
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,490
So, you shouldn't be
on the same level as them.

391
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:12,400
You're right.

392
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,160
I'll forgive them then.

393
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,540
Li Xiaoyao,

394
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,730
do you know what a hero is?

395
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:25,200
Someone with great martial arts skills.

396
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
No.

397
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,340
A hero is someone

398
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,530
with courage,

399
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,370
integrity,

400
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,500
kindness, and courtesy.

401
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,790
It's someone who upholds justice,
punishes evil, and promotes goodness.

402
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,780
It's someone
who sacrifices themselves for others,

403
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,680
just like your father.

404
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,780
I get it.

405
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,850
In the future, I must be like my father

406
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:50,610
to protect those who need protection.

407
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:53,010
Li Xiaoyao,

408
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,250
you will definitely do it.

409
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:10,610
Little rascal,

410
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,160
where did you get this sword?

411
00:26:12,530 --> 00:26:14,530
Mrs. Li, I gave him this sword.

412
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,130
He said that when I grow up,

413
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:17,970
I will definitely
become a hero like my dad.

414
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,400
Always thinking about playing.

415
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:21,400
It's almost time to open the inn.

416
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:22,940
Go and buy some fish.

417
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,090
Okay. I'm going.

418
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,770
Xiao, take a seat, and I'll clean up.

419
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:33,300
Auntie,

420
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:35,060
I should leave.

421
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,010
Leave? Now?

422
00:26:38,010 --> 00:26:39,350
Don't you want
to stay for a couple of days?

423
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:40,920
I have things waiting for me to do.

424
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,130
Auntie,

425
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,980
you should take care of your health.

426
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,820
Don't be too tired.

427
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,970
Ask that boy to run errands for you.

428
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,970
Li Xiaoyao!

429
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:13,860
You're still dawdling here!

430
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,700
Auntie!

431
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,890
- Li Xiaoyao!
-Auntie!

432
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,220
- Auntie, be gentler. It hurts!
- Go!

433
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,400
Buy some shrimp.

434
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,800
Asking me to run errands again?

435
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:24,040
Auntie, are you crying?

436
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,970
I'm happy.

437
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,040
Auntie!

438
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,650
Auntie, you're so good. Auntie!

439
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,300
Let go.

440
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,060
Auntie,

441
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,520
Li Xiaoyao has something

442
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,370
he's been too embarrassed to tell you.

443
00:27:50,250 --> 00:27:51,370
I'll tell you on his behalf.

444
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,890
What?

445
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,160
In his heart,

446
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,040
you're as important

447
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,280
as his parents.

448
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:45,920
I have a story. Do you have good wine?

449
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,820
Sir!

450
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:53,970
Sir, sir!

451
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,650
Sir, are you leaving?

452
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:57,610
Why didn't you say anything?

453
00:28:58,050 --> 00:29:01,170
Fate is predetermined.

454
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:03,460
It comes and goes like clouds.

455
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:05,130
It doesn't matter
if we say goodbye or not.

456
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:07,940
In the future,

457
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,800
you must teach that kid
in Xiaoyao Inn martial arts.

458
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,770
He is the chosen one you mentioned?

459
00:29:15,250 --> 00:29:16,090
That's right.

460
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,800
He will be

461
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,420
your most talented disciple
in the future.

462
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:26,680
Let's see where fate leads us.

463
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:06,460
(Suzhou City)

464
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:09,650
I wonder

465
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:12,370
what Yueru is doing now.

466
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:17,620
Yueru, let's go to the suburbs.

467
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:19,050
These city walls are too high.

468
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,170
Jinyuan, if we want to fly a kite,

469
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,320
it has to be
in a high and spacious place.

470
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,320
Yueru, be careful.

471
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:26,890
Yueru!

472
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,610
Yueru!

473
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,920
(Couldn't it be that she...)

474
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:03,490
Thank you, sir, for saving me.

475
00:31:03,890 --> 00:31:06,280
I am Lin Yueru from Lin Fortress
in Suzhou City.

476
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,560
May I ask your name, sir?

477
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,680
Ten years ago,

478
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,100
he saved my life.

479
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,130
Since then, I have vowed

480
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,490
to become a hero like him.

481
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:29,890
Fool.

482
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:35,800
When we rescue Ling'er,

483
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,130
we'll eat,

484
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:38,130
play,

485
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:39,220
and grow old together.

486
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,650
We'll be friends forever.

487
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,970
Sir,

488
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:54,010
I'm most reluctant
to owe anyone a favor.

489
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:56,400
If it's inconvenient
to tell me your name,

490
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,090
could I at least
remember your appearance?

491
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,820
(Yueru,)

492
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:10,090
(I hope)

493
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,040
(we have never met each other.)

494
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,730
The books say

495
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:42,850
that the high-level cultivators
of Mount Shu

496
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:44,320
can control phoenixes.

497
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:50,440
Unfortunately, I didn't see his face.

498
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,770
This is the way back.

499
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:17,890
The Water Spiritual Bead!

500
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:50,980
(Ten years after)

501
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:39,970
Bai Yue.

502
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,280
Li Xiaoyao,

503
00:34:43,220 --> 00:34:44,980
you are the young man

504
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,560
who saved Princess Ling'er
ten years ago.

505
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:51,370
You know I came from ten years ago?

506
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,370
If it weren't for you and your father,

507
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,520
ten years ago,

508
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,000
I would have already obtained
the Water Spiritual Bead.

509
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,300
Bai Yue,

510
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,450
it was you who killed my parents.

511
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,210
It was your parents
who chose the wrong person.

512
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:08,370
The demoness gave them
the Water Spiritual Bead.

513
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,170
Join me.

514
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
You're delusional!

515
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,720
Li Xiaoyao, you should thank me.

516
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,860
From chasing Ling'er on Fairy Island

517
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,780
to destroying the Witch Queen's statue
in Yunmeng Marsh,

518
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,760
you've always tried to kill us.

519
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:32,000
If I had really wanted to kill you
in Yunmeng Marsh,

520
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,690
would you have been able to leave alive?

521
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:44,320
You all just try to stay alive first.

522
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,850
I'm leaving here now.

523
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,380
You...

524
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,700
You did this on purpose.

525
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,130
You don't think

526
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:04,060
that you got through all these dangers

527
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,520
just with your mediocre skills, do you?

528
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:14,370
I've heard that there's a fairy island here,

529
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:17,130
where has a magical medicine
that can revive the dead.

530
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:18,000
Li Xiaoyao,

531
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:19,410
see you next time.

532
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,650
See you next time.

533
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,850
They should have reached
Yangzhou City by now.

534
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:28,930
Yes.

535
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:32,720
I've already done
what needed to be done.

536
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:34,480
Don't come looking for me again.

537
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:37,250
Chief,

538
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,170
Mr. Shi has already
taken Princess Ling'er

539
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,210
to Yunmeng Marsh.

540
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,240
The timing

541
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,170
is just right.

542
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,410
Why did you do this?

543
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,090
Ten years ago,
your parents obstructed me,

544
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:02,720
causing me to lose
the Water Spiritual Bead.

545
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,480
I've been searching hard
and finally found Li Xiaoyao.

546
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:08,690
He was indeed Li Sansi's son,

547
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,610
but he was just a ten-year-old child.

548
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,890
All of this

549
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:19,450
made me ponder deeply for ten years.

550
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,480
I've deciphered the heavenly secrets.

551
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:25,960
During the battle
in the Imperial Palace ten years ago,

552
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:28,930
the person I met should be you now.

553
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:34,480
And you were destined
to return ten years ago

554
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,800
to take the Water Spiritual Bead.

555
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,170
It was you who arranged for me
to go to Fairy Island.

556
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,850
Everything that followed
was your arrangement.

557
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,560
The memory loss about Fairy Island

558
00:37:47,330 --> 00:37:48,610
was also your doing on purpose.

559
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,560
On that Fairy Island,

560
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,760
there were people
who met you ten years ago.

561
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,370
They would tell you
what happened ten years ago.

562
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,450
I need to prevent you

563
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:11,610
from understanding all of this,

564
00:38:11,810 --> 00:38:14,720
so you must lose this memory.

565
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,520
Besides the Princess,

566
00:38:17,170 --> 00:38:19,690
the rest must be silenced.

567
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:23,040
This is what I needed to ensure

568
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:26,410
that you would obtain
the Water Spiritual Bead.

569
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:31,410
No wonder I entered the Temple so easily.

570
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,800
You were waiting for today.

571
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:40,930
Everything is arranged by heaven.

572
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,760
It's destined that you, Li Xiaoyao,

573
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:45,650
would help me

574
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:48,280
achieve my great cause.

575
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:52,520
Whether it's destined or not

576
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,690
is not for you to decide.

577
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,960
Those who defy heaven

578
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,090
do not deserve to remain in this world.

579
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:45,890
Those who follow heaven prosper,

580
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,930
and those who defy heaven perish.

581
00:39:48,370 --> 00:39:49,780
Give me the Water Spiritual Bead,

582
00:39:49,780 --> 00:39:51,850
and I will grant you a swift end.

583
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:52,760
Never!

584
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,650
What can a mere ancient artifact do

585
00:41:06,650 --> 00:41:08,480
to me?

586
00:41:54,410 --> 00:41:58,320
Spell of the God of Wine!

587
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,720
Good for you.
