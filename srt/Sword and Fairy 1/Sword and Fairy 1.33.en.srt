00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 33=

3
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:46,490
Wan'er, don't!

4
00:01:46,490 --> 00:01:47,930
If the Sword Tomb
loses its magical barrier,

5
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:49,680
I won't be able to protect you anymore.

6
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:53,770
Wan'er, are you alright? Are you hurt?

7
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:55,720
I don't need your pretentious protection.

8
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,980
The power of the King of Prison
is drawing near.

9
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,130
Use the Seven-Star Sword against him now.

10
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,530
But pulling out the Sword

11
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,420
will dissipate your soul.

12
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,280
There's no time.

13
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:10,000
Pull out the Sword now.

14
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,500
Wan'er,

15
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:14,250
I know

16
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,120
you still haven't forgiven me.

17
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,330
In my life,

18
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:21,970
I first failed your mother

19
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,890
and then wronged you.

20
00:02:27,770 --> 00:02:28,610
I should have

21
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:32,050
followed your mother in death.

22
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:36,530
Do you know why I didn't leave?

23
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,220
Because

24
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,560
this way I could watch over you,

25
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,530
protect you,

26
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,480
and atone for sins to your mother.

27
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,170
No.

28
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,170
Be careful!

29
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,660
Li Xiaoyao!

30
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,780
Wan'er,

31
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,170
the King of Prison
should be arriving soon.

32
00:03:13,770 --> 00:03:15,560
Let him pull out the Seven-Star Sword.

33
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,180
If you die,

34
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,170
the efforts your mother
and I made years ago

35
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:21,330
will become meaningless.

36
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,280
Your mother's spirit in heaven

37
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,840
will also be restless.

38
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,050
Listen to me.

39
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:22,730
Father!

40
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,170
Father!

41
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:28,130
Wan'er.

42
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:31,600
Wan'er,

43
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,420
take good care of yourself.

44
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,260
Father!

45
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,480
Father!

46
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,640
With just this broken sword,

47
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,440
do you think

48
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,480
you can hurt me?

49
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,100
No!

50
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,690
It's not possible.

51
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,880
Is my father really dead?

52
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,920
I haven't forgiven him yet.

53
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,160
Miss Wan'er,

54
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,730
perhaps your father can't hear,

55
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,640
but he surely understands.

56
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,220
Before,

57
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,410
I didn't want parents.

58
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,640
Now, I want them,

59
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:15,010
but they are no longer here.

60
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,780
Miss Wan'er,

61
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,200
even if our parents are gone,

62
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:34,680
they will always protect us,

63
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:37,090
hoping we live safely

64
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:38,610
and joyfully.

65
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,300
Let's go.

66
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:02,680
I'll take you to see Ling'er.

67
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:18,890
Ling'er was locked

68
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,490
in the Demon Transformation Pool
at the bottom of the Tower.

69
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:55,930
My Lady, don't worry.

70
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,560
A'nu is just overwhelmed by sadness.

71
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,970
Her body is not seriously harmed.

72
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,490
Thank you, Madam.

73
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:26,760
This

74
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:28,530
is all my fault.

75
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,930
General Gai died because of me

76
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,410
and my poor judgment.

77
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:36,410
I trusted the wrong guy.

78
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,800
My Lady, you needn't blame yourself.

79
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:43,000
Though Tang Yu was from
the Moon Worship Sect,

80
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:46,410
his feelings towards A'nu were genuine.

81
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:49,120
I hope so.

82
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:12,120
I know the pain in your heart,

83
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,490
but this time,

84
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:25,370
you made the right choice.

85
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:27,980
Don't come any closer.

86
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,410
Through this corridor,

87
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,690
you can reach the lowest level
of the Demon Locking Tower.

88
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:00,170
You three must have a lot to talk about

89
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,050
when you meet.

90
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,530
I need to return to the Sword Tomb.

91
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,200
See you next time.

92
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:07,850
Thank you, Miss Wan'er, for escorting us.

93
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,200
We'll go and rescue Ling'er.

94
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,570
It

95
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,550
should be returned to its rightful owner.

96
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,930
I'm a half-demon,

97
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:21,170
unable to wield this ancient divine sword.

98
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,300
This sword has been sealed for many years

99
00:12:24,850 --> 00:12:26,530
and needs a worthy master.

100
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,490
But...

101
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,930
The divine sword chooses its master.

102
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:33,170
Since you pulled it out,

103
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,090
it means you two are fated.

104
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:37,240
I think

105
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:39,680
this is also my father's wish.

106
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,810
In that case,

107
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,800
thank you, Miss Wan'er,
for your father's gift.

108
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,300
We'll come to find you
after we rescue Ling'er.

109
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,810
Let's go.

110
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,000
One more thing.

111
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,970
How much do you really know

112
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,800
about Ling'er?

113
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,560
Why do you ask that, Miss Wan'er?

114
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:09,730
Ling'er

115
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,610
is different from you.

116
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:17,860
Different?

117
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:21,200
My father and mother
truly loved each other,

118
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,490
but ultimately suffered a tragic end

119
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:24,880
due to their different statuses.

120
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,240
Now you and Ling'er
are in a similar situation.

121
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,640
Difference statuses?

122
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:36,610
Miss Wan'er, you worry too much.

123
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,120
Once you see Ling'er,

124
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,170
you'll understand what I mean.

125
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,690
See you next time.

126
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,860
Wait a moment.

127
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,520
- A snake demon.
- A snake demon.

128
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,970
I saw a snake demon on the bed.

129
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,290
That snake demon

130
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,440
seems like

131
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,200
Miss Zhao.

132
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,410
You know best in your heart

133
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:11,760
about whether you're different
from humans.

134
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,980
According to the rules of Mount Shu,

135
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,440
all captured demons

136
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:20,200
are to be imprisoned
within the Demon Locking Tower.

137
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,250
Wan'er,

138
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,490
did what you said just now

139
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,220
mean

140
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:33,570
that Ling'er

141
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,370
is a demon?

142
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,170
So, it's all true.

143
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,540
Li Xiaoyao.

144
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,010
What's wrong?

145
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,680
What did Miss Wan'er tell you?

146
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:17,410
Nothing, nothing.

147
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:18,730
Why are you hesitating?

148
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,090
- No.
- Still saying no?

149
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:23,810
Forget it.

150
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,740
Li Xiaoyao.

151
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,200
Don't you understand

152
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:32,780
what Miss Wan'er was trying to say?

153
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:35,680
Of course, I do.

154
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,900
Wasn't she just saying

155
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,850
even if we rescue Ling'er,

156
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:40,190
it will be hard for us
to leave the Tower?

157
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:43,860
Li Xiaoyao,

158
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,730
what if Ling'er

159
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,050
is different from

160
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:52,980
what you've seen before?

161
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,090
What could be different about Ling'er?

162
00:15:57,410 --> 00:15:58,250
Li Xiaoyao,

163
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,120
if...

164
00:16:01,260 --> 00:16:02,100
What if

165
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,760
Ling'er is

166
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,220
a demon?

167
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,180
Lin Yueru!

168
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,090
What are you talking about?

169
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,340
I mean if.

170
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,290
Why so many ifs?

171
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:16,790
Don't you know how Ling'er ended up
in the Demon Locking Tower?

172
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,050
Without Ling'er,

173
00:16:18,050 --> 00:16:20,150
we would have already died
under the Seven-Star Sword Formation.

174
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:21,400
Others slander her as a demon,

175
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,730
but Ling'er considers you a good friend.

176
00:16:22,730 --> 00:16:23,850
Why would you accuse her like this?

177
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:25,220
I... I didn't...

178
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,440
- Listen to me.
- That's enough.

179
00:16:27,850 --> 00:16:29,900
Li Xiaoyao, calm down.

180
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,800
Some things

181
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:32,900
are clearer
when you're not personally involved.

182
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:33,740
Enough!

183
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:36,170
- Li Xiaoyao...
- Just go.

184
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,410
I'm a burden to you.

185
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:49,680
Ling'er is a burden to you.

186
00:16:59,050 --> 00:16:59,890
If

187
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:03,000
you feel it's inconvenient

188
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,680
like Miss Wan'er,

189
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:07,010
then go ahead and leave.

190
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,440
I just wanted to say

191
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:22,460
if...

192
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,250
By any chance...

193
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,250
I appreciate your kindness.

194
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,700
Alright.

195
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,800
In that case,

196
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:49,280
I'll leave.

197
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,130
Take care.

198
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:41,280
They've gone in?

199
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,200
Why didn't you stop them?

200
00:19:46,130 --> 00:19:47,800
How could I have stopped them?

201
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,060
Dugu,

202
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:52,090
when Jiang went in back then,

203
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,770
we couldn't stop him either.

204
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,370
Li Xiaoyao

205
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,650
is a promising young man.

206
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,780
It's a pity.

207
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,610
I've seen everything in the world,

208
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:07,730
yet I've never

209
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,730
taken anything seriously.

210
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,730
There's no need to tell me

211
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,280
to let go.

212
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,820
Ling'er!

213
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:33,890
Ling'er!

214
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:38,460
Ling'er!

215
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,560
Xiaoyao.

216
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,610
It's really you, Ling'er.

217
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,340
It's not me.

218
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,660
It's not me.

219
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,730
It's not me. I'm not Ling'er.

220
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,820
They...

221
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:04,130
They've turned you into this.

222
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,130
Ling'er, don't panic.

223
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:07,160
I'll rescue you right away.

224
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,580
Xiaoyao,

225
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,560
you must leave now.

226
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,180
Ling'er,

227
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,250
don't be afraid.

228
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,160
They've hurt you like this.

229
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:18,970
I won't let them get away with it.

230
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,060
Xiaoyao,

231
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:28,560
this has nothing to do with others.

232
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:30,210
What you saw earlier

233
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:34,730
was my true form.

234
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:44,400
It's not possible.

235
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,770
It's not possible.

236
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,200
Xiaoyao,

237
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,400
at Lin Fortress,

238
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,680
what you saw

239
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,780
was me.

240
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,580
It can't be.

241
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,700
It can't be.

242
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:08,820
It can't be.

243
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,440
This isn't possible.

244
00:24:12,290 --> 00:24:13,130
Impossible.

245
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:15,440
I've been hiding it from you.

246
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,820
Ling'er,

247
00:24:32,530 --> 00:24:33,370
listen to me.

248
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,650
No matter what you look like,

249
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,280
and no matter what you are,

250
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,320
you are Ling'er.

251
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,440
You are Ling'er.

252
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,250
Xiaoyao.

253
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:05,820
Ling'er,

254
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,060
listen to me.

255
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,560
From now on,

256
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,370
don't think about anything.

257
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,650
You don't need to think about anything.

258
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,490
Just remember

259
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,730
that no matter what happens,

260
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,200
I want to be with you.

261
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,800
Xiaoyao,

262
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,160
we can't be together.

263
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,860
You'll get into trouble because of me.

264
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,700
No, no.

265
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,540
No, I won't.

266
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:33,850
As long as you are by my side,

267
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:36,560
I'm not afraid of anything.

268
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,180
This is...

269
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,940
This is...

270
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,320
Xiaoyao, what's wrong?

271
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,090
I...

272
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,890
Xiaoyao.

273
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,320
Why does it feel like

274
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,200
though we've just met,

275
00:26:57,530 --> 00:26:59,680
it's like long-separated lovers
reuniting?

276
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:00,940
Because

277
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:04,400
if you like someone,

278
00:27:05,170 --> 00:27:06,400
every encounter is a reunion

279
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,920
after a long separation.

280
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,250
Ling'er.

281
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:41,130
Ling'er,

282
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:42,970
do you know

283
00:27:43,290 --> 00:27:44,850
what it means to be a hair-tied couple?

284
00:27:47,130 --> 00:27:48,730
It's a tradition in our Central Plains.

285
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,850
During the wedding,

286
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,850
the couple take a strand of their hair

287
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:53,890
and tie them together,

288
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,400
so that they're a hair-tied couple.

289
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:05,890
So are we now.

290
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:23,370

291
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:25,890

00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,920
We're married.

293
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,280
Xiaoyao.

294
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
Ling'er,

295
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,650
I've remembered everything.

296
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:53,440
I've remembered everything.

297
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,090
Ling'er,

298
00:29:02,410 --> 00:29:04,770
you are my wife.

299

Ling'er,

336
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,520
I'm glad you're okay.

337
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,010
Silly rat,

338
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:47,040
I heard everything.

339
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,770
How can you forget you are married?
It's so important.

340
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:51,800
What on earth is in your head?

341
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:53,660
It's my fault.

342
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,100
It's all my fault.

343
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,050
Of course, it's your fault.

344
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:58,130
Luckily, it's Ling'er.

345
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:58,970
If it were someone else...

346
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:12,300
Ling'er,

347
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,850
you made a mistake too.

348
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,490
You erased our memories of you,

349
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:22,440
so I had a moment

350
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,650
when I wanted to be with him.

351
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,770
But you should know

352
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:28,970
he has always liked you.

353
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,490
Even without his memories of you,

354
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,920
his feelings for you won't change.

355
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,320
Now it's all good.

356
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,610
Since you are married,

357
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:45,730
I can finally tell you

358
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:47,200
some things.

359
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,400
I

360
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,400
like this silly rat.

361
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,220
(Seal)

362
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,490
I did like him.

363
00:33:07,700 --> 00:33:08,540
Savage girl,

364
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,940
you...

365
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:12,010
I was born in Lin Fortress

366
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:14,250
and haven't met many people.

367
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,560
Li Xiaoyao

368
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,650
is young and like-minded,

369
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,440
so I inevitably had feelings for him

370
00:33:21,410 --> 00:33:22,800
during our constant companionship.

371
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,850
Before,

372
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,400
I knew Li Xiaoyao favored you,

373
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,040
but I never imagined

374
00:33:29,770 --> 00:33:30,680
the twists and turns

375
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:32,730
you've been through.

376
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:36,370
Compared to that,

377
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,370
what does my little affection count for?

378
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,180
Ling'er,

379
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:47,090
Li Xiaoyao,

380
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,320
as your friend,

381
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,680
I don't want to keep any secrets
from you.

382
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:54,970
Similarly,

383
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,730
as your friend,

384
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,010
I hope more than anything to see you

385
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,650
love each other and grow old together.

386
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,560
I'm a heroine

387
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,240
and there's nothing I can't let go.

388
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,240
Meeting you in this life

389
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,650
and wandering the martial world

390
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,520
with you guys

391
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:28,170
is already a great fortune.

392
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,210
I ask for nothing more.

393
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,850
Thank you, Yueru.

394
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,010
So,

395
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,210
we will be good friends forever.

396
00:34:41,740 --> 00:34:42,610
We will eat,

397
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:44,620
play,

398
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,210
and grow old together.

399
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,130
Savage girl...

400
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,560
But I won't always
be following you around.

401
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,960
When we were in Taoyuan Village,

402
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,240
I told Ling'er

403
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:00,210
that I still prefer
wandering the martial world,

404
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:01,270
upholding justice,

405
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:02,790
and supporting the weak
against the strong.

406
00:35:03,650 --> 00:35:05,370
But I will come back often to visit you,

407
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,040
rest at your cottage,

408
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,410
and tell you about my adventures.

409
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,650
When I've rested enough,

410
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:12,610
I will continue on my journey.

411
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,800
You can all be envious then.

412
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,800
Alright, stop crying now.

413
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,610
Alright.

414
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:25,930
Don't cry anymore.

415
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:32,210
I can't believe I've said so much.

416
00:35:34,410 --> 00:35:35,250
Ling'er,

417
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,240
it's time for us to go.

418
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,300
Alright.

419
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,860
Let's go.

420
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:48,700
(Seal)

421
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,610
Daring villains,

422
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:08,090
how dare you release a demon criminal?

423
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:08,930
Who's there?

424
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,170
King of Prison.

425
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,280
It was you who imprisoned Ling'er here.

426
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,320
You broke into the Tower,

427
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:18,720
ruined my magical barrier,

428
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,300
and released a demon criminal.

429
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,410
This cannot be justified by law.

430
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:22,250
King of Prison,

431
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:24,330
you should look at yourself.

432
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:25,370
Who really is the demon here?

433
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:27,320
You're too ignorant

434
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:29,060
to recognize a true deity.

435
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,000
Even if you're a deity,

436
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,410
you don't deserve that
since you can't tell good from evil.

437
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,410
Even if she's a demon,

438
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:35,210
her commitment to goodness
makes her a deity.

439
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,450
Utterly foolish.

440
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,800
This demoness' power is extraordinary.

441
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:41,370
If we don't kill her now,

442
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,700
she will bring calamity to the world.

443
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:43,560
King of Prison,

444
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,140
I am not a demon.

445
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:46,700
I am a descendant of Nuwa.

446
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,090
How dare you?

447
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,240
That's ridiculous.

448
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,320
Taoists follow Taoism,
while Buddhists honor Buddha.

449
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,960
Where does this so-called
descendant of Nuwa come from?

450
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:57,940
Just another heresy
from the southern barbarians.

451
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,240
You call yourself a god,

452
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,650
yet can't recognize Nuwa.

453
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,280
Since I can't reason with you,

454
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:06,520
you shall perish here without a next life.

455
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:09,410
Ling'er!

456
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,370
Xiaoyao, now's our chance!

457
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,930
It's impossible.

458
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,450
How could I be defeated by mortals?

459
00:40:27,850 --> 00:40:30,040
It's impossible!

460
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,170
The Wind Spiritual Bead.

461
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:45,410
No. This place is going to collapse.
We need to go now!

462
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,410
Xiaoyao!

463
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:23,980
You guys, go!

464
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,930
- Savage girl!
- Yueru!

465
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,040
Savage girl!

466
00:41:38,810 --> 00:41:39,760
Yueru!

467
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:44,130
Savage girl!

468
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:00,780
Li Xiaoyao.

469
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,690
Li Xiaoyao.

470
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,410
Li Xiaoyao.

471
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,370
Li Xiaoyao.

472
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,040
My mother wants to meet you.

473
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:22,450
Shall I take you to see her now?

474
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,520
Now?

475
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,690
I'm a bit tired.

476
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,450
Maybe next time.

477
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,560
Okay.

478
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,520
Then I'll go by myself.

479
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:44,580
