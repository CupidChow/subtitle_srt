=Episode 28=

3
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:48,260
(Lizhao Residence)

4
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,280
Sir, thank you for your attention.

5
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,280
It's my job.
No need to be courteous, Mrs. Liu.

6
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,400
Is this young man Mr. Liu?

7
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,620
Indeed, his eyes are lifeless,

8
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,810
and his forehead is darkened.

9
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:04,360
Have you just experienced a great ordeal?

10
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,850
Do you feel like
you can't remember many things,

11
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,050
and your head is throbbing?

12
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,410
Sir,

13
00:02:10,970 --> 00:02:13,120
this is my son's friend.

14
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:17,170
I see.

15
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,410
I'm fine.

16
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,090
- Jinyuan.
- Mother.

17
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,220
Why are you here?

18
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:24,280
Seeking medical treatment
for illness is enough.

19
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,260
No need to find a Taoist.

20
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,330
It's just futile.

21
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:29,610
So, this is Mr. Liu?

22
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:33,540
Indeed, Mr. Liu's eyes are lifeless,
and his forehead is darkened.

23
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:36,560
It must be due to evil spirits.

24
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,410
Same words.

25
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,810
Sir,

26
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:43,250
I know my illness best.

27
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,410
It's definitely not caused
by evil spirits.

28
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,770
You have truly
been blinded by demons.

29
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,050
I sensed a demonic presence
in the city the other day.

30
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,940
Fortunately, your mother's invitation

31
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,200
made me aware

32
00:02:57,850 --> 00:02:59,410
that it's lurking around her.

33
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,280
Sir, please perform your exorcism

34
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,410
and vanish demons for me.

35
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,170
Mrs. Liu, rest assured.

36
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:08,890
I came prepared

37
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:11,280
and will surely rid
the young master of evil.

38
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,480
Good, I'll prepare immediately.

39
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:15,300
Mother!

40
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:16,810
Mother!

41
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,890
Honey. Honey.

42
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,330
Honey, is something wrong?

43
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,640
A Taoist from Sanqing Abbey has arrived,

44
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,480
claiming there's a demon in our house.

45
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,970
If the Taoist is powerful,

46
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,720
it's good to rid the evil from our house.

47
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,970
They're just talking nonsense

48
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,000
to swindle some money.

49
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,410
Honey,

50
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:58,450
I suddenly crave the peony cake

51
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,810
you often make for me.

52
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,410
Honey,

53
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,610
snacks should be eaten in moderation.

54
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:19,920
Honey, it's okay. Don't worry.

55
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:33,160
Then,

56
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:34,810
I'll go out and look for a bit.

57
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,600
Just rest in the house.

58
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,420
Mother,

59
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:10,730
I'm fine.

60
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:19,570
The banner of distinguished names hangs high,
guarded by the gods.

61
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:22,760
Talisman of Subduing Demons
by Taoist Master Zhang.

62
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:28,690
Audacious demon,

63
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:30,920
daring to mock me, the celestial master?

64
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:35,200
Then don't blame me for being merciless.

65
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,410
Heavenly soldiers and generals,
descend now!

66
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,810
It's heading to Jinyuan's bedroom!

67
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,730
It's...

68
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:03,200
- Master!
- Master! Master!

69
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:07,160
Mrs. Liu, the demon here

70
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,810
is not ordinary.

71
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:10,690
We hastily set up the altar today

72
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,200
and haven't prepared all the instruments.

73
00:06:12,450 --> 00:06:13,850
What should we do next?

74
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:15,730
It's hiding in the dark.

75
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,690
I need to find another way.

76
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,170
Sir, this demonic aura is false,

77
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:21,410
but you did believe the rumors.

78
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:23,850
Mother, I think this Taoist

79
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,160
clearly listened to the gossip outside

80
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,890
and concluded there's a demon here

81
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,160
to swindle money.

82
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:32,760
It's utterly absurd.

83
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,540
Jinyuan.

84
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:35,970
Jinyuan, don't worry.

85
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,050
Sir, he has no such intentions.

86
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,250
Everything I said is true.

87
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,820
My words end here.

88
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,980
If you refuse to listen,

89
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,690
it will be your downfall.

90
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,600
Nonsense!

91
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,410
You might be the one in jeopardy!

92
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,410
Stop pulling the tricks here
to swindle money.

93
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,880
- Let me deal with you!
- I've offered my advice.

94
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,530
You don't listen and want to beat me?

95
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,570
Let's go.

96
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,820
Sir.

97
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:03,130
- Mother.
- Sir!

98
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,970
Stop praying to gods and Buddhas

99
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,920
and making a mess at home.

100
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,980
Why do you have to do this?

101
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:16,820
Alright.

102
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:18,410
I'll listen to you.

103
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:20,690
Enough said.

104
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:22,920
Let's go back to the room and rest.

105
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:24,780
Let's go.

106
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,440
Silly rat,

107
00:07:37,170 --> 00:07:38,130
as you've seen,

108
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:41,360
stop pondering these superstitious matters
in the future.

109
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,530
Why do you keep staring at me?

110
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,040
I have something to tell you.

111
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,440
What is it?

112
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,360
Tonight, at midnight,
I'll be waiting for you here.

113
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,010
Remember to come.

114
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,440
Silly rat,

115
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,920
making it so secretive.

116
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:21,850
Honey.

117
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:35,170
Mother, don't worry.

118
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,930
I'll take good care of him.

119
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:38,130
Alright.

120
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,560
I'll leave him to you.

121
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:44,290
Jinyuan, rest well.

122
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:07,930
Honey.

123
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,410
Actually, I...

124
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:17,410
That Taoist is just seeking fame.

125
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:19,880
Don't take it to heart.

126
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,560
There really is a demon
in the Liu Mansion.

127
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:42,780
Look.

128
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,490
It rained when we were there,

129
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,730
but now the sun is out.

130
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:46,570
Sir.

131
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,010
Sir.

132
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,460
What do you want?

133
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,490
Sir, please don't misunderstand.

134
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm just puzzled and want
to ask you about something.

135
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:59,370
Sir, do you know what kind of demon
is in the Liu Mansion?

136
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,320
Since you put it that way,

137
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:12,760
I feel the demon has at least
a thousand years of cultivation.

138
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,200
Based on your judgment,

139
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,090
where might the demon hide?

140
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,880
Throughout the Liu Mansion,

141
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:21,140
Mr. Liu is the palest

142
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,530
and the weakest one.

143
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,930
I believe

144
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,680
the demon is often with him.

145
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:33,170
That makes sense.

146
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:35,690
By the way, sir,

147
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,200
earlier you mentioned
I've experienced a great ordeal.

148
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,850
It's true.

149
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,290
My head throbs

150
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,590
and I've forgotten something.

151
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,620
Do you know

152
00:10:45,090 --> 00:10:46,200
what may have caused this?

153
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:56,800
I only discerned that you were affected

154
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,560
by demonic power.

155
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,880
As for the reasons,

156
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,800
I can't tell.

157
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,320
Thank you for your honest disclosure.

158
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:06,540
Goodbye.

159
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,880
Could it be related

160
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:14,050
to Zhao Ling'er they mentioned earlier?

161
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,050
You're finally awake.

162
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,610
Where am I?

163
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,690
(Jiang Wan'er)
This place is known as the Sword Tomb.

164
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,200
The King of Prison cannot enter,

165
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,590
so there's no need for you to worry.

166
00:11:58,850 --> 00:11:59,730
Thank you

167
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:01,010
for saving me.

168
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:05,800
Who are you?

169
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,880
I'm Jiang Wan'er.

170
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,050
Why are you here?

171
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,410
I was born in the Tower.

172
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,440
So, I'm here.

173
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,050
What about your parents?

174
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,440
According to the Book Immortal,

175
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:22,580
my father is a human

176
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,490
named Jiang Che,

177
00:12:24,090 --> 00:12:25,970
and my mother
is a Saint of the Demon Clan

178
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,170
named Yue Rouxia.

179
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:30,000
But they died

180
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:31,130
shortly after I was born.

181
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:35,730
You've been living alone
in this Demon-Locking Tower.

182
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,880
Aren't you afraid of the King of Prison?

183
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,440
My mother left a mark on me

184
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:43,090
to prevent me from being harmed
by the King of Prison.

185
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,410
I don't know if it's true or not,

186
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,250
but I haven't been harmed
by the King of Prison

187
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:50,440
in the past 18 or 19 years.

188
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:51,880
Maybe it's real.

189
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,530
Your parents

190
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,760
must have loved you very much,

191
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:58,410
so they left a strong mark on you

192
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,410
to protect you.

193
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,760
After all this talk,

194
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,680
I still don't know your name.

195
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:08,640
I'm Zhao Ling'er.

196
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,330
Ling'er,

197
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,240
you don't have any demonic energy.

198
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,560
How did you get in here?

199
00:13:18,850 --> 00:13:19,690
I...

200
00:13:20,410 --> 00:13:21,880
I'm a descendant of Nuwa.

201
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:23,780
Nuwa?

202
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,000
The Book Immortal says

203
00:13:26,610 --> 00:13:28,000
Nuwa is an ancient deity.

204
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,970
You're a descendant of Nuwa,

205
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,850
so your mother must also be
a descendant of Nuwa.

206
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:35,730
But she's gone.

207
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,530
Do you have any other relatives?

208
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:43,250
I have my grandmother.

209
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,300
Now,

210
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,760
I also have Xiaoyao.

211
00:13:51,290 --> 00:13:53,530
Who is Xiaoyao?

212
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,090
He's a very important person to me.

213
00:13:56,730 --> 00:13:59,640
Ling'er, I advise you to forget about it.

214
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,000
Once you're in the Demon-Locking Tower,

215
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,800
it means you'll never leave again.

216
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,680
You'd better let go now

217
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,530
and stop thinking
about the outside world.

218
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:22,240
Ling'er, you've seen the outside world.

219
00:14:23,050 --> 00:14:24,170
Tell me about it.

220
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,680
What's it like out there?

221
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,560
I really want to go out and see it.

222
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,730
I've never seen it before.

223
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:33,530
I used to live on an island

224
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,050
with my grandmother,

225
00:14:36,970 --> 00:14:39,700
just like you live
in the Demon-Locking Tower,

226
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,640
never leaving.

227
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,440
But that island

228
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,740
was very beautiful,

229
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,610
like a fairyland.

230
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,780
Later,

231
00:14:49,730 --> 00:14:51,290
I met Xiaoyao,

232
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,170
and he took me away from Fairy Island

233
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,970
back to his hometown, Yuhang Town.

234
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,000
It's a very friendly place.

235
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,560
We later searched for the Spiritual Beads

236
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,200
and went to Suzhou City.

237
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,680
Suzhou City?

238
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,610
Suzhou City is very lively,

239
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,970
and there's an even livelier place

240
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,810
called Yangzhou City.

241
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,060
Yangzhou City?

242
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,440
They have a fireworks festival there.

243
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,810
Do you know?

244
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:24,530
The fireworks suddenly burst in the sky,

245
00:15:25,170 --> 00:15:28,680
like a shower of stars.

246
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,440
That must be beautiful.

247
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,610
But I've never seen real stars.

248
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:42,250
Wan'er,

249
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,800
do you know

250
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,760
there's something

251
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,320
called a revolving
scenic lantern outside?

252
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,850
It shows you many beautiful stories

253
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,320
in this world

254
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,640
through the changing light and shadow.

255
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,090
When we get out,

256
00:16:03,290 --> 00:16:04,490
I'll take you to see it together.

257
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,220
Master,

258
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,120
is there a kind of insect

259
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:41,900
that can control eagles to fly
to distant places to gather information

260
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,200
and then transmit messages?

261
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,530
As far as I know,

262
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,850
there's no such insect.

263
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,370
That's strange.

264
00:16:58,380 --> 00:16:59,290
What's wrong?

265
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:02,980
Master,

266
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:06,730
I suspect there are followers of Bai Yue

267
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:08,010
around us.

268
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:10,650
Every time we encounter danger,

269
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:13,200
we hear a strange eagle call.

270
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:17,680
But after being tamed,

271
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:22,650
eagles can transmit messages
like carrier pigeons through whistles.

272
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:30,920
Whistles...

273
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,610
What am I thinking?

274
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:57,040
How could I think of Tang Yu?

275
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:49,040
He... He's still my Tang Yu.

276
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,160
He's not the spy.

277
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:54,490
A'nu, how can you think like that?

278
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,130
Silly rat,

279
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,300
you...

280
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,680
What are you doing

281
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,800
being so mysterious?

282
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm warning you,

283
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,580
you silly rat.

284
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:49,400
Although we travel together,

285
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:52,010
there might

286
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,800
be a bit of friendship.

287
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:56,420
But

288
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,320
marriage is about
parents and matchmakers.

289
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,400
I'm the young lady of the Lin Fortress.

290
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,290
You can't skip any formalities.

291
00:20:02,290 --> 00:20:03,130
Speak softly.

292
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:09,280
Why did you call me over

293
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,090
in the middle of the night?

294
00:20:11,290 --> 00:20:12,280
You'll find out soon.

295
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Let's follow her.

296
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,730
She's gone.

297
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,340
She has light footsteps
and agile movements.

298
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,370
Even we lost track of her.

299
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:32,650
Cai Yi is truly no ordinary person.

300
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:34,160
Cai Yi?

301
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:35,800
You mean my sister-in-law?

302
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,010
Yes. That's right.

303
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,890
Even if it's really her,

304
00:20:41,170 --> 00:20:42,970
Jinyuan is just a weak scholar.

305
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,770
How could he escape her

306
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:45,920
if she really intended to harm him?

307
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,010
Besides, have you ever seen
such a devoted demon?

308
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,210
Of course, I have.

309
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,650
The toad demon in the Toad Valley.

310
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,850
Monsters are even scarier
when they're devoted.

311
00:20:53,130 --> 00:20:53,970
Anyway, I don't believe it.

312
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,400
Let's just follow up and see.

313
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:57,940
No matter what,

314
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,440
I won't let a demon harm Scholar.

315
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,460
Wait for me!

316
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,160
What's that thing?

317
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:23,890
Be careful. It seems like a spider.

318
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,160
Yueru, Mr. Li,

319
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,090
what are you doing here?

320
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,680
Mrs. Cai,

321
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,400
it really is you.

322
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:38,780
Mrs. Scholar,

323
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,040
why are you out alone picking herbs
so late at night?

324
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,010
It's dangerous in the woods
at this time of night.

325
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:47,250
Mrs. Cai, didn't I tell you last time

326
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,190
that I would accompany you?

327
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:52,940
The medicine Jinyuan needs

328
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,610
includes some fresh herbs

329
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:55,800
that we ran out of at home.

330
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:58,200
I couldn't delay his medicine
for tomorrow,

331
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,770
so I came out tonight to look for them.

332
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,200
Do you still need our help?

333
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:04,580
No need.

334
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,770
I've found everything.

335
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,400
Don't be afraid to trouble us.

336
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,680
Those are certainly not enough.
Let us help you gather more.

337
00:22:09,890 --> 00:22:12,040
Mr. Li, it's not necessary.

338
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:15,530
It's late,

339
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:17,440
and there are many poisonous creatures
in these woods.

340
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,940
Let's head back

341
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,680
so as not to worry Jinyuan.

342
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,160
Then let's all walk back together.

343
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,250
It's so late at night,
yet you're not resting.

344
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:53,370
Where are you going?

345
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,850
Tang Yu,

346
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,800
where were you just now?

347
00:22:57,740 --> 00:22:58,580
I...

348
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,160
Who are you?

349
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,890
I'm sorry, Tang Yu.

350
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,440
I promise this is the last time
I make wild guesses.

351
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,370
Tang Yu,

352
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,200
you're back.

353
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,400
Greetings, Chief.

354
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,650
I acknowledge my fault.

355
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,650
Please punish me as you see fit.

356
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,130
You came for her, didn't you?

357
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,320
Chief,

358
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,800
please spare A'nu and their lives.

359
00:25:50,290 --> 00:25:51,850
During the fight at Yunmeng Marsh,

360
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:55,090
I could have taken everyone's life,

361
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,370
but I showed mercy.

362
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:04,440
That was because of you.

363
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:07,160
Because you were there.

364
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,850
Do you understand?

365
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,970
Chief, if you promise not to harm them,

366
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:17,460
I'm willing

367
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,200
to die for it.

368
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,920
If they stop being stubborn,

369
00:26:32,770 --> 00:26:34,520
I can agree to your request.

370
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:40,370
Thank you, Chief.

371
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,730
Get up.

372
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:04,320
Golden Silkworm Venom.

373
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:26,220
(Lizhao Residence)

374
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,060
Honey.

375
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,650
Where were you going so late at night?

376
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,200
I saw that we were running low on herbs,

377
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:39,090
so I went to the forest behind the house
to pick some fresh herbs.

378
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:41,920
I happened to meet Yueru
and Mr. Li there.

379
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:43,850
I'm sorry, Honey,

380
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,130
for making you worry.

381
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,700
Jinyuan, we're here.

382
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,770
She won't be in any trouble.

383
00:27:51,340 --> 00:27:52,800
Then please sit.

384
00:27:53,050 --> 00:27:54,620
I'll go prepare some snacks.

385
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,460
Sure.

386
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,460
Have a seat.

387
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:15,890
What's wrong?

388
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:17,890
Scholar,

389
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:21,560
since you married Miss Cai Yi,

390
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:24,490
have you noticed anything unusual?

391
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,060
No.

392
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,920
Why do you ask, Li?

393
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:35,890
I just find it strange.

394
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:40,370
Miss Cai Yi seems not as simple

395
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:44,130
as she appears.

396
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,490
What do you mean

397
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,560
by that, Li?

398
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:58,250
He's implying

399
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,560
that Cai Yi is a demon.

400
00:29:03,290 --> 00:29:04,730
I didn't believe it at first,

401
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,560
but after observing her
secretly with him,

402
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:10,370
she does seem suspicious.

403
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,200
So you followed Cai Yi?

404
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:23,010
Yes.

405
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:25,280
There's no smoke without fire.

406
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,730
I've been with Cai Yi day and night,

407
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:31,850
and I know better than anyone
what kind of person she is.

408
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:34,920
You don't need to say anymore.

409
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,770
I trust Cai Yi.

410
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,890
Scholar, how can you be fooled by her?

411
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,770
A frail woman like her went out
in the middle of the night,

412
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,530
and even we couldn't keep up.
Isn't that suspicious?

413
00:29:42,530 --> 00:29:43,890
Seeing is not always believing.

414
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:45,280
Just leave it be.

415
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,700
Scholar,

416
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:47,860
do you know something?

417
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,250
I told you to leave it be!

418
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,210
Li Xiaoyao!

419
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,340
Li Xiaoyao!

420
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,010
Li Xiaoyao!

421
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,820
Li Xiaoyao!

422
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,820
Leave me alone.

423
00:30:21,010 --> 00:30:21,920
What are you going to do?

424
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,400
I'm going to sleep.

425
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,150
You're going to leave Jinyuan like that?

426
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,790
He told me not to bother
with his affairs, didn't he?

427
00:30:26,870 --> 00:30:27,610
Keep it down.

428
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,010
Why should I worry needlessly?

429
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:31,700
Right.

430
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,940
Since Jinyuan is so clever,

431
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,090
we don't need to worry about him.

432
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,950
Aren't you afraid that he has fallen

433
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,130
for the demon's beauty trap?

434
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,010
I knew you wouldn't leave him like that.

435
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,250
But he's clearly biased
towards Cai Yi now.

436
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,490
What can we do?

437
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,800
A fox will eventually show its tail.

438
00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:51,370
I'll keep following her.

439
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,610
I just don't believe it.

440
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,280
Honey, it's time for your medicine.

441
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,420
Oh no!

442
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:02,890
Jinyuan, you can't drink this!

443
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:04,590
Scholar, there's something wrong
with this medicine.

444
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,010
It is poisoned!

445
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,460
No.

446
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,340
It's not what you think.

447
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,890
Caught red-handed
and still trying to argue?

448
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:21,900
I've suspected you weren't human
for a long time.

449
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,800
We just happened to see your true form.

450
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,800
You are a spider demon.

451
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,370
Am I right?

452
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,520
- Li...
- No, I'm not.

453
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:31,040
It's not what you think.

454
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:33,980
- Jinyuan!
- Honey!

455
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,820
- Scholar!
- How are you?

456
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,680
- Jinyuan, are you alright?
- It's not me.

457
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,490
Jinyuan.

458
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,210
It's not me.

459
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,650
- Don't think of escaping.
- Jinyuan!

460
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,460
Jinyuan!

461
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:07,970
Tang Yu,

462
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:10,010
the Golden Silkworm Venom in you

463
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:11,200
has been removed by Chief.

464
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,090
Thank you, Chief,
for saving my life once again.

465
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,920
I will brave any danger

466
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:23,370
in return.

467
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,250
Tang Yu,

468
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:29,650
I adopted you.

469
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:31,970
I know

470
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,250
that girl is waiting for you.

471
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,850
Go find her.

472
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,850
Thank you, Chief.

473
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,320
Tang Yu,

474
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,680
if you had to choose someone to die

475
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,850
between them and me,

476
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,890
tell me,

477
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:20,800
how would you choose?

478
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:38,130
I don't need your answer now,

479
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,920
but you must understand

480
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,160
that the hardest

481
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:49,680
and most necessary thing
to do in your life

482
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,610
is to make decisions.

483
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:01,520
Go.

484
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:07,820
Yes.

485
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,850
Chief, Tang Yu is clearly wavering.

486
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:23,370
Why do you still treat him so kindly?

487
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,650
If the most precious thing in the world

488
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:32,960
is affection,

489
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:38,000
then naturally,
it is also the best weapon.

490
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,250
Yes.

491
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,010
No.

492
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,140
Yes.

493
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,300
No.

494
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:25,650
Yes. No.

495
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,490
Yes.

496
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,140
No.

497
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,650
He couldn't possibly be.

498
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,540
Master,

499
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,960
do you know where Tang Yu is?

500
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:16,480
What's wrong with Tang Yu?

501
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:24,960
He deceived me!

502
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,980
Tang Yu lost his vital blood

503
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:36,210
to the Golden Silkworm King to save you.

504
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,090
Physician Xue,

505
00:37:09,890 --> 00:37:11,210
what do you mean?

506
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:13,800
Prepare for the worst.

507
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:15,730
Wait.

508
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:22,480
How did it become
so serious all of a sudden?

509
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:24,480
From the current pulse,

510
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:27,280
he has at least two types
of demonic poison in his body,

511
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:29,320
and they are antagonistic,

512
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:32,450
constantly draining his vitality.

513
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:34,060
Now,

514
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,520
his vital energy is nearly depleted,

515
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:40,040
and he's beyond saving.

516
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,410
It can't be.

517
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,040
Uncle Xue, Physician Xue,

518
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,280
please think of something else.

519
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,280
Jinyuan...

520
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:52,610
Jinyuan can't die.

521
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:57,760
At least,

522
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:00,280
let him go

523
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,090
without so much pain.

524
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,370
Yueru.

525
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,930
Yueru.

526
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,610
Yueru.

527
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:32,100
Jinyuan,

528
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:33,760
Physician Xue just left.

529
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,240
He said he's found a way to detoxify.

530
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,170
Yueru,

531
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,170
take it out.

532
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,410
Take out what?

533
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,520
The medicine Physician Xue gave you.

534
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,620
Jinyuan,

535
00:38:57,810 --> 00:38:59,000
did you hear all that?

536
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,090
Don't believe what he said.

537
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:05,130
Besides this physician,

538
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,060
there are great physicians.

539
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:09,930
I can find them all for you.

540
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:12,320
Yueru, don't cry.

541
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,000
I understand my condition.

542
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,130
I'm just lingering on the brink.

543
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,130
Everyone dies.

544
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,480
I'm not afraid of death.

545
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,560
It's just a pity

546
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,090
that I won't see you get married.

547
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,560
It's a pity

548
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,450
I have to leave

549
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,520
when I shouldn't.

550
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,610
Jinyuan, don't talk like that.

551
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,760
You'll get better.

552
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,060
Yueru,

553
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,890
give me the medicine.

554
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:59,850
Let me go quicker.

555
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:00,930
No!

556
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:03,000
Yueru!

557
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,340
Li Xiaoyao,

558
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:07,800
Jinyuan...

559
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,620
Scholar,

560
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:11,970
how are you?

561
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:14,090
Is Cai Yi alright?

562
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:16,800
You didn't hurt her, did you?

563
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:18,410
At this time,

564
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,850
you still have the energy
to care about her?

565
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,000
She didn't harm me.

566
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,760
But Physician Xue said you were poisoned
by demonic toxins.

567
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,760
If not from Cai Yi,

568
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:33,610
where would the poison come from?

569
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,130
I trust Cai Yi.

570
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:38,690
She wouldn't harm me.

571
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:41,010
Scholar,

572
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,480
did you already know
something was wrong with her?

573
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:54,000
Why do you still defend her so much?

574
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,320
Cai Yi...

575
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,760
She's my wife.

576
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:04,720
What kind of wife is she?

577
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,480
She's clearly a demon.

578
00:41:08,410 --> 00:41:09,320
No.

579
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:15,650
When I was gravely ill,

580
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,240
she cared for me

581
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,800
without concern for propriety,

582
00:41:23,650 --> 00:41:24,490
without complaint

583
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,540
or anger,

584
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,800
never abandoning me.

585
00:41:31,610 --> 00:41:33,000
With a wife like this,

586
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:36,850
what more could I ask for?

587
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:40,250
Don't worry.

588
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:42,410
I will save you.

589
00:41:43,020 --> 00:41:43,890
Li,

590
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:45,690
Yueru,

591
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,130
listen to me.

592
00:41:49,090 --> 00:41:50,410
What's done is done.

593
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,760
Let's not pursue this matter further.

594
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:54,900
No.

595
00:41:55,890 --> 00:41:57,370
If she was the one who poisoned you,

596
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,610
she must also have an antidote.

597
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,090
Jinyuan, rest assured.

598
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,500
Li Xiaoyao and I

599
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,000
will definitely find a way to save you.

600
00:42:04,570 --> 00:42:05,480
Yueru...

601
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,690
I know where she is.

602
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,090
Jinyuan, wait for us to return.

603
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,210
Don't!

604
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:20,650
Don't!

605
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:22,210
Li!

606
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,900
Li!

607
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,000
We've searched everywhere.
There's no sign of Cai Yi.

608
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:38,130
This was where we encountered her before.

609
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,370
Her lair must be around here.
Let's search again.

610
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,580
