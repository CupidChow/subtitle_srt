2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,810
Greetings, Your Majesty.

4
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,490
- Rise.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

5
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:59,770
Bai Yue, what is this all about?

6
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,570
Please forgive my presumption,
Your Majesty.

7
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,360
I have advised you several times

8
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:07,250
about the Witch Queen.

9
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,840
Today, I had to bring the people

10
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,810
into the palace

11
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:13,970
to let you hear the voice of the people.

12
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:25,050
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

13
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,050
Bai Yue,

14
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,170
I do not believe the rumors
that the Witch Queen is a demon.

15
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,120
Do not bring this up again.

16
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,220
Your Majesty,

17
00:02:38,690 --> 00:02:40,920
today I performed a ritual.

18
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:43,170
Our ancestor's spirit appeared

19
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,560
and told us

20
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:48,000
that the floods in Nanzhao
are caused by a snake demon,

21
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,050
and that snake demon

22
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,530
is the Witch Queen.

23
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,530
I am not lying.

24
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:58,690
Everyone present
saw it with their own eyes.

25
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:00,920
- We saw it.
- Yes, we all saw it.

26
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,210
- The Witch Queen is a demon.
- Yes, she is.

27
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:03,410
She is a demoness!

28
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,410
Your Majesty,

29
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,940
the idea

30
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,520
of the Witch Queen being
a snake demon is absurd.

31
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,460
The Witch Queen is the Sacred Lady
of our Witch Moon Sect.

32
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:10,890
She can't be a demon.

33
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:12,820
Please discern loyalty and truth,

34
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,720
and do not let villains
spew nonsense here.

35
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,810
- Bai Yue!
- Mr. Shi.

36
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,860
Bai Yue,

37
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:23,050
what is this?

38
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:26,360
Please, Your Majesty, punish me.

39
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,100
If it could save Nanzhao

40
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,720
and the people from flooding,

41
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:35,330
I am willing to give my life.

42
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:40,970
Please, Your Majesty,

43
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:44,560
depose the Witch Queen,
eliminate the demon,

44
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,560
and save Nanzhao.

45
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,740
Your Majesty,

46
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,970
please decide now.

47
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,970
What do you all think?

48
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,090
Shouldn't the King decide now?

49
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,380
This...

50
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:06,890
Speak!

51
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:12,250
Your Majesty, please decide now.

52
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,410
This...

53
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:27,710
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

54
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,130
Your Majesty.

55
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,700
Your Majesty,

56
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:49,040
I am not a demon.

57
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:50,610
Qing'er,

58
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,850
I believe you.

59
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,760
You keep saying you are not a demon.

60
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,700
In front of the King
and all the officials,

61
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,290
you should answer truthfully.

62
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,640
What do you really look like?

63
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:05,640
Are you half-human, half-snake?

64
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,290
Yes or no?

65
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:20,730
Yes.

66
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,130
Your Majesty,

67
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,730
I am indeed different
from ordinary people,

68
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:41,760
as I am a descendant of Nuwa.

69
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,690
I am not a snake demon.

70
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,010
The floods in Nanzhao
are not caused by me.

71
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:50,810
But before this,

72
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:54,320
the Witch Queen never mentioned
she was a descendant of Nuwa.

73
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,770
This is clearly deceiving the King

74
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,160
and the people.

75
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,260
Your Majesty,

76
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,570
do not trust the words of a demoness.

77
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,290
Your Majesty, please

78
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,600
decide now.

79
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:10,730
Your Majesty, please decide now.

80
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:14,440
Your Majesty, please decide now.

81
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,050
In my opinion,

82
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,100
the union of the Witch Queen
and the Witch King

83
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,600
is part of
the Witch Moon Sect's sinister plan

84
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,690
to control Nanzhao.

85
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
That's not necessarily true.

86
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,140
For hundreds of years,

87
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:27,860
the Witch Moon Sect and the Moon Worship Sect
have been at odds.

88
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:30,480
The Witch Queen
might have been wrongly accused.

89
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:31,610
Right?

90
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:34,860
Exactly, young man.
You are very sensible.

91
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:35,700
Of course.

92
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,380
Who are you?

93
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:44,730
Looks quite good.

94
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,290
This smell is too foul.

95
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,440
Don't fuss over this.
Let's hurry and leave.

96
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:52,940
Go, go, go!

97
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,380
Depose the Witch Queen!
Eliminate the demon!

98
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
Depose the Witch Queen!

99
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,450
- Father, Mother.
- Eliminate the demon! Depose the Witch Queen!

100
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,810
- Eliminate the demon!
- Ling'er.

101
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,600
Are you alright?

102
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:16,320
Father, why are you
treating Mother this way?

103
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,890
Ling'er, let me explain.

104
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:19,730
Father,

105
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,420
my mother is not a demon.

106
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:23,730
I don't believe it,
and you shouldn't either.

107
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,500
They...

108
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,410
They are all bad people,

109
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:28,970
all wanting to harm my mother.

110
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,130
Ling'er,

111
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,920
your father does not believe them,

112
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,480
and I will be fine.

113
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:39,640
Go to the harem
and find your grandmother.

114
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,530
I'm not going anywhere.

115
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,320
I want to stay with you.

116
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,040
I want to protect you.

117
00:07:45,700 --> 00:08:08,540
Depose the Witch Queen!
Eliminate the demon!

118
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,040
- Your Majesty.
- Depose the Witch Queen! Eliminate the demon!

119
00:08:11,490 --> 00:08:12,690
Please make a decision.

120
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,320
Depose the Witch Queen!
Eliminate the demon!

121
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:21,130
Someone,

122
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,010
take the Witch Queen to the dungeon.

123
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,360
Your Majesty, how can a mere dungeon

124
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,410
hold a demoness?

125
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:34,940
The demoness
should be executed immediately.

126
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:41,290
Depose the Witch Queen!
Eliminate the demon!

127
00:08:41,290 --> 00:08:43,640
By my command, lock up the Witch Queen.

128
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,490
I respectfully obey
Your Majesty's command.

129
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,640
I respectfully obey
Your Majesty's command.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,530
Bai Yue, any objections?

131
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:04,570
I

132
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:07,450
obey the command.

133
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,540
Someone!

134
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,780
Here!

135
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,680
Father, don't!

136
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:22,530
Mother, don't!

137
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,240
Mother, don't go!

138
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,330
Mr. Shi,

139
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,800
escort the Princess back to her palace.

140
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,220
Yes.

141
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,660
Your Highness,

142
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,970
please come with me.

143
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:39,740
I don't want to.

144
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,220
Ling'er.

145
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,000
I won't.

146
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:48,170
Ling'er, be good.

147
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,140
I won't listen.

148
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:52,530
- I want to stay with you.
- Mr. Shi,

149
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,780
please take care of her.

150
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,220
I...

151
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,440
I don't want to.
I just want to stay with you.

152
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,130
- Let's go.
- Your Highness, hurry up.

153
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:05,000
- Hurry up.
- Mother!

154
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,530
Mother!

155
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,000
Don't!

156
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,680
Mother!

157
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,320
Don't! Don't!

158
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:21,440
Mother!

159
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:25,170
Mother!

160
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,620
Let's go.

161
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:26,420
(Cangling Gate)

162
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,200
Very spirited.

163
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:37,090
Walk this way, this way.

164
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,640
Hurry. The Witch King has
summoned us to the grand hall.

165
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:45,220
Let's go.

166
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:57,070
Just now in the grand hall,
these two ministers

167
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,790
merely rebutted
the Chief of the Moon Worship Sect

168
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:00,760
and he killed them
right in front of the Witch King.

169
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,640
The other ministers
dared not say a word.

170
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:05,170
In my opinion, Chief is quite popular
with the people.

171
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:06,260
Not just these ministers,

172
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,000
but even the Witch King
has to give him some respect.

173
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,780
The Witch Queen is so beautiful.

174
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,970
I didn't expect her to be a demoness.

175
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,970
Now that the Witch King
has imprisoned her,

176
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,240
it seems like the floods
will soon recede.

177
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,930
Hopefully, that's the case.

178
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:22,460
- Sorry.
- You two, watch where you're going.

179
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,560
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

180
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,940
What are you doing?

181
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,800
Exactly.

182
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:36,090
They say the Witch Queen
has been imprisoned.

183
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:37,440
I'm going to find the Witch Queen now.

184
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:43,680
I feel the Imperial Palace
is heavily laden with demonic energy,

185
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:46,680
but it seems not
to originate from the dungeon.

186
00:12:48,050 --> 00:12:51,640
Could it be that the Witch Queen
has really been framed?

187
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:54,660
Here's what we'll do.

188
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,090
You go to the dungeon,

189
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,800
and I'll check out
the location of the demon.

190
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,610
This outfit really stinks.

191
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:03,450
I have to take it off.

192
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:30,570
Your Highness.

193
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:37,530
You are...

194
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,540
I...

195
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,440
I'm an old acquaintance of Li Sansi.

196
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,560
I'm here to save you.

197
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,170
Li Sansi?

198
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,970
I heard that Li Sansi and his wife
came to Nanzhao not long ago.

199
00:13:55,490 --> 00:13:57,560
I specifically came to inquire
about their whereabouts.

200
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,290
You bear such a resemblance to him.

201
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:11,290
Please tell me

202
00:14:11,290 --> 00:14:12,560
what happened to Li Sansi and his wife.

203
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,640
It's my fault.

204
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:22,490
What?

205
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,850
The demonic presence is so strong.

206
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,880
It seems the demon is hiding here.

207
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,850
Demon!

208
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,560
Months ago,

209
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:16,120
I met Li Sansi and his wife
sneaking into the Imperial Palace.

210
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,200
They came looking for
the poisonous dragon's gall

211
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,560
to cure the severely poisoned constable,

212
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:23,970
Huangfu Ying.

213
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,810
What happened next?

214
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:31,410
At that time, Bai Yue was searching everywhere
for the Five Spiritual Beads,

215
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,220
intending to use their power
to control the demon

216
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,320
and conquer the world.

217
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,320
I didn't want him to succeed,

218
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,240
so I gave my Water Spiritual Bead

219
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:42,290
to Li Sansi and his wife.

220
00:15:43,490 --> 00:15:45,200
Then why is it rumored everywhere

221
00:15:45,410 --> 00:15:47,370
that the Lis
stole the Water Spiritual Bead?

222
00:15:48,850 --> 00:15:50,490
After they left,

223
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,410
Bai Yue spread the news

224
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:54,410
that they sneaked
into the Imperial Palace

225
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,800
and stole Nanzhao's treasure,
the Water Spiritual Bead,

226
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,730
bringing floods to Nanzhao,

227
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:01,530
and petitioned the Witch King
to pursue and capture them relentlessly.

228
00:16:05,170 --> 00:16:06,290
Were they then

229
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,200
killed by the Shadowless Poison?

230
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:15,680
Your Highness,

231
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,180
I wish to know

232
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,050
if the Shadowless Poison

233
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,050
could only be made by you.

234
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:24,560
The Shadowless Poison

235
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,000
was indeed my unique creation.

236
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,850
But it was later stolen.

237
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:35,050
Only after learning that Mr. and Mrs. Li
were poisoned by Shadowless Poison

238
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:35,970
did I realize

239
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,530
it was Bai Yue's plan
to kill two birds with one stone.

240
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:44,120
I also secretly investigated,

241
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,170
but afterward,
there was no further news of them.

242
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,270
The whereabouts
of the Water Spiritual Bead

243
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,240
are also unknown.

244
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,050
It seems

245
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,120
they might still be alive.

246
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:00,640
Why didn't you
reveal everything at that time?

247
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,560
Bai Yue has been plotting for years,

248
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,680
well-entrenched
in Nanzhao's court and society.

249
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,200
Even if I told the truth,

250
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,850
no one would believe me.

251
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,040
It was my fault.

252
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,090
My selfishness

253
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:22,520
implicated them.

254
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,560
They are not thieves.

255
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,730
They are not thieves.

256
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:40,890
Sir,

257
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,850
Li Sansi and his wife
are benefactors to me

258
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,680
and to Nanzhao.

259
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,370
If you can find them,

260
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,610
please convey my apologies to them.

261
00:18:00,410 --> 00:18:01,440
They are heroes.

262
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,370
Yes.

263
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,770
They are true heroes.

264
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:16,340
Sir,

265
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,520
I have an unreasonable request,

266
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,160
and I hope you will grant it.

267
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,940
Your Highness, please get up.

268
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,130
I, Li Xiaoyao, will surely help you.

269
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,890
What did you say your name was?

270
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,770
Little demon,

271
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,490
quite impressive.

272
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:43,250
It seems you are not ordinary.

273
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:44,970
No.

274
00:18:45,290 --> 00:18:46,770
I need to find a way.

275
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,090
I am Li Xiaoyao.

276
00:18:58,460 --> 00:18:59,300
Li Sansi

277
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:01,730
is my father.

278
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,440
The Lis told me

279
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,400
they have a son named Li Xiaoyao,

280
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,920
but he's about nine years old.

281
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,340
Well...

282
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,010
This is a long story.

283
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:21,730
I can only tell you

284
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,610
that it was Goddess Nuwa
who guided me here.

285
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:28,440
I will explain the details to you later.

286
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,610
Let's get out of here first.

287
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:32,200
Whether I leave now or not
isn't important.

288
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,040
What's most important now

289
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,730
is that I have a favor

290
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:37,650
to ask of you.

291
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,010
Your Highness, please tell me.

292
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,320
It concerns my daughter.

293
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,650
I ask you to save her.

294
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,730
Goddess Nuwa sent me
back to the world ten years ago,

295
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,680
perhaps because she wanted me
to change Ling'er's fate

296
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:56,320
so she could escape the destiny
of a Nuwa descendant.

297
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,820
Mr. Li,

298
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,340
right now,

299
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:01,280
no one can protect Ling'er.

300
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,490
If she

301
00:20:04,530 --> 00:20:05,560
stays in Nanzhao,

302
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,040
I fear Bai Yue

303
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,280
will harm her.

304
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,250
Your Majesty, rest assured.

305
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:13,370
I will do everything in my power
to ensure the Princess's safety

306
00:20:13,370 --> 00:20:14,800
and prevent any harm
from coming to her.

307
00:20:15,890 --> 00:20:16,970
I'll take you both out of here.

308
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,060
No.

309
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,650
My escape

310
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:21,920
is exactly what Bai Yue wants

311
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,280
and turns me
into the so-called traitorous demoness

312
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:26,320
they claim I am.

313
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,370
Bai Yue is prudent,

314
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:31,920
cunning,

315
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,680
and most importantly, ambitious.

316
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,920
I cannot leave Nanzhao
at this critical time,

317
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,320
or the nation

318
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:43,820
might face great peril.

319
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,130
They have already abandoned you,

320
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,280
yet you still think of them.

321
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,280
Perhaps this is our destiny.

322
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:56,580
There's a demon! A demon!

323
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:59,160
A demon! There's a demon!

324
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,660
What demon are you talking about?

325
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:02,740
It's the demon that's been
causing chaos in Nanzhao.

326
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:06,680
The one in the water deep in the dungeon.

327
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,300
Oh, no.

328
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,500
It's the Water Demon Beast.

329
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,890
Water Demon Beast?

330
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,580
The demon I met just now.

331
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,320
The Water Demon Beast
is a beast from ancient times,

332
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:23,090
sealed by the Goddess Nuwa.

333
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,250
It can summon floods

334
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,530
and control minds,

335
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,490
a power beyond ordinary humans.

336
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,130
Only descendants of Nuwa
can seal it again.

337
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:32,130
I'm heading to the dungeon now

338
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,770
to calm the Water Demon Beast.

339
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:35,680
My Heavenly Snake Cane
is still in the Imperial Palace.

340
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,520
Please fetch it for me.

341
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,220
I'll go. I'll go.

342
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:41,920
If you meet Mr. Shi

343
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,250
guarding the inner palace, tell him

344
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,620
that Qing'er has come
to pick a lotus flower.

345
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,280
Okay, okay.

346
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,130
Show Ling'er this,

347
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:56,920
and she will go with you.

348
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:36,250
Ling'er.

349
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:43,180
You're bad.

350
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:44,680
- Don't come any closer!
- Ling'er...

351
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:50,610
Your Highness,

352
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,780
rest assured.

353
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:53,850
I'm not a bad person.

354
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,440
- I am...
- You're all bad people!

355
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,700
You're bad!

356
00:22:57,050 --> 00:22:58,500
You all want to harm my mother!

357
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,850
Your Highness, listen to me.

358
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,980
It was your mother
who sent me to get you out.

359
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,130
Liar! The people who just took me out

360
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,130
said the same.

361
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:07,420
But...

362
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:08,890
You're all bad people!

363
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:10,740
- Bad people!
- Okay, okay.

364
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,580
Go!

365
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,530
- You go!
- I'll keep my distance.

366
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,370
Don't be nervous.

367
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,580
Grandmother.

368
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:17,850
Grandmother?

369
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,420
Grandmother,

370
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:24,390
Bai Yue has revived the Water Demon Beast,
wreaking havoc on Nanzhao.

371
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,730
To ensure the Princess's safety,

372
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,220
I am tasked by the Witch Queen

373
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,280
to take the Princess away.

374
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:34,800
Her Highness said,

375
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:36,770
if you see this hairpin,

376
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,280
you'll understand.

377
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:53,890
Okay.

378
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,440
We'll go with you.

379
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,300
Your Highness,

380
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,560
let's go.

381
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:09,200
Grandma, are we going to see Mother?

382
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:13,540
Your Highness,

383
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,340
we are...

384
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,320
That is right.

385
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,040
We are going to see your mother.

386
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:23,850
Alright.

387
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:26,130
Then let's hurry.

388
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,160
I miss my mother so much.

389
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:30,210
Good.

390
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,660
Let's go.

391
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,520
Order from the Chief!

392
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,130
Capture the Princess alive

393
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,130
to force the demon queen to comply.

394
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,100
Quickly! Hurry!

395
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,530
- Order from the Chief!
- Hurry up!

396
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:03,620
- Sir, where is my mother?
- Capture the Princess alive!

397
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,680
Your Highness, rest assured.
I will make sure you see your mother.

398
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,300
Quickly! Hurry!

399
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,420
Look over there!

400
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,160
Order from the Chief!

401
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,440
- Capture the Princess!
- Hurry!

402
00:25:15,170 --> 00:25:16,010
Hurry!

403
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:37,890
Stop! Who are you?

404
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:38,890
Chase them!

405
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:43,560
Catch them!

406
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,340
Grandma!

407
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,130
Hurry! Get them!

408
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:00,530
Get on the phoenix!

409
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:01,800
- Get on the phoenix now!
- Hurry!

410
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,460
Grandma,

411
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:44,280
I don't want to leave Nanzhao.

412
00:26:45,130 --> 00:26:46,410
I want my mother.

413
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,800
It's okay, Your Highness.

414
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,850
I'm here. It's okay.

415
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,370
Sir, where are we going?

416
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,920
We need to leave Nanzhao.

417
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,090
The further, the better.

418
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,040
I don't want to leave Nanzhao.

419
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,400
I want my mother.

420
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,560
Grandma.

421
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,090
Your Highness, don't be afraid.

422
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,010
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

423
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:08,890
Sir,

424
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,560
didn't you say you were taking me
to see my mother?

425
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:13,650
Where is she?

426
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,460
I...

427
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,540
Your Highness...

428
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:07,090
What's that?

429
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,060
That's...

430
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:11,700
That's...

431
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:15,970
That's a huge firework.

432
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:19,820
Ling'er,

433
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,780
listen to me,

434
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,610
this phoenix was sent by your mother
to pick you up.

435
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,730
She said it would take you
to a place first,

436
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:27,940
and she would come

437
00:28:28,370 --> 00:28:29,680
to find you very soon.

438
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,010
Really?

439
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,340
Yes.

440
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,090
Your Highness,

441
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,650
it's true.

442
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,730
Rest assured. No matter what,

443
00:28:42,050 --> 00:28:44,250
I will always be by your side.

444
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:53,130
Ling'er,

445
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,370
she also told me to tell you

446
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,730
not to cry

447
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:00,040
when she's not around.

448
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,490
Be happy,

449
00:29:02,370 --> 00:29:03,520
or she'll be sad too.

450
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,820
Okay.

451
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,560
I won't cry.

452
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,400
I'll listen to Mother.

453
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,370
I don't want her to be sad.

454
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:19,060
No.

455
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:28,250
I don't know where the Witch Queen

456
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:29,890
wants this phoenix to take them.

457
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,010
Although I don't know where it goes,

458
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:37,010
there's one place it definitely can't go.

459
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,090
Quick, quick!

460
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:51,530
Hurry! Hurry!

461
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:52,370
Grandma.

462
00:29:58,370 --> 00:29:59,530
Let's go. Let's go.

463
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,920
- Go.
- I'm okay.

464
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:03,440
Grandma, you'll be okay.

465
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,380
(Shanshen Temple)
Grandma.

466
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:11,220
(Shanshen Temple)

467
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:18,890
Come in, come in.

468
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,090
- Over there.
- This way.

469
00:30:22,770 --> 00:30:24,520
Slow down, slow down.

470
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:29,100
You're bleeding nonstop.

471
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:31,560
I'll go find some hemostatic herbs,
and be right back.

472
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:32,730
Thank you.

473
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,010
Sir,

474
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,800
I don't know what to call you.

475
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,850
I am...

476
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,250
I'm Li Xiaoyao.

477
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:53,940
Good.

478
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:56,130
Good.

479
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:00,320
Thank you, Xiaoyao.

480
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:06,890
You're welcome.

481
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:09,890
Ling'er.

482
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,250
Grandma.

483
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,320
I'm fine.

484
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,820
Ling'er.

485
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:28,920
Ling'er, don't cry.

486
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,320
I'll make something for you.

487
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,580
Cherry candy.

488
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:49,490
Thank you, Xiaoyao.

489
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:19,730
Xiaoyao.

490
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,490
(When Ling'er was on Fairy Island,)

491
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,130
(the cherry candy she recognized)

492
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,320
(was indeed given by me.)

493
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,680
This is...

494
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,130
Thank you.

495
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,920
Sir, what was that seal just now?

496
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,730
What you saw

497
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:55,650
was the sealing technique

498
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,280
left by the descendants
of Goddess Nuwa.

499
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,890
The Witch Queen

500
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,920
used her life

501
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,920
to suppress the Water Demon Beast.

502
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,330
Could it be
that the descendants of Nuwa

503
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:17,040
really cannot escape their fate?

504
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,460
Ling'er...

505
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,460
What about Ling'er?

506
00:33:22,290 --> 00:33:23,200
I promised her

507
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:24,800
I would take her to see her mother,

508
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,060
but now...

509
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:27,210
Xiaoyao.

510
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,040
Xiaoyao,

511
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:30,770
Grandma is asking for you.

512
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,660
Okay.

513
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:35,700
Okay.

514
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:37,440
You go in first.

515
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,850
I'll check if anyone followed us.

516
00:33:51,050 --> 00:33:52,160
Mr. Li,

517
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,280
thank you for your rescue.

518
00:33:57,010 --> 00:33:59,680
Please do me a favor.

519
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:03,950
Grandmother, please tell me.

520
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:22,720
You take this handkerchief

521
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,170
to the riverbank.

522
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,930
If someone recognizes it,

523
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:31,760
tell her

524
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,090
I'm bringing Qing'er...

525
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,930
I'm bringing Qing'er's daughter

526
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:39,960
to meet Lady Lingyue.

527
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:41,720
Lady Lingyue?

528
00:34:50,130 --> 00:34:50,970
The Water Moon Palace.

529
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,520
Mr. Li,

530
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:56,370
you know the Water Moon Palace?

531
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,720
I've heard of it.

532
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,300
But what if

533
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,650
I can't find Lady Lingyue?

534
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:21,040
Mr. Li, don't worry.

535
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,760
This handkerchief

536
00:35:23,570 --> 00:35:25,760
is marked by Lady Lingyue.

537
00:35:26,370 --> 00:35:28,000
As long as it's near a waterway,

538
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:31,370
Lady Lingyue will sense it.

539
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,330
It really is you, Xiaoyao.

540
00:36:29,330 --> 00:36:33,090
It's time to fulfill the promise
you made to the Princess back then.

541
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,900
Ling'er!

542
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,410
Grandma.

543
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,800
Grandma!

544
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,280
If I deliver this handkerchief

545
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,760
to Lady Lingyue,

546
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,130
then Ling'er and Grandmother

547
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:48,280
will surely go with Lady Lingyue
to Fairy Island.

548
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
No.

549
00:36:53,350 --> 00:36:55,290
I've already missed one opportunity
to save the Witch Queen.

550
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,930
I can't let Ling'er go
to Fairy Island this time.

551
00:36:58,330 --> 00:36:59,690
I can't let the tragedy happen again.

552
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:46,650
How can there be a handkerchief?

553
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,460
(Li Xiaoyao, nine years old)

554
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,690
This handkerchief is quite pretty.

555
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,690
Auntie would surely like it.

556
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,500
Next time she beats me,

557
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,610
I'll give this to her,

558
00:38:02,850 --> 00:38:04,320
and she surely won't hit me anymore.

559
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,940
Uncle Zhang, give me a fish.

560
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:13,780
Xiaoyao,

561
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:15,850
look at what time it is.

562
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:17,170
They've all been sold out.

563
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,760
Really?

564
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:22,450
Auntie is going to beat me again.

565
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:24,090
Uncle Zhang, please look again.

566
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:25,240
Even a small one will do.

567
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:30,130
You go ask him.

568
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,690
He's been fishing all day.

569
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,210
Though the fish aren't big,

570
00:38:33,370 --> 00:38:34,560
they're enough

571
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,720
to save your bottom.

572
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:36,780
Go on.

573
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,380
Uncle,

574
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,280
could you sell me one of your fish?

575
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,520
My fish are not for sale,

576
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,730
only for trade.

577
00:38:54,650 --> 00:38:55,980
Let's see what you have

578
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:58,760
that might trade for my fish.

579
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:02,690
My treasure is in a far, far away place.

580
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,650
How about this handkerchief?

581
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:22,580
Does it work?

582
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:25,580
Okay.

583
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,130
I really like this handkerchief.

584
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:29,130
I'll trade a fish for it.

585
00:39:33,850 --> 00:39:34,690
Here you go.

586
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,210
Little kid,

587
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,380
tell me.

588
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:43,410
Where did you get this handkerchief?

589
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:48,300
You little devil.

590
00:39:48,890 --> 00:39:49,930
I'll give you another one.

591
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,450
I found it in the woods
next to the Shanshen Temple.

592
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:03,650
I see.

593
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,760
Little kid, you better go home.

594
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,410
Mr. Li,

595
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,040
you came back so soon?

596
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:54,820
Grandmother,

597
00:40:55,740 --> 00:40:56,580
I'm sorry.

598
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,800
I threw away

599
00:40:59,650 --> 00:41:01,040
- that handkerchief.
- What...

600
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:03,890
What did you say?

601
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:06,450
I did it for Ling'er's good.

602
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,010
Mr. Li,

603
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:10,980
I don't understand what you mean.

604
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,130
You can't go to the Water Moon Palace,

605
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:13,190
and you can't go to Fairy Island,

606
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,020
because it's not good for Ling'er,

607
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,520
you, and the Water Moon Palace.

608
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:20,610
Mr. Li,

609
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:22,930
how do you know?

610
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:23,970
Well...

611
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:29,690
Moon Worshippers

612
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,450
will soon follow you to Fairy Island.

613
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,240
I can't explain in detail,

614
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:35,500
but you must trust me.

615
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,650
I won't harm you.

616
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:50,240
Mr. Li,

617
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,410
I believe you.

618
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,520
But now,

619
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:00,320
the world is so vast,

620
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,040
yet where is there a place for us?

621
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:06,850
Anyway, you can go anywhere.

622
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,930
Just don't go to Fairy Island.

623
00:42:08,170 --> 00:42:09,570
I will find you a new place,

624
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,690
a safer place.

625
00:42:11,090 --> 00:42:11,930
Grandmother,

626
00:42:12,370 --> 00:42:13,940
I'm begging you. Please promise me.

627
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:14,850
Please promise me.

628
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:18,450
Okay.

629
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,320
I promise you.

630
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:22,410
Good.

631
00:42:22,890 --> 00:42:23,760
Thank you, Grandmother.

632
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:25,060
Thank you.

633
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,570
I will definitely find

634
00:42:27,570 --> 00:42:28,930
a safer place for you.

635
00:42:29,810 --> 00:42:32,690
Fairy Island is that safer place.
