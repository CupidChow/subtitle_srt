=Episode 40=

3
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,100
- Princess Ling'er is back.
- Nanzhao is saved.

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,950
- Princess Ling'er.
- Princess Ling'er.

5
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,740
We are saved.

6
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:55,910
- Nanzhao is saved.
- We are saved.

7
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,450
Nanzhao is saved.

8
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,270
Princess Ling'er, save us.

9
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,800
Marked with snake patterns,

10
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,670
here is the sacred spirit.

11
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:11,710
Quell the Wind Demon
in the Western Plains.

12
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,040
Slay the Thunder Demon
in the Eastern Sea.

13
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:16,220
Capture the Earth Demon
in the Southern Mountains.

14
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,250
Subdue Fire Demon
in the Northern Wilderness.

15
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:20,480
Finally, stop the water calamity,

16
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,870
and the earth shall be reborn.

17
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,140
Look at the sky.

18
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,920
Look now!

19
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,400
Gods of heaven and earth,

20
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,230
in the name of Nuwa's sacred spirit,

21
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,590
I pray you to grant this land new life.

22
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:03,640
Miracle, a miracle!

23
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:06,640
Nanzhao is saved.

24
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,040
It's raining.

25
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,200
- It's the rain.
- It's raining.

26
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,070
- It's the rain.
- It's raining.

27
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,560
We are saved.

28
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:27,360
It's raining.

29
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,380
Great! Nanzhao is saved.

30
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:34,710
We are saved.

31
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,480
It's raining.

32
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:53,040
We are saved.

33
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,530
Ling'er,

34
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,790
we finally succeeded.

35
00:04:01,130 --> 00:04:02,400
Why do I feel like everything

36
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,200
is going too smoothly?

37
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,140
Your Highness,

38
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,970
the Witch King
heard of your return to Nanzhao

39
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:12,600
and has ordered me to escort you
back to the Palace.

40
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:13,410
Father?

41
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,040
Yes, the Witch King asked you
to return to the Palace now

42
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:18,150
to discuss countering
the Moon Worship Sect.

43
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:19,570
Okay.

44
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:46,890
Father.

45
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:56,800
Ling'er.

46
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:04,680
My Ling'er.

47
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,590
It was my weakness that caused

48
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,480
your mother's misfortune,

49
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,920
leading to your wandering.

50
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,480
These years,

51
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,640
I've been repenting every day.

52
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,660
Father,

53
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,240
it's not your fault.

54
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:35,430
I understand

55
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,310
that you had your reasons.

56
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,110
Now, you're finally back.

57
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:53,430
My daughter.

58
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:04,760
Ling'er!

59
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,610
- This... This...
- Ling'er!

60
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:22,830
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

61
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,170
How...

62
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,270
How could this happen?

63
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:32,290
Ling'er, are you okay?

64
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,570
Let's go now.

65
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,130
Let's go.

66
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:38,240
Since you're here,

67
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,830
what's the rush to leave?

68
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:41,890
Bai Yue!

69
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,330
The Water Spiritual Bead.

70
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,870
Only the blood of Nuwa's descendant

71
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,520
and the Water Spiritual Bead

72
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,200
can resurrect the Water Demon Beast.

73
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,920
Li Xiaoyao,

74
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,040
my ten years of waiting

75
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,520
are for this day.

76
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:54,590
In that case,

77
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:57,960
I will kill you and that monster.

78
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:01,590
This shows that you still don't know
the Water Demon Beast.

79
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,760
It can evoke those ugly thoughts

80
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,870
and evil intentions

81
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,590
in people's hearts.

82
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:11,110
Without the evil in human nature,

83
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:15,430
how could the Water Demon Beast
control them?

84
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,730
Absurd.

85
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,690
Don't think you can do as you please
just because you have the Water Demon Beast.

86
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,080
Li Xiaoyao,

87
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:24,920
any place with water in this world

88
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:27,310
can be controlled by me.

89
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,560
Ling'er, go!

90
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:10,330
Bai Yue.

91
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,980
Go, go!

92
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:15,440
Today is your day to die!

93
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,130
Run!

94
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
Run!

95
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:49,170
Your Highness, My Lady.

96
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:50,240
What's the situation in the city?

97
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,510
The city is in chaos.

98
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:53,150
Lady of the South
has already gone to stop it.

99
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,650
You escort the Princess to leave first.

100
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,800
- A'nu!
- Your Highness, hurry!

101
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,890
Go!

102
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,360
You've finally shown yourself.

103
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:08,660
Kill her!

104
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,190
Are you okay?

105
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Who are you?

106
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,150
I'm your lifesaver.

107
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:08,630
I want to be your best friend.

108
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:11,510
Your only best friend.

109
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,300
Look!

110
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,040
I want to be your best friend.

111
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,300
No!

112
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:52,130
Tang Yu.

113
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,630
The Spirit Poison in Tang Yu
has dispersed. Kill him!

114
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,860
Shoot!

115
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:02,120
Kill me.

116
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,620
General Gai,

117
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:08,250
leave now.

118
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,320
He forced me
to choose between you and A'nu.

119
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:19,930
Since Bai Yue

120
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,070
is forcing you to make such a choice,

121
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,740
it means

122
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,880
you still have a chance to approach him.

123
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:30,190
We mustn't let Bai Yue's plot succeed.

124
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:32,570
Find an opportunity

125
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,510
to kill the Water Demon Beast
ahead of time.

126
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,180
General Gai.

127
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:51,690
Kill me now.

128
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,590
I'm sorry.

129
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,220
Why,

130
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
Tang Yu?

131
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:37,390
Why is it like this? Why?

132
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,630
Tang Yu, it's my fault.

133
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:43,440
Tang Yu, it's all my fault.

134
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,120
It's all my fault.

135
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,690
A'nu,

136
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:55,120
having met you in this life,

137
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,240
I have no regrets.

138
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,920
If there is a next life,

139
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,330
A'nu,

140
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:14,680
we must be together forever,

141
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:19,980
forever.

142
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:28,010
Tang Yu.

143
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,890
Tang Yu.

144
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:41,370
Tang Yu!

145
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:49,890
Tang Yu!

146
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:54,040
Don't!

147
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,510
Tang Yu!

148
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,630
Run!

149
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,390
The Water Demon Beast is coming!

150
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:23,800
Run!

151
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,460
Ling'er,

152
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,750
- are you okay?
- I'm fine.

153
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,990
You're the daughter of the demoness.

154
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:56,560
It's time to send you
to meet your mother.

155
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,840
Today, I will avenge my mother.

156
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,470
The Nuwa clan

157
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,680
is as stubborn as ever,

158
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,200
and you should all meet the same fate.

159
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,720
Run!

160
00:20:44,290 --> 00:20:45,130
Ling'er!

161
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:42,490
Bai Yue,

162
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:43,980
you have no way to escape.

163
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,820
Shut up!

164
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,600
The divine beast isn't dead yet.

165
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,440
As long as I'm here,

166
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,320
it won't die!

167
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,780
Is everything

168
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:12,990
over?

169
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:30,370
Not good.

170
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,130
Bai Yue

171
00:22:35,170 --> 00:22:36,540
offered himself
to the Water Demon Beast.

172
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,540
What?

173
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,490
Xiaoyao!

174
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,420
Bai Yue

175
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,390
has turned into such a monster.

176
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,040
He is now immortal.

177
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:54,870
Unless...

178
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,820
No, no.

179
00:25:00,130 --> 00:25:00,970
No way.

180
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,920
This is the mission
of our Nuwa descendants.

181
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,700
I knew it long ago.

182
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,250
Ling'er, no.

183
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,340
No!

184
00:25:16,010 --> 00:25:16,850
No way.

185
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:18,270
This isn't yours.

186
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,090
No!

187
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,320
Why is it like this?

188
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:23,960
Why?

189
00:25:25,250 --> 00:25:26,600
I've already changed everything.

190
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,350
Why is it still like this?

191
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:30,210
No!

192
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:31,250

00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:49,680
that it is our mission

00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,200

00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,230
