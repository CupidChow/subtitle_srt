2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 15=

3
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,140
This way.

4
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,650
We have arrived.

5
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,790
This is the Temple of the Earth God?

6
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,530
Why is a giant rat being worshipped?

7
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:10,890
What's going on here?

8
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,410
How would I know?

9
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:15,810
I have never seen Mr. Jinba, Miss.

10
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,920
Now that I have brought you all here,

11
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,530
please let me go.

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:25,610
Why did you let him go?

13
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,530
He probably wasn't lying.

14
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:27,780
No use keeping him.

15
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:31,610
If this is really the place,

16
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:32,920
what do we offer as tribute?

17
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,050
So?

18
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:48,410
We just wait here?

19
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:50,500
A'nu,

20
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:51,640
be patient.

21
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,610
As Mr. Huang said,

22
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,890
Mr. Jinba should come to us.

23
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,480
That is Mr. Jinba.

24
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,700
(Mr. Jinba)

25
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,850
A mouse demon?

26
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,730
Who are you?

27
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:41,410
You came looking for me,

28
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,640
and yet you ask who I am?

29
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:45,010
You

30
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:46,920
are Mr. Jinba?

31
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:49,160
Follow me.

32
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,810
"Being in a room of orchids for a while,
one stops noticing their fragrance."

33
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,130
Truly the ancients did not lie.

34
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:20,890
Li,

35
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:22,580
to be honest,

36
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:25,010
I can no longer distinguish any scents.

37
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:26,850
Did you find it?

38
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,570
No.

39
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,660
Sir,

40
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,200
still can't find the scent you're after?

41
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,130
Perhaps consider other rouges?

42
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,410
I want to gift one to Ling'er.

43
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,850
Any recommendations, Scholar?

44
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,920
This rouge.

45
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,570
Its hue is like peach blossoms
upon the water, bright and captivating.

46
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,920
It's perfect

47
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:52,360
for Miss Ling'er.

48
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,540
Sounds impressive.

49
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,380
We'll take this one.

50
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,100
Madam.

51
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,700
Two boxes, please.

52
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:02,330
Sure.

53
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:18,880
Does your cousin

54
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,410
need this?

55
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:22,730
After all, she's a lady.

56
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,860
Though she's currently trapped in jail,

57
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,970
looking dirty,

58
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,940
once she clears her name,

59
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:30,440
she'd surely want to dress up properly.

60
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,010
Come here.

61
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,700
(House for Music and Pleasure)

62
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:45,050
Follow me.

63
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,690
Let's go.

64
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:53,200
That's right, sir.

65
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,570
Li,

66
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,040
did you see that female thief?

67
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:00,860
- No.
- Yes.

68
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:02,290
Any new clues then?

69
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,220
None.

70
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:07,290
Li, let's focus on what's important.

71
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,410
I can't let my cousin down,

72
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,210
nor can you disappoint Miss Ling'er.

73
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:12,050
Right?

74
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,410
First time here, gentlemen?

75
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,140
What kind of girl do you like?

76
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:21,250
You can find whomever you need.

77
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,220
Manager,

78
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,420
ask all the girls

79
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,260
to be here.

80
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,730
All of them?

81
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:32,130
We can surely afford that.

82
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:39,320
No problem.

83
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,290
Gentlemen, follow me.

84
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,420
Follow me.

85
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:52,160
A rare Thunder Fire Bead.

86
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:53,810
So generous.

87
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:56,760
You must be seeking a finer treasure.

88
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,090
Mr. Jinba.

89
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,920
We're looking for a Spiritual Bead
with spiritual powers.

90
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,260
A Spiritual Bead?

91
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,480
For the lost treasures
from the appraisal event,

92
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,360
our friends have been wrongly imprisoned.

93
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,420
Without that bead

94
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:12,690
to find the lost treasures,

95
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,640
they're in mortal danger.

96
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,530
Those treasures weren't stolen
by the thief.

97
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:21,250
So, that won't save your friend.

98
00:08:29,330 --> 00:08:30,800
Alright, Ling'er, I get it now.

99
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,120
He's not answering our question.

100
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:34,110
It's just that he has no clue
about where the Spiritual Bead is.

101
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,730
Stinky mouse, give back
my Thunder Fire Bead!

102
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:36,180
How bold!

103
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,380
No one's dared speak to me like that.

104
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,800
So what if I did?

105
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:49,850
Mr. Jinba, my friend is outspoken

106
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:50,880
but means no harm.

107
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,560
Please understand.

108
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Tang Yu, A'nu,

109
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:57,490
go outside and wait for me.

110
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:06,460
No, Ling'er.

111
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,300
- What if...
- Come with me.

112
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:15,850
Forget it.

113
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:19,800
Humans naturally distrust the different.

114
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:22,760
You not seeing me as a demon

115
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,050
is already unusual.

116
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:28,440
Mr. Jinba,

117
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,680
then you are...

118
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:34,050
Since birth,

119
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,800
I have had this long tail.

120
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,700
Even my own parents

121
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,730
thought I was a mouse-turned demon.

122
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,730
Fearing trouble,

123
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:47,940
they abandoned me in
a dilapidated temple in the wilderness,

124
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,730
leaving me to fend for myself.

125
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,780
Perhaps my fate wasn't sealed yet,

126
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:58,200
so I was saved by mice.

127
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,290
They taught me their language,

128
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,640
and we depended on each other

129
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,730
until one day I ventured

130
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:13,610
into the city and realized,

131
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,240
I was not one of them.

132
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:21,120
Though the mice
showed me kindness and raised me,

133
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,850
after much thought,

134
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,850
despite the pain,

135
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,560
I left them.

136
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:33,000
You are different after all.

137
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,120
Perhaps,

138
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,850
parting is for the best.

139
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:42,050
- I'm not a snake demon.
- Ling'er.

140
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,610
- I'm not a snake demon.
- Descendants of Nuwa have their own missions,

141
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,730
destined not to live at will.

142
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,050
They'll never be able to become

143
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,730
an ordinary person.

144
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,170
I thought so too.

145
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,240
But having experienced
the world's coldness and warmth,

146
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,200
and seeing through people's hearts,

147
00:11:02,530 --> 00:11:04,580
I realized people despise rats,

148
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,090
calling them dirty and despicable.

149
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,170
But human hearts

150
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,560
are even darker and filthier.

151
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,540
Never mind.

152
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:25,290
Let's not dwell on it.

153
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,200
Our meeting is fate.

154
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,090
I'll help you find that Spiritual Bead.

155
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:38,850
Thank you, sir.

156
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,560
Stand straight. Stand straight.

157
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,100
Gentlemen,

158
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,290
all our female musicians

159
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:51,930
are here.

160
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,170
I especially recommend

161
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:57,050
Cuiye and Lanzhao to you.

162
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,240
Not only are they beautiful,

163
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,860
well,

164
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,850
they can also surely
take good care of you.

165
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,620
Let them all stay.

166
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,530
All of them?

167
00:12:13,090 --> 00:12:14,640
It's broad daylight.

168
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,560
Well, isn't it a little inappropriate?

169
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:20,860
Is it?

170
00:12:24,730 --> 00:12:25,940
No, no, no. It's not.

171
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,260
Then you should leave.

172
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,100
Alright, alright.

173
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,170
You go ahead and enjoy.

174
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,080
Shh.

175
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,130
Don't talk.

176
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
Take off your clothes.

177
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:58,240
What are you doing?

178
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:03,010
Scholar,

179
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,290
- did you see it?
- No, nothing.

180
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,800
Not here either.

181
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:07,820
Strange.

182
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,730
You, you, and you.

183
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:10,980
Leave.

184
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,380
This is absurd.

185
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,930
What are they trying to do?

186
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:17,440
Why are you coming out?

187
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:18,700
They're crazy.

188
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,540
Who's crazy?

189
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,260
None of these girls

190
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,730
suit my master's taste.

191
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,330
All...

192
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,370
All of them?

193
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:37,970
Just those two inside are acceptable.

194
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,180
Tell me.

195
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,940
Are you hiding the best ones from us

196
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,760
- and not letting us see?
- No, no, no, not at all.

197
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,930
Forget it. I'll look for them myself.

198
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,490
Go, go, go.

199
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:04,930
May I ask what you're doing?

200
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:06,220
Sir,

201
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,370
why have you come to this unclean place?

202
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,020
My master
is seeking pleasure in the room.

203
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:13,050
I came out for some fresh air.

204
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,170
These are...

205
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:18,320
They're old clothes
the girls no longer wear.

206
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,900
We deal with them all at once,

207
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:21,320
packing them up and throwing them away.

208
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:30,320
Right. I just remember I haven't eaten.

209
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:31,290
Who knows

210
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:32,580
when will my master be done.

211
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:34,560
I'd like to trouble you
to prepare me some food.

212
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,860
Keep this for yourself.

213
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,650
Sure, no problem. Please wait.

214
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,490
Wait a moment.

215
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:01,860
Sir,

216
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,820
your food

217
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,970
is ready in the hall.

218
00:15:07,970 --> 00:15:08,810
Thank you, thank you.

219
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:11,640
I'd like to ask you about one more thing.

220
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,660
Tell me.

221
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:17,410
Whose clothes are these?

222
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:19,940
Don't let this dirty your hands.

223
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,170
It's fine. Take a look.

224
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,170
This belongs to Miss Yingying.

225
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,300
Are you sure?

226
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,530
This. Look.

227
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,340
(Ying)
They're different.

228
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:45,300
(Yingying)

229
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:49,330
Li.

230
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,180
Scholar,

231
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,700
you escaped so quickly.

232
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:52,610
What about those two girls?

233
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,620
They're asleep.

234
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:57,180
So soon?

235
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,200
I just shared some life lessons with them.

236
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,970
Admirable, admirable.

237
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:05,800
Li, did you find a new clue?

238
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,330
Pretty much.

239
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,930
Who are you?

240
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,440
We have come to meet Miss Yingying.

241
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:30,930
Gentlemen, I apologize.

242
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,490
I'm unwell today and cannot see guests.

243
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,490
Please leave.

244
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,060
Manager!

245
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,300
Manager!

246
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,660
Coming.

247
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:50,970
Gentlemen, this...

248
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,970
How did you end up
in Miss Yingying's room?

249
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:54,220
Unfortunately,

250
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,140
Miss Yingying
is not receiving guests today.

251
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,120
Quite the coincidence.

252
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,050
None of your musicians

253
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,410
caught my master's eye,

254
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,880
except for Miss Yingying.

255
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:02,740
Well...

256
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,920
This really puts me
in a difficult position.

257
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,340
Gentlemen,

258
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:10,040
I'll prepare some drinks
and dishes for you.

259
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:13,620
Yingying, these two gentlemen
seem gentle and refined.

260
00:17:13,620 --> 00:17:14,620
They won't cause trouble.

261
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,560
Take good care of them.

262
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,940
(House for Music and Pleasure)

263
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,320
Barging into your room without knocking

264
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,850
was presumptuous of me.

265
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:44,090
I'll drink as punishment.

266
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:45,820
Sir, I don't drink.

267
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,010
If you don't drink,

268
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,390
does it mean
that you refuse to forgive us?

269
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,490
Bravo.

270
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:05,340
I felt you were familiar
the moment I saw you.

271
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,580
Your voice

272
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,890
seems so familiar, too.

273
00:18:07,890 --> 00:18:09,200
Have we met before?

274
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,370
You must be joking, sir.

275
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,010
I have never met you before.

276
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,320
Is that so?

277
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,250
To me, it feels like we have hit it off
right from the start,

278
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,440
extraordinarily familiar.

279
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:25,610
You mentioned you were unwell earlier?

280
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:30,770
Just some old ailments,

281
00:18:30,770 --> 00:18:31,770
nothing serious.

282
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,160
No need for concern, sir.

283
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:34,740
I know a bit about medicine.

284
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,090
Let me take a look at you, okay?

285
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,520
I don't think your injury

286
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:50,250
is on your left hand.

287
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:52,130
It's on your shoulder, right?

288
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,100
Last night, at Yue Lai Inn,

289
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:01,160
a thief was stealing.

290
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,800
Have you heard about it, Miss Yingying?

291
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,580
Not at all.

292
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,500
That female thief had a fragrance

293
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,460
exactly like yours.

294
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,290
- How coincidental, don't you think?
- All the girls here

295
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:12,730
smell like this.

296
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:13,890
What's so strange about that?

297
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:15,450
I injured the female thief's left shoulder,

298
00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:17,290
and today, your left shoulder
happens to be injured.

299
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,890
- How would you explain that?
- Merely a coincidence.

300
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,890
Just now, you were tidying up.

301
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:21,220
Were you worried about being questioned

302
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,020
- for not killing us?
- No.

303
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,280
Your palms are sweating so much.

304
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:24,780
Are you afraid
of the person instructing you?

305
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,610
- I'm not afraid of her.
- Her? Who is she?

306
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:33,730
Help! Help!

307
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,660
She...

308
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,650
Are you sure it's her?

309
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:52,920
Don't get it wrong.

310
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,250
It's the thief I encountered at the inn.

311
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,130
But by build,

312
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,370
she doesn't resemble the one
I saw with the savage girl.

313
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,090
Really?

314
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,490
This is your night attire, right?

315
00:20:11,170 --> 00:20:12,010
Miss Yingying,

316
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:13,340
with evidence so clear,

317
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,040
should I take you to the authorities?

318
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,730
I really can't bring myself to do that.

319
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:23,500
In the bottom compartment
of the wardrobe, there's a hidden box,

320
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,000
containing the money

321
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:26,770
I have saved over many years,
hoping to buy my freedom.

322
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,650
A total of 480 taels and seven qian.

323
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,940
If you're willing to let me go,

324
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,610
all this money is yours.

325
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,530
So, we take your money

326
00:20:35,530 --> 00:20:38,040
and still take you to the officials.
Wouldn't that be better?

327
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,160
Don't be nervous.
We don't want your money.

328
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:44,770
Just answer our questions.

329
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,200
What do you want to ask?

330
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:48,890
Who instructed you?

331
00:20:49,430 --> 00:20:50,290
I can't say.

332
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,360
You're afraid of offending her.

333
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,520
How long have you been trapped here?

334
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,300
Five years.

335
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,560
You're afraid we'll find out
about the female thief,

336
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,340
and that if the thief is caught,

337
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:10,200
you won't be able to earn money.

338
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,200
And without money,
you can't buy your freedom, right?

339
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:22,040
I didn't want to do these things.

340
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:24,040
But relying on my art alone,

341
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,320
I feared I'd be old

342
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,560
and not have saved enough money.

343
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,890
If you can provide us

344
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,250
with clues about the female thief,

345
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,130
I can help you buy your freedom today.

346
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,580
Really?

347
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,920
A gentleman never goes back

348
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,610
on his words.

349
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,890
He's particularly wealthy.

350
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,490
In the eastern corner of the city,
there's an abandoned house

351
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,680
with a dry well that leads
to an underground passage.

352
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:12,520
Go down and follow it

353
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:14,490
until you reach a secret room
in the middle.

354
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,800
What you're looking for

355
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,160
is there.

356
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,160
Thank you, Mr. Jinba,
for the information.

357
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,010
He'll guide you there.

358
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:38,520
Following Yingying's directions,
we're here.

359
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:40,850
Let's look around.

360
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:45,920
The female thief you mentioned
is Ji Sanniang.

361
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,820
She's the one sending people to find me.

362
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:49,970
I can't find her.

363
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,040
If she has something for me to do,

364
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:54,650
she leaves a note at the window.

365
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,650
After completing the task,

366
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,370
I go to the west of the city

367
00:22:58,370 --> 00:23:00,440
to retrieve money
from beneath a brick wall.

368
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:01,770
It's empty.

369
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,010
Did Yingying lie?

370
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,370
Scholar, how about you?

371
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:09,130
Nothing here.

372
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:11,400
It's empty.

373
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,250
And you?

374
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:16,200
Nothing at all.

375
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,890
Here come two more
who don't value their lives.

376
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:21,090
Madam.

377
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,860
Madam, to be honest,

378
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,820
we are brothers
and came here to find relatives.

379
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:27,280
You're here to find relatives?

380
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:29,160
Who are you looking for?

381
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:30,610
I...

382
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,440
This house has been vacant
for over a decade.

383
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,250
No one has lived here.

384
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,800
I advise you to leave quickly.

385
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:38,890
But my wife

386
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:40,980
promised to meet me here tonight.

387
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,280
Could it be she...

388
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,650
To tell you the truth,

389
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,130
this house,

390
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:46,400
at night,

391
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,770
always has these in-and-out sounds.

392
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:50,610
Those sounds

393
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,280
are muffled,

394
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,290
as if coming from underground,

395
00:23:55,290 --> 00:23:56,680
calling for one's life.

396
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,090
Terrifying.

397
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,500
You should leave, quickly.

398
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,340
You can't stay here.

399
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,280
Can't stay here, hurry and go away.

400
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,850
Underground...

401
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,180
That well!

402
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:17,560
We're late. The well is sealed.

403
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:20,040
It seems the female thief was prepared.

404
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:22,250
A rabbit has three burrows.
There must be other entrances.

405
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,460
It's hot.

406
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,010
This weather shouldn't
heat the stones this much.

407
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:33,970
The female thief hides underground,

408
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:35,400
naturally needing ventilation.

409
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,610
The well, serving as a passage,

410
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:39,280
would emit geothermal heat.

411
00:24:39,330 --> 00:24:41,160
Given the rich geothermal resources
in Yangzhou City,

412
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:44,770
and the interconnected wells,

413
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,100
thus...

414
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,500
Finding a well emitting heat

415
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,700
would lead us to the entrance
of the female thief's secret chamber.

416
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:50,400
- Exactly.
- Let's go.

417
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,850
It seems the Spiritual Bead
must be hidden beneath this well,

418
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,440
so the Bead's energy was masked.

419
00:25:42,770 --> 00:25:43,610
Wait.

420
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:46,400
There's a trap ahead.

421
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,340
Impressive, Tang Yu.

422
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,320
Quite clever.

423
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:12,770
Good thing we didn't proceed.

424
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,370
Look,

425
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,440
the Spiritual Bead is just ahead.

426
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,940
Let me.

427
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:37,130
I'll hold them off.

428
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,250
You go find the Bead.

429
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:40,850
Don't get hurt.

430
00:28:01,130 --> 00:28:02,370
Among the eight wells nearby,

431
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:03,610
only this one is hot.

432
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,280
This must be the right place.

433
00:28:06,370 --> 00:28:08,340
Finally, a chance to save my cousin.

434
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,650
Li, let's go down.

435
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:10,850
Wait.

436
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:12,800
This female thief is full of tricks.

437
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,010
If we rush in recklessly,

438
00:28:14,010 --> 00:28:15,040
we might fall into an ambush.

439
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:16,100
Here's the plan.

440
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,780
You go to the yamen
to call for reinforcements.

441
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:19,370
I'll draw them out to catch them all.

442
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:20,210
Excellent plan.

443
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,090
But please be very careful, Li.

444
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,920
Why is it closed?

445
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:00,850
Ling'er,

446
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,370
the Spiritual Bead is here.

447
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,460
Let's split up and search.

448
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:20,320
It's nearby.

449
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:27,090
Ling'er.

450
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,340
This chest.

451
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,440
This wooden box has the aura
of the Spiritual Bead.

452
00:29:41,050 --> 00:29:42,040
Why is it empty?

453
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:45,650
After all this effort,

454
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,200
the trail goes cold again.

455
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,800
Ling'er, the mechanism is here.

456
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
There's something off about this chest.

457
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,970
Look, it's open.

458
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:20,100
Ling'er, you go find the Spiritual Bead.

459
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,580
Once Tang Yu and I regroup,

460
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,420
we'll come find you.

461
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,420
A'nu...

462
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,700
Once you find the Spiritual Bead,
hurry to find Li Xiaoyao.

463
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:26,580
I understand.

464
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,800
You can't leave him now.

465
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,820
- But...
- No buts.

466
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,660
Go now.

467
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,780
Hurry.

468
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,460
A'nu,

469
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,130
you must be very careful on your own.

470
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:52,800
Ling'er, you too must be cautious.

471
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,420
Go now.

472
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,490
Be careful.

473
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,440
I wonder how Tang Yu is doing.

474
00:31:33,410 --> 00:31:34,770
Since you have come,

475
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,280
come in.

476
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,040
You're here to catch me, right?

477
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,490
Return that hair tie to me.

478
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,370
So, you came for the hair tie.

479
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:09,560
Where did you see

480
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:10,920
the owner of this hair tie?

481
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,010
You care about her so much.

482
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:16,650
Could it be you're that girl's lover?

483
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:19,090
No.

484
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,410
The girl who followed me with you

485
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,920
and watched me change clothes

486
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,740
was someone else.

487
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,610
Enough talk!

488
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:30,800
Seems you're quite the romantic.

489
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,250
Quite different

490
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,520
from Li Sansi

491
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:36,560
back in the day.

492
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:37,610
You...

493
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,250
Who are you talking about?

494
00:32:39,250 --> 00:32:42,130
Of course, your father.

495
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:45,800
How do you know my father?

496
00:32:47,130 --> 00:32:47,970
Indeed.

497
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,320
More than just knowing.

498
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,340
We were like-minded

499
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,890
and quite familiar.

500
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:54,730
Shut up.

501
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,610
My father was a hero
who robbed the rich to help the poor.

502
00:32:58,100 --> 00:32:59,970
How could he be in the same league
as a thief like you?

503
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,220
Ah, the noble robber.

504
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,580
Your theft is for personal gain,

505
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,890
framing others.

506
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,370
How dare you
compare yourself to my father?

507
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,370
I used you

508
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,040
because I thought

509
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:13,820
you had the skill to escape.

510
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:14,660
Enough.

511
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,320
Surrender quietly.

512
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,050
Hand over what you stole

513
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,000
from the Treasure Pavilion.

514
00:33:21,170 --> 00:33:22,130
What?

515
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:25,170
Did I steal that much
from the Treasure Pavilion?

516
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,010
Of course.

517
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,560
You emptied the second floor.

518
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:31,850
It seems you saw it with your own eyes.

519
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,370
I saw you sneak
into the Treasure Pavilion.

520
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,560
What more do you have to say?

521
00:33:37,170 --> 00:33:40,520
Kid, you're too naive.

522
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,370
Compared to your father,

523
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,970
you're far behind.

524
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:46,200
Don't mention my father again.

525
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,370
Though I'm a thief,

526
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,490
I'm not the worst of them.

527
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,860
I don't want to end like your parents,

528
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:02,040
beheaded.

529
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,130
You're talking nonsense.

530
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:04,400
My parents aren't dead.

531
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:08,280
Li,

532
00:34:08,570 --> 00:34:11,650
it seems you're really kept in the dark.

533
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:15,540
No.

534
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,520
You're trying to distract me.

535
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,040
You know nothing.

536
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:21,970
Alright.

537
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:24,930
Then you might as well listen.

538
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:30,960
It's said that the Nanzhao Kingdom
possessed a treasure,

539
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,370
named the Water Spiritual Bead,

540
00:34:34,130 --> 00:34:36,610
reportedly crafted by the Nuwa herself.

541
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:40,850
Your parents
sneaked into the Nanzhao Palace

542
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,240
and stole the Water Spiritual Bead,

543
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,370
but were discovered by the guards.

544
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,890
They broke through the encirclement
and fled with the treasure.

545
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:52,560
And thereafter, Li Sansi vanished
with the Bead.

546
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:56,000
Rumor has it they were afflicted
by the Shadowless Poison.

547
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,520
Even though they escaped,

548
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,610
they would never live.

549
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,520
Impossible.

550
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,760
Impossible!

551
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,320
The Shadowless Poison,
Nanzhao's deadliest toxin,

552
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:16,260
guarantees death

553
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,240
without an antidote.

554
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,890
Thus, Li,

555
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:20,370
your parents

556
00:35:20,570 --> 00:35:22,090
have long perished.

557
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,960
My parents

558
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,000
died in Nanzhao...

559
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:32,410
Had your parents not been greedy,

560
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,210
getting in trouble
with the Nanzhao people,

561
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,480
they wouldn't have met

562
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,000
such a fate.

563
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,850
- You're lying!
- The son of a thief!

564
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,460
My dad was not a thief!

565
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,410
Not a thief at all!

566
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,960
You're all lying!

567
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:49,980
Lying!

568
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,170
The son of a thief!

569
00:35:51,460 --> 00:35:53,760
Son of a thief!

570
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,860
Auntie,

571
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:57,410
what exactly does my dad do?

572
00:35:57,570 --> 00:35:59,410
Why do they all say my dad was a thief?

573
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,780
Weren't my parents

574
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:03,220
the envied couple of the martial world?

575
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:04,570
Envied couple?

576
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,940
They left you behind without care,

577
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,650
claiming to rob the rich to aid the poor,

578
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:09,610
yet who knows
what they are actually up to?

579
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,850
Xiaoyao, do you know?

580
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:14,320
Your parents are wanted
by the authorities.

581
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:17,210
You must not follow
in your father's footsteps.

582
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:18,410
Understand?

583
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:27,960
Xiaoyao, be careful!

584
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:33,620
Ling'er!

585
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,890
Li, to fight me,

586
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,000
you're still too inexperienced.

587
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,340
Who?

588
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,280
The mantis stalks the cicada,

589
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,090
unaware of the oriole behind.

590
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,320
What took you so long?

591
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:58,760
Are you hurt?

592
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:01,800
Didn't you tell me not to get hurt?

593
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,090
You're quite obedient.

594
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,100
Ling'er,

595
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,140
you're alright?

596
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,240
I'm fine. Don't worry, Xiaoyao.

597
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,300
Ling'er,

598
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:20,760
it's really you.

599
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,520
You're really in Yangzhou.

600
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:30,720
I have finally found you.

601
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,800
If people see my form,

602
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:41,130
they'll surely identify me
as a snake demon.

603
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:44,930
Xiaoyao would definitely protect me,

604
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,690
even getting hurt in the process.

605
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,650
Xiaoyao,

606
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:07,300
I...

607
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,140
You...

608
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,210
Why did you leave
without saying goodbye?

609
00:39:18,090 --> 00:39:20,480
Did I do something wrong

610
00:39:20,810 --> 00:39:22,280
that makes you angry, Ling'er?

611
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,380
No.

612
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:26,450
Xiaoyao,

613
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,210
you did nothing wrong.

614
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
Ling'er,

615
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:45,410
I promised your grandmother.

616
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,760
I must safely return you to Nanzhao.

617
00:39:49,810 --> 00:39:52,130
The words I spoke must hold true.

618
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:54,820
Ling'er,

619
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:57,210
what happened?

620
00:40:05,850 --> 00:40:07,210
What exactly happened?

621
00:40:08,610 --> 00:40:10,330
Do you know how hard it was
for me to find you?

622
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,330
Do you know how anxious I was

623
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:12,600
when you left without saying goodbye?

624
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,960
Why?

625
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,130
Why can't you tell me anything?

626
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,210
I'm sorry.

627
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:30,930
I'm sorry.

628
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,210
I'm sorry.

629
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,800
This hair tie,

630
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,610
I got it back for you.

631
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:39,800
It's my fault.

632
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:44,210
I

633
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,520
never wanted to leave you.

634
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:48,860
But...

635
00:41:53,850 --> 00:41:54,690
Ling'er,

636
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,930
if you don't want to talk,

637
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,170
I won't ask anymore.

638
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:06,610
I'm sorry.

639
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:09,970
But,

640
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:14,000
please, don't leave me again.

641
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:19,540
