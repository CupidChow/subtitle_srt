3
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,290
Cousin, my fan.

4
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,180
I want to play, too. Teach me.

5
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:53,540
I'll walk Ling'er to her room.

6
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,690
- All right.
- Let's go, Ling'er.

7
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,050
Be careful.

8
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,500
Oh, no.

9
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:03,500
The way you taught me
to break off the engagement

10
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,340
is too cumbersome.

11
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,620
I still have to make everything
clear to Father.

12
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,100
I should go.

13
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,540
- Cousin...
- I'm getting back.

14
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:11,820
Cousin.

15
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,220
(Virtues Blessing Future Generations)

16
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,300
Master, this is the wedding arrangement.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,540
Check it out.

18
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,060
No, no.

19
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,860
Yueru, why are you so drunk?

20
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,820
Hurry. Get her back to her room.

21
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,660
Stop.

22
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm not drunk, Father.

23
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:30,740
The wedding...

24
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,580
No.

25
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,140
Miss, does any of the arrangement

26
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,900
dissatisfy you?

27
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,380
I don't like Li Xiaoyao.

28
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,980
And I'm not marrying him.

29
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,020
It doesn't matter, Yueru.

30
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,020
You two can get married first

31
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,900
and then bond.

32
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,180
Indeed, Mr. Li

33
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,900
is average-looking.

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,860
But he has a great potential.

35
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:51,700
Father,

36
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,580
that has nothing to do with me.

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,940
I'm just not getting married, anyway.

38
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,460
I, Lin Yueru,

39
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,180
will travel around the world, help the weak,

40
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,860
and become a heroine.

41
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:11,740
The marriage thing

42
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,020
isn't what I should think about.

43
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:16,740
Listen, Yueru.

44
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,980
Before, I didn't want you to travel around.

45
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,900
But if you marry Mr. Li,

46
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,420
you can work together

47
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:27,980
to build a wonderful career

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,060
and become a chivalrous couple
that shocks the martial world.

49
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,220
I don't care.

50
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,020
I'm just not getting married.

51
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,840
(Wedding)
If you want a wedding,

52
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,700
you guys marry him.

53
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,220
Come on. Get her back to her room.

54
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:01,940
Go away.

55
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,540
Xiaoyao,

56
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,180
Yueru promised

57
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:11,700
she would break off the engagement.

58
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,380
With such a character,

59
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,980
she will keep her word.

60
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,020
I don't worry about her.

61
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,420
I worry about her father.

62
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,060
I think he's determined
to marry his daughter to me.

63
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:25,540
But he cares for Yueru that much.

64
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,900
I think he'll approve.

65
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,660
Glad you're both here.

66
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,740
You just go get packed now.

67
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:40,580
I'll take you out.

68
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,020
Why, Yueru?

69
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,860
My father insists that I marry this guy.

70
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,700
I'm taking you out now

71
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,060
and I'll try to get you out of the city.

72
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,500
I'm not leaving.

73
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,860
What do you mean?

74
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,860
Aren't you afraid I have to marry you?

75
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,180
I am.

76
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,740
However,

77
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,620
Ling'er isn't well enough now.

78
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,100
She shouldn't travel overnight.

79
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,940
And even if I leave now,

80
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:03,260
are you sure your powerful father

81
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,220
won't get me back?

82
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:05,620
What...

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,340
What do we do, then?

84
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,020
We can't count on you.

85
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,140
Scholar and I talked about this.

86
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,660
Tomorrow morning,

87
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:16,220
we're going out of the city
to catch the Snake Demon in his name.

88
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,740
After we make it,

89
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,100
Mr. Lin will be more impressed with him.

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,820
Then he'll ask for you.

91
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:23,700
When Mr. Lin is pleased,

92
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,940
he will certainly approve.

93
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,060
Naturally, our engagement will be broken.

94
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:29,580
Man, you...

95
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,420
What?

96
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,420
Shame on you.

97
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,860
In the end, I still have to get married.

98
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:37,300
You will be free.

99
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,900
What about me?

100
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,940
You have to know.

101
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:43,170
It's not that I don't want to get married.

102
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,220
I just don't want to marry you.

103
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,860
I don't want to marry you, either.

104
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,780
What I just said has nothing to do

105
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,940
with your approval.

106
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,060
You...

107
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,460
Xiaoyao,

108
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:56,580
I don't think this is appropriate.

109
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:59,380
Yueru has a mind of her own.

110
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,900
And it can't be that easy

111
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,100
to catch the Snake Demon, right?

112
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,900
Tomorrow morning,
I'll try to get you out of the city.

113
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:12,620
Then, I'll go catch the Snake Demon alone.

114
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,820
Maybe when my father is pleased,

115
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,500
I don't need to get married.

116
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,020
No way. I came up with this idea.

117
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:20,380
What makes you think
you can carry it out?

118
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,660
It has nothing to do with your approval.

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:28,140
Now, you either listen to me

120
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:28,980
or listen to my father.

121
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,820
You...

122
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,940
I should go.

123
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,020
(Taihe Restaurant)

124
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,580
Help!

125
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,700
Come help me! Help!

126
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:50,460
Help!

127
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,100
Come help me!

128
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,140
Bugs.

129
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,580
Bugs.

130
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:04,860
What are you waiting for?

131
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,060
Come help me! I'm horribly afraid of bugs.

132
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,420
Silly man.

133
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,340
Come back.

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,740
You can't restrain me anymore, huh?

135
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,060
You...

136
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:44,700
My bugs are nontoxic.

137
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,340
You just need to sit here for a while.

138
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,340
- You...
- Don't say anything.

139
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,300
Or some other bugs can shut you up.

140
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,580
I should go now.

141
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,020
See you in Nanzhao.

142
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,140
We have really come out.

143
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:07,300
Cousin.

144
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,460
I didn't know

145
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,500
you could really sneak out of the city
under your father's nose.

146
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,700
I could, of course.

147
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,820
To escape, I prepared for a dozen years.

148
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,820
Ling'er, we haven't known
each other for a long time,

149
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:21,940
but we feel like old friends.

150
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,540
This time, I can't go to Nanzhao with you.

151
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,580
But I will visit you someday.

152
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Yueru, it's too dangerous
to catch the Snake Demon.

153
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,060
How about you go back home?

154
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,740
A Snake Demon can't scare me at all.

155
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,580
Whether I get married doesn't matter now.

156
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,860
What matters is
I must catch the Snake Demon

157
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,300
and prove to my father how strong I am.

158
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:46,100
Jinyuan, you can't do martial arts.
You turn back now.

159
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,140
I can't.

160
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:49,020
The Snake Demon's cave
has a tricky terrain.

161
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,580
And that's not an ordinary demon.

162
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,220
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

163
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:53,060
I'll go with you.

164
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,900
You have no martial arts.

165
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:56,380
If you go, you'll only be my burden.

166
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,020
Yueru, do you have to go?

167
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,700
Yes, of course.

168
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,900
I have to prove to my father

169
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,940
that a woman

170
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:05,780
can do more things than marry someone.

171
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,940
Since you insist on going,

172
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,980
as your friend, I'll go with you.

173
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,100
Come on. Stop arguing.

174
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:15,180
Let's just go together.

175
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,420
We can take care of each other,

176
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,420
in case someone is so weak

177
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,690
that she'll be caught by the Snake Demon.

178
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,220
Do you even know
where the Snake Demon is?

179
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,540
And what about you?

180
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,020
Stop. I know. I know where it is.

181
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,140
Let's go, Jinyuan.

182
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,020
Scholar, go with me.

183
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:30,500
He's my cousin. He'll go with me.

184
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,880
- Come with me.
- Let's go together.

185
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,180
- Come on. Hurry.
- Ling'er, catch up.

186
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,940
Why are you grabbing him so hard?

187
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,180
Why are you, too?

188
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,540
Jinyuan, hurry.

189
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,500
(Suzhou City)

190
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:50,980
Chief,

191
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:53,220
they got out of Suzhou City
early this morning.

192
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,220
They're heading for the Dragon-hidden Cave

193
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,540
to catch the Snake Demon.

194
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,860
Don't let that demon

195
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:03,220
ruin our plan.

196
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,460
Yes.

197
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:06,820
The daughter of the Lady of the South
has also arrived, huh?

198
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,340
Keep an eye on her.

199
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,180
Yes.

200
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:12,260
Sadly,

201
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,260
we haven't found the Spiritual Beads yet.

202
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,940
Once you find them,

203
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,380
let me know immediately.

204
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,180
Yes.

205
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,900
- Jinyuan, do you really know the way?
- Be careful.

206
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,180
We have been walking for so long.

207
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:39,660
We're going the right way.

208
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:42,460
But the Snake Demon dwells
in the Dragon-hidden Cave.

209
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:45,180
It's said to have a treacherous terrain.

210
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,460
Stop!

211
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:50,740
Why, Xiaoyao?

212
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,180
It's...

213
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,020
Let me guess,

214
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,300
we may be approaching...

215
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,340
The Snake Demon's lair.

216
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,580
I noticed that right away.

217
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,020
How could any humans live
deep within the mountains?

218
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,700
Don't pretend to be experienced.

219
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:10,860
I noticed this first.

220
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
Yueru, Li, calm down.

221
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,700
What do we do, next?

222
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,460
Kill him, of course.

223
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:17,380
You guys follow me.

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,740
You should follow me.

225
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,340
Be very careful, Yueru.

226
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,460
Careful, Ling'er.

227
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,660
This is the Dragon-hidden Cave, I guess.

228
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,660
I'll get in and have a look.

229
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,140
You guys wait here.

230
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,180
Yueru, we'd better get in together.

231
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:05,300
That's right.

232
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,580
It's too dangerous to get in alone.

233
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,780
When you're in there,
don't do anything hasty.

234
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,700
Who would do that?

235
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,700
Yueru, Yueru...

236
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,140
Ling'er, follow me in.

237
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,260
So many passages.

238
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,820
Which one should we take?

239
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:10,860
That's easy.

240
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,580
Snake Demon, come out!

241
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,180
This is the simplest way.

242
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,900
I believe I'll get him out.

243
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,140
Snake Demon,

244
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:26,540
if you still don't come out,

245
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,180
I will burn your lair down!

246
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,620
Forget it. Let's search around.

247
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,940
(Male Snake Demon)

248
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,700
- Jinyuan!
- Scholar!

249
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:21,980
- Jinyuan!
- Scholar!

250
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,180
- Jinyuan, are you all right?
- Scholar!

251
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,300
Wake up, Jinyuan.

252
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,780
Let me try the Resurrection Spell.

253
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,660
Ling'er, you can't use it.

254
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,500
Too risky.

255
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,140
I can't hesitate now.

256
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,140
Snake Demon! Snake Demon!

257
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,260
Recently, a Snake Demon has occupied
the Dragon-hidden Cave outside Suzhou City.

258
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,620
Everyone panics.

259
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:07,380
Ling'er, are you all right?

260
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,780
Xiaoyao,

261
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,060
what do we do?

262
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,780
The Resurrection Spell can heal wounds,

263
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,260
but it can't detoxify the snake venom.

264
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,460
So what now?

265
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:25,660
(Jinyuan Inn)

266
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:29,260
It feels great to be alone.

267
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:37,940
Spiritual Bead?

268
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:54,100
Father,

269
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,660
how is Jinyuan now?

270
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:00,660
Luckily, when I took my men
to fight the Snake Demon,

271
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,700
I made some antidote.

272
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,580
Otherwise,

273
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,780
Jinyuan would die.

274
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,420
Uncle.

275
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,060
Jinyuan,

276
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,020
you're awake?

277
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:14,660
How do you feel now?

278
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,820
I'm fine.

279
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,660
Uncle,

280
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
may I ask for a favor?

281
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,500
What is it?

282
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:30,060
Yueru doesn't want to get married now.

283
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,980
Could you please

284
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,380
break off her engagement with Li?

285
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,540
Jinyuan...

286
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,700
I have my own plan for this.

287
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,220
The three of you,

288
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,420
come with me!

289
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:50,900
Uncle.

290
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,380
(Virtues Blessing Future Generations)

291
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,380
Who allowed you to fight the Snake Demon?

292
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,340
Father, we just wanted
to kill the demon for our people.

293
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,940
For our people?

294
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,060
Figure out how strong you really are.

295
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:08,740
You think some martial arts
make you invincible?

296
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,180
You fool!

297
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,060
You didn't get involved alone.

298
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:14,300
Your cousin got hurt, too!

299
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,300
Mr. Lin, the Snake Demon hurt people.

300
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,220
We can't ignore it
just because it's hard to be killed.

301
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,380
The two of you

302
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,540
should get married early.

303
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:27,780
Then try not to lose your nuts.

304
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,860
- No!
- No!

305
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:31,460
There is

306
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,220
no room for negotiation.

307
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,060
I'm just not getting married.

308
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:37,460
I would rather be killed
by the Snake Demon

309
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,420
than get married!

310
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,940
What did you say?

311
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,540
Slap me.

312
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,100
If Mother were still alive,

313
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:55,420
she wouldn't force me to get married.

314
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,780
Yueru.

315
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,580
Ling'er,

316
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,900
that must have been embarrassing.

317
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,100
That's not true.

318
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,020
Before, my master and my grandma

319
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,300
often disciplined me.

320
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,900
They didn't let me

321
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,420
do a lot of things.

322
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,820
But...

323
00:20:07,460 --> 00:20:09,380
Later, they were gone.

324
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,100
I started

325
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,660
to miss their nagging.

326
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,820
Yueru,

327
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,260
Mr. Lin is very strict with you.

328
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,620
But he always cares for you.

329
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,700
Hope so.

330
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,860
Li Xiaoyao?

331
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,500
What are you doing here?

332
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:40,140
Walking around. What? Any problem?

333
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,180
I brought Ling'er some snacks.

334
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,380
The pastry...

335
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,220
You got it from our kitchen, huh?

336
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,380
- Would you like some, then?
- Here, Yueru.

337
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,980
Why not?

338
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,460
You eat first, Ling'er.

339
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,380
It's very tasty. Try it.

340
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:59,420
You don't eat that much. It's for Ling'er.

341
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:02,180
Give it back. I got this for Ling'er.

342
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,420
Haven't you had enough yet?

343
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
I haven't.

344
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,140
- Want a fight, huh?
- Stop it.

345
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
It's for Ling'er.

346
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,420
- Ling'er, eat.
- I have some.

347
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,780
- Eat.
- I'll lash you.

348
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,460
Try so hard
when you can't beat me up, huh?

349
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:15,020
I can beat you up.

350
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,420
Ling'er, do you think I can beat him up?

351
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:18,540
Stop there.

352
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,660
Want to beat me up, seriously?

353
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:20,900
You silly guy, stop there!

354
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,660
- Can you even touch me?
- Still running, huh?

355
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,500
Come on.

356
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,770
I don't think you can even touch me.

357
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:28,420
(Tablet of Lin Zhigong)

358
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,860
(Tablet of Liu Wan'er)

359
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,540
Honey,

360
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:47,780
I'm sorry.

361
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,540
I broke my promise again.

362
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:54,780
Our daughter still failed to get married.

363
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:58,860
(Tablet of Liu Wan'er)
She took Jinyuan on an adventure

364
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:01,700
and he nearly died.

365
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,820
Luckily,

366
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,660
she has

367
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,580
some good friends

368
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,140
and a sworn sister.

369
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,260
She isn't married.

370
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,460
But anyway,

371
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,780
she has friends to rely on.

372
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,900
Honey,

373
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,100
when you're in heaven,

374
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,900
hope you can bless our daughter

375
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,740
with a happy life

376
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,860
every day.

377
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,780
Then I will

378
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,260
have nothing to worry about.

379
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,420
Father.

380
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,340
I knew

381
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,460
you would understand me.

382
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,780
I understand you.

383
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,100
But remember, you mustn't be...

384
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,260
Rash!

385
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,700
Father,

386
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,460
I know you worry about me.

387
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:30,660
From now on,

388
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,860
I will think carefully before I do anything.

389
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:35,820
And I will be

390
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:38,860
a famous martial artist just like you.

391
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,820
Look, your favorite sweetmeat.

392
00:23:47,140 --> 00:23:47,980
Taste it.

393
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,100
Not bad.

394
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,180
It's sweet.

395
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,060
Let me taste some, then.

396
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,940
Why are you so mean?

397
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,260
My sweet daughter bought this for me.

398
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,220
If you want some,

399
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,660
have a daughter and ask her to buy some.

400
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,100
I won't.

401
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:14,180
Your daughter always pisses you off.

402
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:15,340
I don't think she's so good.

403
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,620
Don't talk that way
about my sweet daughter.

404
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,260
Then let me taste some.

405
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,420
Come on, Father.

406
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:23,260
No.

407
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,580
- Mr. Lin, give me some.
- No.

408
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,660
Give me some.

409
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,420
(Lin's Shrine)
- Don't be so mean. - I just won't.

410
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,580
- Give me some.
- My sweet daughter bought it for me.

411
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,100
I am your sweet daughter.

412
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,940
I won't give you any.

413
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,420
I'm so jealous of Yueru

414
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,940
for having such a caring father.

415
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,460
All parents in this world

416
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,700
love their children.

417
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,340
Xiaoyao,

418
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:01,300
I believe our parents

419
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,740
care about us, too.

420
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:04,180
However,

421
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,900
they have their duties

422
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,940
and secret reasons.

423
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,940
They must be silently blessing us

424
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,420
somewhere in this world.

425
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,060
You're right.

426
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,140
When we see your parents back in Nanzhao,

427
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,220
I will tell them

428
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,860
what a pretty and kind daughter they have.

429
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:28,260
Ling'er.

430
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,220
Ling'er,

431
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,540
what's wrong with you?

432
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:33,780
I'm fine, Xiaoyao.

433
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,260
I just feel a little dizzy.

434
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:38,260
I'm tired, I guess.

435
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,100
After some rest, I'll be fine.

436
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,340
Let me walk you back, then.

437
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:51,900
Come on. Be careful.

438
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,740
How do you feel now?

439
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,300
Xiaoyao,

440
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:03,900
don't worry.

441
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,980
I guess I lost some spiritual power

442
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,180
because I used the Resurrection Spell today.

443
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,020
Ling'er,

444
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,260
promise me.

445
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,380
You won't use this spell again.

446
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,660
Do you hear?

447
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,420
Whatever happens,

448
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:26,180
I won't leave you in danger.

449
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,260
Not even a little bit.

450
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,300
All right. Get to sleep.

451
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,980
Tomorrow, we're leaving Suzhou City

452
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,940
for Nanzhao.

453
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,940
Xiaoyao.

454
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,980
You will not

455
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,820
leave me, will you?

456
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:55,700
Silly girl,

457
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,740
I won't leave you.

458
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
I won't now

459
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:03,180
and I won't ever.

460
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,860
I will never leave you.

461
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:13,860
All right.

462
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,220
Get to sleep.

463
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,060
Somebody! Somebody!

464
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,620
- Dongmei.
- Somebody!

465
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,620
Anybody?

466
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,390
- Somebody come!
- What's up? What is all the yelling about?

467
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,420
De... Demon!

468
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,900
- A demon in the west-wing chamber.
- What?

469
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,420
- So scary.
- Don't talk nonsense.

470
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:55,140
How dare any demon come to our mansion?

471
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,980
It's true.

472
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:57,700
In... In Miss Zhao's room.

473
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:58,860
There is really a demon.

474
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,220
- What?
- Half human, half snake.

475
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,100
Right in the room.

476
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,060
Yueru, what happened?

477
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:04,260
Butler, where's my father?

478
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,220
Miss, Master isn't home today.

479
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,800
Jinyuan, take them

480
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:08,780
to gather our disciples here

481
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:09,780
and bring more torches.

482
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,860
Ling'er!

483
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,140
Miss.

484
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,700
Wait a minute.

485
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,540
- Snake Demon!
- Snake Demon!

486
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,780
Ling'er.

487
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,740
Ling'er.

488
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:13,900
Ling'er.

489
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
Ling'er, where are you?

490
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,020
Ling'er.

491
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:22,140
She was snatched by the Snake Demon.

492
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:24,140
It can't be. I'll have my men look for her.

493
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,900
Maybe she left the room
to get rid of the Snake Demon.

494
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:29,540
- Yueru.
- Jinyuan.

495
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,020
What now? Where's the Snake Demon?

496
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,980
Jinyuan, send all our men to look for Ling'er.

497
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:35,860
In and out of the city.

498
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,180
Even if you have to look everywhere,

499
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,220
you must get Ling'er back.

500
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,060
All right.

501
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:41,380
Dongmei, how did the demon get in?

502
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,500
On my way back to my room,

503
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,500
I passed by Miss Zhao's chamber.

504
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,260
Suddenly...

505
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,700
Suddenly, I heard Miss Zhao scream.

506
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,140
I then broke in to check on her.

507
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,780
And I saw...

508
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,940
I saw...

509
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,900
What did you see?

510
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,780
I saw a Snake Demon in the bed.

511
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,060
It...

512
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:05,300
It seems to be...

513
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,340
Miss Zhao.

514
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,100
Nonsense!

515
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:20,140
Dongmei, don't talk nonsense.

516
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,540
How can Miss Zhao be a Snake Demon?

517
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,100
I'm not talking nonsense.

518
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,900
The demon has a human upper body.

519
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,380
I saw its face...

520
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,500
It looks like...

521
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,340
Shut up!

522
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,020
Why do you
make up stories to slander Ling'er?

523
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,540
Miss, however daring I am,

524
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,060
I wouldn't lie to you.

525
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,060
You came in with me. You say something.

526
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,300
No way.

527
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,260
Ling'er can't be a Snake Demon.

528
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,090
The Snake Demon from the Dragon-hidden Cave
must have come for revenge

529
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,180
and snatched Ling'er.

530
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,300
Li Xiaoyao!

531
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,300
- Yueru.
- Miss.

532
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,220
Go inform my uncle.

533
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,820
- Hurry.
- Yes.

534
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,100
Ling'er!

535
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:20,100
Ling'er!

536
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:22,420
Ling'er!

537
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:23,780
Ling'er!

538
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,660
Ling'er!

539
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:33,500
It's you.

540
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:35,340
What? Disappointed?

541
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,300
Are you blaming me
for not saying anything just now?

542
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:43,940
At that time, whatever I said would not help.

543
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:45,660
Our priority is to find Ling'er.

544
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:48,060
Don't bother what others say or think.

545
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:53,780
I get it.

546
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,940
You go back. I'll look for her alone.

547
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,540
When you go alone
to the Dragon-hidden Cave so late,

548
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,660
can you really get Ling'er out?

549
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,260
I'll get her out even at the risk of my life!

550
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,360
Then let's take the risk together.

551
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,220
You don't have to.

552
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,660
I'm not doing this for you,

553
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:12,060
but for Ling'er.

554
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,140
She's my good friend.

555
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:16,060
Since she went missing from my house,

556
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,380
I have a responsibility to get her back.

557
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:22,340
Well,

558
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,420
thank you for Ling'er.

559
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,300
Do I not have a name?

560
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,760
What do you want me to call you?

561
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,220
Your Grace isn't really necessary.

562
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,420
I won't take advantage of you, anyway.

563
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:34,660
Just call me Yueru.

564
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,820
Come on, savage girl.

565
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,690
Hey, you...

566
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,780
I'm not a Snake Demon.

567
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,500
I'm not a Snake Demon.

568
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,660
I'm not a Snake Demon.

569
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,860
I'm not a Snake Demon.

570
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,900
I'm not a Snake Demon.

571
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:37,460
I'm not a Snake Demon.

572
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:40,460
I'm not a Snake Demon!

573
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,620
What is this palace?

574
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:04,860
Oh, bad Tang Yu.

575
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,500
If only he were here now!

576
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:19,860
(Virtues Blessing Future Generations)

577
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,460
Uncle, you're home, finally.

578
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,140
What happened, Jinyuan?

579
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,380
Last night,

580
00:34:32,380 --> 00:34:34,300
a Snake Demon broke
into Miss Ling'er's room

581
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:35,820
and she was snatched.

582
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,940
According to Dongmei,

583
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,940
the Snake Demon
has red hair and green scales.

584
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,020
Yueru and Li have gone...

585
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,260
Where have they gone?

586
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,620
The Dragon-hidden Cave.

587
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,900
This is ridiculous!

588
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,220
The Dragon-hidden Cave is very dangerous

589
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:51,220
with a tricky terrain!

590
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,140
Considering their poor martial arts,

591
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,700
they will lose their lives!

592
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:58,020
Jinyuan, why didn't you stop Yueru?

593
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,020
That was an emergency.

594
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,500
Uncle, don't be worried.

595
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:01,820
Last time, they failed

596
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:03,740
because they had to protect me.

597
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:05,220
But this time, I think

598
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,900
they have enough strength to make it.

599
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:08,340
We're heading
for the Dragon-hidden Cave now.

600
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:10,580
Uncle, I'm worried about something else.

601
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,020
Yueru has always been loyal and righteous.

602
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:17,020
And Miss Zhao is her sworn sister.

603
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,540
I'm afraid...

604
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,620
I'm afraid she will go with Li

605
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,260
to look for Miss Zhao.

606
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:26,940
Jinyuan,

607
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,980
how can she do that?

608
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,180
If it really happens,

609
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,060
I'm willing to go with Yueru.

610
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,900
I'm a mere scholar

611
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:34,780
who has no martial arts.

612
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,580
But I will always think about Yueru

613
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,500
and take care of her.

614
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,260
Please approve, Uncle.

615
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:53,700
Go gather our disciples in the forecourt.

616
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,380
I'll catch up.

617
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:01,660
(Virtues Blessing Future Generations)

618
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:44,180
- Scholar?
- Jinyuan?

619
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,300
Oh, I caught up with you.

620
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,540
Glad I'm not late.

621
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,820
Jinyuan, why did you come here

622
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,200
instead of staying at home for recovery?

623
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,700
I was detoxicated.

624
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,940
And Miss Ling'er gave me some treatment.

625
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:56,220
Now, I'm all right.

626
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:58,020
This time, we must catch the Snake Demon

627
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,180
and get Miss Ling'er out.

628
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:00,900
Last time when we were here,

629
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,260
the Snake Demon had a defensive advantage

630
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,820
due to so many passages.

631
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:04,780
It was hard to attack him.

632
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,980
So, I had our men
prepare something overnight.

633
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,180
The antidote,

634
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,140
the healing powder, the realgar,

635
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,260
and...

636
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,300
And the metal soft armor.

637
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,300
Well, you put it on.

638
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,460
The map of the interior of the cave.

639
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:26,420
Where did you get it?
Such a detailed map.

640
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,900
Why didn't you take it out last time?

641
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,020
Before I set off,

642
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,380
Uncle threw it into my carriage.

643
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,380
He attacked this cave several times

644
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,700
and he did collect some information.

645
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:39,140
My father...

646
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,020
Uncle

647
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,660
urged me again and again

648
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,180
that I should stop you.

649
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:44,820
He's gathering his men

650
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,180
to come and suppress the Snake Demon.

651
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,140
Without further ado,

652
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:54,140
let's get moving now.

653
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:56,140
Scholar, you just recovered

654
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,350
and you shouldn't risk your life again.

655
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,780
You'd better stay here and back us up.

656
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,820
Yeah, Jinyuan.

657
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:01,580
You can't get hurt again.

658
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,100
Or my father would really kill me.

659
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,140
Fine, then. Yueru and Li,

660
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:08,140
be very careful.

661
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,420
Don't get hurt by the Snake Demon.

662
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:11,540
I'll stay here and wait for Uncle.

663
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,460
Then we'll cooperate with you
from the outside.

664
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,340
All right.

665
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,220
Do you feel it stinks more

666
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,540
as we go deeper underground?

667
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:11,420
This is where the Snake Demon
attacked us last time.

668
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:13,180
Come this way.

669
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,540
- Savage girl.
- Let me go!

670
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:53,900
Let me go!

671
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,620
It's you again.

672
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:59,620
You have got some nerve to come get killed.

673
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:01,700
Let her go! Or I'll ruin your lair right now!

674
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,220
You think you can?

675
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,700
Are you all right?

676
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:29,660
I'm fine.

677
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:04,460
Give me Ling'er!

678
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,300
Ling'er?

679
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,420
What are you talking about?

680
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,460
A girl of my age. Confess!

681
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:11,580
I... I don't know.

682
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:13,220
I have never caught

683
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,420
a girl.

684
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:16,380
Wait.

685
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,260
Could Ling'er be snatched

686
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:19,900
by someone else?

687
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:21,540
Who else could it be?

688
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,740
In my memory,
the Snake Demon in my mansion

689
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,340
looks smaller.

690
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,940
It had different hair color
and figure, too.

691
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,220
What's the difference
between Snake Demons?

692
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,060
I didn't see clearly.

693
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,020
But it's also half human and half snake.

694
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,420
Green scales

695
00:41:35,420 --> 00:41:36,380
and red hair.

696
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:40,500
As far as I know, that's not a Snake Demon,

697
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,580
but a god.

698
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,500
If it's really a god,

699
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,780
it won't hurt Ling'er.

700
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,180
Then where did it take her?

701
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,940
He even cut off his own tail.

702
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,300
He just wanted to distract us,

703
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,540
so he lied like that.

704
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,460
He has Ling'er. Go after him!

705
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,540
Go!
