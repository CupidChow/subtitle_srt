1
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,780
=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:47,860
(In ancient times,)

4
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:50,710
(the five great beasts of wind,
thunder, water, fire, and earth)

5
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,220
(wreaked havoc on the world.)

6
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,180
(Nuwa, unable to bear
the suffering of living beings,)

7
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,820
(concentrated the power of the earth)

8
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,580
(to forge five spiritual beads
to suppress the beasts.)

9
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:04,410
(After the beads scattered
across the human realm,)

10
00:02:04,630 --> 00:02:08,030
(the beasts' leader, Water Demon Beast,
was reborn through water,)

11
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,490
(bringing destruction once more.)

12
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:11,980
(For centuries,)

13
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,340
(no one could stand against the beast)

14
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:18,670
(until a young man suddenly emerged,)

15
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,540
(known as Xiaoyao, the Hero.)

16
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:27,140
(He battled the Water Demon Beast underwater)

17
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,850
(for seven days and nights,)

18
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:31,950
(with the surface alternately roiling)

19
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:34,180
(and surging with giant waves.)

20
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:35,540
(Then,)

21
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,340
(all became calm.)

22
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,420
Li Xiaoyao, wake up.

23
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,260
Li Xiaoyao!

24
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,100
Auntie Li.

25
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,700
(Li Xiaoyao)
You don't have to bang on the pot

26
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,950
every time you wake someone up.

27
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:52,980
It's terrifying.

28
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,620
(Mrs. Li)
If I don't bang, will you wake up?

29
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,980
You dream all day,

30
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,950
acting crazy.

31
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,850
Don't you know
how to do something serious?

32
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,980
Dreaming while sleeping is a serious matter.

33
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,620
Sleeping again? Always sleeping.

34
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,910
I'll let you sleep.

35
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,820
- I'll let you sleep again.
- And you're kicking me.

36
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:10,830
This wooden bed isn't sturdy.

37
00:03:10,830 --> 00:03:11,910
If I fall and die,

38
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:12,930
the Li family will end with me.

39
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:15,340
Don't always act like your father,

40
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,910
waving swords
and practicing martial arts,

41
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,060
lacking proper conduct.

42
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Which girl would marry you?

43
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,060
How did my dad marry my mom then?

44
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,930
Your mother?

45
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,060
She's just like your dad,
married into our family

46
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:29,110
and didn't learn a bit of needlecraft
like sewing or embroidery.

47
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,060
They just fooled around outside together.

48
00:03:32,830 --> 00:03:33,820
But everyone says my parents

49
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:35,620
were a couple of heroes

50
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:37,670
admired by all in Jianghu.

51
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:39,370
A couple of heroes? Indeed,

52
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,980
they went out to perform righteous deeds,

53
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,370
leaving you, a troublemaker, to me.

54
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,670
If it weren't for me saving and scrimping

55
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:48,700
to run this inn,

56
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:50,540
do you think
I could have raised you till now?

57
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,210
After all that trouble,

58
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,980
you turn out to be a lazy man!

59
00:03:57,390 --> 00:03:58,290
Still fooling around.

60
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,110
Stop that!

61
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:01,900
Auntie, I am not lazy.

62
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,620
I will become a hero
who roams the world

63
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,270
and dominates Jianghu

64
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,570
just like my parents.

65
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,140
Stop talking nonsense.

66
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,290
I'm making porridge downstairs.

67
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,750
Clean up the room

68
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,420
and then come down to greet the guests.

69
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,460
Got it, got it.

70
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,890
Vegetables, come take a look.

71
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,170
Old wine, aged wine.

72
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,790
Dad.

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,020
Dad.

74
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,100
Li Xiaoyao!

75
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,890
Doing rough work early in the morning.

76
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,060
So boring.

77
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:09,980
Li Xiaoyao!

78
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,060
Coming!

79
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,020
Please have some tea.

80
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:21,870
- Madam.
- Coming.

81
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:23,890
We are businessmen from Nanzhao,

82
00:05:24,110 --> 00:05:25,300
looking for a peaceful stay.

83
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,260
Thank you, dear sir.

84
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,340
Our inn will surely make you feel at home.

85
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,610
I'll go prepare the dishes now.

86
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,430
Xiaoyao,

87
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,740
show the guests to their rooms.

88
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:38,580
Alright.

89
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,050
Dear guests, please follow me.

90
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,330
Young man, no trouble,

91
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,710
we can find our way.

92
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:45,580
Vegetables, come take a look.

93
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,460
Young man.

94
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,760
- Young man?
- Fine silk and satin.

95
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,210
- Where are our rooms?
- Take a look.

96
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,340
Sir, please.

97
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:02,150
Sir,

98
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,620
you are staying in our best room.

99
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:05,540
Please rest well.

100
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,490
Thank you.

101
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,860
Please bring the meals to my room later.

102
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,650
Surely more than 500 wen.

103
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,820
I met a god of wealth here.

104
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:26,390
By the way, Auntie,

105
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,140
where are those merchants from?

106
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,330
They dress so strangely.

107
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,490
Li Xiaoyao, I warn you.

108
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,740
Do your job well

109
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,170
and don't inquire about unnecessary things.

110
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,790
Okay, okay.

111
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,710
Hurry up.

112
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:42,990
This is their meal.

113
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,990
Hurry and deliver it.

114
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:44,830
Alright.

115
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,860
Sir, your wine and dishes are here.

116
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,020
Sir.

117
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,270
Boss,

118
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,490
now that we are here,

119
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,450
why don't we go and see that fairy island?

120
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,980
Why are you still thinking about that?

121
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,490
We are already short on time for this trip.

122
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:06,170
Let's talk about it next time.

123
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,990
Sir,

124
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,220
I grew up in Yuhang.

125
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:17,210
Maybe I know about the fairy island
you mentioned.

126
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:21,170
Young man, we were just chatting.

127
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,620
Most of what we hear is hearsay,

128
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:25,580
probably false.

129
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,770
That is right.

130
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:30,180
What kind of wine is this?

131
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:31,260
It has no taste.

132
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,740
Sir, you may not know,

133
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:35,650
but this Osmanthus Wine is
a famous product from Jiangnan.

134
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:36,700
It is fragrant and sweet,

135
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,340
even the current Noble Consort
loves it very much.

136
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,180
(Osmanthus Wine)

137
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,370
What Osmanthus Wine?

138
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,050
That's what women drink.

139
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,180
Sir, may I ask what kind
of wine you would like?

140
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,080
I can change it for you.

141
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,820
Never mind. Don't trouble yourself.

142
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:47,950
Just porridge is fine.

143
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,450
You go about your business.

144
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,740
Alright, I will leave then.

145
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,100
Wine!

146
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,460
Auntie.

147
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:00,580
Wine!

148
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,900
Xiaoyao.

149
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,140
Auntie.

150
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,060
This is the meal for Zhang Si and the others.

151
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:07,980
Deliver it

152
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,930
and buy some shrimp on your way back.

153
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,260
Making me run errands again?

154
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,950
If not you, then who?

155
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:14,980
Would your old aunt run?

156
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,790
Alright then.

157
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,420
(Osmanthus Wine)

158
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,260
Drive away that beggar outside.

159
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,370
He's been yelling all morning. Go.

160
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:27,020
- Buns!
- Wine!

161
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,540
Small trinkets!

162
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:30,200
(Xiaoyao Inn)
Come, take a look.

163
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:32,180
Wine!

164
00:08:34,010 --> 00:08:36,280
- Yellow wine, rice wine, come take a look!
- Wine!

165
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:37,230
Excuse me,

166
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:38,910
our small inn can't afford such disturbances.

167
00:08:38,910 --> 00:08:40,460
I have no money for you.

168
00:08:40,470 --> 00:08:43,300
(Drunken Sword Immortal)
But you have good wine here.

169
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:45,060
Let me have a sip.

170
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:47,130
But this wine is not for you. Please leave.

171
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,100
Young man.

172
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,860
Come take a look.

173
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:56,180
Fine silk and satin.

174
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,980
The chosen one.

175
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,500
I'm not interested in your story.

176
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,890
Please leave, or I really won't have time.

177
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:19,690
Young man,

178
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,810
just listen.

179
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,740
When Pangu created the world,

180
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,860
in ancient times, there was a demigod, Nuwa.

181
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,300
Nuwa vanquishing demons, right?

182
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,300
Storytellers are tired of that tale.
Please leave.

183
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,210
It seems you've heard it.

184
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,480
Come take a look.

185
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,420
Seeing you're pitiful, I'll give you a sip.

186
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:43,300
But only one sip.

187
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:50,780
(Osmanthus Wine)

188
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,420
Why did you drink it all?

189
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,500
Good wine.

190
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,010
Good wine. Good wine.

191
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,790
Well, you've drunk it all,
so just leave quickly.

192
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,890
Don't delay our business.

193
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,980
Vegetables, come take a look.

194
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,980
You just said

195
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,180
I am what?

196
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,130
The chosen one.

197
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,940
Do you have any basis for saying that?

198
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,330
Could it be I truly have the potential
to be a great hero?

199
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,460
You

200
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,810
want to learn swordsmanship?

201
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:33,700
How did you know?

202
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:40,890
Tonight, at the third watch of the night,
meet me at the Shanshen Temple on Shili Slope.

203
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:43,540
Be there or be square.

204
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,740
Come take a look.

205
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:50,220
(Yuhang Town)

206
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,380
Fish! Fish!

207
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,210
Here's your meal.

208
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,210
Xiaoyao, be careful.

209
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:20,450
Watch out for the carriage!

210
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,860
When you grow up, remember to repay me.

211
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,420
Mr. Sun, here it is.

212
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:47,910
Mrs. Wang, here's your roast chicken.

213
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:49,010
Thanks, Xiaoyao.

214
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:50,860
Luckily, I move fast.

215
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,330
- Almost didn't make it.
- I'm not!

216
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:53,300
You're lying!

217
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,830
(Wang Xiaohu)
Wang Xiaohu, you big liar.

218
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:55,980
You've never seen it,

219
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:57,130
never seen it at all.

220
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,230
What's going on?

221
00:11:58,410 --> 00:11:59,270
Xiaoyao.

222
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,450
What's up, Xiaohu?

223
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,350
Wang Xiaohu's lying,
saying there's a fairy island in the sea.

224
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:05,230
A fairy island?

225
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:06,690
Yes, Xiaoyao, it's true.

226
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,180
Not just a fairy island, but one with a fairy.

227
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,030
She gave me a magic pill,

228
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:13,270
and Grandpa was instantly cured.

229
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,470
You're dreaming, right?

230
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,620
A fairy?

231
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,470
There is a fairy!

232
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:17,770
Still so stubborn. Let's beat him up.

233
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:19,790
That's enough, no need for violence.

234
00:12:19,790 --> 00:12:22,420
You? Beaten by my brother

235
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,390
and still talking big.

236
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:26,230
Beaten by your brother? Nonsense.

237
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:27,250
Nonsense?

238
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:29,950
Xiaoyao of the Li family,

239
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,800
a thief's son with great ambition,

240
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,190
dreams of being a swordsman
reaching the clouds like the Sword Immortal.

241
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,150
Sleeping till noon,

242
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,860
living in dreams every day.

243
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,180
Don't pick on Xiaoyao!

244
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:40,660
Dare to bully me?

245
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:42,980
Li Xiaoyao, dare to bully my little brother?

246
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,740
Look at that cheap face of yours.

247
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,660
You're just a thief's son
but dream every day of being a hero,

248
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,710
forgetting how I used to beat you up as a kid.

249
00:12:48,710 --> 00:12:50,690
I tried every possible means to beat you up!

250
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:54,230
Xiaoyao of the Li family,

251
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,400
a thief's son with great ambition,

252
00:12:56,410 --> 00:12:58,830
dreams of being a swordsman
reaching the clouds like the Sword Immortal.

253
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:01,100
Sleeping till noon,

254
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,390
living in dreams every day.

255
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,270
Xiaoyao of the Li family...

256
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,110
Shut up!

257
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,180
Getting mad, little thief's son?

258
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:13,450
Don't fight, Xiaoyao.

259
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:28,740
Li Xiaoyao!

260
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:29,620
Xiaohu, run!

261
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Li Xiaoyao, I'm gonna fight you!

262
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Over there, over there!

263
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,010
Li Xiaoyao, stop right there!

264
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,570
Li Xiaoyao,

265
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,710
wait for me!

266
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:40,150
This is my new outfit!

267
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,300
- Li Xiaoyao, come out!
- Go!

268
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,980
Xiaoyao, you're so cool.

269
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:49,330
They can compete with me in their dreams.

270
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:52,380
They say that to you, and you're not angry?

271
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,300
Such nonsense.

272
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,030
I've heard it so much
that my ears are calloused.

273
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:56,300
I couldn't care less about them.

274
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,140
By the way,

275
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,300
you mentioned a fairy island in the sea.

276
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,300
Xiaoyao, it's true,

277
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,450
there really is a fairy island with a fairy.

278
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,130
So those merchants were telling the truth?

279
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:12,380
(Red Bean Congee)
Come take a look, tasty and affordable.

280
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,100
Xiulan, is my clothing ready yet?

281
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,420
I'll check.

282
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,950
Xiaoyao,

283
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,180
try the red bean congee I made.

284
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,020
Alright.

285
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:23,740
- Fill it up, yeah?
- Okay.

286
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:26,820
Give it a try.

287
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,140
Thank you.

288
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,980
Xianglan, could you get me another one?

289
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,540
(Ding Xianglan)
Sure thing.

290
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,900
Li,

291
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:36,390
(Ding Xiulan)
my sister's almost done mending your cape.

292
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,500
Come get it tomorrow.

293
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,100
Thanks for the effort, really.

294
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:41,540
To keep it from my dad,

295
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,180
my sister has been secretly sewing by night

296
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:47,150
with a little lamp.

297
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:48,740
It really hurt

298
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,380
her eyes.

299
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,740
How should you thank her?

300
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,300
How about this, Xianglan?

301
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,650
I'll buy you some liver
to nourish your eyes someday.

302
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,380
Is that what my sister wants?

303
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:01,540
Alright, alright.

304
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,390
Xiaoyao, weren't you going
to deliver the meals?

305
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:05,230
Go on, then.

306
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:06,250
I'm off.

307
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:07,630
Wait,

308
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,330
you're going to see Zhang Si
who depends on the sea for a living, right?

309
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,380
Yes.

310
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:13,420
Then you must ask

311
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,980
if that strange event is true.

312
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,770
What event?

313
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,270
Mr. Wang, the salt seller,

314
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:20,470
fell ill a while back,

315
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,810
and even Physician Hong couldn't cure him.

316
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:24,250
Guess what happened in the end.

317
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,310
I know.

318
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,950
Wang Xiaohu went to the fairy island
and got a magic pill,

319
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,950
which cured his grandpa.

320
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:29,940
You've heard too.

321
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:31,150
Wine! Aged fine wine!

322
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,690
Do we really have a fairy island here?

323
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,780
(Yuhang Town)

324
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,620
Fish that's just caught! Absolutely fresh!

325
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,740
Just-caught fresh fish, take a look!

326
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,580
Zhang Si,

327
00:15:39,830 --> 00:15:40,790
your meal's here.

328
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,450
Take a look!

329
00:15:43,910 --> 00:15:45,060
And red bean congee.

330
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,380
- Bought especially for you.
- Thanks, Xiaoyao.

331
00:15:49,270 --> 00:15:50,300
Got any fresh shrimp?

332
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:51,140
A kilo, please.

333
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,460
Sure, sure.

334
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,820
(Zhang Si)
Si,

335
00:15:58,830 --> 00:16:01,290
- is what Xiaohu said about the island true?
- Come take a look.

336
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:02,180
Mrs. Wang, goodbye.

337
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,060
Don't inquire randomly.

338
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,690
Tell me about it.

339
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:14,860
I have a secret.

340
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:15,890
Do you want to hear it?

341
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:17,310
What is it?

342
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,860
Well, this red bean porridge, Xianglan...

343
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:24,940
Xianglan?

344
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,950
- What about Xianglan?
- Shrimp!

345
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,790
Do you want to hear it?

346
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,420
Tell me about the fairy island.

347
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,700
Vegetables!

348
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,710
Home-grown vegetables!

349
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:32,620
Alright, Xiaoyao,

350
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:35,380
don't ask me about the island's authenticity.

351
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,620
I didn't see it myself,

352
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,770
but when I pulled Xiaohu

353
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,010
out of the water,

354
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,300
he did have a magical pill.

355
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,980
You don't know how dangerous it was then.

356
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:47,010
Xiaohu was almost gone.

357
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:49,770
Okay, forget about the island.

358
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,690
So, it seems the legend of the island is true.

359
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,620
We have both yellow wine and rice wine.

360
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,180
Li, something's wrong.

361
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,020
Mrs. Li...

362
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,750
What happened to my aunt?

363
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,870
I just passed by the inn

364
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:08,510
and heard Mrs. Li suddenly fainted.

365
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:09,930
Physician Hong has already gone there.

366
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,060
Where did you go?

367
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:17,590
Look at your aunt,

368
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,450
and you're not at home now?

369
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:24,620
How did my aunt suddenly fall ill?

370
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,660
She was fine when I left.

371
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,620
Mrs. Li has been sick for many days

372
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,380
due to overwork.

373
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:33,210
She hid it from you.

374
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,900
Is it serious?

375
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,020
I think...

376
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,350
No.

377
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:43,020
No. Please, Physician Hong,

378
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:44,870
you must heal my aunt.

379
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:46,050
I'll do anything you ask.

380
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,210
Let's talk outside.

381
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,740
Physician Hong!

382
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,740
Physician Hong!

383
00:17:57,990 --> 00:17:59,290
Your aunt's illness

384
00:17:59,510 --> 00:18:01,660
seems to show signs of poisoning.

385
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,500
Poisoning?

386
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:05,590
How could this happen?

387
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:07,980
That's what I find strange too.

388
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,780
Let fate decide.

389
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:16,410
I've done my best.

390
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,050
Physician Hong! Physician Hong!

391
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:33,380
Xiaohu,

392
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,570
did you really get the medicine
from the fairy island

393
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,060
and cure your grandfather's illness?

394
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,570
- Yes.
- Where is the fairy island?

395
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,540
Last time, I accidentally
stumbled upon the island,

396
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,810
met a fairy at the edge of the island,

397
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,290
and fell into the sea on the way back.

398
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:49,140
I can't remember now where it was.

399
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:54,290
What do we do now?

400
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,380
Madam,

401
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,380
is lunch ready?

402
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,830
I heard there's a fairy island here.

403
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:03,260
It's said there's a magical medicine
that can bring the dead back to life.

404
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,990
Xiaohu, watch over Auntie for me.

405
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:06,830
I'll be right back.

406
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,830
- Sir.
- What's wrong?

407
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:13,060
Do you know

408
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:14,140
where that fairy island is?

409
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:16,540
We only mentioned that island casually.

410
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,630
You shouldn't take it seriously.

411
00:19:17,630 --> 00:19:18,470
Sir,

412
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:19,620
please tell me.

413
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,810
My aunt is seriously ill.

414
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,220
I need to go to the fairy island for medicine.

415
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,210
Madam is seriously ill?

416
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,500
Sir.

417
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,290
Since your aunt is seriously ill,

418
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,290
we'll move to another inn.

419
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
We'll cover the room rent.

420
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:30,860
- Farewell.
- Sir! Sir!

421
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:31,950
Sir!

422
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,570
About the rumors of this fairy island,

423
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,530
I only heard some news

424
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,170
from a merchant.

425
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,190
He said

426
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,100
the island

427
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:48,660
is in the southeast direction of the sea,

428
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,780
but it's hard for ordinary people to reach.

429
00:19:51,870 --> 00:19:53,210
He sold me a hammer

430
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:55,050
named "Sky Breaking Hammer",

431
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:57,380
which he said could break the miasma
on the island.

432
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,710
Sir,

433
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,260
can I borrow that hammer?

434
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,980
Since you're desperate to save your aunt,

435
00:20:05,630 --> 00:20:07,860
I'll lend you the hammer.

436
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,260
You can return it to us
when you're done.

437
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:14,900
Thank you, sir.

438
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,870
When I get the medicine,

439
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:17,020
I'll repay you by any means.

440
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,100
Hold on.

441
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,330
This isolated island at sea has miasma.

442
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,060
I have a pill

443
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,900
that can protect you from it.

444
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,750
Take it immediately

445
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:30,950
if you're going there now,

446
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,980
or it'll be too late
once you inhale the miasma.

447
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:35,900
Thank you, sir.

448
00:20:42,710 --> 00:20:43,550
Thank you, sir.

449
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:45,050
Hurry up and go.

450
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:04,930
Is this the fairy island?

451
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:32,380
(Fairy Cave)
It seems this trip won't be in vain.

452
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,020
Could there really be fairies?

453
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:57,740
Miss Fairy!

454
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:28,540
(Zhao Ling'er)

455
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:49,740
Who are you?

456
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,290
How dare you trespass on the Fairy Island?

457
00:27:53,110 --> 00:27:55,020
Speak up, or I won't spare you.

458
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:08,450
Please forgive me, Miss Fairy.

459
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,530
My aunt is seriously ill,

460
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,620
and I heard there's a fairy medicine
on the island that can cure all diseases.

461
00:28:15,950 --> 00:28:17,110
I apologize

462
00:28:17,110 --> 00:28:18,500
for disturbing your cultivation.

463
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,930
(Oh no, it's that little boy.)

464
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,220
Miss Fairy,

465
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,260
my aunt is on the brink of death,

466
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,200
please grant me the medicine.

467
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:27,070
I can't.

468
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,330
That medicine

469
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:30,500
is a relic from my master

470
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,570
and cannot be given casually.

471
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,100
Fairy, please save my aunt.

472
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,690
She's still waiting for me to return.

473
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,620
If I don't get the medicine,

474
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,860
what should I do?

475
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:44,050
Well, um...

476
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:47,660
Don't be too sad.

477
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,530
Actually,

478
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,100
there's another way...

479
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:57,140
Miss Fairy,

480
00:28:57,710 --> 00:28:58,860
please have mercy.

481
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,930
But...

482
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,290
Ling'er,

483
00:29:02,990 --> 00:29:04,260
where are you?

484
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,110
Come with me.

485
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:07,690
If Grandma finds out, she'll kill you.

486
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,300
Wait here for a while.

487
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,290
Grandma will leave soon.

488
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,900
Ling'er!

489
00:29:19,470 --> 00:29:20,620
Ling'er!

490
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:34,930
Ling'er!

491
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,530
Ling'er!

492
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,930
I have a candy here.

493
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,050
Do you want it?

494
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:59,980
No, I don't eat things from strangers.

495
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,930
Cherry candy.

496
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:08,100
Cherry candy?

497
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,500
If you don't eat it,

498
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:16,830
I'll eat it.

499
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:18,470
It's mine then.

500
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:26,980
You...

501
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,660
Did you really eat it?

502
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:22,930
Xiaoyao.

503
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,530
Is it you,

504
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:28,930
Xiaoyao?

505
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:31,350
You...

506
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:32,810
You know me?

507
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,450
It's really you, Xiaoyao!

508
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:46,710
Xiaoyao!

509
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,140
Don't you remember me?

510
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:49,860
It's me.

511
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,210
I'm Ling'er, Zhao Ling'er.

512
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:00,380
I remember now.

513
00:32:01,830 --> 00:32:02,670
Ling'er,

514
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:03,930
we've met before.

515
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:05,900
Xiaoyao, ten years ago,

516
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,660
you also conjured up

517
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,570
a cherry candy for me like this.

518
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,500
I've remembered that taste

519
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,740
for ten years.

520
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:15,900
Ten years ago?

521
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,620
Xiaoyao,

522
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:20,330
you're really back.

523
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,860
I'll take you somewhere.

524
00:32:25,830 --> 00:32:26,690
Miss Ling'er,

525
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:30,500
but my aunt is seriously ill.

526
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:34,140
I'm sorry, Xiaoyao.

527
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,690
I got carried away with my own happiness.

528
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,500
I'll take you to get
the Purple Gold Pill right now.

529
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:42,100
Thank you, Miss Ling'er.

530
00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:45,100
Run! Be careful.

531
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,350
Xiaoyao.

532
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,530
Xiaoyao,

533
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,050
have you been wandering the world,

534
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,380
upholding justice

535
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,450
all these years?

536
00:33:04,870 --> 00:33:06,140
I wish.

537
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,900
I've just been cleaning

538
00:33:08,110 --> 00:33:10,110
and running the inn every day,

539
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:12,380
so I can't go anywhere. It's so boring.

540
00:33:13,510 --> 00:33:14,530
Xiaoyao,

541
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:18,210
do you remember

542
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:21,740
the promise you made
when you left ten years ago?

543
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,740
What promise did I make?

544
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:35,980
The rain has stopped.

545
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:39,900
Let's hurry.

546
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:40,860
Okay.

547
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,570
What promise?

548
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,330
Come on, Xiaoyao,

549
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,550
follow me.

550
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,570
This is the pill-making room.

551
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,500
Xiaoyao, this is the Purple Gold Pill.

552
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:07,620
(Purple Gold Pill)

553
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,900
This is the magic pill?

554
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,570
Once your aunt takes it,

555
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:15,310
she should recover within two hours.

556
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:16,900
Thank you, Ling'er.

557
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,250
Xiaoyao,

558
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:22,220
go back and save your aunt quickly.

559
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,010
And

560
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:26,860
don't forget our agreement.

561
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:38,810
Xiaoyao.

562
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,220
Did you

563
00:34:48,710 --> 00:34:51,140
forget our agreement?

564
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,070
No.

565
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:02,700
I just can't remember at the moment
after ten years.

566
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,110
Then,

567
00:35:07,950 --> 00:35:09,220
do you still remember

568
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:11,490
how we met

569
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:13,420
ten years ago?

570
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:15,700
Of...

571
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:17,010
Of course, I remember.

572
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:20,970
Ten years ago, you and your grandmother

573
00:35:22,550 --> 00:35:24,250
came to stay at our inn

574
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,250
in Yuhang.

575
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,220
I met you

576
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,620
and we played together.

577
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,700
If not looking back,

578
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,250
why not forget?

579
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,570
If it's not destiny,

580
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,970
why make promises?

581
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,770
There are four more lines to this,

582
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:53,420
do you know them?

583
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,250
Miss Ling'er,

584
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,660
I...

585
00:36:10,230 --> 00:36:11,070
I...

586
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:13,700
You don't know.

587
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:16,830
I'm sorry.

588
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,700
My name is Li Xiaoyao.

589
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,820
Miss Ling'er, sorry,
and thank you for the medicine.

590
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,010
You're not Xiaoyao.

591
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,220
Miss Ling'er,

592
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:00,940
I'm sorry.

593
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,810
I was just desperate for the medicine.

594
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:04,940
I didn't mean to deceive you.

595
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,140
Then why do you

596
00:37:08,620 --> 00:37:10,380
have the cherry candy made by Xiaoyao?

597
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,570
Maybe it's just a coincidence.

598
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:17,900
Ten years ago, I was only nine years old.

599
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:19,740
Miss Ling'er,

600
00:37:20,070 --> 00:37:21,490
my aunt is seriously ill.

601
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:24,050
I'll never forget you
for what you did for her.

602
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:26,530
You better leave now.

603
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,260
Grandma,

604
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,460
don't kill him.

605
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,150
Don't move.

606
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:43,750
Boy, if you dare to move again,

607
00:37:43,750 --> 00:37:45,270
I'll make sure you won't be able

608
00:37:45,270 --> 00:37:47,050
to move for the rest of your life.

609
00:37:48,270 --> 00:37:50,270
Grandma, he's not a bad person.

610
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:52,900
He came here for medicine
for his seriously ill aunt.

611
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:54,620
Ling'er.

612
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:56,970
(Grandmother)
Last time, you said the same about that boy.

613
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,290
But what happened?

614
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:00,140
He immediately brought this stranger here.

615
00:38:01,710 --> 00:38:03,310
Strangers bring calamity to the island.

616
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:04,180
He must be killed.

617
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,900
You can't kill him.

618
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,220
He…

619
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,570
He's Xiaoyao.

620
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,700
What did you say?

621
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,250
Stand up.

622
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,940
Look at me.

623
00:38:42,790 --> 00:38:43,810
Xiaoyao!

624
00:38:57,510 --> 00:38:58,570
Maybe I should stand.

625
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,380
Xiaoyao, please sit.

626
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,330
No need for formalities.

627
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,900
Serve the tea.

628
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,070
Madam,

629
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,340
you must be mistaken,
just like Miss Ling'er.

630
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:17,140
I'm not the Li Xiaoyao you know.

631
00:39:17,140 --> 00:39:18,700
I'm just a waiter at Yuhang Inn.

632
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:19,750
I came to the island

633
00:39:19,750 --> 00:39:21,340
to get medicine for my aunt.

634
00:39:21,340 --> 00:39:22,700
It's not a mistake.

635
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,750
Xiaoyao, as soon as I saw you,

636
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:29,100
I remembered everything
from ten years ago.

637
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,530
Ten years ago?

638
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,620
Ten years ago,

639
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,770
Nanzhao faced a great disaster.

640
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,810
If not for your timely rescue,

641
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:43,700
the Princess and I
wouldn't have survived until today.

642
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,070
The Princess...

643
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,570
Miss Ling'er is a princess?

644
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:51,070
Grandma,

645
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:52,500
is he

646
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,810
really Xiaoyao?

647
00:39:56,790 --> 00:39:58,010
He must be.

648
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,010
Xiaoyao,

649
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,820
you seemed to have predicted
today's situation ten years ago.

650
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,250
And your master, Lady Lingyue.

651
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:11,050
Her last words were

652
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:14,770
that the person who returns
after ten years is Li Xiaoyao.

653
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:16,020
Madam,

654
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:17,810
you're making me more confused.

655
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,380
My aunt is still sick.

656
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:20,530
Please let me go back.

657
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,810
Don't worry.

658
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,290
No matter what illness your aunt has,

659
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,550
as long as she takes the Purple Gold Pill,

660
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:28,220
she will recover immediately.

661
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:30,010
There's no rush at this moment.

662
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,310
Now,

663
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:34,940
it's time to fulfill the agreement
you and the Princess made years ago.

664
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:36,620
The agreement again...

665
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:37,490
Grandma,

666
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:39,140
he...

667
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:42,100
Is he really Xiaoyao?

668
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,220
Of course.

669
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,900
Otherwise, why would I
marry you to someone so easily?

670
00:40:49,230 --> 00:40:50,070
Marry?

671
00:40:51,510 --> 00:40:54,140
You two can get married
with me as your witness now.

672
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,030
Madam, you must be joking.

673
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,100
This is absolutely not possible.

674
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,530
Xiaoyao,

675
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,010
don't you want to marry the Princess?

676
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:05,420
It's not about that.

677
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,900
Madam, your decision is too hasty.

678
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,990
I can't continue to pretend
to be someone I'm not

679
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:11,330
and deceive you and Miss Ling'er.

680
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,500
Alright.

681
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,900
Let the Princess take you somewhere.

682
00:41:21,230 --> 00:41:22,140
Once you get there,

683
00:41:22,710 --> 00:41:23,970
you will understand.

684
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,660
Xiaoyao,

685
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:27,250
please come with me.

686
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:38,500
Xiaoyao,

687
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:42,140
go ahead.

688
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:44,140
The Princess is waiting for you.

689
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:47,940
Alright.

690
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:57,900
Go ahead.

691
00:41:58,710 --> 00:41:59,730
Once you get there,

692
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:03,140
