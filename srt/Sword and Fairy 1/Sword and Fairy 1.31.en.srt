00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:40,780
=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:48,100
Since ancient times, humans and demons
have walked on different paths.

4
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,130
Why must you both be so stubborn?

5
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,620
Get up.

6
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,250
I don't care
if Ling'er is human or demon.

7
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,490
I only distinguish good from evil,

8
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,920
not human from the demon.

9
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:05,900
You...

10
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:07,330
What did you say?

11
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:09,410
In this world,

12
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,410
there are heartless humans,

13
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,710
yet there are also deeply devoted demons.

14
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,450
What truly defines a demon?

15
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,840
What defines a devil?

16
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,560
These are your words.

17
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,120
Is it really more important

18
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,480
to distinguish human from the demon
than good from evil?

19
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:40,690
To only distinguish good from evil,

20
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:43,480
not human from the demon.

21
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,120
After decades,

22
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:48,530
I didn't expect

23
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,890
to hear the same words

24
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,170
in the same place.

25
00:02:58,770 --> 00:02:59,780
Was there someone else before

26
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,330
who entered the Demon-Locking Tower?

27
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,120
Kid,

28
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:05,690
you both

29
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,220
should get up.

30
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:09,970
Sir,

31
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,020
who was that person
who entered the Demon-Locking Tower?

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,970
And why did he go in?

33
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:17,970
For hundreds of years,

34
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:21,610
no one has ever come out alive.

35
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,410
Even my...

36
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,690
Even that person,

37
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,170
he also

38
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,640
never returned.

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,020
There was a disciple from Mount Shu

40
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,610
named Jiang Che,

41
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:53,850
a rare genius of Mount Shu
in a hundred years.

42
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,430
(Jiang Che)
He was the most talented disciple.

43
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:04,250
All disciples of that time
took him as their role model.

44
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,640
Jiang, well done!

45
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,820
Good, good!

46
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,410
Jiang is amazing!

47
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:09,970
Jiang is amazing!

48
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,920
Jiang! Jiang!

49
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,140
Amazing, Jiang!

50
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,920
- Amazing, Jiang!
- Jiang!

51
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,570
Master, I'm here
to welcome you out of seclusion.

52
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,210
This sword seems very fated to you.

53
00:05:30,210 --> 00:05:33,040
Master, what is the name
of this precious sword?

54
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,530
This is the Seven-Star Sword.

55
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,530
That year, demons
troubled the mortal realm,

56
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,920
so Mount Shu sent disciples
to exterminate them.

57
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:46,920
Jiang was the disciple
favored by the Head,

58
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:50,050
and that was his last trial

59
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:52,010
before inheriting the position
of the Head.

60
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,600
Jiang, Jiang, wait for me.

61
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,220
Situ,

62
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,600
you're planning to go down the mountain
behind Master's back again.

63
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,770
I just want to go down the mountain
with you,

64
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,290
and together we can subdue demons

65
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:06,380
and uphold justice.

66
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:08,690
As for Master,

67
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:09,970
let him blame me if he wants.

68
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,920
You want to go, so I have to agree?

69
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,700
Jiang, I won't drink.

70
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,380
If you can finish this jug of wine,

71
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:23,760
I'll agree to let you come with me.

72
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,700
Your wine isn't tasty.

73
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,640
When you learn to appreciate wine,

74
00:06:35,210 --> 00:06:36,090
then go down the mountain.

75
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:41,330
Everyone thought Jiang

76
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:43,640
would become the future
Head of Mount Shu.

77
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,780
But no one could anticipate

78
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:47,810
that after he went down the mountain,
he never returned.

79
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,490
What came back to Mount Shu

80
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:54,160
were only rumors
that he had joined forces with demons.

81
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,980
Jiang.

82
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:04,880
Situ?

83
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,980
Jiang,

84
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,100
I heard people say
you were bewitched by a demoness

85
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
and had fallen into the demonic path.

86
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,760
I couldn't believe it was true.

87
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,820
Jiang,

88
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,040
come back to Mount Shu with me.

89
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,590
I'll explain everything to Master.

90
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:18,850
Let's go.

91
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,330
Honey.

92
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:24,380
Situ.

93
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,260
Situ.

94
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,760
My wife

95
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,290
is indeed from the Demon Clan.

96
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,200
You've fallen into the demonic path?

97
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,490
Whether it's the human realm
or the demonic path,

98
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:38,320
it doesn't concern me.

99
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,490
Situ, it's getting late.

100
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:45,410
I should be going back.

101
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,320
You should go back early too.

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,970
Back then,

103
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:00,770
I thought Jiang

104
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:03,690
was bewitched by the demon
to act this way.

105
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,050
- To bring Jiang back to his senses.
- Master,

106
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,500
- I immediately returned to Mount Shu.
- I've found Jiang.

107
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,900
I reported Jiang's hideout

108
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,770
- to the Head of Mount Shu,
- Disciples for the Formation. - Yes.

109
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,690
- not expecting it to lead to a tragedy.
- Go and capture the demoness Yue Rouxia.

110
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,530
After that demoness was captured
in the Demon-Locking Tower,

111
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:28,130
Jiang, as if possessed,
stormed up Mount Shu.

112
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,880
After injuring many disciples,

113
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:45,000
he arrived at the Demon-Locking Tower.

114
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,450
Who are you,

115
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:51,880
daring to intrude upon Mount Shu

116
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,390
and harming my fellow disciples?

117
00:08:57,650 --> 00:08:58,490
Jiang?

118
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,120
Mount Shu

119
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,020
is the worst place in the world

120
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,340
where people blindly
seek fame and fortune.

121
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,180
Jiang.

122
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,370
Jiang,

123
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,690
you have already
been expelled from the sect.

124
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,020
Please leave now.

125
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:20,170
I only want to rescue my wife.

126
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,410
Given the current situation,

127
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:23,490
do you still want to ally with demons?

128
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:25,530
I am a demon.

129
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:27,560
I am a devil.

130
00:09:27,730 --> 00:09:29,650
Capture me
in the Demon-Locking Tower too.

131
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,490
Jiang,

132
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,560
if you continue to be obstinate,

133
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,000
don't blame us
for disregarding past friendships.

134
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:38,800
I'll kill everyone who tries to stop me,

135
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:40,800
no matter if it's people or Buddhas.

136
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,900
Jiang, don't rush in.

137
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,120
If you do, you'll truly become a demon.

138
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,050
I only distinguish good from evil,

139
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,220
not human from the demon.

140
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,060
Jiang!

141
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,410
Jiang, no!

142
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,380
That year,
Jiang entered the Demon-Locking Tower

143
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,090
to save that demoness,

144
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,360
and to stop him,

145
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,790
the disciples of Mount Shu
followed him in,

146
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,530
resulting in no survivors.

147
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,000
After that battle,

148
00:10:46,410 --> 00:10:47,440
Mount Shu

149
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,970
fell into decline,

150
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,580
so Master made a decision

151
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,730
that no one from the sect

152
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,680
should enter the Demon-Locking Tower.

153
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:03,680
Since you haven't taken me
as a disciple,

154
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,290
I am not a disciple of Mount Shu.

155
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:07,930
Sir, I hope

156
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,320
that you will let me in.

157
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,880
You're determined on this?

158
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,530
Sir,

159
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,580
my mind is made up.

160
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
You...

161
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,580
Alright, alright.

162
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,050
If you can withstand three of my moves,

163
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:27,290
I'll let you in.

164
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,410
Kid, in martial arts,
speed is of the essence.

165
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:24,020
Would you like to experience

166
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:26,560
my Drunken Immortal Gazing
at the Moon Step?

167
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,420
Watch the sword!

168
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,370
What kind of move is this? It's so fast!

169
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,340
Complicated things
are usually unbelievably simple.

170
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,370
Have you ever heard

171
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,170
of the Immortal Cloud Technique?

172
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,680
The Immortal Cloud Technique.

173
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,970
The Drunken Immortal Gazing
at the Moon Step.

174
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:11,930
Quick, quick, quick!

175
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:28,560
Kid, it seems you're quite talented.

176
00:13:28,850 --> 00:13:29,730
Alright.

177
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,170
I'll teach you one last move.

178
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,530
If the heavens didn't love wine,
there would be no wine star in the sky.

179
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:53,260
If the earth didn't love wine,
there would be no wine springs on the ground.

180
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:56,170
Since heaven and earth both love wine,
loving wine is not contrary to the heavens.

181
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:59,530
It's said that clear wines are like saints,
while turbid ones are like wise men.

182
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:02,580
Since both saints and wise men are in a drink,
why then pray to immortals and gods?

183
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,580
Three drinks comprehend Confucianism,
and a jar of wine unites with Taoist nature.

184
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,850
I can only appreciate joy in wine
and cannot share it with those who are sober.

185
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,050
The Spell of the God of Wine.

186
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,410
Kid, get this drink.

187
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:06,860
Thank you, Master...

188
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,190
Sir, thank you for your generous teaching.

189
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,180
Kid,

190
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,420
how does it feel?

191
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:15,850
The power is immense, right?

192
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,020
This is the Spell of the God of Wine.

193
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:19,860
The Spell of God of Wine?

194
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:24,530
This spell is immensely powerful,

195
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:25,850
but remember,

196
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,090
you can only use it nine times
in your lifetime,

197
00:15:28,090 --> 00:15:30,240
or you will exhaust your breath and die.

198
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:32,730
Each time you use it,

199
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:35,610
it will deplete all your vital qi,

200
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,900
so you can only use it

201
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,440
in dire situations.

202
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,250
Understood.

203
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
Thank you, sir.

204
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,170
You've already taken three of my moves.

205
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:54,050
As we agreed earlier,

206
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,730
you may proceed as you wish.

207
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,250
Thank you, sir.

208
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,680
We will definitely come out alive.

209
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,240
Kid, I hope

210
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,640
you can keep your word.

211
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:14,450
When I come out,

212
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,640
I want to formally
take you as my master.

213
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,000
It's up to fate. It's up to fate.

214
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:44,000
It's fine that the Tower looks strange,

215
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,640
but it doesn't even have a door.

216
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,530
Just this Bagua pattern.

217
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,240
Could there be some secret to it?

218
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,130
Maybe.

219
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,920
The symbols on this Bagua pattern

220
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,130
might be the way into the Tower.

221
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,340
Be careful.

222
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,680
Just as the Book Immortal said,

223
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,800
these spells are set
by the King of Prison himself,

224
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,440
absolutely impossible to unravel.

225
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,440
Someone has entered the Tower.

226
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,170
It must be Li Xiaoyao.

227
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,280
I want to bring him to you.

228
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,340
Wan'er,

229
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,490
did Xiaoyao enter the Tower?

230
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,560
Wan'er, make him leave now.

231
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,130
Li Xiaoyao is willing to go
through fire and water for you.

232
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,440
He surely won't regret it,
even if he has to die.

233
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,700
But

234
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,370
I don't want Xiaoyao to get hurt.

235
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,040
Wan'er, I beg you.

236
00:18:33,290 --> 00:18:34,160
I beg you.

237
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:37,130
But once you enter the Tower,
you can't get out.

238
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,650
This is the Demon-Locking Tower, right?

239
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,970
Book Immortal, tell me.

240
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,610
If you like someone

241
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,370
and think of him every day,

242
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:17,250
why don't you want to see him then?

243
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:21,770
Who do you like?
That guy who just arrived?

244
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:22,890
Not me.

245
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:27,800
You mean the one
locked at the very bottom?

246
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,850
I advise you to mind your own business.

247
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,130
Book Immortal, just tell me.

248
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:41,410
Why doesn't Linger
want to see Li Xiaoyao?

249
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,280
How should I know?

250
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,920
If she doesn't want to see him,

251
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,970
then I'll bring him here to see her.

252
00:19:52,290 --> 00:19:53,220
Once they meet,

253
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:55,010
everything can be clarified.

254
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,850
Don't meddle.

255
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,060
But

256
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,970
they aren't from the Demon-Locking Tower.

257
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:06,980
Does it matter
if he's from the Tower or not?

258
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,280
Once he's in, he can't get out.

259
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:15,440
We've walked so long,

260
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,250
yet there's no end, no demons,

261
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:20,320
and no sign of Ling'er.

262
00:20:23,410 --> 00:20:24,800
Look, there's a bridge ahead.

263
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,460
I suppose the Bagua pattern
on the other side of the bridge

264
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,390
is the entrance to the next level
of the Demon-Locking Tower.

265
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,160
Why is there a stone statue
in the middle of the bridge?

266
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,790
Be careful. There might be traps.

267
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,280
What is that?

268
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,440
Looks like a demon.

269
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,490
We need to cross the bridge.

270
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,160
If you don't want to die, make way.

271
00:21:11,290 --> 00:21:13,740
I don't mean to block your way,

272
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:16,090
(Pondering Ghost)
I just have a puzzle.

273
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:18,010
What's your puzzle?

274
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,890
You can tell us.

275
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:21,440
Maybe we can help you.

276
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,370
Well,

277
00:21:23,770 --> 00:21:25,130
tell me.

278
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:27,250
Should I step
with my left foot first or my right foot

279
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,280
when I leave here?

280
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,090
Well.

281
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,340
The left foot.

282
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,520
The left?

283
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:37,620
Why not the right foot?

284
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,050
Stepping out with the right foot
would get me there too.

285
00:21:40,050 --> 00:21:41,680
Why start with the left?

286
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,060
Then it doesn't matter.

287
00:21:43,290 --> 00:21:45,010
Use whichever foot you're used to.

288
00:21:45,010 --> 00:21:46,890
How can it not matter?

289
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,370
If you don't move,

290
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:49,860
I'll chop off both your feet.

291
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:51,620
Even if you cut off my feet,

292
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:54,160
my puzzle remains unanswered.

293
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,250
Since

294
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,770
you don't know the order,

295
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:01,160
why don't you just go together?

296
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:04,520
Together?

297
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:05,660
Exactly.

298
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,410
Since you don't care about the order,

299
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,610
just use the feet together.

300
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:10,890
That's right.

301
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:12,370
It's been five hundred years,

302
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:14,560
and I finally have the answer
to my question.

303
00:22:15,530 --> 00:22:16,770
So, can you let us through now?

304
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:18,970
Well, no.

305
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,100
Which direction

306
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,770
should both my feet go to?

307
00:22:21,770 --> 00:22:23,320
The left or the right?

308
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,540
You...

309
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,090
Bao Pu,

310
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,720
you really are inside
the Demon-Locking Tower.

311
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:46,650
Li Xiaoyao,

312
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,890
I failed to lure you
into the Tower before,

313
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,770
but I didn't expect you
to come to me willingly.

314
00:22:52,010 --> 00:22:54,040
The one who bewitched Tai Wu
to hurt me was you!

315
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,440
Give me the Spiritual Bead,

316
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,730
and I will spare your life.

317
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:57,780
Why waste words?

318
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:33,370
How did he become so powerful?

319
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,890
He has been a demon.

320
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:42,500
If you don't move aside, he'll kill us.

321
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,650
But you haven't given me the answer yet.

322
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,370
Savage girl, give me the whip.

323
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:04,370
I have a question.

324
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,010
Good thing they didn't follow us.

325
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:25,560
We must find Ling'er quickly.

326
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,090
What a lousy man.

327
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,250
Always chasing the new.

328
00:24:46,530 --> 00:24:47,920
You weren't hurt just now, were you?

329
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,100
How could I be hurt?

330
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,890
I'm the heroine
and have such high martial arts skills.

331
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,730
Yes, yes, yes.

332
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,560
You're the best. Let's go, heroine.

333
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,580
Here...

334
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,250
Why are there so many jars?

335
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:05,730
Right.

336
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:07,890
Nobody is pickling vegetables here, right?

337
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,420
Right.

338
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,560
I once heard

339
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,090
that long ago, a great demon

340
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:22,160
was sucked into a Demon-Locking Jar
to save a friend

341
00:25:23,130 --> 00:25:24,800
and has been trapped inside ever since.

342
00:25:25,370 --> 00:25:27,610
Do you think one of these jars
could be that jar?

343
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,130
As you said,

344
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:32,610
he was trapped in the jar
trying to save his friend.

345
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,730
He must have been loyal and righteous.

346
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,770
If he really is here, let's find him and ask.

347
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,770
He might tell us where Ling'er is.

348
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,520
Hey, girl,

349
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,040
are you crazy?

350
00:26:07,290 --> 00:26:08,850
You scared me to death.

351
00:26:10,370 --> 00:26:13,010
"Ah, girls, do not take
your pleasure with men!"

352
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,490
"A man can take pleasure
and get away with it,

353
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,580
but a girl will never get away with it."

354
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,320
What?

355
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,740
"How happy we were when we were young,
and how fondly we talked and laughed."

356
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,900
"How solemnly we swore to be true,
not realizing the feud was forging."

357
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,300
"I must think no more of the past,
and just leave it be since it's all over."

358
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,460
What are you talking about?

359
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,380
The books record
Wei Sheng's eternal love,

360
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,430
the romantic stories
between phoenixes, heavenly couples,

361
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:32,680
and the Cowherd and the Weaver Girl.

362
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,620
That's all nonsense.

363
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,530
Men's affections are never fixed.

364
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:37,920
- You too.
- Me?

365
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,100
I'm not that shallow.

366
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,730
The books contain everything.

367
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,560
Girl, what did you see

368
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,090
that made you so angry?

369
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,400
Li Xiaoyao

370
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,440
brought another woman with him.

371
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:55,130
They were so intimate.

372
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,650
Poor Ling'er is still
worried about his safety.

373
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,090
This is what the book says.

374
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,010
He sees only the new lover smiling,

375
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:02,850
never hearing the old one cry.

376
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,560
This is called loving the new
and loathing the old.

377
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:06,610
Exactly, exactly.

378
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,020
Loving the new and loathing the old.

379
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,370
No matter if he loathes the old

380
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:10,800
or loves the new,

381
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:12,370
what does it have to do with you?

382
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:13,370
I don't care.

383
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,800
Book Immortal, you must help me
with something.

384
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,130
Me?

385
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,920
- No, no, no.
- Will you help or not?

386
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,970
Show mercy. What do you want me to do?

387
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,680
Test Li Xiaoyao for me.

388
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:45,940
Luojiao,

389
00:27:46,170 --> 00:27:47,010
you're awake.

390
00:27:49,890 --> 00:27:50,770
A'nu.

391
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,280
Master.

392
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,420
Master.

393
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:04,200
Hurry and see how Luojiao is.

394
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:09,970
The knife wound on Luojiao
is not serious.

395
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,580
But

396
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,520
the knife was poisoned

397
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,520
with one of the seven ancient poisons,
Peacock Gall.

398
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:20,200
There is no cure.

399
00:28:23,530 --> 00:28:24,370
It can't be.

400
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,460
Luojiao,

401
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:27,200
you'll surely be fine.

402
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:28,820
Master,

403
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:31,040
please think of a way to save her.

404
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,580
That's impossible.

405
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,410
You had a cure
for the Golden Silkworm Venom,

406
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,850
so you must have one for this poison.

407
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,250
Master,

408
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,970
if not, I will help you find the antidote.

409
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:43,040
The one who poisoned her
must have it.

410
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:44,780
Luojiao,

411
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:46,560
who hurt you?

412
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,560
Gui Ying.

413
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,340
Gui Ying?

414
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,180
Master,

415
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,700
Bai Yue...

416
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,650
A'nu, I have prepared

417
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,700
the medicine Luojiao needs.

418
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,040
Go and make it now.

419
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,730
A'nu,

420
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,300
don't worry.

421
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:12,370
Master will think of something.

422
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,540
Master,

423
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:32,090
Bai Yue is trying to resurrect
the Water Demon Beast.

424
00:29:33,370 --> 00:29:34,770
Following Bai Yue's men,

425
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,250
I found a subterranean palace

426
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,440
built under the imperial palace.

427
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:42,490
In the palace,

428
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:45,280
there is a large pool.

429
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,730
From the water,

430
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,560
I could faintly hear

431
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,770
the roar of a beast.

432
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,340
Master,

433
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,160
can the Water Demon Beast

434
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,160
really be resurrected?

435
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:02,650
Legend says the Water Demon Beast
is reborn upon encountering water.

436
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:05,250
Nanzhao has been in drought for years.

437
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:08,200
Surely it's related.

438
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:10,740
You said last time

439
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,730
that Bai Yue
destroyed the Queen's statue,

440
00:30:14,050 --> 00:30:16,090
yet did not kill you.

441
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,490
It seems

442
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:22,680
he must have found a way
to resurrect the Water Demon Beast.

443
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
Then, Master,

444
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,520
we must stop him.

445
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,560
Ten years ago,

446
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,730
the Water Demon Beast wreaked havoc,

447
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,520
and the living suffered.

448
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:34,370
If Bai Yue

449
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,770
can truly resurrect
the Water Demon Beast,

450
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,200
then the world

451
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:41,920
will never have peace again.

452
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,700
Master,

453
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,530
we must quickly destroy
the subterranean palace

454
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,770
and eliminate the Water Demon Beast.

455
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,610
But Gui Ying is dead now.

456
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:53,010
Bai Yue will surely send heavy troops
to guard it.

457
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:55,780
The Lady of the South was framed by him
and lost her military power,

458
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:58,320
and A'nu should not risk herself.

459
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,040
Now, the situation is so critical.

460
00:31:02,650 --> 00:31:04,440
Master, what should we do?

461
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,650
Right now,

462
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:10,200
we have only one person we can rely on.

463
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:19,130
Master,

464
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:21,520
A'nu just told me

465
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:24,520
you can cure Tang Yu
of the Golden Silkworm Venom?

466
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,650
In this world,

467
00:31:29,250 --> 00:31:30,850
only one person

468
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,370
can cure this.

469
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,770
Bai Yue.

470
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:45,010
Luojiao will surely be fine.

471
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,920
Master will surely cure her.

472
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,340
A'nu,

473
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:02,490
let's leave.

474
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,200
Leave?

475
00:32:07,290 --> 00:32:08,130
Leave this place.

476
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:09,940
Leave Nanzhao.

477
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,160
Tang Yu,

478
00:32:16,290 --> 00:32:17,770
we haven't found
the Five Spiritual Beads yet,

479
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,200
the drought in Nanzhao hasn't eased,

480
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:21,820
Bai Yue hasn't been eradicated,

481
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:22,660
and now,

482
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,740
Luojiao has suffered
such serious injuries.

483
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:26,370
How can we leave now?

484
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:32,370
Once everything settles,

485
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,920
we can be together forever.

486
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,400
I'm afraid you'll get hurt again.

487
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,700
I'm not afraid.

488
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,920
As long as you are always by my side,

489
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:54,320
I fear nothing.

490
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,180
A'nu.

491
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:13,460
Master.

492
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,040
Come with me to the Sacred Woods

493
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,200
to look for Dragon's Saliva Grass.

494
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:21,440
Hurry and deliver the medicine
to Luojiao.

495
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,130
I will be back soon.

496
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,210
Let's go, Master.

497
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:55,890
General Gai,

498
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,730
it's your medicine.

499
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:00,090
Tang Yu.

500
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,980
Your Golden Silkworm Venom

501
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,820
has been cured?

502
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,720
As far as I know,

503
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,090
this Golden Silkworm Venom

504
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:19,520
can only be cured
by one person in the world.

505
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,170
Do you know who that person is?

506
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:25,900
Bai Yue.

507
00:34:26,890 --> 00:34:28,850
Mr. Shi was right to doubt you.

508
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,170
In Yunmeng Marsh,

509
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:37,040
it was you
who passed the message to Bai Yue.

510
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:40,970
Yes.

511
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,650
From the beginning,

512
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:47,090
you have been monitoring

513
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:49,210
every move of A'nu and Princess Ling'er.

514
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:52,650
No wonder Bai Yue knows everything so well.

515
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:57,240
Do you know

516
00:34:58,090 --> 00:35:01,130
how the Water Demon Beast wreaked havoc
in Nanzhao ten years ago?

517
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,800
How many people died because of it?

518
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,540
Tang Yu,

519
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,450
why do you help the tyrant?

520
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:24,720
Ten years ago,

521
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,850
my parents were killed
by the people of Nanzhao,

522
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:31,780
just because they thought
we were from the Central Plains

523
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,420
and took business away
from the people of Nanzhao.

524
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,650
Since then I've been on the streets,

525
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:37,450
suffering all hardships.

526
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,800
Have you ever eaten rice
filled with insects?

527
00:35:44,570 --> 00:35:46,760
Have you ever been pushed
into a lake in winter?

528
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,480
I hate Nanzhao.

529
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:52,210
I hate all of you.

530
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,800
No one cared whether I lived or died.

531
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:02,010
Only him.

532
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:04,260
Only that Bai Yue

533
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,560
you speak of as utterly evil.

534
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,780
He was the only one
who treated me like a human.

535
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,280
He gave me clean food to eat

536
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,410
and warm clothes to wear,

537
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,610
and taught me martial arts.

538
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Tang Yu,

539
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,930
the world indeed is full
of injustice and prejudice,

540
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:57,850
but you must believe

541
00:36:58,220 --> 00:36:59,890
not everyone is like that.

542
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:07,900
I understand

543
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,890
Bai Yue has been good to you,

544
00:37:14,330 --> 00:37:15,720
but have you ever thought

545
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:18,410
how many people

546
00:37:18,450 --> 00:37:19,810
have been harmed by him
like your parents?

547
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:20,890
Shut up!

548
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:33,800
I'm dying.

549
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:36,210
My life doesn't matter.

550
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,280
But I ask you one thing

551
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,040
that could save Nanzhao

552
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,240
and A'nu.

553
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,820
A'nu?

554
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,620
Please

555
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:04,650
stop Bai Yue from resurrecting
the Water Demon Beast.

556
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,000
The Water Demon Beast?

557
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,370
Wasn't it

558
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:09,650
sealed by the Witch Queen?

559
00:38:11,370 --> 00:38:12,720
Bai Yue has kept the Water Demon Beast

560
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:14,790
captive in the subterranean palace

561
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:16,720
beneath the Nanzhao Imperial Palace,

562
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:18,780
and

563
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:20,370
it seems he has already found a way

564
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:21,690
to resurrect the Water Demon Beast.

565
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,410
Destroying the Queen's statue

566
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:26,090
was the first step.

567
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:28,690
In Yunmeng Marsh,

568
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:31,090
intentionally letting us live

569
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,370
was the second step.

570
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,450
But I hope you will find

571
00:38:36,810 --> 00:38:38,240
the exact reason.

572
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,370
If it is indeed so,

573
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,800
you must stop Bai Yue.

574
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,090
Once the Water Demon Beast
is resurrected,

575
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:51,240
no one will survive,

576
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:52,690
including A'nu.

577
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,340
No.

578
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,340
It can't be.

579
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:08,970
Tang Yu,

580
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:12,130
the hope of Nanzhao is entrusted to you.

581
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:14,900
Please.

582
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,300
General Gai,

583
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,650
why would you trust your enemy?

584
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:50,210
It's just a gamble,

585
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,130
but this bet

586
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:56,930
is for the lives of all the people

587
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,280
and A'nu.

588
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:05,480
I know that A'nu likes you,

589
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,320
and you like her.

590
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,560
But A'nu

591
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:12,800
is the young master

592
00:40:13,890 --> 00:40:15,450
and the hope of the Witch Moon Sect.

593
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,210
If you really care about her,

594
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:20,730
I hope

595
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:26,280
you can leave her.

596
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,620
Tang Yu,

597
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,380
you're back.

598
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:08,170
Chief,

599
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:11,680
is it the Water Demon Beast

600
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:13,090
under the water?

601
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:16,690
When it caused floods years ago,

602
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:18,370
the people of Nanzhao were displaced.

603
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,780
If it is reborn,

604
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,280
Nanzhao will once again be in turmoil.

605
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,650
Please think twice, Chief.

606
00:41:22,650 --> 00:41:25,280
This water can save

607
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,760
and harm people.

608
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:30,240
Everyone knows

609
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:32,760
the Water Demon Beast
once flooded Nanzhao,

610
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,560
but today's Nanzhao

611
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,480
just lacks water.

612
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,540
But

613
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,480
if the Water Demon Beast is reborn,

614
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:49,480
the people of Nanzhao...

615
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:50,580
That's right.

616
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:54,040
Tang Yu, think about it.

617
00:41:55,170 --> 00:41:57,450
Water can exist without people,

618
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:00,320
but can people live without water?

619
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,210
Floods

620
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:03,860
or droughts.

621
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,960
Given the choice,

622
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,090
what would you do?

623
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:18,970
Chief,

624
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,060
I...

625
00:42:25,850 --> 00:42:26,720
Child,

626
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:29,170
in other words,

627
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:31,130
between Luojiao and A'nu,

628
00:42:32,370 --> 00:42:34,650
if you must choose,

629
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,560
