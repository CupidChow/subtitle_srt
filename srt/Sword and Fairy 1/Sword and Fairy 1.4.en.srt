=Episode 4=

3
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:09,750
Ling'er.

4
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,150
Ling'er.

5
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,620
Ling'er, what happened?

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:22,370
Xiaoyao, this is great.

7
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,260
I'm so glad you're alive.

8
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,540
Ling'er,

9
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,420
did you do something to me?

10
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:38,340
That woman just stabbed me.

11
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,770
How come I'm all right now?

12
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,700
Let me get you up.

13
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,620
Come on.

14
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,150
Ling'er,

15
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,290
did you use any witchcraft to save me?

16
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:01,570
I used the Resurrection Spell.

17
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,460
The Resurrection Spell?

18
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,850
A healing technique my master taught me.

19
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:09,460
Before, I failed to master it.

20
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:11,770
When I saw you pass out, I was so worried

21
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,420
that I tried this technique.

22
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,130
Thank you, Ling'er.

23
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,260
But I've heard

24
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:29,340
forcibly using an unmastered witchcraft

25
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,930
will easily make someone lose his mind.

26
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,060
From now on,

27
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,820
don't risk your life anymore.

28
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,580
How do you feel now?

29
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,620
Would you like some rest?

30
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,260
No need.

31
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,850
I just exhausted some spiritual power.

32
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,260
Are you sure?

33
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:58,730
Mad girl...

34
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,540
You'd better wish I wouldn't see you again.

35
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:04,860
Ling'er, it's getting late.

36
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,270
It's too dangerous to stay here.

37
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,580
Let's get to Suzhou City early.

38
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,420
All right.

39
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,670
What's wrong?

40
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,370
Snake Demon! Snake Demon!

41
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,890
I'm fine, Xiaoyao.

42
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,930
Just some numbness in my feet.

43
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,490
Then walk slowly. I'll help you.

44
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:35,270
It's all right, Xiaoyao.

45
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,980
Don't worry. I'm fine.

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:39,020
All right.

47
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,260
Where's he?

48
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,740
This is his blood.

49
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:10,580
Miss, there isn't too much blood.

50
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:12,900
But I'm sure

51
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,650
I just pierced his body.

52
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,620
Miss, he didn't lose too much blood

53
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,500
and he left safely.

54
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,300
It means he wasn't in great danger.

55
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,370
But I stabbed him...

56
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:25,710
It's all right.

57
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,100
Fine. He's just lucky enough.

58
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:36,780
(Suzhou City)

59
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,180
Where are you from?

60
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,400
Why do you want to get into Suzhou City?

61
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:52,450
We're from Yuhang Town
and we want to get accommodation.

62
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,060
In you go.

63
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:56,540
Lately, there have been snakes around.

64
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,860
Take care of your wife.

65
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:02,230
All right.

66
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,180
Thanks.

67
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,180
(Xiangyu Inn)

68
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,100
Come in, please.

69
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,900
Come in.

70
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:14,830
Lady and gentleman,

71
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:15,860
welcome.

72
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,110
What do you want, food or accommodation?

73
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,300
Accommodation. Two rooms, please.

74
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,370
Gentleman, are you here
for the combat for marriage?

75
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,580
- No.
- Then sorry.

76
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,450
Our guest rooms are full.

77
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,820
Full?

78
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,930
No way.

79
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,020
For the next seven days,

80
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,540
all the guest rooms in town have been taken.

81
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:37,650
All the guest rooms?

82
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:38,860
Who did that?

83
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,370
Mr. Lin of Lin Fortress.

84
00:06:41,590 --> 00:06:43,300
At this time every year,

85
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,460
he holds a combat for marriage

86
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,150
and rents all the guest rooms

87
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,670
for participants coming from other places

88
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:50,580
free of charge.

89
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,950
I'm not a participant.

90
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,420
How about I pay for the rooms?

91
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,870
Landlord, if the rooms aren't full,

92
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,990
please give us one room.

93
00:06:58,990 --> 00:06:59,860
Miss,

94
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:01,900
it's not that I don't give you a room.

95
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,620
But Mr. Lin has paid for the rooms.

96
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,490
He's taken all the rooms.

97
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,340
Let's go, then.

98
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:15,900
(Lin Fortress)

99
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,860
Wait. Stop.

100
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,300
Miss.

101
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,140
Listen.

102
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,540
The man is about 5.4 chi tall

103
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,150
and he looks poor.

104
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,260
He has a sword wound.

105
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:35,740
The girl is as elegant and beautiful as me.

106
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:37,780
Get them to me at whatever cost.

107
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,620
Yes.

108
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:40,670
Yueru.

109
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:45,100
(Lin Tiannan)
Made some trouble again?

110
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:46,550
Father.

111
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,330
I told you

112
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:51,210
not to make trouble out of home.

113
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,740
I didn't make trouble.

114
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,900
Confess.

115
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,540
The east or the west of the city?

116
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,330
I went out of the city.

117
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,740
Out of the city?

118
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,620
Some girls have been missing.

119
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,220
How dare you go out of the city?

120
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,900
Father, I'm no longer a kid.

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,210
I can be responsible for whatever I do.

122
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:12,230
Just leave me alone.

123
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:15,340
Don't blame me for being nagging.

124
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,710
Your mother died at a young age.

125
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,260
If I don't bother about you,

126
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,670
who else will?

127
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:21,420
The combat for marriage will be held tomorrow.

128
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,610
As long as you get a good husband,

129
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,930
I won't worry about you anymore.

130
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,060
I'm not getting married, anyway.

131
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,830
I made inquiries.

132
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:33,660
This time, a lot of great young men have come.

133
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:35,420
Someone will satisfy you, I believe.

134
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,420
Who knows

135
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,030
what they really want to be,

136
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:40,380
your son-in-law or my husband?

137
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,150
Aren't they just the same?

138
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,210
You just wish.

139
00:08:44,910 --> 00:08:45,750
Yueru.

140
00:08:48,350 --> 00:08:49,190
Chief Lin,

141
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:50,650
how about we negotiate?

142
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,810
On what?

143
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,830
If no one can defeat me just as before,

144
00:08:55,830 --> 00:08:58,210
never hold this humiliating event again.

145
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,250
Why do you think it's humiliating?

146
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:03,590
I don't care. Either you listen to me

147
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:05,060
or I have to offend you.

148
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:08,500
Yueru, let's talk about this.

149
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,620
If you don't approve,

150
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,010
I'll shave my head and be a nun!

151
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:18,060
Fine. We'll do it your way.

152
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:19,900
All right.

153
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,890
Clap hands for the pledge.

154
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,300
If no one can't defeat me,

155
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,570
don't force me to get married again.

156
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,630
Deal.

157
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,380
So many sky lanterns over there.

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,100
Uphill grow trees,

159
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,570
- on the trees boughs grow.
- They're so high.

160
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,380
My heart goes to you,

161
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,230
but you don't know.

162
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:46,070
So high.

163
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:04,580
(Liu Jinyuan)

164
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:19,060
I can portray Yueru perfectly,

165
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:24,450
but I can't win her heart.

166
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:26,890
Come out here!

167
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,030
You little naughty boy!

168
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,270
(Yiyang Restaurant)
I got you at last.

169
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:33,740
You sneaked in for free food.

170
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,650
- Believe it or not, I'll kill you!
- Sir, I won't dare to steal again.

171
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:37,300
- I won't.
- What are you doing?

172
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,180
Mercy?

173
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,470
- What are you doing?
- Sir!

174
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:41,140
(Douzi)
Sir, I won't steal anymore!

175
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,500
I just won't!

176
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,100
- Why are you bullying a kid?
- You're all right now.

177
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:45,910
He stole food from my restaurant.

178
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,940
I guess I can beat him.

179
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:50,420
How much can a kid eat?

180
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,180
Are you kicking so hard to kill him?

181
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,350
Who are you, rube?

182
00:10:53,350 --> 00:10:54,740
Mind your own business. Go away.

183
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,100
How can you still be so rude?

184
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,180
Just a little money for food. I'll pay.

185
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,070
Fine.

186
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,210
If you pay,

187
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,660
I'll apologize to him.

188
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,270
- That's what you said.
- Yes.

189
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,110
How much?

190
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,020
Fifty taels.

191
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:09,990
What?

192
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:12,300
For one month, a whole family

193
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,620
only spends 1.5 taels of silver on food.

194
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,470
And you want fifty taels?

195
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:16,830
Such strong appetites!

196
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,450
He has a strong appetite, actually.

197
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,740
His stomach is like a bottomless pit.

198
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,390
If I hadn't found him in time,

199
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,950
he would have eaten everything in my kitchen.

200
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,010
How could this happen?

201
00:11:26,230 --> 00:11:27,070
You don't believe me?

202
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,450
Then ask him.

203
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,060
Kid,

204
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:36,620
where are your parents?

205
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,940
I don't know.

206
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:43,620
Why did you steal food?

207
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:47,010
I'm starving and I want more food.

208
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,500
Xiaoyao,

209
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,060
let's buy him enough food.

210
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:58,670
All right.

211
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,030
Landlord, give him enough food

212
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,060
until he gets full.

213
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:07,060
Sure. I'll go prepare the dishes.

214
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,720
Serve the dishes.

215
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,980
He almost ate up everything.

216
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,350
Kid, what's your name?

217
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,380
- Anything available, then.
- I'm Douzi.

218
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,060
You must be kidding.

219
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,030
Such a big plate of rice.

220
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,010
How can a kid like him finish it?

221
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,060
You just wait and see. You'll know.

222
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:25,980
Here. Eat.

223
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,810
Still starving?

224
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,890
Landlord, get him more food.

225
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,070
Ling'er,

226
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:24,350
if he keeps eating like this,

227
00:13:24,350 --> 00:13:25,450
we won't be able to afford the food.

228
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:27,980
Is this kid sick or something?

229
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,450
Looks like he has a Demon Worm inside him.

230
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,550
Demon Worm?

231
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,010
I read about it
in the library of Water Moon Palace.

232
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:37,500
But I can't remember very clearly.

233
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,270
So, I'm not quite sure.

234
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,620
Miss, do you mean the Gluttony Demon Worm?

235
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,300
Just now,

236
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,890
I drank too much.

237
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,820
More than too much,

238
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,260
I guess.

239
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,540
Thanks for reminding me.

240
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,060
That's exactly the Gluttony Demon Worm
I read about in the book.

241
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,380
Miss, I'm suddenly full, I think.

242
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:42,450
Douzi, come out with me.

243
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,420
This is the Gluttony Demon Worm.

244
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,940
Have a look.

245
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,690
When it gets into someone's stomach,

246
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,890
he'll always feel starving

247
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,210
as if he could never be full.

248
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:32,300
Feeling any better, Douzi?

249
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,620
Miss, I don't feel starving anymore.

250
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,230
Douzi...

251
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:42,620
I thought it was just a story in a book.

252
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,450
But it turned out to be real.

253
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:46,980
Unexpectedly, an alcoholic like you

254
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,420
has read quite a lot of books.

255
00:15:49,910 --> 00:15:50,940
You flatter me.

256
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,420
I'm just the Number One Scholar of our country.

257
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,310
Miss,

258
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,540
do you know

259
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
why this kind of demon appeared in this city?

260
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:05,570
All things reinforce and restrain each other.

261
00:16:06,030 --> 00:16:08,330
The appearance of the Gluttony Demon Worm

262
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
indicates

263
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,980
a quite strong demon nearby.

264
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:19,180
Recently, a Snake Demon has occupied
the Dragon-hidden Cave outside Suzhou City.

265
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:21,740
It invades the city repeatedly

266
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,910
and many young girls
have been missing for no reason.

267
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,250
Everyone panics.

268
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:30,650
Snake Demon! Snake Demon!

269
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,500
Gentleman,

270
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,300
I'm from Shushan Sect,
the biggest sect in the country.

271
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,420
If you need any help, let me know.

272
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,460
That'd be great.

273
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,100
I'm Liu Jinyuan.

274
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,570
And who are you?

275
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:45,830
I'm Li Xiaoyao.

276
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:46,670
And this is my...

277
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:47,900
My...

278
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,430
This is Zhao Ling'er.

279
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,980
Mr. Li.

280
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,820
Miss Zhao.

281
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,180
I'm a mere scholar

282
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,890
and I usually adore strong martial artists.

283
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,980
We really hit it off today.

284
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,530
I wonder if you'd like to drink with me.

285
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,980
Tea, I mean.

286
00:17:11,950 --> 00:17:14,780
If I knew you were Mr. Liu's friend,

287
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:17,330
I would have given you the best rooms.

288
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:18,810
Sorry about the rude welcome.

289
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:21,140
Please enjoy it.

290
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,330
This is my uncle's property.

291
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,780
You can stay without worry. Come on.

292
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:28,980
Let's drink some tea instead of wine.

293
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,500
Nice to meet you.

294
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,260
Miss Zhao looks gorgeous

295
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,210
and intelligent.

296
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:42,050
Li, you two make a perfect couple.

297
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,690
You flatter us.

298
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:49,900
We aren't a couple.

299
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:51,930
Don't be ridiculous.

300
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:10,430
Liu.

301
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,900
What's bothering you?

302
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,900
Li, I'm ashamed to say this,

303
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,620
but the girl I adore

304
00:18:18,950 --> 00:18:20,900
happens to be the daughter of my uncle.

305
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,620
Then...

306
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,330
She's your cousin, huh?

307
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:27,660
I'm in one-sided love with her.

308
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,050
But she'll have a combat for marriage tomorrow.

309
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,290
Then ask your uncle to marry her to you.

310
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,620
I tried that before.

311
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:39,500
But my uncle...

312
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:43,210
He only thinks highly of martial artists.

313
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,780
Will you just watch

314
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:50,930
when someone else marries her?

315
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,660
That may not happen, though.

316
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:57,470
But...

317
00:18:58,750 --> 00:18:59,590
What if...?

318
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,170
She must be a wonderful girl,

319
00:19:10,990 --> 00:19:12,450
so you've been

320
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,810
this obsessed with her.

321
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,100
Speaking of my cousin,

322
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:21,810
she's really extraordinary.

323
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:25,530
Though she is a lady,

324
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:30,100
she has been extremely helpful.

325
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,750
She's straightforward.

326
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,400
She loves what she loves
and hates what she hates.

327
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,870
She tries to rid the world of injustice.

328
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,100
And she's as excellent as a great man.

329
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,930
But inwardly,

330
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,690
she's very gentle, too.

331
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:55,100
Such an extraordinary lady.

332
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,140
I'm really curious

333
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,620
and how I wish I could see her!

334
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,780
Mr. Liu.

335
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,050
Mr. Liu?

336
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:05,410
Does she like you?

337
00:20:12,350 --> 00:20:13,410
I...

338
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,620
I don't know.

339
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,020
Liu,

340
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:22,110
do you want to win and marry your cousin?

341
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:23,260
Yes, of course!

342
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:24,410
- But I...
- I have a plan

343
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:26,690
to make you get what you want.

344
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,780
- I'm all ears.
- Come on.

345
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,540
(Jinyuan Inn)

346
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,410
Xiaoyao, you're awake.

347
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,450
Without my aunt's terrible morning call,

348
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,690
I really had some great sleep.

349
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:56,100
Ling'er.

350
00:20:56,870 --> 00:20:57,780
What time is it?

351
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,300
It's about the Wei Hour.
[*One in the afternoon]

352
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,500
Xiaoyao, you slept too long.

353
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,790
Where's Liu?

354
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,660
He's gone to the combat for marriage.

355
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,710
Let's go and watch.

356
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,660
We can also ask around

357
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,400
and see if any businessmen
are going to Nanzhao.

358
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,300
Make way, please.

359
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,140
Ling'er, come on.

360
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,640
Look over there.

361
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,340
(Combat for Marriage)

362
00:21:25,100 --> 00:21:26,620
(Gathering of Talents)

363
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,020
So many people are here.

364
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:29,830
So crowded.

365
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:31,050
Make way, please.

366
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,110
At this time of the year, Suzhou City...

367
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:39,060
Xiaoyao,

368
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,170
such a bustling place.

369
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,780
Martial artists came from all over the country

370
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,980
just to marry Miss Lin, huh?

371
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:47,230
I don't quite agree.

372
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:48,380
More than half of the participants

373
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,750
who have come here

374
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,590
want to take a marvelous step

375
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,050
with the help Lin Tiannan,

376
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,170
chief of his sect.

377
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:57,140
Or they just want his property.

378
00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:59,000
In my opinion, no one

379
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,630
will win this combat just like before.

380
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:01,470
Yeah.

381
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:03,750
Miss Lin has been learning

382
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:04,810
her family's great martial arts.

383
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,380
Since she was 13, no men in Suzhou City

384
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,210
have ever defeated her.

385
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,020
To beat her down

386
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,380
can be immensely difficult.

387
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:15,790
Ling'er,

388
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,230
the lady of the combat

389
00:22:18,230 --> 00:22:19,530
seems to be from a rich family, too.

390
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,810
And she can do martial arts.

391
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,570
Can she be the crazy woman we met yesterday?

392
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:25,500
No way.

393
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:27,630
According to Mr. Liu,

394
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:29,570
Miss Lin is very gentle.

395
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,260
If Miss Lin was gentle,

396
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,690
there wouldn't be any rude girl in the world.

397
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:36,230
Today,

398
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:37,350
you can see

399
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:39,380
the most fierce woman in Suzhou City.

400
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:40,290
Keep your voice down.

401
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,410
If she hears you, she'll cut your tongue.

402
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,410
Does Miss Lin have a tall and thin figure,

403
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:48,900
a long face,

404
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,980
straight eyebrows and big eyes?

405
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:52,190
Oh, she...

406
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:53,860
There she is.

407
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,620
She's coming up.

408
00:22:59,110 --> 00:22:59,950
She's up there.

409
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:03,740
Miss Lin.

410
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,460
She's up there.

411
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:08,300
(Be Wise and Brave)

412
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,290
That's really her.

413
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,620
Nice!

414
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,060
(Be Wise and Brave)

415
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,260
Miss Lin.

416
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,620
What a small world!

417
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,100
Xiaoyao,

418
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,420
how about we leave now?

419
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,260
No hurry.

420
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,690
Today, I'd like to see

421
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,050
who will marry this fierce woman.

422
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:51,930
Master Lin.

423
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,260
Dear swordsmen...

424
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,260
Master Lin.

425
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:00,550
Master Lin.

426
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,810
This is

427
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,620
a combat for my daughter's marriage.

428
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,780
Thank you all for coming

429
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:07,230
and participating

430
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:08,570
in this event.

431
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,750
This year's rule remains the same.

432
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,050
Whoever beats my daughter off the stage

433
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:17,750
will marry into my family

434
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,260
and become my son-in-law.

435
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:21,410
- Nice!
- Great!

436
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,900
There you go.

437
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:27,870
Hurry. You go first.

438
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:30,140
Why hasn't Liu come yet?

439
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,750
The combat now begins!

440
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,930
- Nice!
- Great!

441
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:38,550
I'll go first.

442
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,220
Master Lin,

443
00:24:41,990 --> 00:24:44,410
I'd like to call you Father-in-law now.

444
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,170
Come on, Miss Lin.

445
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:03,710
Next.

446
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:07,450
The pretty girl is mine.

447
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,670
Bravo.

448
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,410
Miss Lin is awesome.

449
00:25:35,350 --> 00:25:37,020
Bravo!

450
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,330
Bravo!

451
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,330
Come on, Miss Lin.

452
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,500
Get lost!

453
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:48,100
Next.

454
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:52,950
- Nice!
- Bravo!

455
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:55,620
Miss Lin has such great martial arts.

456
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,660
Impressive.

457
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,930
Will anyone else try?

458
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,430
Anybody else?

459
00:25:59,990 --> 00:26:00,900
You go there.

460
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,310
Go.

461
00:26:05,780 --> 00:26:06,810
Me!

462
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,210
I...

463
00:26:10,510 --> 00:26:12,020
I'd like to have a try!

464
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:26,930
Come on!

465
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:34,210
Come on!

466
00:26:34,990 --> 00:26:38,140
Come on!

467
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:43,380
Fight! Fight!

468
00:26:55,830 --> 00:26:56,670
Yueru.

469
00:26:57,110 --> 00:26:57,950
Jinyuan?

470
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,470
Mr. Liu is there.

471
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,450
I have faith in you.

472
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:09,670
It's him.

473
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,100
Jinyuan, why are you here?

474
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,690
To marry you, of course.

475
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,100
Get down there. Don't embarrass yourself.

476
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:23,260
Yueru, there are no restrictions

477
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,300
for the participants of this combat.

478
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,450
So, right here, I'm not your cousin,

479
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,100
but an ordinary participant.

480
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,020
Well, I won't show mercy, then.

481
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,810
Bring it on, Yueru.

482
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:53,780
- Bravo!
- Nice!

483
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:11,020
Mr. Liu turns out to be so strong.

484
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,830
I can't make you win.

485
00:28:17,830 --> 00:28:19,180
But I can make you not lose.

486
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,110
I'm all ears.

487
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,210
There are patterns for all martial arts.

488
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:24,260
As long as you remember all her moves,

489
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,620
she can hardly beat you down.

490
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,590
People don't kill in a combat.

491
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:28,470
When you aren't defeated,

492
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:29,980
you'll be winning another way, right?

493
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,210
So, you've remembered all my moves.

494
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,980
Yueru, you can't hit me.

495
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
I won't hurt you, either.

496
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:40,900
How about

497
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:42,860
you give in?

498
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:45,570
I never give in.

499
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,100
The last ten moves.

500
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:48,780
Unless I kick you off the stage,

501
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,660
you will win.

502
00:28:51,710 --> 00:28:52,740
Bring it on.

503
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,570
One, two, three...

504
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:00,740
Four, five, six...

505
00:29:01,110 --> 00:29:03,050
Seven, eight...

506
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:04,930
Nine... Nine...

507
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,260
The last move.

508
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,100
The very last.

509
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:18,820
Bravo!

510
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,740
Bravo!

511
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:25,380
Yueru.

512
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:27,470
Yueru.

513
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:31,470
Yueru.

514
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,980
Brilliant!

515
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:37,750
Fight! What are you waiting for? Fight her.

516
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,590
Yueru!

517
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,290
You'd better give in.

518
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,290
Fight.

519
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:45,980
Fight her.

520
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:52,380
Jinyuan.

521
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:24,860
Mr. Liu.

522
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,140
Liu.

523
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,020
Come on.

524
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:28,430
Mr. Liu.

525
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:30,020
Number One Scholar,

526
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,140
that was close. Why were you tempted?

527
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:35,900
Li, don't say that.

528
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,500
I really appreciate what you taught me.

529
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:41,660
I'm just not valiant enough

530
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,930
and I'm not destined to marry Yueru.

531
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,380
I told you you wouldn't win.

532
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:52,930
Even if you learned a dirty trick
from a wicked man,

533
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:54,750
you still failed.

534
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,020
This is a combat for marriage

535
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,620
instead of a gathering of martial artists.

536
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,750
If she is really unbeatable,

537
00:30:59,750 --> 00:31:00,870
she won't marry anyone

538
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:01,990
and she'll be alone forever, right?

539
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,830
You...

540
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,690
- That's right!
- That's right!

541
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,450
That's not going to happen.

542
00:31:07,830 --> 00:31:08,900
That's not true.

543
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:12,230
For the sake of your wound,

544
00:31:12,230 --> 00:31:13,330
I won't argue with you.

545
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,590
Get lost now.

546
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:16,900
You think you can hurt me?

547
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,060
Hey, loser,

548
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:19,660
it's me who doesn't want to argue with you.

549
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,930
Rat, if you dare to come up,

550
00:31:23,350 --> 00:31:25,470
you and I will only compete in martial arts

551
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,780
instead of the marriage thing.

552
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:29,810
I don't believe you.

553
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,260
If you break your promise
and insist on marrying me,

554
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,830
I'll be living a terrible life, won't I?

555
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:36,410
- Yeah.
- That's right.

556
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:38,740
You...

557
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,660
It won't be terrible.

558
00:31:41,350 --> 00:31:42,290
Xiaoyao.

559
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:44,140
How about we leave now?

560
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:48,100
We can explain it to Miss Lin another day.

561
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,430
Fine.

562
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,780
Let's not fight.

563
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,420
But in my eyes,

564
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,870
you're just like these men down there.

565
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,230
Cowards.

566
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,330
Fight here.

567
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,050
Don't push it.

568
00:31:58,380 --> 00:31:59,220
What?

569
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,690
A coward gets angry?

570
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:06,740
Fight her.

571
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,140
Fight her.

572
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,950
- Go.
- Fine, then!

573
00:32:19,830 --> 00:32:20,780
Xiaoyao...

574
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,170
Ling'er, don't worry.

575
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,300
If I don't give this savage girl a good lesson,

576
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,660
she'll keep haunting us.

577
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:30,380
And we'll only do martial arts

578
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,520
instead of the marriage thing.

579
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,260
Li, don't hurt Yueru.

580
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,620
Be careful, Xiaoyao.

581
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:53,900
A deal, huh? Only the martial arts.

582
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:54,740
Enough talk.

583
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:55,860
Let's fight.

584
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:07,140
Bravo!

585
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,380
Well done, young man.

586
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:38,570
Nice!

587
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,450
Brilliant!

588
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:53,790
Yueru...

589
00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:13,970
Impressive!

590
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:56,300
Nice!

591
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,380
Wonderful!

592
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:09,660
Great!

593
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,620
Awesome.

594
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:13,990
What a surprise! Miss Lin lost.

595
00:35:13,990 --> 00:35:15,230
I knew

596
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:16,860
she couldn't fight this young man.

597
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,700
That's right.

598
00:35:18,510 --> 00:35:20,180
What? Are you convinced or not?

599
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:24,940
Rat, just you wait!

600
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,660
Yueru.

601
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,820
- Be careful.
- Impressive, young man.

602
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:50,250
Bravo!

603
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,220
Nice!

604
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,180
Well done!

605
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,900
Yueru, are you all right?

606
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,380
- Leave me alone.
- You lost.

607
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:01,250
- Yueru.
- Rat, I'm going to kill you!

608
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,660
You flatter yourself. Can't stand to lose?

609
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:07,250
Young man,

610
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,700
you have such powerful martial arts.

611
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,730
May I know your name?

612
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,010
I'm Li Xiaoyao from Yuhang Town.

613
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:17,330
Good name.

614
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:18,570
Mr. Li,

615
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,770
congratulations.

616
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,110
Everybody,

617
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,510
this combat has been held for five years

618
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:29,530
and finally, we've got a winner.

619
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:33,620
From tomorrow on,
we'll hold a feast for three days.

620
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:35,530
My fellow townsmen

621
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:36,770
and martial artists,

622
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,550
please come.

623
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,330
- All right.
- We will.

624
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,050
Wait. What do you mean?

625
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:45,660
Father, this round doesn't count!

626
00:36:48,230 --> 00:36:49,660
For martial artists,

627
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,460
a bet is a bet.

628
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,530
Master Lin, huh?

629
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:58,140
I have things to do and I should go.

630
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,420
Mr. Li,

631
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,970
I held this combat

632
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,940
to get my daughter a husband.

633
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,140
You won

634
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,180
and they all witnessed it.

635
00:37:11,550 --> 00:37:12,770
How could you deny it?

636
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,800
Just now, you said

637
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,950
we would do martial arts
instead of the marriage thing,

638
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:19,580
and if I defeated you,
everything would be erased.

639
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,420
Does it still count?

640
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:22,070
Yes, of course. Fight me again!

641
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:22,910
Stop, stop.

642
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:24,660
Master Lin, you heard her, huh?

643
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:26,470
She said we only competed in martial arts.

644
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,860
Don't get me involved in the marriage thing.

645
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,770
We are

646
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:31,570
the biggest sect in the Central Plains.

647
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:32,970
How could you

648
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:34,970
do anything

649
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,460
the way you want?

650
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:48,820
Miss Lin, congratulations
on getting such a great husband!

651
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:50,750
You two make a perfect couple!

652
00:37:50,750 --> 00:37:53,050
See, Mr. Li?

653
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:55,420
Everyone is cheering.

654
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,620
Father, I would rather die than marry him.

655
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,460
Don't be ridiculous.

656
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,660
You and I had a deal.

657
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,180
Mr. Li won the combat,

658
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,860
in no way

659
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,490
could you break your promise.

660
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,330
Rat, just you wait!

661
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:12,790
Yueru.

662
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:14,830
Yueru.

663
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,970
Master Lin, I'll take my leave, too.

664
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,570
Xiaoyao!

665
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,290
Mr. Li,

666
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,050
come to my mansion, please.

667
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:34,990
After sailing for so many days,

668
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:36,380
I'm finally seeing living people.

669
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:38,230
What's going on over there? So crowded.

670
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,250
A combat for marriage.

671
00:38:42,250 --> 00:38:43,140
You can't go.

672
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,940
Come have a look.

673
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:50,730
Tang Yu, could you stop doing this?

674
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,140
You have to know
I'm the young master and you're the guard.

675
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,400
You're disqualified to restrain me.

All kinds of floral umbrellas.

677
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:00,820
I know where the beads are.

678
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:01,660
Where?

679
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,700
Come have a look.

680
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:05,660
Just one second.

681
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,790
Over there.

682
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,790
Come have a look.

Fancy rouge.

688
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:42,180
They're the Spiritual Beads?

689
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:45,010
None of your business.

690
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,550
Miss, you have great taste.

691
00:39:48,550 --> 00:39:50,340
This is the best seller in my store.

692
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,380
Young pretty girls love it.

693
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:55,700
This pair looks good, too.

694
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,140
It's so hard to pick one.

695
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,260
Which one do you think...?

696
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:03,180
It's a waste of time to ask you.

697
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,020
My Lady,

698
00:40:04,790 --> 00:40:06,620
please don't waste time
on anything meaningless.

699
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:08,100
- I'll take both.
- All right.

700
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,660
The bill is...

701
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:11,500
She has no money.

702
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,990
Miss, don't try it on when you have no money.

703
00:40:15,990 --> 00:40:17,900
I don't have money, but he does.

704
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:20,110
Pay for them.

705
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,010
He has some money.

706
00:40:42,070 --> 00:40:43,100
Tang Yu!

707
00:40:47,790 --> 00:40:49,380
How dare you disobey me?

708
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,290
Sorry, but I can't obey you

709
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:52,810
in any case irrelevant to bead-seeking.

710
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,230
Our budget is for bead-seeking.

711
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,400
We can't spend it on anything else.

712
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:33,530
In our sect,

713
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:37,460
everybody takes me as the young master

714
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,290
and stays away at a respectful distance.

715
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,860
Who really cares about what I expect

716
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:43,940
or what I want to do?

717
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,250
I would rather be an ordinary girl

718
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:54,180
who can do whatever she wants.

719
00:42:05,270 --> 00:42:06,140
Steamed cake.

720
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,980
Get up.

721
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
Go away!
