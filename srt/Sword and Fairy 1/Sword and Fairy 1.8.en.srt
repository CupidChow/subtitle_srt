00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 8=

3
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,090
It's strange, indeed.

4
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,090
He was just here a moment ago.

5
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,690
Where could he have gone?

6
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,530
Tang Yu,

7
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,050
how did you get here?

8
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:50,330
What took you so long?

9
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,100
My Lady,

10
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,450
you can't get rid of me.

11
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,120
You'd better focus
on finding the Spiritual Beads instead.

12
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,810
I have been looking for the Spiritual Beads.

13
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,690
Look,

14
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:03,890
the Sacred Spiritual Bead is glowing.

15
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,850
This means there must be
a Spiritual Bead nearby.

16
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:06,890
You don't know anything.

17
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,740
Tang Yu, how did you find me?

18
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,580
My Lady,

19
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,840
where is the Spiritual Bead?

20
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,720
It's strange.

21
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,840
You were clearly poisoned
by my Five Poison Bug.

22
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:21,460
How did you neutralize it?

23
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:23,300
Who in Nanzhao doesn't know
the art of the Five Poisons?

24
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:25,720
My Lady, don't try the same trick again.

25
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,810
Tang Yu, I'm telling you.

26
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,690
I just saw someone here,

27
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,850
and then he suddenly disappeared.

28
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:36,810
Help me find him.

29
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:44,410
Maybe the Spiritual Bead
is on that person.

30
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,170
Xiaoyao.

31
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,920
Xiaoyao.

32
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:27,380
Snake demon.

33
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,850
Maybe

34
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,920
we were never meant to meet again.

35
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:51,570
Ling'er.

36
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,880
Ling'er, where are you?

37
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,880
How did I lose you?

38
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:01,890
Ling'er.

39
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,380
Ling'er.

40
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:09,700
Ling'er.

41
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,160
Why?

42
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,570
Why can't I find you?

43
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,660
Ling'er.

44
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:26,290
Ling'er.

45
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,480
Xiaoyao.

46
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:40,010
I really don't know

47
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,760
what to do.

48
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,920
Why?

49
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,970
Why can't I find you?

50
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:57,570
Xiaoyao, I hope...

51
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:00,570
I hope

52
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,880
I'm not making the wrong decision.

53
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,100
Ling'er.

54
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,780
Ling'er!

55
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,050
That's right.

56
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:36,320
It's you!

57
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,570
It's really you, Ling'er.

58
00:06:45,730 --> 00:06:46,570
Ling'er,

59
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,530
you're alright.

60
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:51,320
I won't lose you again.

61
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:19,500
Ling'er,

62
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:22,600
why did you leave suddenly?

63
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,480
Xiaoyao,

64
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:28,800
actually...

65
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:30,050
Did you encounter a snake demon

66
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,290
at Lin Fortress?

67
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:34,730
A snake demon?

68
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:36,050
That's right.

69
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,040
The maidservant at Lin Fortress
was scared silly,

70
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,640
saying you were the snake demon.

71
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:46,160
Xiaoyao...

72
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,600
How could you possibly be a snake demon?

73
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,330
Later,

74
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:52,330
the savage girl, Scholar, and I

75
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,850
found the snake demon's lair.

76
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,320
With one strike,

77
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,690
I ended the snake demon.

78
00:07:57,890 --> 00:07:59,880
But in Dragon-hidden Cave,

79
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,360
I still couldn't find you.

80
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,440
You killed

81
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:06,530
the snake demon?

82
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,730
Of course, we had to.

83
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,780
Right,

84
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,380
there was also a fox demon
with the snake demon.

85
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:12,220
I killed them both.

86
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,730
Xiaoyao,

87
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:16,320
does being a demon mean

88
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,360
they must be killed?

89
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,450
Of course,

90
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,600
demons and monsters must be eradicated.

91
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,670
A hero is supposed to slay demons
and exorcise monsters.

92
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:24,850
Besides,

93
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,000
that snake demon captured you.
I must be the first one to fight it.

94
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,920
Xiaoyao,

95
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,970
what if...

96
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,850
I mean...

97
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,050
What if there are good demons?

98
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:39,000
Impossible.

99
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,800
Demons and monsters only harm people.

100
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:42,970
No matter how good they appear on the surface,
they must be devils.

101
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,800
So, they must be eliminated swiftly.

102
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,060
By the way, Ling'er,

103
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,800
you haven't answered me

104
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:53,200
why you left.

105
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,760
I

106
00:08:58,290 --> 00:08:59,640
encountered a corpse demon.

107
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:01,370
Later,

108
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:04,410
Physician Han from Baihe Village saved me.

109
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,000
Then, are you alright?

110
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:08,560
Were you hurt?

111
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,860
That's good.

112
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,290
It's the corpse demon again.

113
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:16,730
Ling'er, rest assured.

114
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:17,900
I will protect you.

115
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,050
I won't let them harm you.

116
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,290
So, what happened later?

117
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,560
How did you end up here?

118
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,050
Physician Han asked me to save someone.

119
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,220
To save someone?

120
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:38,050
This...

121
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,440
She is my daughter,

122
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,410
Mengci.

123
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:42,970
The corpse poisoning

124
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,440
has seeped into her heart.

125
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,640
(Han Mengci)
But I couldn't bear to kill her.

126
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,560
I could only lock her up here,

127
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:52,290
guarded and cared for.

128
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:53,560
All of this

129
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,440
is my fault.

130
00:09:57,090 --> 00:09:58,610
I was too selfish.

131
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:04,010
Miss Zhao,

132
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,650
you were poisoned

133
00:10:06,650 --> 00:10:07,930
but managed to heal yourself.

134
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,650
The girl who bit you

135
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:11,880
also stopped spreading the poison.

136
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,250
You

137
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,760
might be able to cure the poison.

138
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:17,130
I?

139
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,290
I know

140
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,370
this may be

141
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,000
too much to ask,

142
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,440
but you

143
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:28,050
might be her only hope.

144
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:32,640
I can save her.

145
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:01,010
Mengci...

146
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,610
Curing the corpse poisoning?
Ling'er, you look so pale.

147
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,600
You must have used
your spiritual power again, right?

148
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,120
Xiaoyao, don't worry. I'm fine.

149
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,610
Curing the corpse poisoning
only requires a little spiritual power.

150
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,660
Really?

151
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,970
Ling'er, even though it only takes
a little spiritual power,

152
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,020
you still shouldn't always use

153
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,610
the Resurrection Spell to save others.

154
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,370
By the way, Ling'er,

155
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,970
now that Miss Han's poison is cured,

156
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:42,930
why are you still here?

157
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:47,320
Ling'er, what are you doing?

158
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:48,800
Looking for something.

159
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:50,320
Looking for something?

160
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:51,610
What are you looking for?

161
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,930
Something very important.

162
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,130
Ling'er,

163
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,320
is this hair tie yours?

164
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,300
Found it!

165
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,930
You came back just to find it?

166
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:10,380
When I returned to the medical hut
and realized the hair tie was missing,

167
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,850
I retraced my steps,

168
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,170
and then I saw you.

169
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,320
Hair tie, oh hair tie,

170
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,700
thanks to you,

171
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,930
I saw Ling'er again.

172
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,370
By the way, Ling'er,

173
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:29,560
this hair tie looks a bit old.

174
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:30,570
How about this?

175
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,200
I'll go to the city
and buy you a new one.

176
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,250
No need.

177
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,200
This hair tie

178
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,410
is very important

179
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,440
to me.

180
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:46,800
Very important?

181
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:49,050
It must have been given

182
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:50,930
by someone very important to you, right?

183
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:55,090
A very special person.

184
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,800
Very special?

185
00:12:58,610 --> 00:12:59,760
Who is that person?

186
00:13:00,290 --> 00:13:01,170
Do I know that person?

187
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:03,800
Yes, you do.

188
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,370
I know that person?

189
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,490
Then I must think hard about
who he could be.

190
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,290
Alright, Xiaoyao, let's hurry.

191
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,490
There are corpse demons
around here at night.

192
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:19,450
Let's go.

193
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,320
Do I really know that person?

194
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,370
Both of us know that person,
so it can't be many people.

195
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,800
Miss Han,

196
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:36,930
how are you feeling now?

197
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,100
Much better.

198
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:45,610
Miss Ling'er has been gone for so long
but hasn't returned.

199
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,610
Could something have happened?

200
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,850
Don't worry.

201
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,340
Physician Han said

202
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,820
he'd go get Miss Zhao.

203
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,200
They will be back soon.

204
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,410
See, they're back.

205
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,660
Miss Ling'er,

206
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:02,930
you're finally back.

207
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,000
And this is?

208
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,560
Li Xiaoyao.

209
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,660
Mr. Li.

210
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:09,980
Miss Han,

211
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,120
you must be the First Chief
of Baihe Fort, right?

212
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,560
Exactly. How did you know?

213
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,540
Just a guess.

214
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,880
By the way, Miss Han,

215
00:14:21,530 --> 00:14:23,050
the lady who saved me, where is she?

216
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:24,640
I didn't see her.

217
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:26,240
Didn't see her?

218
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:30,340
Probably left on her own
after the wound had been healed.

219
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,180
Don't worry.

220
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,440
I'll send people to look for her.

221
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,370
Chief,

222
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:38,290
there's something else
I need your help with.

223
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:49,850
The night has passed.

224
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:52,000
Chief's illness
should be cured by now, right?

225
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,490
Well, that's hard to say.

226
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,240
If the marriage for joy didn't work...

227
00:14:57,050 --> 00:14:57,890
Boss,

228
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,140
you check the situation.

229
00:14:59,140 --> 00:14:59,980
Move aside!

230
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:08,130
No movement.

231
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,320
No movement. Come here.

232
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,540
Who?

233
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:13,620
Stop!

234
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,300
You...

235
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,090
You run so fast.

236
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,090
Hurry, come here.

237
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,370
Quick, don't dawdle.

238
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,680
Quick.

239
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,490
- No sound.
- Right.

240
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:49,760
Boss Li!

241
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:51,120
Have mercy!

242
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:55,410
What are you doing?

243
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,440
You scared us.

244
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,660
What happened?

245
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,900
You scared me.

246
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,680
No sign of Chief or that boy.

247
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:05,130
Could it be

248
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,050
that Chief

249
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:09,050
devoured the joy-bringing boy?

250
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,800
No, impossible.

251
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,410
Even if Chief eats someone,

252
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,170
she should spit out the bones.

253
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,610
Look here, where are the bones?

254
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,490
Could it be

255
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:21,850
our sleeping drug wasn't strong enough

256
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,610
and the boy ran away?

257
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,090
What's wrong? What's that?

258
00:16:34,170 --> 00:16:35,010
What is this?

259
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,090
Physician Han's silver needle.

260
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,930
Why is Physician Han's
silver needle here?

261
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:52,170
What's wrong?

262
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,560
This is Chief's blood.

263
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,090
Chief

264
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,650
must have tried to eat
the joy-bringing boy last night,

265
00:17:03,650 --> 00:17:05,130
but he ran away.

266
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,250
The boy went to find Physician Han.

267
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,740
Physician Han came over

268
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:11,860
and found Chief
was at the point of eating people.

269
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:12,700
He...

270
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:17,650
He made a righteous decision.

271
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,680
Chief!

272
00:17:21,530 --> 00:17:25,130
Chief!

273
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,010
Yueru,

274
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,850
you should rest.

275
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:39,250
Jinyuan, you're not
worried about Li Xiaoyao?

276
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:41,320
I have seen Li's skills.

277
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:45,090
He's a bit clever.

278
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:47,490
But he was drugged.

279
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:48,490
What if...

280
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:57,530
I didn't expect you, young lady,

281
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,040
to be so loyal and righteous.

282
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:00,820
But while you care for others,

283
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,490
others may not care for you.

284
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,890
What do you mean?

285
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:05,800
Where's Li Xiaoyao?

286
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,130
Him?

287
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:08,560
He ran away.

288
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,770
- What? Ran away?
- Yes.

289
00:18:11,770 --> 00:18:12,610
That's right.

290
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,460
He abandoned you and ran.

291
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,730
Li Xiaoyao, you scoundrel!

292
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,090
Miss, there's no need to be so angry.

293
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,250
You're so loyal and righteous.

294
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,250
Our chief will definitely like you a lot.

295
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:27,730
You can go down and accompany her.

296
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,290
Go down? Where to?

297
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,130
To the underworld?

298
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:35,130
Right.

299
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:39,370
We're ordered to escort you two
to the underworld.

300
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,580
Take them away.

301
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,250
What's the joy in living?

302
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,010
What's sad about dying?

303
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,460
Yueru,

304
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:13,730
to die together with you in this life

305
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,520
is my greatest fortune.

306
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,850
Li Xiaoyao, you're shameless!

307
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:25,100
I was so worried about you,

308
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,890
and you just ran off, abandoning us.

309
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:29,050
Cowardly, unfaithful!

310
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,290
You're not a man!

311
00:19:30,290 --> 00:19:32,620
Li Xiaoyao, I won't let you go
even as a ghost.

312
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,460
Enough.

313
00:19:34,010 --> 00:19:35,260
You have said all that needs to be said.

314
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,180
I'll

315
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,200
arrange for a priest

316
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,610
to properly conduct rituals for you both

317
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:43,130
and guarantee
you won't become fierce ghosts.

318
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:46,410
You two, be happy down there,

319
00:19:46,410 --> 00:19:48,400
serving our chief.

320
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:51,250
Yes.

321
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,090
You do it.

322
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:04,130
You do it.

323
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,460
Boss Li,

324
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,530
today is my mother's birthday.

325
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,560
I cannot kill.

326
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,050
Look at you.

327
00:20:24,050 --> 00:20:24,920
This lad.

328
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,770
Today is my son's one-month birthday.

329
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,010
I can't kill either.

330
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,410
Is killing someone that hard?

331
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:54,250
Then you do it.

332
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:56,770
Recently,

333
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,520
I have been unwell.

334
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:03,800
Useless! All three of you!

335
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,890
Is killing a person
really that difficult?

336
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,130
Give it here.

337
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,770
I'll show you how it's done.

338
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,650
Step back.

339
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,010
Boss,

340
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,280
you'd better chop me first.

341
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:34,010
Does it make any difference?

342
00:21:35,050 --> 00:21:35,890
What if

343
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:38,010
there's a turn?

344
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:38,850
No turning back now.

345
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,850
Kneel properly.

346
00:21:59,010 --> 00:21:59,920
Spare the broadsword!

347
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,460
It's over.

348
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,400
A fortune teller told me

349
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,400
I can't kill in this life.

350
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,060
Look at him.

351
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,460
There's no way around it.

352
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,300
Right.

353
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,770
No way, no way.

354
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,970
Scared me there.

355
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,130
Big gasp.

356
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,460
Li Xiaoyao,

357
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,800
did you do that on purpose?

358
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:02,970
Chief!

359
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,040
Is it true or not?

360
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:07,520
True or not?

361
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,680
Is this true or not?

362
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,530
Chief?

363
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:16,610
How is Chief alive?

364
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,780
Everyone,

365
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,650
let me say something.

366
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,920
My recovery

367
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,200
is all thanks to Miss Zhao's rescue.

368
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:33,850
This bowl

369
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,320
is to thank Miss Zhao.

370
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:38,560
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

371
00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:40,890
This second bowl.

372
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:41,770
Come, fill it up, fill it up.

373
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,610
To Miss Zhao's friends.

374
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,970
Previously,

375
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,400
everyone in the Baihe Fort offended you.

376
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:49,680
Please forgive us.

377
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,040
Sorry. Sorry.

378
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:00,370
Come.

379
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,610
Give me more.

380
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,650
This third bowl of wine

381
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,130
is to see off
the four friends in advance.

382
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,440
Our Baihe Fort
and the Baihe Village down the mountain

383
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,280
lie deep in Mount Guiyin,

384
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:18,920
rarely visited by outsiders for decades.

385
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:21,040
Meeting you

386
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,440
is also fated.

387
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,040
However, we have other matters,

388
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,730
so we can't keep you long.

389
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:30,400
If there's ever a need
for Baihe Fort in the future,

390
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,770
just speak up.

391
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:33,940
Come, cheers.

392
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,250
Cheers! Cheers!

393
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,090
Stay in the fort for the night,

394
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,730
and set off early tomorrow.

395
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:44,250
Please.

396
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:45,130
Please.

397
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,130
Chief,

398
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:06,920
the people here
are indeed very enthusiastic.

399
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,700
Yeah, indeed.

400
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:11,280
The food is more delicious
when you fight for it.

401
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:13,400
Eat up, eat up.

402
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,770
What's there to eat?

403
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:19,420
Tasty.

404
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:22,940
Try this.

405
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,820
Tastes alright.

406
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:26,130
You try.

407
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:27,010
Ling'er,

408
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,970
have some. This fruit is okay.

409
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:42,890
Well...

410
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,400
I forgot to feed my Xiaobai.

411
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:48,250
You fed him, Boss.

412
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:50,130
When we arrived,
Xiaobai was eating happily.

413
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,700
- Really?
- Yes.

414
00:25:53,460 --> 00:25:55,090
His appetite has been bigger recently.

415
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,800
Need to feed him more times. Let's go.

416
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:04,970
The marriage for joy, right?

417
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:08,970
Mr. Li.

418
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:10,800
Well,

419
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:13,050
desperate times called for desperate measures.
It was our fault.

420
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:15,650
But I heard from Chief

421
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,520
that it's because of
the joy-bringing marriage

422
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:20,700
that you could meet Miss Zhao
and reunite with her.

423
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,370
- Right, right, right.
- Is that tasty?

424
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:23,860
The joy-bringing marriage

425
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:26,010
did bring you joy, right?

426
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:27,920
Let's go. Let's go.

427
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,010
Li.

428
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,210
Li,

429
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,010
you and Chief didn't really

430
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,100
do that, did you?

431
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,890
Scholar, what are you thinking?

432
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,520
I doubt you have read the classics.

433
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,130
Just curious, curious.

434
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,610
Eat slowly. Take your time.

435
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:58,440
Really not?

436
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,160
No, no.

437
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,160
Shameful.

438
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:04,010
How did you disappear all of a sudden?

439
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,320
Did you encounter a snake demon?

440
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:10,400
Glad you're alright.

441
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
If anything happened to you,

442
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,340
I'd have to slay all the demons

443
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,440
within hundreds of miles.

444
00:27:15,890 --> 00:27:16,730
Drink more.

445
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:21,010
Don't be afraid.

446
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:23,770
When we return to Suzhou City,
I'll take you out to calm your nerves.

447
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,370
Yueru,

448
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,820
thank you.

449
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,770
It's all my fault
for dragging you into this.

450
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:35,460
What are you saying?

451
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,770
We're all good friends.

452
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:39,850
Yueru,

453
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,160
I might not be able to return
to Suzhou City with you,

454
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:47,320
because I'm leaving
for Nanzhao tomorrow.

455
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,220
Oh right, you're going back to Nanzhao.

456
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:52,500
So, Li Xiaoyao is going with you?

457
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,610
Of course.

458
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,560
I finally found Ling'er.

459
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,090
I definitely can't let her go alone.

460
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,780
Li Xiaoyao,

461
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,340
I think I'm more suited
to take Ling'er back to Nanzhao.

462
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:02,500
You don't need to follow us.

463
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,050
Some things, indeed, can't be envied.

464
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,460
Hurry back to Suzhou,

465
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,040
lest your dad sends someone
to protect you again.

466
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,620
I can go wherever I want.

467
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:10,740
My dad can't control me,

468
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,770
neither can you.

469
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:12,620
Yueru, Yueru.

470
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,650
Now that we have almost finished eating,

471
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,580
and it's getting late,

472
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,770
how about we head back to rest?

473
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:18,530
We can send off Li
and Miss Zhao in the morning.

474
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,370
Let's go, Ling'er.

475
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,090
Yueru.

476
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,280
Ling'er, I'll be leaving first.

477
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,730
Make way.

478
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,780
Grab my sword.

479
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,320
Sorry. Excuse us.

480
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:34,540
Yueru.

481
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:40,820
Ling'er,

482
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,540
eat this.

483
00:29:24,370 --> 00:29:25,400
Ling'er, are you full?

484
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:27,700
Why does this fort only have vegetables?

485
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,770
Not even a bit of meat.

486
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,520
Ling'er, rest early.

487
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,800
We'll set off first thing tomorrow.

488
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,560
Xiaoyao,

489
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,520
actually,

490
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:47,250
I can return to Nanzhao by myself.

491
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:52,090
Ling'er, why...

492
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,520
Why would you say that?

493
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:01,160
Ling'er, did I do something

494
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:02,370
to make you angry?

495
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,040
Was it because
I didn't find you immediately,

496
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:06,100
or because I always argue
with that savage girl,

497
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:07,600
or because I was sent
to the marriage for joy?

498
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,040
I was forced into that. You know it.

499
00:30:09,410 --> 00:30:11,610
Xiaoyao, it's not about you.

500
00:30:15,580 --> 00:30:16,560
It's me.

501
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:19,010
I have always had a question in my heart,

502
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,650
and I still can't figure it out.

503
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:22,660
What question?

504
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,890
Tell me. I'll help you.

505
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:25,620
If I can't,

506
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,530
we'll go to talk with Scholar.

507
00:30:26,530 --> 00:30:27,880
He's the Number One Scholar.
He must know.

508
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:28,890
It's all so sudden.

509
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:30,160
I don't know

510
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,520
how to tell you right now.

511
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:34,620
Ling'er, what's wrong with you?

512
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,130
Tell me, please.

513
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,320
Xiaoyao,

514
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,610
once I'm sure,

515
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:50,130
I'll tell you,

516
00:30:50,770 --> 00:30:51,610
okay?

517
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,460
Okay.

518
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,180
Okay.

519
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:57,770
I'll listen to you.

520
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,180
Ling'er,

521
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,850
if it's because of me
that you have doubts,

522
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,440
you must believe

523
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,740
I will protect you
all the way to Nanzhao.

524
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,200
I won't lose you again.

525
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,610
Thank you,

526
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,970
Xiaoyao.

527
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,200
So, don't overthink it.

528
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,090
Tomorrow,

529
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:30,730
I'll set off with you.

530
00:31:33,250 --> 00:31:34,090
Okay.

531
00:31:35,050 --> 00:31:35,890
Okay.

532
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:37,440
It's settled then.

533
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,180
Settled.

534
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:43,040
Xiaoyao,

535
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,400
you should rest early.

536
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,460
Okay.

537
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:20,970
It's all your fault.

538
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,820
If you hadn't suddenly appeared,

539
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,400
I would have found
the Spiritual Bead by now.

540
00:32:32,530 --> 00:32:33,650
The Spiritual Bead seems to be here.

541
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,820
Wait.

542
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,130
The person last time

543
00:32:40,410 --> 00:32:41,730
disappeared from here.

544
00:32:47,410 --> 00:32:48,740
Can't you say something?

545
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,090
Am I the only living person here?

546
00:33:21,460 --> 00:33:23,280
Can't you use your brain?

547
00:33:23,620 --> 00:33:25,130
If you're going to dig, dig a big one.

548
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,160
How could the Spiritual Bead
be in such a small grave?

549
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,440
My apologies.

550
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:40,220
Blame Tang Yu.

551
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,130
He dug first.

552
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,520
Spiritual Bead, oh Spiritual Bead.

553
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:38,800
What's the use of brute force?

554
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:40,130
At critical moments,

555
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,130
it's still my Five Poison Bug
that comes in handy.

556
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:44,800
Thanks, little bug.

557
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,370
I want to see

558
00:34:48,130 --> 00:34:49,410
what kind of monster you are.

559
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:51,410
Don't!

560
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:37,370
Is my wandering in the martial world

561
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,280
going to end like this?

562
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,780
At least,

563
00:36:44,170 --> 00:36:46,170
I wasn't implicated by that foolish rat.

564
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,800
Don't speak ill of others
behind their back,

565
00:36:50,170 --> 00:36:52,560
especially when they're behind you.

566
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,210
Li Xiaoyao, how did you get here?

567
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:58,760
Why are you here?

568
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,500
The room here is stinky and stuffy,

569
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,410
so I came out for some air.

570
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:08,610
You haven't told me yet.

571
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:09,800
What are you doing here?

572
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,320
I ate too much at night.

573
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:15,240
Just walking to digest.

574
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:20,000
That's a big lie.
Out in the middle of the night.

575
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:21,650
Well, do you have worries?

576
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,930
Tell me.

577
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,930
Why would a girl suddenly

578
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,000
become so thoughtful?

579
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,930
How did you know?

580
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,520
She was fine all along.

581
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,610
What exactly went wrong?

582
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,280
It's Ling'er, right?

583
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,610
Then you must have made her sad.

584
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,890
You can't go a day
without annoying someone.

585
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
I really shouldn't have asked you.

586
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,370
I forgot that you don't count as a girl.

587
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:17,970
Li Xiaoyao,

588
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:19,540
if you're here to mock me,

589
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:20,720
just go away.

590
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,060
Right.

591
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:33,000
Did Ling'er

592
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:35,370
ever confide in you about something?

593
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:38,370
About she has some thoughts?

594
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,620
No.

595
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:44,280
What exactly is wrong with Ling'er?

596
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:46,170
Well,

597
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:47,250
it's nothing.

598
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:55,240
Considering we're somewhat friends,

599
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,210
I can give you some advice.

600
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:00,930
Girls

601
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,410
have their moods.

602
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,450
When you think she's thoughtful,

603
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,850
just spend more time with her.

604
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,560
Talk less, and do more.

605
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,090
If you do talk, speak gently.

606
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:16,560
Say things to cheer her up, got it?

607
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,140
Thanks.

608
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:22,930
What did you say? I didn't hear you.

609
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:24,930
Good words won't be repeated.

610
00:39:25,890 --> 00:39:26,730
You're welcome.

611
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,210
I'm not helping you.

612
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:31,650
I'm doing it for Ling'er.

613
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,930
Anyway,

614
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,320
thank you for everything
you have done for her.

615
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,540
Seeing how sincere you are,

616
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:45,000
I'll reluctantly accept it.

617
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,010
I'm leaving.

618
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,780
Li Xiaoyao,

619
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:54,610
you and Ling'er are leaving
for Nanzhao tomorrow.

620
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,300
Hope

621
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,280
we'll meet again someday.

622
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,650
It was somewhat fun knowing you.

623
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,000
I won't forget you.

624
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,340
Really?

625
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,170
After all,

626
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,480
girls as unruly as you

627
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:21,720
are rare.

628
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:22,930
You...

629
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,060
Well, it's good

630
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,690
to remember your annoying face
before leaving.

631
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:43,720
What are you doing?

632
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:49,760
Shh.

633
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:50,930
Look.

634
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:07,500
Corpse demons!

635
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,570
Corpse demons are coming!
Close the gate!

636
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:10,890
Quickly, close the gate!

637
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:12,240
Corpse demons are coming!

638
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,570
Close the gate!

639
00:41:13,570 --> 00:41:14,760
Get everyone to resist!

640
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,520
Close the gate!

641
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,000
Chief, defending like this won't work.

642
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:52,480
Corpse demons only go out at night.

643
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:54,240
The sun will be out soon.

644
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:56,370
Just hold on a bit longer,
and they will retreat.
