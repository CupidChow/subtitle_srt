00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,530
Luojiao. Luojiao.

4
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:50,040
- A'nu.
- Here.

5
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,850
How are you feeling?

6
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,170
I'm fine now.

7
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:58,280
I said before that our master is miraculous
at reviving the dying.

8
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:00,400
There's no poison she can't neutralize.

9
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:03,220
Last night, Master and I
went to the Sacred Woods

10
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,500
and collected Dragon's Saliva Grass.

11
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,850
She's preparing it for you right now.

12
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:07,380
Once Tang Yu's wounds heal,

13
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:09,690
we'll head back to Nanzhao
to settle accounts with Bai Yue.

14
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,100
Luojiao,

15
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,740
have you seen Tang Yu?

16
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,970
I can't find him anywhere.

17
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,220
I...

18
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,300
I haven't seen him.

19
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:30,820
In that case, you should rest here.

20
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,660
I'll go look for him.

21
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,220
A'nu.

22
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,120
Tang Yu has left.

23
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:37,720
He has left?

24
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,120
Where did he go?

25
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,050
He

26
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:44,970
won't be coming back.

27
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,050
No, that can't be.

28
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:00,410
That can't be.

29
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:02,480
He promised he wouldn't leave me.

30
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,020
A'nu,

31
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,100
come here.

32
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:11,690
I gave the Golden Silkworm King

33
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:13,250
to Tang Yu,

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,940
and it required the blood from his heart

35
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,410
to create the Golden Silkworm Venom.

36
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:20,810
At that time,

37
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:22,260
you were close to death.

38
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,970
Only the Golden Silkworm Venom
could save your life,

39
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,410
but this Golden Silkworm Venom

40
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,000
has no cure in the world.

41
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:31,640
Tang Yu...

42
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:34,170
He didn't want you
to see him suffer and die.

43
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:36,200
That's why he left.

44
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,170
It can't be true.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
It can't be true.

46
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,840
Master said she could cure it.

47
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:44,940
A'nu,

48
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,200
there's only one person in this world
who can cure the Golden Silkworm Venom,

49
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,050
and it's not me.

50
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,610
Master,

51
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,410
tell me who it is.

52
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,330
I'll go find him.

53
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,780
Bai Yue.

54
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,140
Bai Yue?

55
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,760
Tang Yu is a good person.

56
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:16,200
He sacrificed his life

57
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,320
for you,

58
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,920
and he would die in agony.

59
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:26,970
No, that can't be true.

60
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:29,010
That can't be true.

61
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,660
I'll go find him.

62
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,810

Who killed General Gai?

175
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:40,200

Your Majesty, Tang Yu

179
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,560
is a disciple of the Witch Moon Sect
and the guard of the young master.

180

may not be easily calmed.

189
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,240
For prudence,

190
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:13,560
it's best to have them return

00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,800
should go on your behalf
to properly appease them.

193
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:21,050
You speak wisely.

194
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,170
I'll leave it to you then.

195
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,420
Yes.

196
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:38,290
We've almost turned everything over.

197
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:39,700
These jars are all empty.

198
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,980
There isn't
the Demon-Locking Jar, right?

199
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:44,370
Right. We can't continue this.

200
00:11:45,090 --> 00:11:47,490
Could someone actually
be pickling vegetables here?

201
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,680
Who is it?

202
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:05,610
Disturbing my peace.

203
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,090
What is this thing?

204
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:09,680
You're the thing.

205
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:11,740
Sir,

206
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:14,610
I see you possess an aura of wisdom

207
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,700
and the demeanor of a scholar,

208
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:18,630
you surely are versed in both ancient
and modern knowledge,

209
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:20,320
well-read, and learned.

210
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:24,120
You boy, you're so good at flattering.

211
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,300
Indeed,

212
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:30,020
I have perused the classics
and histories throughout my life,

213
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,380
and studied the works of many philosophers.

214
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:33,900
In terms of the depth

215
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,490
and broadness of knowledge,

216
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,930
even the gods and Buddhas of heaven

217
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:40,730
might not match me.

218
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:44,530
You do me justice

219
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,760
by calling me Book Immortal.

220
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,170
I apologize for my oversight,

221
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:52,170
Mr. Book Immortal.

222
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,660
That's more like it.

223
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,730
I like the sound of that.

224
00:12:57,730 --> 00:12:58,730
Mr. Book Immortal,

225
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:00,330
do you know

226
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,340
where the new girl captured
in the Demon-Locking Tower

227
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,320
is being held?

228
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,760
You think you can just ask me questions

229
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,760
and I must answer?

230
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,730
What do we do now?

231
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,290
Well...

232
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,200
Sir,

233
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:20,560
how about I make a bet with you?

234
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,290
I'll pose a question,

235
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:23,580
and if you can't answer it,

236
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,730
you must tell us where Ling'er is.

237
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,530
How could I not answer your question?

238
00:13:29,650 --> 00:13:30,880
This foolish Book Immortal

239
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:32,410
is likely to fall into the trap.

240
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:34,440
It's an object
that can't be turned into anything.

241
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:37,410
It comes before guests arrive.

242
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,000
When guests arrive, it leaves,

243
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:41,240
while it comes when guests leave.

244
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,570
What is it?

245
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:47,050
What is it, then?

246
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,170
Can't answer, can you?

247
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:49,010
Don't tell me.

248
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,220
Let me think.

249
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,370
What could it be?

250
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:57,290
Which book mentions this?

251
00:13:58,260 --> 00:13:59,850
This...

252
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,050
It's a rag.

253
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,090
It comes before guests arrive...

254
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:11,900
Indeed.

255
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,000
- That's right.
- Indeed.

256
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,880
Give me another. One more.

257
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,100
This truly shows a fondness for the new
and boredom with the old,

258
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,470
change upon seeing different girls,

259
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,680
fickleness,

260
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:20,730
capriciousness

261
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:21,930
and lust.

262
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,530
Your ability to stump me

263
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:29,780
doesn't mean

264
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,680
that you can answer the question I pose.

265
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:35,100
Alright.

266
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,290
Then you ask.

267
00:14:36,290 --> 00:14:37,410
If I can answer,

268
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:38,850
then you respond to my earlier question.

269
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,690
Okay.

270
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:44,970
Mencius once said,

271
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:47,530
"Fish is what I desire.

272
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,640
Bear's paw is also what I desire.

273
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,650
Since I can't have both,

274
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:57,380
I give up fish and take bear's paw."

275
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,120
How would you choose?

276
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:06,490
There's no answer to this.

277
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:11,090
I knew you couldn't answer.

278
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,440
What kind of question is this?

279
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,140
If fish comes first, I choose fish.

280
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,880
If the bear's paw comes first,
I choose the bear's paw.

281
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:25,810
Be careful.

282
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:43,320
It's you again!

283
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,320
Truly a sweet couple.

284
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,320
Go to the underworld
and become a pair of ghostly lovers.

285
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,130
Go.

286
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,320
Why are there so many corpses?

287
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,680
Li Xiaoyao,

288
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,800
you can't escape.

289
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,090
Give me the Spiritual Beads now.

290
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,970
Stop this futile struggle.

291
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,340
Li Xiaoyao!

292
00:18:35,130 --> 00:18:36,540
Why is there a magical zone
from Mount Shu

293
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:39,010
in this Demon-Locking Tower?

294
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,460
Li Xiaoyao,

295
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:43,770
are you alright?

296
00:18:44,410 --> 00:18:45,610
How are you?

297
00:18:47,050 --> 00:18:48,370
If you keep your voice down,
I'll be fine.

298
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:51,560
You're hurt like this,
yet still arguing with me?

299
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:54,370
Li Xiaoyao!

300
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,130
I have unmatched martial skills,

301
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,800
how could there be...

302
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,940
Li Xiaoyao, Li Xiaoyao, what's wrong?

303
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,250
Wake up, Li Xiaoyao.

304
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,700
Wan'er.

305
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:15,890
Wan'er,

306
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,130
did you find a way

307
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,490
to get Xiaoyao to leave?

308
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:20,940
Not yet,

309
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,850
but we don't need to anymore.

310
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:25,250
What are you saying?

311
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:26,730
What's wrong with him?

312
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,620
A despicable Taoist
fallen into the demonic path

313
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,680
is chasing him.

314
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,090
I'm going to save him.

315
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:32,520
I need to leave this place.

316
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,090
Ling'er, don't do this.

317
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:41,680
Ling'er, no!

318
00:19:48,130 --> 00:19:48,970
Ling'er!

319
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,340
Ling'er,

320
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,200
are you alright?

321
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,580
Wan'er,

322
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:55,850
I beg you.

323
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,610
Please save Xiaoyao.

324
00:19:58,650 --> 00:19:59,560
I beg you.

325
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,250
Is this worth it?

326
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,660
All I want

327
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:08,850
is for him to be safe.

328
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:10,210
Absurd!

329
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,610
Have you ever considered

330
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:14,040
that your blindly impulsive love

331
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:16,680
is also a type of selfishness?

332
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,160
To love someone

333
00:20:21,370 --> 00:20:22,520
is to be selfless.

334
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,540
Fine.

335
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,160
Since you like Li Xiaoyao so much,

336
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,560
I'll make sure
he stays by your side forever.

337
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,890
Wan'er,

338
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,560
what are you going to do?

339
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,970
Wan'er!

340
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:40,610
Wan'er!

341
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,540
Li Xiaoyao,

342
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,200
wake up.

343
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,560
We still need to find Ling'er.

344
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,520
Xiaoyao.

345
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,090
Ling'er.

346
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:15,250
Ling'er, is that you? Ling'er?

347
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,440
Li Xiaoyao, it's Ling'er.

348
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,370
Li Xiaoyao, wake up!

349
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,730
Ling'er, we are here.

350
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,060
Ling'er.

351
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,700
You're not Ling'er.

352
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,540
Who are you?

353
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,200
Of course, a demon
in the Demon-Locking Tower.

354
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,560
You imitated Ling'er's voice
to deceive me here.

355
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,890
What do you want?

356
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:54,970
What have you done with Ling'er?

357
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,650
Don't talk nonsense.

358
00:21:57,050 --> 00:21:58,460
I'm a friend of Ling'er's.

359
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,850
I wouldn't harm her.

360
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,460
Little girl,

361
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:07,860
I'm also a friend of Ling'er's.

362
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,730
My name is Lin Yueru.

363
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,490
Where is Ling'er now?

364
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,170
You'd better worry about yourself

365
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,920
and see if you can leave here alive.

366
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:17,090
Don't go.

367
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,490
Ling'er!

368
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:41,660
You...

369
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,850
Who are you?

370
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,560
Are you Li Xiaoyao?

371
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,370
You know me?

372
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Ling'er asked me to find you.

373
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,940
She's nearby.

374
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,580
Really? You know where Ling'er is?

375
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
Take me to her now.

376
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,370
Did you just see another girl?

377
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:05,250
No.

378
00:23:08,530 --> 00:23:10,440
She must have gone
to find water for you.

379
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,560
After all, you just fainted.

380
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,460
This is the Sword Tomb.

381
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,560
Demons cannot enter here.

382
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:16,890
It's very safe.

383
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:19,250
You don't have to worry about her.

384
00:23:21,250 --> 00:23:22,090
Miss.

385
00:23:22,530 --> 00:23:23,650
You must have been taking care

386
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,970
of Ling'er all this time.

387
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:26,370
Stop talking.

388
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:29,160
You'll know everything
once you see Ling'er.

389
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,180
Miss.

390
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,560
Come with me.

391
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:01,440
Book Immortal?

392
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:03,010
Why are you here?

393
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,580
I was afraid you'd wander aimlessly

394
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,650
and never find your way out of here.

395
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,420
Book Immortal,

396
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,250
you must know
how to leave this place, right?

397
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,010
Follow me.

398
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,300
Wait.

399
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:21,010
You just gave us a riddle

400
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:23,250
and didn't tell us where Ling'er is,

401
00:24:23,250 --> 00:24:24,800
but now you suddenly want to help?

402
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,220
Are you planning a trap

403
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,170
like that girl?

404
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:29,100
Miss Lin, you misunderstand me.

405
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,170
I just want you to stop Wan'er

406
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:34,560
from making a grave mistake.

407
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,770
You know the girl who deceived me?

408
00:24:37,770 --> 00:24:40,440
I watched her grow up.

409
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,460
She lost her parents at birth

410
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:46,890
and grew up alone
in this Demon-Locking Tower.

411
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:50,040
Another lie.

412
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,580
If she lost her parents at birth,

413
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,250
how did she grow up
by herself as an infant?

414
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:58,730
Wan'er's mother, Yue Rouxia,

415
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,770
was the daughter of the Demon King.

416
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:03,090
Wan'er is thus a half-demon.

417
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,340
Wan'er's father, Jiang Che,

418
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:08,400
was the most outstanding disciple
of Mount Shu at that time.

419
00:25:09,290 --> 00:25:10,390
So, they were the ones mentioned

420
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,730
by the Drunken Sword Immortal.

421
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,490
You know about this?

422
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:16,400
I know a bit.

423
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:17,520
What happened then?

424
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:25,130
The King of Prison
coveted Yue Rouxia's demonic powers,

425
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,440
and injured her in an attack.

426
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:31,560
Jiang Che fought
to protect his wife and child

427
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:34,130
and sustained serious injuries.

428
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,250
After giving birth to Wan'er,

429
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,160
Yue Rouxia transferred

430
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,860
all her demonic powers to Wan'er

431
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:46,580
and then died from exhaustion.

432
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,370
Jiang Che, to protect his daughter,

433
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:50,010
left Tiangang Will

434
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,520
around her.

435
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:54,890
Later,

436
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,650
he fell

437
00:25:57,530 --> 00:25:58,610
into the demonic path.

438
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:01,320
Even if they would die,

439
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:03,680
they still want

440
00:26:04,410 --> 00:26:05,560
to be with their beloved.

441
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:11,130
Wan'er doesn't understand these things.

442
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:19,160
Though protected
by her parents' powers,

443
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:21,850
she lost them young

444
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,460
and spent her days
in the Demon-Locking Tower,

445
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,160
hiding amongst demons

446
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:28,290
and living a lonely

447
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,920
and fearful life.

448
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,490
I took her

449
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,490
under my wing

450
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,250
and taught her to read and write.

451
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,920
When she read about parental love
in books and asked me,

452
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:44,650
I hardly dared to tell her much.

453
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:48,250
I only hinted at her origins.

454
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,970
Unexpectedly,

455
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:53,740
Wan'er resented her parents.

456
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:54,820
She hated them

457
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,170
for bringing her into this world

458
00:26:57,170 --> 00:26:58,850
of suffering.

459
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:00,620
In that case,

460
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:01,890
why not persuade the girl

461
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,610
and tell her everything?

462
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:05,770
I've tried

463
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:06,970
over and over.

464
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,130
I treat her like my own granddaughter,

465
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,560
quite indulgently.

466
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:15,370
How could she listen to me?

467
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,280
She's quite pitiful.

468
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,010
Miss,

469
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:23,370
maybe you could reason with her.

470
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:33,800
Miss, you should leave
through the front.

471
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,490
This is the way out.

472
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:09,850
Miss,

473
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,060
where is Ling'er?

474
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:13,280
Just over there.

475
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:14,970
If you pull out that sword,

476
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,770
you can break the illusion
in front of you,

477
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:18,250
and you'll be able to see Ling'er.

478
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:41,820
Don't dawdle.

479
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,290
Go and save him.

480
00:28:43,290 --> 00:28:46,100
Wan'er wants to use Jiang Che,
who fell into the demonic path,

481
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,650
to kill Li Xiaoyao.

482
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:48,820
What?

483
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:51,890
Remember to never pull out that sword.

484
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,170
What sword?

485
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,250
Jiang Che's old sword,

486
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,490
the Seven-Star Sword.

487
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:18,050
Pulling out the sword
will break the seal,

488
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:18,970
and you'll see Ling'er.

489
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:23,860
What are you doing?

490
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,010
Ling'er isn't here at all.

491
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,010
Who are you really?

492
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,700
I was asked by Ling'er to find you.

493
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,620
Where is my friend?

494
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:29,770
You're so worried about her.

495
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,460
I knew there was something special
between you two.

496
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:32,320
Enough talk.

497
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:34,010
Where is she?

498
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:35,610
I know where she is,

499
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,250
and I know where Ling'er is too.

500
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:38,850
But you can only

501
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,370
save one of them.

502
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,370
Which one would that be?

503
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,520
"I can't have both."

504
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:48,280
So, the Book Immortal

505
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,370
was with you on this.

506
00:29:51,050 --> 00:29:52,010
So what?

507
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,680
Just pull out this sword,

508
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:56,170
and I'll tell you where they are.

509
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,130
Where are they, exactly?

510
00:29:57,130 --> 00:29:58,850
You fickle heartbreaker!

511
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,560
You don't deserve Ling'er's affection.

512
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,920
She's so worried about you,

513
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,770
yet your heart is all for that girl.

514
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,970
You don't deserve to know
Ling'er's whereabouts.

515
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,560
As for that savage girl,

516
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,280
you can find her in the underworld.

517
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:12,180
Don't run!

518
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,390
This is
the Mount Shu Swordsmanship.

519
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:30,010
Those who hurt Wan'er will die.

520
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:33,200
Those who trespass
on the forbidden area will die.

521
00:30:54,170 --> 00:30:57,490
Wan'er wants to lead Li Xiaoyao
deep into the Sword Tomb,

522
00:30:58,010 --> 00:31:00,100
not just to have the demonic Jiang Che

523
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,650
kill him,

524
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:04,320
but also to let Li Xiaoyao

525
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,010
pull out that sword.

526
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:09,200
That is a divine weapon

527
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,040
that demons cannot touch.

528
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,850
Only a human can pull it out.

529
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:16,130
Once the Seven-Star Sword is drawn,

530
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:18,730
Jiang Che's soul

531
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:22,320
will dissipate.

532
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,520
She wants to kill her own father?

533
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:29,560
Exactly.

534
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,580
Wan'er

535
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,040
resents her parents.

536
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,520
Her mother has long departed,

537
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:39,340
so she channels all her resentment

538
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:43,920
towards her demonic father.

539
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:49,520
Book Immortal, where are you?

540
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:56,730
Book Immortal!

541
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:57,970
Wan'er.

542
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,610
You dare to betray me?

543
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:05,160
Wan'er, you can't keep making mistakes.

544
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,250
I don't need you to manage my affairs.

545
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:12,320
Fine.

546
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,610
Fine, fine.

547
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,540
Where's Li Xiaoyao?

548
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,250
That heartless man is already dead.

549
00:32:25,770 --> 00:32:26,610
But

550
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,800
you'll soon see him again.

551
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:30,680
He'd be waiting for you
on the road to the underworld.

552
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,440
I know why you want to kill us.

553
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:17,680
It's for Ling'er.

554
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,490
Not entirely foolish.

555
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,160
But you better not harm Li Xiaoyao.

556
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:22,940
If he dies,

557
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:24,130
Ling'er will be devastated,

558
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,770
just like your parents.

559
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,610
Shut up.

560
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,410
You smooth talker.

561
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,250
Look at you,

562
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:33,280
trying to steal Ling'er's beloved.

563
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,130
I didn't come here for Li Xiaoyao.

564
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:37,920
Don't tell me it's for Ling'er.

565
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,730
You can hardly believe your own lies.

566
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,090
You've lived in the Tower
your whole life,

567
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,160
so you don't understand

568
00:33:53,130 --> 00:33:54,560
that besides romantic love,

569
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,280
there's also parental love

570
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:58,290
and friendship among friends.

571
00:33:58,290 --> 00:33:59,130
Enough.

572
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,400
What romantic love? Parental love? Friendship?

573
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,130
These are all selfish desires

574
00:34:03,130 --> 00:34:04,680
that disregard others' feelings.

575
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,010
If all emotions

576
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,040
are selfish desires

577
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:10,720
as you say,

578
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,380
then why are you
helping Ling'er like this?

579
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,800
Because Ling'er is different.

580
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,850
She doesn't think of herself.

581
00:34:17,370 --> 00:34:19,410
She's the only selfless one
I've ever seen.

582
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:22,170
Then what about your parents?

583
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:25,020
They were the most selfish people
in the world,

584
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:26,720
not worthy of being parents at all!

585
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,540
Miss Wan'er,

586
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:36,890
I can understand why
you resent your parents,

587
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,040
but you must know

588
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:43,240
that nothing in life is certain,

589
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,960
especially emotions.

590
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,800
When you truly fall in love with someone,

591
00:34:51,090 --> 00:34:52,320
it's uncontrollable.

592
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:56,320
If it harms others,

593
00:34:57,570 --> 00:34:58,890
all you can do is try to fix it,

594
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:03,370
because there are no "ifs" in this world.

595
00:35:04,370 --> 00:35:06,000
What's done is done,

596
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,800
and there's no room for regrets.

597
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:12,730
So,

598
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,170
once you involve yourself in emotions,

599
00:35:15,810 --> 00:35:17,090
you must be prepared to pay the price.

600
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:19,320
You've said so much.

601
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:20,930
Now, are you willing

602
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:23,240
to pay your price?

603
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,450
If I die,

604
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,800
will you spare Li Xiaoyao?

605
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,300
For Ling'er,

606
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,170
I can.

607
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,280
Will you help them leave the Tower?

608
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,620
Fine.

609
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:51,650
I'll do everything I can.

610
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,210
If they can't leave,

611
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,480
they can spend their lives
together here,

612
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:59,480
which isn't the worst outcome.

613
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,210
Fine.

614
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:04,970
I agree.

615
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,410
Aren't you afraid of death?

616
00:36:40,130 --> 00:36:41,370
If my life

617
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,560
can save my friends,

618
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:46,820
it's worth it.

619
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,690
Why are you so foolish,

620
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,520
just like Ling'er?

621
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,320
This isn't worth it at all.

622
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,210
Like water to a drinker,

623
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,440
one knows best
whether it's cold or warm.

624
00:37:05,850 --> 00:37:06,690
Only I know

625
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,480
if it is worth it or not.

626
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,060
Back then,

627
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:14,090
someone sacrificed their life
to save you.

628
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,610
Why do you think

629
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,930
they did it?

630
00:37:41,610 --> 00:37:43,040
You know the Immortal Cloud Technique?

631
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:46,560
There's a disciple named Jiang Che

632
00:37:46,810 --> 00:37:48,370
at Mount Shu.

633
00:38:08,410 --> 00:38:09,250
Mr. Jiang!

634
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,760
Drunken Immortal Gazing
at the Moon Step.

635
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,130
Who are you to Situ Zhong?

636
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,450
The Drunken Sword Immortal
taught me the Step.

637
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:21,320
The Drunken Sword Immortal?

638
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:26,760
Situ Zhong?

639
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,280
That's right,
he's your fellow at Mount Shu.

640
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:31,210
Right.

641
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,490
That's right.

642
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,560
I'm Jiang Che.

643
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:41,170
Jiang Che.

644
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,320
That's right. I'm Jiang Che.

645
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:47,130
Jiang Che.

646
00:38:47,810 --> 00:38:49,780
Sir, your consciousness still exists.

647
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:51,650
Mr. Situ would be delighted to know.

648
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,450
Delighted?

649
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,370
I betrayed Mount Shu,

650
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,930
killed my fellow disciples,

651
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,210
caused my wife's death,

652
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,610
and implicated my daughter.

653
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,040
She's alone in the world because of me.

654
00:39:14,410 --> 00:39:17,410
I am truly deserving of death.

655
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:21,280
Deserving of death!

656
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,320
Deserving of death!

657
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,240
Deserving of death!

658
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:51,650
Li Xiaoyao, are you alright?

659
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,480
Savage girl, how about you?

660
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:54,490
I'm fine.

661
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,340
Jiang Che,

662
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,300
since you've harmed so many people,

663
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,650
why are they no longer here,

664
00:39:58,890 --> 00:40:00,520
while you're still clinging to life?

665
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,130
Wan'er.

666
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,540
Wan'er!

667
00:40:05,410 --> 00:40:07,060
It's my fault.

668
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:08,720
That's right.

669
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:12,520
It's all the fault of my mother and you!

670
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:14,780
Wan'er,

671
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,480
it's my fault,

672
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,760
not your mother's.

673
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:22,240
You left after her.

674
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:25,280
You never once considered me.

675
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:28,240
As parents,

676
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,560
you gave birth to me
but didn't raise me.

677
00:40:31,060 --> 00:40:32,210
It means you don't love me at all.

678
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:35,610
Why bring me into this world

679
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,480
to suffer all the misfortunes?

680
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:43,650
Yes.

681
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,730
Wan'er,

682
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,960
it's my fault.

683
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:53,040
It's me who wronged you.

684
00:40:54,330 --> 00:40:55,170
You...

685
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,480
You're just selfish!

686
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,540
Miss Wan'er,

687
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:05,800
you said your father didn't love you,

688
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:06,930
but do you know

689
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,090
you're protected
by the Tiangang Will of Mount Shu?

690
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:14,730
Impossible!

691
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,560
Only the Tiangang Will of Mount Shu

692
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,060
can protect you

693
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,130
from the King of Prison.

694
00:41:20,850 --> 00:41:22,090
The Book Immortal told me

695
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:24,560
your mother was hurt
by the King of Prison.

696
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,610
To protect you,

697
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,150
your mother exhausted her demonic power
inherited from the Demon King,

698
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,610
and your father
fell into the demonic path

699
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:33,000
before he left the Tiangang Will
at the Sword Tomb.

700
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,170
Impossible!

701
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,060
That can't be.

702
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,280
I don't believe you.

703
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,730
Miss Wan'er,

704
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,410
we all have parents.

705
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,800
Perhaps we never met them

706
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,450
from birth

707
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:55,560
and never experienced
their love firsthand.

708
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,800
But as you grow older,
you'll understand

709
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,930
that for parents,

710
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,040
from the moment their child is born,

711
00:42:02,500 --> 00:42:04,210
it becomes the most important part
of their lives.

712
00:42:06,810 --> 00:42:08,210
I never had parents since childhood,

713
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,800
but I always believed

714
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:12,540
that since they couldn't be with me,

715
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:14,170
there must have been reasons
and difficulties.

716
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,800
You've told me enough,

717
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,410
but still, all parents
are the same in the world.

718
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:22,650
Ever since I was little,

719
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:23,930
what I wanted

720
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:26,610
was never any demonic power,

721
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,370
nor the Tiangang Will.

722
00:42:28,610 --> 00:42:30,000
You forced those upon me,

723
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,890
and I'm giving them all back to you.

724
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,580
Wan'er,

725
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,580
don't!

726
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,050
If the Sword Tomb
loses its magical barrier,

727
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,650
I won't be able to protect you anymore.
