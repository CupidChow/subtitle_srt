=Sword and Fairy 1=

00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
Xiaoyao.

4
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:13,370
What tree is this?

5
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,490
Why does it bloom with blue flowers?

6
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,100
It's a blue jacaranda.

7
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,100
Blue jacaranda?

8
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,290
Xiaoyao,

9
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:22,700
it was you who brought me

10
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,820
under this tree years ago.

11
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,460
You said

12
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,290
when the blue jacaranda blooms and withers

13
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,010
for the tenth time,

14
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,490
you would return.

15
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:35,650
I'm not sure where it went wrong.

16
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,180
I've been desperately
trying to remember,

17
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,620
but beyond a name,

18
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,290
I have no memory of anything else.

19
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,310
Name?

20
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:45,620
Name…

21
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:55,140
In my haste, I forgot.

22
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,820
I remember you telling me,

23
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,650
if you were to forget me,

24
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,290
I should show you this.

25
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:10,670
This?

26
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:12,260
What is this?

27
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,010
It's engraved

28
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,540
with the wish you made back then.

29
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,750
You said

30
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,730
just by seeing the engraved words,

31
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,700
you would remember me.

32
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,260
Wife.

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:41,340
So,

34
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,180
the wish you made

35
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:45,490
was this.

36
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,900
(I,)

37
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,010
(Li Xiaoyao,)

38
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,260
(take Zhao Ling'er as my wife,)

39
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,180
(for life,)

40
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,210
(unwavering.)

41
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,650
This is indeed my handwriting.

42
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:05,700
But...

43
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,420
Xiaoyao,

44
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:09,770
do you remember me now?

45
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,790
I...

46
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:15,390
I...

47
00:04:20,110 --> 00:04:23,460
The person who returns
after ten years is Li Xiaoyao.

48
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:24,300
Ling'er.

49
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:26,770
(Unwavering)
If I don't remember you by then,

50
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,700
bring me here, and dig this up.

51
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,210
When the blue jacaranda

52
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,930
blooms and withers for the tenth time,

53
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,930
I will return.

54
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:49,540
Xiaoyao,

55
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,610
I am Ling'er, Zhao Ling'er.

56
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,650
(If not looking back,)

57
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,540
(why not forget?)

58
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:58,930
(If it's not destiny,)

59
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:00,860
(why make promises?)

60
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,420
(Today's matters,)

61
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,370
(like water, leave no trace.)

62
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,050
(Tomorrow, what of tomorrow?)

63
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,930
(You'll be a stranger on a different path.)

64
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,330
Xiaoyao.

65
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,020
Xiaoyao, what's wrong?

66
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,550
Ling'er,

67
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,100
the Xiaoyao you mentioned

68
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,580
seems truly to be me.

69
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,540
Xiaoyao,

70
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,860
you finally remembered me.

71
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,700
Not remembered.

72
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:44,610
I saw

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,450
our past and future.

74
00:06:07,830 --> 00:06:08,670
Ling'er,

75
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,020
why does it feel like,

76
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,650
though we've just met,

77
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:21,140
it's like long-separated lovers reuniting?

78
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,140
Because,

79
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,740
if you like someone,

80
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,860
every encounter is a reunion

81
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,740
after a long separation.

82
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,700
(Happiness)

83
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,820
A good marriage will last forever.

84
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:21,930
The supreme good is like water.

89

90

91

Second bow.

Drink the wedding wine together.

99
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:19,610

Ling'er,

120
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:07,810
do you know what it means
to be a hair-tied couple?

121
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,740
It's a tradition in our Central Plains.

122
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,380
During marriage,

123
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,500
the couple take a strand of their hair

124
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:21,150
and tie them together,

125
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,300
so that they're a hair-tied couple.

126
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,650
So are we now.

127
00:11:08,390 --> 00:11:09,330
Xiaoyao,

128
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,380
this is the Purple Gold Pill.

129
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:14,860
(Purple Gold Pill)

130
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,940
Ling'er,

131
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,420
once my aunt is cured,

132
00:11:18,830 --> 00:11:20,450
I will bring her to the island,

133
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,180
and we'll never be apart again.

134
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:25,980
It's a deal then.

135
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:29,860
Xiaoyao,

136
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,570
I'll wait here for your return.

137
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:38,650
A promise is a promise.

138
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,300
Ling'er, watch out behind you!

139
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,300
Kill everyone on the island,

140
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,250
sparing no one.

141
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,190
Ling'er!

142
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,470
Grandma!

143
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,310
Ling'er!

144
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,940
Xiaoyao!

145
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,870
Xiaoyao!

146
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,030
Xiaoyao, wake up. Xiaoyao!

147
00:13:59,030 --> 00:13:59,870
Xiaoyao.

148
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:00,790
Xiaoyao!

149
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,250
Come on, Xiaoyao, get up.

150
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,700
Come on.

151
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:08,650
Good, you're still alive.

152
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,060
Quickly, take me back to the Fairy Island.

153
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:15,030
What nonsense, Xiaoyao?

154
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm here to take you back home.

155
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,660
Zhang Si,

156
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:19,650
I've found the magic pill.

157
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,620
Quickly give it to my aunt.

158
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,130
I'll go back to the Fairy Island now.

159
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,770
You... You really found the magic pill?

160
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,540
Then why are you going back?

161
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,420
I need to save...

162
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:45,430
Save whom?

163
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,330
- Xiaoyao?
- Save...

164
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,710
Xiaoyao, what's wrong with you, Xiaoyao?

165
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,060
- Save...
- Xiaoyao, Xiaoyao, Xiaoyao!

166
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,860
Xiaoyao, save whom, Xiaoyao?

167
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,020
Xiaoyao,

168
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,010
save whom?

169
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,310
Xiaoyao!

170
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:07,770
Buns! Freshly baked buns!

171
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,990
You're awake.

172
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,860
Li is truly filial.

173
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:29,860
He found the magic pill.

174
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
You rascal.

175
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,860
Stop gaping like that,

176
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,300
or a fly will fly right in.

177
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,980
Auntie, don't hit me, I'm awake.

178
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,210
What's wrong with you?

179
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,980
Why the panic?

180
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,300
How did I sleep till now?

181
00:15:58,030 --> 00:15:59,330
Good that you're up.

182
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,130
Now rest well.

183
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:11,540
I lazed around till now,

184
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:13,940
but my aunt didn't beat me

185
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:15,770
and told me to rest well instead.

186
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,110
She...

187
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,500
What's wrong with her?

188
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:41,100
I feel like I've forgotten

189
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,010
something very important.

190
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,810
Why can't I remember it?

191
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,010
Speaking of the ancient times,

192
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:55,270
there were the five great beasts of wind,
thunder, water, fire, and earth,

193
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,130
rampaging through the human world.

194
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,380
(Xiaoyao Inn)

195
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:02,230
(Spring Tea House)
Nuwa,

196
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:03,790
seeing the suffering

197
00:17:03,790 --> 00:17:04,870
of all beings...

198
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,110
Li, here you are to listen to the stories.

199
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:07,450
She gathered the earth's energy,

200
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,950
crafting five spiritual beads
to suppress the beasts.

201
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:12,260
Xiaoyao is here.

202
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:14,420
- Xiaoyao has arrived.
- Hey, Xiaoyao!

203
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,330
Li.

204
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,860
- Mr. Wang.
- Is your auntie better now?

205
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,530
When was my auntie sick?

206
00:17:22,710 --> 00:17:24,140
Kid,

207
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:27,210
did the waves confuse you?

208
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:31,210
I heard you, like our Xiaohu,

209
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,100
went to the fairy island for medicine,

210
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:35,230
and cured your aunt.

211
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,450
- Exactly.
- I...

212
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:38,900
When did I go to the fairy island?

213
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,170
Don't judge him by his usual behaviors.

214
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:44,900
He's really something when it matters.

215
00:17:44,900 --> 00:17:46,750
- Right.
- I heard from Xiaohu

216
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,850
that all matchmakers in Yuhang

217
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,990
are after his aunt,

218
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:52,930
lining up good girls for him.

219
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,450
I'm already married.

220
00:17:57,230 --> 00:17:58,530
- What?
- You're...

221
00:17:58,830 --> 00:17:59,670
Married already?

222
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:00,900
Yeah, why didn't we know?

223
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,900
- You're making things up again.
- Right.

224
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,170
When did you get married?

225
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:07,620
Right.

226
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,830
Why did I say I was married?

227
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:11,300
Okay, let's not talk about it.

228
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:13,530
We'll wait for your wedding banquet.

229
00:18:13,530 --> 00:18:14,780
(Spring Tea House)

230
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,510
- So, we were discussing...
- I remember now.

231
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:29,930
After the five beads were scattered,

232
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,260
the Water Demon Beast resurrected
upon touching the water.

233
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,690
That stinky Taoist was just lying to me.

234
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,260
Given his look, I doubt
he knows any martial arts.

235
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,450
And I believed his nonsense?

236
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:01,930
Who's accusing me of lying?

237
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,140
You truly know martial arts?

238
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:06,330
Doubting me?

239
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,900
No, no. I believe you.

240
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,900
Then, sir, please keep your word
and teach me martial arts.

241
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,330
Hold on there.

242
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,660
You're not bad, kid.

243
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,780
Thought you wouldn't come yesterday.

244
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:18,900
Surprised you waited another day.

245
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:19,950
I...

246
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,050
Waited another day?

247
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:23,710
Yesterday,

248
00:19:23,710 --> 00:19:27,300
I heard there was good wine

249
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,590
at Lin Fortress in Suzhou City.

250
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,020
So, I stole...

251
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,930
took some to taste.

252
00:19:34,350 --> 00:19:35,190
Take some?

253
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:37,860
Stealing wine in your mouth
sounds so elegant.

254
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,140
I admire you.

255
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:43,350
You're not a wine lover,
so you wouldn't understand.

256
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:45,450
But I am.

257
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,260
Lin Fortress has good wine,

258
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:52,350
but also a lady who knows nothing about it.

259
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,450
Wouldn't it be a waste

260
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:57,660
if I didn't drink it all?

261
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,140
Teach me martial arts, please.

262
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:00,110
Once you teach me,

263
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,660
I'll bring good wine to thank you.

264
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:05,980
Kid,

265
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:10,140
everything in this world is predestined.

266
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:13,180
You and I are meant to meet in this life.

267
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,830
I'll show you now.

268
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:17,670
Remember it.

269
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,900
What you learn depends on your fate.

270
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,740
- Okay.
- Watch closely.

271
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,930
My nature is much like
the nutcase of the Chu State.

272
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:38,570
I sing to advise Confucius
against taking office.

273
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:46,330
Holding in hand a cane
decorated with green jade,

274
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:49,780
I bid farewell
to Yellow Crane Tower early morning.

275
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,570
No distance is spared
to find immortals at Five Peaks.

276
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,900
In life, I have a penchant
to sightsee famous mountains.

277
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,290
Mount Lu stands majestically
beside the South Dipper.

278
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:06,050
Clouds cover screen-like mountain range
like blankets.

279
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:08,660
Reflections on limpid lake
show green-blackish colors.

280
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:11,350
The two peaks standing on each side
are high-reaching.

281
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:13,660
Silvery waterfall hangs down
from Three Rock Beam.

282
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:17,710
Incense Burner Waterfall
is facing it from the distance.

283
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:20,290
Layered mountains
with spiralling up paths are stately.

284
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,140
Dawn's sun with red glow
reflects off greenish water.

285
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,100
Birds cannot fly
past Wu State's sky-high mountains.

286
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:30,900
In climbing up,
world's spectacular scenes are in view.

287
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:34,050
Endlessly long river flows out
and will never return.

288
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,780
Wind carries vastly broad expanse
of gloomy clouds.

289
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,330
Branched out rivers surge forth
with snow-like froth.

290
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:45,290
A ballad is composed
for the sake of Mount Lu here.

291
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,330
The scenery of this mountain
puts me in a good mood.

292
00:21:49,110 --> 00:21:51,780
At leisure, looking at the rock mirror
purifies my mind.

293
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,620
Moss has grown over the footprint tracks
of Master Xie.

294
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,780
Ingesting Taoist pellet early rids mind
of worldly thoughts.

295
00:21:59,780 --> 00:22:03,210
In total serene mindset,
first stage of Taoism is achieved.

296
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,630
Supernatural is seen walking
among distant colorful clouds.

297
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,980
Holding lotus flowers,
he's heading to Heaven King's hill.

298
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,020
He's going to meet deities at ninth heaven.

299
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:17,660
We'd like to invite you to come along
and tour outer space.

300
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,450
Sir, what exquisite swordsmanship is this?

301
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:32,140
This is the Sword Control Technique
of our Shushan Sect.

302
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:35,870
If you master this technique
and keep improving,

303
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,660
you'll eventually master
the Art of Thousands of Swords.

304
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:41,140
Sir, please take me as your disciple.

305
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,140
I dare not.

306
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:44,980
I'm used

307
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,620
to wandering,

308
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:50,590
not suited to have disciples.

309
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:55,050
But if you master this technique,
it will benefit you for life.

310
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,410
I've only watched it once.

311
00:22:58,710 --> 00:22:59,660
Not sure how much I can learn.

312
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,740
You're too modest.

313
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:03,140
You're gifted, kid.

314
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:05,140
Try it once, and let me see.

315
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:29,330
Seems what that person said years ago
wasn't wrong.

316
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,310
Years ago?

317
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,740
Who?

318
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,930
An old acquaintance,

319
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:39,210
a person of fate. Let's not mention it.

320
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,900
So, how do you think I did just now?

321
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,330
Not bad.

322
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,210
Still, you won't take me as a disciple?

323
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:54,330
My young friend,
everything in this world is fated.

324
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,300
We're not destined
to be master and disciple at this moment.

325
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,100
We meet today and part today.

326
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,100
We'll meet again if it's meant to be.

327
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:07,380
Sir.

328
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,170
Sir, may I know your name?

329
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:12,590
Riding the wind with my sword,

330
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:15,510
vanquishing demons between heaven and earth.

331
00:25:15,510 --> 00:25:17,750
Joyous with wine, carefree.

332
00:25:17,750 --> 00:25:20,620
Without wine, it drives me mad.

333
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:23,510
One drink empties rivers and seas,

334
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:25,950
another swallows the sun and moon.

335
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,630
Thousands of cups don't bring me down,

336
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:33,660
only I, the Drunken Sword Immortal.

337
00:25:34,510 --> 00:25:37,050
Drunken Sword Immortal.

338
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,900
(Favorable Winds and Timely Rains)
Top-quality silk, come take a look.

339
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,900
Various ornaments and trinkets, come see.

340
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,340
(Xiaoyao Inn)

341
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:03,050
- Xiaoyao.
- Auntie.

342
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,750
Where were you last night?

343
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:06,300
Not back till this morning.

344
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,660
- Didn't lock the door.
- Auntie. Auntie.

345
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,660
Be gentle. It hurts. I can't feel my ear.

346
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,380
Auntie, listen,

347
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:13,470
I saw those merchants

348
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:14,750
only returned this morning too.

349
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:15,660
Weird.

350
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:17,900
- Li Xiaoyao.
- But

351
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,140
they carried a strange big sack,

352
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,260
covered in blood.

353
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:24,310
Do you think

354
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,690
they murdered for loot?

355
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:28,380
If the officials investigate,

356
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,620
won't we be harboring criminals?

357
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:30,740
I warn you

358
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:32,260
to stay away from them.

359
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:33,630
Don't provoke them.

360
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:35,420
But we can't just ignore this.

361
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,380
What can you do?

362
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,020
Don't get yourself killed

363
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,620
before doing anything. Do you hear me?

364
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:43,710
Also,

365
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:45,620
they took

366
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,290
your room.

367
00:26:48,590 --> 00:26:49,430
Why so surprised?

368
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,590
They needed another room.

369
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:53,290
So, where do I sleep?

370
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,050
Just make do for now.

371
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,860
Go clean the guest rooms.

372
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:03,460
(Xiaoyao Inn)

373
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:06,780
Me, a disciple
of the Drunken Sword Immortal,

374
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,450
without a room,

375
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:09,810
doing chores.

376
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:11,020
Boring.

377
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:30,500
Young man, busy?

378
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:33,260
Sir, what do you need?

379
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:36,930
Where's my thing?

380
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:41,170
What thing?

381
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:45,660
Nothing, my mistake.

382
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:47,420
Also,

383
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:48,630
have you heard

384
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,020
of a fairy island nearby?

385
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:53,430
Fairy island?

386
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,570
Why's everyone asking about it?

387
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:58,420
Passers-by are talking about it.

388
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,570
So, it got me curious.

389
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,260
That's why I asked.

390
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,570
Forget it if you don't know.

391
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,070
Young man,

392
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:08,050
from now on,

393
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,140
without my order,

394
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,050
no one can get near this room.

395
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,260
Got it?

396
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:15,750
Yes.

397
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:17,140
- Go on.
- Sure.

398
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:23,350
They have their own rooms.

399
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,620
Why'd they need my room?

400
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,500
Could it be for a sack?

401
00:28:32,950 --> 00:28:33,930
Must be that.

402
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,980
I know what to do.

403
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,210
Didn't expect

404
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:54,330
to use this secret passage so soon.

405
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,570
I seem to have seen her before.

406
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,980
Xiaoyao,

407
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,450
come back with me.

408
00:29:52,870 --> 00:29:53,710
Grandma, she...

409
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,130
Shh,

410
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,190
someone's outside.

411
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,710
Follow me.

412
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,860
Go down here.

413
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,140
Be careful.

414
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,450
Not good. Split up.

415
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,020
Hand over the girl!

416
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,140
Miss, get in. Don't come out.

417
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,990
(Didn't know that Taoist's sword skills
were so good.)

418
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,570
You're quite skilled.

419
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:42,780
I've got more tricks.

420
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,380
If this were a real sword,
your toes would be gone.

421
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:49,780
Cloud Piercing Palm.

422
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,690
- Run!
- See you next time.

423
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,950
Stop chasing.

424
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,500
Why stop? I'm not done fighting.

425
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,020
My Cloud Piercing Palm hit him.

426
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,780
He's half-dead if not fully.

427
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:02,980
Auntie,

428
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:05,660
since when can you fight?

429
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:07,260
I want to ask you the same.

430
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:09,050
Since when can you fight?

431
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,180
Just picked up a few moves from others.

432
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,410
How's that? Not bad, right?

433
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:14,550
Not really.

434
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,980
Just a beginner's luck.

435
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:21,430
Miss.

436
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,620
Xiaoyao.

437
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:24,020
Quick, let's go.

438
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,140
My grandma's hurt.

439
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,020
Miss. Miss!

440
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,740
Miss,

441
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,380
do we know each other?

442
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:32,900
Xiaoyao,

443
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,330
it's me, Ling'er.

444
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,140
Grandma's hurt.

445
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:37,660
We need to go back quickly.

446
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:39,060
Go back to save her.

447
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,530
Don't cry. Please don't cry.

448
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:41,900
I can help your grandma.

449
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,330
- Don't worry.
- Xiaoyao.

450
00:33:48,630 --> 00:33:49,860
Is she the one you saved?

451
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,620
Auntie.

452
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,710
You know her?

453
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:55,620
No.

454
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:56,980
I don't know her.

455
00:33:58,990 --> 00:33:59,930
Xiaoyao,

456
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:01,900
it's me, Ling'er.

457
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,210
What's wrong with you?

458
00:34:06,590 --> 00:34:07,900
You said you don't know her,

459
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,570
but she calls you Xiaoyao.

460
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:11,700
Did you bully her?

461
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,070
Auntie,

462
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,380
I don't know what's happening.

463
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,770
I found her in a sack in my room.

464
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,900
Maybe she's scared silly.

465
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:23,870
Xiaoyao,

466
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,900
let's go back to the island.

467
00:34:26,070 --> 00:34:27,580
Or I'm afraid it'll be too late...

468
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,420
Island?

469
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,420
- What island?
- The Fairy Island.

470
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,140
Xiaoyao,

471
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,860
what's wrong with you?

472
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,380
Auntie, what do we do?

473
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,490
I'll go back by myself.

474
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:42,630
What to do?

475
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:44,340
Just go with her.

476
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:46,140
It's not safe for a girl to go alone.

477
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:46,980
Okay, okay.

478
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,730
This boy...

479
00:34:53,750 --> 00:34:55,010
Why is he more and more like

480
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:57,020
that man?

481
00:35:19,030 --> 00:35:20,050
Guests of the inn...

482
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:22,940
Grandma.

483
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:24,350
Grandma!

484
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:25,550
Grandma!

485
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:26,870
Grandma!

486
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,180
Grandma, wake up!

487
00:35:29,750 --> 00:35:30,590
Grandma.

488
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,500
Grandma.

489
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,070
Grandma!

490
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:53,770
Ling'er...

491
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:55,730
You're awake.

492
00:35:57,950 --> 00:35:59,250
You're okay.

493
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,900
That's great.

494
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:04,790
Grandma,

495
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,570
I'll use the Resurrection Spell

496
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,020
to save you.

497
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,220
Don't bother.

498
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,900
You haven't grasped

499
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:18,460
the Resurrection Spell.

500
00:36:21,510 --> 00:36:22,350
I can do it.

501
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:24,660
My time is up.

502
00:36:25,950 --> 00:36:27,100
The spell

503
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,770
won't work.

504
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:33,910
It will.

505
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,050
It will, Grandma!

506
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,220
Miss.

507
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,570
- It will!
- Mr. Li.

508
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,010
I entrust Ling'er

509
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:09,530
to you.

510
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:19,180
Take care of her for me.

511
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,420
Madam, I...

512
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,050
Ensure

513
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:26,490
that Ling'er

514
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:28,810
returns

515
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,250
safely

516
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:34,700
to Nanzhao.

517
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,940
Escort her

518
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,770
back to the Witch Moon Sect.

519
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,050
- Madam, I promise.
- Grandma...

520
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:45,070
Madam...

521
00:37:45,140 --> 00:37:46,490
I won't go anywhere.

522
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:48,860
I won't go anywhere.

523
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,660
- Grandma.
- My child...

524
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,860
Child...

525
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,220
Madam.

526
00:38:11,750 --> 00:38:12,590
Grandma.

527
00:38:14,070 --> 00:38:14,970
Grandma.

528
00:38:15,950 --> 00:38:18,330
Grandma, wake up!

529
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:20,530
Grandma!

530
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:58,180
(Xiaoyao Inn)

531
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,180
What are you doing?

532
00:39:17,510 --> 00:39:19,460
Tell me everything about what's going on.

533
00:39:20,230 --> 00:39:21,950
I'm also confused.

534
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,230
How about waiting for her to wake up,

535
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,140
so you can ask her?

536
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,630
Grandma.

537
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:26,940
Grandma.

538
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:28,830
Grandma.

539
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:30,070
Grandma.

540
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,070
Grandma.

541
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:32,700
Grandma.

542
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,260
Don't go.

543
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,180
Don't leave me.

544
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,180
Hold her hand.

545
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,620
Don't go, Grandma.

546
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:40,390
Grandma.

547
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:43,260
Grandma.

548
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:44,570
Don't go.

549
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,420
Miss,

550
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,020
don't be scared.

551
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:54,140
You're safe now.

552
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,070
Xiaoyao.

553
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,700
- Xiaoyao.
- Xiaoyao?

554
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:24,660
No, no.

555
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:27,830
Don't go.

556
00:40:29,310 --> 00:40:30,150
Don't go.

557
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,940
Stay with her.

558
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:34,180
Why me?

559
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,730
She didn't say "Auntie, don't go."

560
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,980
I'm leaving.

561
00:40:39,510 --> 00:40:41,100
Auntie! Auntie! Auntie!

562
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:42,100
- Xiaoyao.
- Auntie!

563

Xiaoyao.

564
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,110
Forget it.

565
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:54,180
I'll stay up all night if needed.

566
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:36,390
