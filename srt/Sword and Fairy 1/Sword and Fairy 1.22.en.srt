=Episode 22=

3
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:06,650
It's her?

4
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,120
Dare to beg on our turf?

5
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:24,330
Beat him!

6
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,330
Stop hitting me!

7
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,560
In broad daylight,

8
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,900
you're ganging up on a child.

9
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:31,120
What kind of skill is that?

10
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:33,300
Another nosy one.

11
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:34,140
Are you leaving or not?

12
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:36,120
If not, we'll beat you too.

13
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,170
Tang Yu.

14
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:00,000
Tang Yu, let's go over there.

15
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,100
What's wrong?

16
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,740
A'nu,

17
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,330
what tune were you humming just now?

18
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,300
Tune?

19
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,050
Did I hum?

20
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,410
This one?

21
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,140
That's right.

22
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:59,640
It's not really a tune.

23
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,460
It's just something I made up

24
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,610
when I was bored as a child,

25
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,890
and I gradually started humming it.

26
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,760
Why? Don't you like it?

27
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,380
I do.

28
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:26,890
A'nu,

29
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,610
it's you.

30
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,570
Tang Yu,

31
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,730
why do you

32
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:47,920
suddenly act like this?

33
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,160
- I...
- The magical zone is gone.

34
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:00,010
Ling'er succeeded.

35
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:03,940
Tang Yu, let's go find the Witch Queen.

36
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,780
A'nu.

37
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,760
Let's leave this place together.

38
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,320
Leave?

39
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,160
Aren't we going to find the Witch Queen?

40
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,850
I have something to tell you.

41
00:05:18,890 --> 00:05:19,970
What is it?

42
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:22,850
Last night,

43
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:24,220
I saw

44
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:28,410
people from the Moon Worship Sect.

45
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,730
What?

46
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:30,850
The Moon Worship Sect?

47
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:32,420
I...

48
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,260
What's wrong?

49
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:49,530
Maybe I was mistaken,

50
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:53,970
but I just heard something strange.

51
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,320
Maybe it really is them.

52
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,570
What should we do?

53
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,880
Did we fall into their trap?

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,700
This is what we're going to do.

55
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,810
You go protect the Princess,

56
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,320
and I'll stay by the passageway.

57
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,850
If any suspicious person
tries to come in,

58
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:19,320
I'll deal with them.

59
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,330
Okay,

60
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:25,850
but I'll say it again.

61
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,570
Don't get hurt.

62
00:06:35,610 --> 00:06:36,450
A'nu.

63
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:42,410
You must be safe.

64
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,570
With you here, I'll surely be safe.

65
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,290
Come back quickly.

66
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,880
Come back soon.

67
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,450
A'nu,

68
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:31,890
I'm sorry.

69
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,920
Ling'er, what's wrong?

70
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:49,730
Xiaoyao,

71
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,690
I couldn't revive my mother.

72
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,760
She's gone forever.

73
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,500
Ling'er,

74
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,540
don't worry.

75
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:04,690
You still have me.

76
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,130
You still have me.

77
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:08,700
Your Highness,

78
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:11,480
you just said the Witch Queen has left?

79
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,480
My mother couldn't be revived at all.

80
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,040
Inside the statue,

81
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,570
only her consciousness remained,

82
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:30,010
but upon seeing me,

83
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,240
it also dissipated.

84
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,370
Could it be

85
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:43,800
the rumors we heard were false?

86
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,370
A'nu, where is Tang Yu?

87
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,370
He's right behind,
and he'll be here soon.

88
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,370
Everyone,

89
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,050
now that the magical zone has dissipated,

90
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,170
we must find a way

91
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:10,340
to transfer or hide

92
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,290
the Queen's statue now.

93
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,540
That's right.

94
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,090
The timing

95
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,930
is just right.

96
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,540
Bai Yue!

97
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,680
So many familiar faces.

98
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,410
Mr. Shi, you really were used by him.

99
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,730
General Gai,

100
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:49,090
you're as clever as ever.

101
00:09:49,090 --> 00:09:51,000
And you're still so scheming.

102
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:53,130
Chief of the Moon Worship Sect,

103
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,900
was it you who ordered the killing
of Ling'er's grandmother?

104
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,640
Li Xiaoyao,

105
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,410
long time no see.

106
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,290
When have I ever seen you?

107
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:08,730
Your Highness,

108
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,090
are you well?

109
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,420
Bai Yue,

110
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,220
why did you

111
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:20,170
frame my mother back then?

112
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,930
You and your mother
are of the same blood.

113
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,330
As for

114
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,000
whether you have otherworldly traits,

115
00:10:31,610 --> 00:10:33,610
you know best in your heart.

116
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,850
After ten years,

117
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,850
who shall be the first

118
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,930
to take this fatal strike?

119
00:11:24,490 --> 00:11:25,800
- Mother!
- The Witch Queen!

120
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:27,930
Li Xiaoyao,

121
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:30,640
after ten years,

122
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:34,120
your martial arts are still so poor.

123
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,130
Bai Yue,

124
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:38,530
even if I die today,

125
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:40,290
I will take you down with me.

126
00:13:53,090 --> 00:13:53,930
Landlord!

127
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,680
Young lady,

128
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,370
your role is completed.

129
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,410
It's time to send you back.

130
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,450
A'nu!

131
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,300
Don't!

132
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,690
A'nu!

133
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:52,890
A'nu!

134
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,740
A'nu!

135
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,220
- Tang Yu...
- I'm sorry.

136
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,970
You go help Miss Gai and the others.

137
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,610
They can't hold on.

138
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,980
No.

139
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:05,320
- No.
- Go.

140
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,660
Tang Yu,

141
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:18,650
where have you just been?

142
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,820
Was Bai Yue brought here by you?

143
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,530
Why did he spare you just now?

144
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,050
Tell me!

145
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:47,760
Naive.

146
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:35,420
No!

147
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,530
Mr. Shi,

148
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,560
you really were

149
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,240
easy to use.

150
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:52,570
Your Highness,

151
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:54,800
I was foolish,

152
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:58,120
unable to see
Bai Yue's true colors earlier,

153
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:01,930
committing such a grave mistake.

154
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:04,500
I've let down the Witch King,
the Witch Queen,

155
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,730
the Princess,

156
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:08,130
and the people of Nanzhao.

157
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:11,040
Mr. Shi, rest assured.

158
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:13,730
The Witch King
and Witch Queen will know

159
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,560
you died a heroic death.

160
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,730
Crimson Blood Flame!

161
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,940
No!

162
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:52,400
Mr. Shi!

163
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,660
Ling'er!

164
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,730
Bai Yue!

165
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:23,090
You all better live well.

166
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:26,250
I'm leaving this place.

167
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,800
How regrettable it is today.

168
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:35,250
The combined strength of all of you

169
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:39,970
cannot harm me even in the slightest.

170
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,460
A'nu!

171
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,210
Chief,

172
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,610
we could have killed them all.

173
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,200
Why did you let them go?

174
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,340
Killing them and letting them die

175
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,250
is easy.

176
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,560
Making them live

177
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,440
according to my wishes

178
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,160
is not easy.

179
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,400
But just now,

180
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,090
Tang Yu had feelings

181
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:02,420
for that girl.

182
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:06,160
Feelings are precious
in the mortal world.

183
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,650
Everyone in the mundane world wants it.

184
00:20:11,050 --> 00:20:12,010
But Chief,

185
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:14,130
aren't you afraid

186
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,730
he will betray you

187
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,280
because of this?

188
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:21,400
If it really comes to that,

189
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,200
I would be sad.

190
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:27,970
Very sad.

191
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:31,410
Li Xiaoyao,

192
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:34,490
I'm waiting for you
to take the last step.

193
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:43,650
It's unexpected
that Bai Yue's martial arts are so good.

194
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,220
Perhaps only the Five Spiritual Beads

195
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,440
can help us against him.

196
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:05,730
General Gai,

197
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,680
how is A'nu's injury?

198
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,850
Your Highness,

199
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,520
A'nu has suffered internal injuries.

200
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,340
We must return to Nanzhao quickly

201
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:18,680
to seek treatment from the Sacred Maid,

202
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,560
otherwise, I'm afraid she might not survive.

203
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,800
Then you and Tang Yu
escort A'nu back to Nanzhao now.

204
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,040
We'll go look for
the Five Spiritual Beads.

205
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,770
Tang Yu, come with me.

206
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:43,940
Tang Yu,

207
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,170
about A'nu's injuries,

208
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:46,370
I'm afraid she won't make it to Nanzhao.

209
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:47,210
What can we do?

210
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,060
Right now,

211
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,040
only the Heavenly Fragrance Elixir

212
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,850
can stabilize her condition.

213
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:03,520
But I'm still missing one ingredient.

214
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,180
What is it?

215
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,060
This

216
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:19,160
is the Golden Silkworm King?

217
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:21,130
Indeed.

218
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,440
This creature is of utmost yin.

219
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:27,970
Only by consuming the heart blood
of a body full of yang

220
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:29,800
can it be used as a medicine.

221
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,450
Are you aware of the consequences
of the worm entering the body?

222
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,770
Meridian disruption,

223
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:49,730
endless circulation,

224
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,010
and eternal suffering.

225
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:24,250
I will exert my energy

226
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,010
to force out the worm
as a medicine ingredient.

227
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,580
Tang Yu.

228
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:34,770
I hope you make the right decision.

229
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:00,210
Your Highness,

230
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,370
I'll carry the baggage.

231
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:04,560
The Earth and Sacred Spiritual Beads
are entrusted to you.

232
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:35,820
Ling'er

233
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,320
is acting a bit off.

234
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:41,770
She's a bit anxious.

235
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:44,010
With such a significant change,

236
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,250
anyone would be,

237
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,090
especially Ling'er.

238
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:48,800
She's always been more sensitive.

239
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,680
We need to find a way
to get her to stop for a moment.

240
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,400
I can't go on. I can't go on.

241
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,890
Let's rest for a bit.

242
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:02,970
Let's rest for a bit.

243
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,180
Ling'er,

244
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,770
we've been walking for a long time.

245
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:06,850
Let's rest for a bit.

246
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,160
Xiaoyao,

247
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,680
you and Yueru rest here for a while.

248
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,400
I'll take a look around.

249
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:16,040
Ling'er, where are you going?

250
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,300
Ling'er!

251
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,730
Ling'er!

252
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,610
- Ling'er.
- Why?

253
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,400
Why does the Sacred Spiritual Bead
show no reaction when it's with me?

254
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,730
Am I unable to find
the Five Spiritual Beads?

255
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:48,580
Ling'er, don't worry.

256
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,800
I will definitely help you find them.

257
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,440
It's my fault.

258
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:55,890
I can't revive my mother

259
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,160
and save Mr. Shi.

260
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,220
I have no way

261
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:01,680
to save the people of Nanzhao.

262
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,700
Ling'er,

263
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,620
don't think too much.

264
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,890
You need to stay calm.

265
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,440
So many people were implicated
because of me.

266
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,320
It's my fault that so many people died.

267
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,650
It's my fault
that so many people got hurt.

268
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,580
It's me. It's me. It's me.

269
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,700
It's all my fault.

270
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,850
No, it's not.

271
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,160
Ling'er, it's not your fault, Ling'er.

272
00:26:22,170 --> 00:26:23,010
Ling'er.

273
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,340
Ling'er.

274
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:29,610
Ling'er,

275
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,560
you can't think like that.

276
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:35,010
You shouldn't.

277
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,210
Ling'er,

278
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:10,130
do you feel a bit better after crying?

279
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:11,940
Thank you,

280
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,560
Xiaoyao.

281
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,730
Xiaoyao,

282
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,040
all the way here,

283
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,320
we've been through so much.

284
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,040
If

285
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,920
I'm as weak as before,

286
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,090
how can I face those
who died because of me?

287
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,420
Ling'er,

288
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:35,860
you shouldn't blame everything

289
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,940
on yourself.

290
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,850
But they indeed died because of me.

291
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:42,780
Ling'er,

292
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,250
just do what you want to do.

293
00:27:45,250 --> 00:27:46,400
I will always be with you.

294
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,200
But you have to promise me.

295
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,130
Don't bear it all alone anymore.

296
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:51,770
I can face everything

297
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,560
with you.

298
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:55,400
But Bai Yue

299
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:57,680
is so hard to defeat.

300
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,250
I don't know what kind of difficulties

301
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,820
we'll face in the future,

302
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:02,730
- and how many more people...
- So what?

303
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:04,730
Ling'er,

304
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,560
no matter how powerful Bai Yue is,

305
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,160
I firmly believe

306
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,250
evil will never prevail over good.

307
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,320
Even if we have to go
through a sea of fire and blades,

308
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,440
I'll walk beside you.

309
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,460
Thank you,

310
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:21,200
Xiaoyao.

311
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:33,970
Ling'er,

312
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:35,210
how are you now?

313
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,130
Yueru,

314
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,290
I'm fine now.

315
00:28:37,290 --> 00:28:38,370
Sorry for making you worry.

316
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:39,750
It's okay as long as you're fine.

317
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:41,460
It's getting late. Let's hurry on,

318
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,050
find a place to rest,
and have something to eat.

319
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:44,300
You're always thinking about eating.

320
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:47,010
Yueru.

321
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,010
Savage girl, what's wrong with you?

322
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,800
Why didn't you tell us earlier?

323
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,090
It's just a small injury.
What's there to tell?

324
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,010
Ling'er,
don't waste your spiritual power.

325
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:01,440
I'll find some medicine
to apply on it later.

326
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:21,250
Thank you, Ling'er.

327
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,250
You're the best.

328
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,090
Yueru,

329
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:26,650
even if it's a minor injury,
don't just bear it on your own.

330
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:27,800
Ling'er, you too.

331
00:29:28,460 --> 00:29:30,370
Don't keep everything to yourself.

332
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,420
Let's go.

333
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:05,200
I haven't seen you
as you were for a long time.

334
00:30:06,170 --> 00:30:08,520
I've already extinguished
the consciousness of that demon queen

335
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:10,320
and lifted the seal.

336
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:14,130
I gave you life,

337
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:17,320
so you will obey me.

338
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:21,440
I will definitely let you see
the light of day again.

339
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:43,780
(Taoist Wood)

340
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,700
Master,

341
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,560
I've found a clue
about the peach branch.

342
00:30:53,050 --> 00:30:55,090
It's hidden in a peach forest
not far from here.

343
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,370
However, this peach forest
is shrouded in heavy fog.

344
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,320
I've tried several times

345
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,370
but couldn't get through the fog.

346
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:09,560
Recently, while cultivating
the Wind Spiritual Bead,

347
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:12,920
I sensed a gathering
of demonic energy nearby.

348
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:16,170
(Bao Pu)
- Maybe that's why. - Demonic energy?

349
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:18,280
Let me pass some wind spiritual power
to you now

350
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,740
to help you

351
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,090
disperse the fog.

352
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:23,010
Thank you, Master.

353
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:54,020
(Taoyuan Village)

354
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,890
Strange. Why is the fog getting thicker?

355
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,520
What kind of place is this?

356
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:12,090
And with so many peach blossoms?

357
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,010
I faintly sense

358
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,890
a gathering of demonic energy around.

359
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,250
Demonic energy?

360
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,730
If there truly is demonic energy here,

361
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,680
perhaps we could find a clue
to the Five Spiritual Beads.

362
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,250
Let's venture into the peach forest.

363
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,650
Ling'er, stay close to me.

364
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:48,850
Spiritual Beads?

365
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,850
Give me one.

366
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:57,890
No.

367
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,740
Go pick one yourself.

368
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:00,400
Give it to me.

369
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:06,940
We're going now.

370
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,560
How come there's suddenly a village?

371
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,800
This place is beautiful.

372
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,610
These are blossoms
that bloomed yesterday.

373
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,100
We can make
a lot of peach blossom cakes.

374
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:23,610
- Let's ask ahead.
- Here, take this.

375
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,460
Someone's coming.

376
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,370
We got lost and ended up here.

377
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:39,100
May I ask where this place is?

378
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,280
(Song Hewen)
This is Taoyuan Village.

379
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:42,370
(A-Tao)
You all look weary

380
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:43,370
from travel.

381
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:44,370
Come to my house for a rest.

382
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,750
Have some hot tea
before you go on your way.

383
00:33:45,770 --> 00:33:47,490
No need. We're in a hurry.

384
00:33:48,010 --> 00:33:48,980
Could you please tell us

385
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,200
how to get out of this forest?

386
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,940
The terrain of this valley
is complex and changing.

387
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,400
You won't be able to leave for now.

388
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:57,280
Come have some tea and snacks
at my house first,

389
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,410
and then I'll explain in detail

390
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:00,250
how to get out.

391
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,420
Please.

392
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,680
You should rest a bit
before continuing on your journey.

393
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,620
Thank you.

394
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:12,410
Follow me.

395
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:17,040
Look, this is my home.

396
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:23,210
Dad,

397
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:24,690
we have guests in the village.

398
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,320
Welcome, welcome.

399
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,090
(Chief of Taoyuan Village)
I failed to greet our guests from afar.

400
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,800
My apologies, my apologies.

401
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,090
This is my father,

402
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,520
also the chief of Taoyuan Village.

403
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:39,500
By the way,
we still don't know your names.

404
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,540
I am Li Xiaoyao.

405
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,690
These two are Zhao Ling'er
and Lin Yueru.

406
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,020
This is my daughter, A-Tao,

407
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,220
and he is Song Hewen.

408
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:48,220
Don't stand there. Please, have a seat.

409
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,060
Please have a seat.

410
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,610
Come here.

411
00:34:51,810 --> 00:34:52,720
A-Tao, serve some tea.

412
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,520
Miss Zhao, here.

413
00:34:58,850 --> 00:34:59,700
- Please.
- Mr. Li.

414
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:01,090
If you don't mind...

415
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:01,930
Thank you.

416
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,000
Stay at my home today.

417
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,130
We got lost and ended up here.

418
00:35:06,130 --> 00:35:08,130
Could you tell us
how to leave this valley?

419
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,490
We still need
to continue on our journey.

420
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,890
No rush, no rush.

421
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:14,520
The terrain here is extremely complex.

422
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:17,370
Without a local to guide,

423
00:35:17,370 --> 00:35:19,450
it's hard for outsiders to leave.

424
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:22,930
Sir...

425
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,540
It's getting late today.

426
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:27,170
Tomorrow morning, I will arrange
for someone to lead you out.

427
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,460
Tonight, our village

428
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,460
is celebrating the arrival of spring.

429
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,650
Stay and join us for the festivities.

430
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,140
Ling'er,

431
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,720
then we'll continue our journey tomorrow.

432
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,370
Great. Great.

433
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:46,650
In that case,

434
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,240
A-Tao, you entertain our guests for now,

435
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,570
I'll check on the preparations

436
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:50,810
for the festival.

437
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:51,650
Okay.

438
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:54,850
Excuse me. I'm leaving then.

439
00:35:58,850 --> 00:35:59,850
Please, have a seat.

440
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:01,690
Try our famous peach blossom crisp.

441
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:04,940
This is delicious.

442
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,890
Give it a try.

443
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:14,520
Over here, over here.

444
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:22,730
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

445
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:26,560
Join us.

446
00:36:27,610 --> 00:36:28,450
Come here.

447
00:36:30,330 --> 00:36:33,090
Mr. Li, Miss Zhao, and Miss Lin,

448
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,370
where are you from?

449
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,780
We've been to Yuhang,

450
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:36,980
Suzhou City, Yangzhou City,

451
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,020
and Yunmeng Marsh.

452
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:39,170
So many places.

453
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,370
I've never heard of them.

454
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,610
A-Tao, don't worry.

455
00:36:43,850 --> 00:36:44,760
After we get married,

456
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,450
we'll also visit Yunmeng Marsh.

457
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,410
Then I'll take you to Suzhou City
and Yangzhou City for fun.

458
00:36:49,650 --> 00:36:51,210
I've always wanted
to see the outside world,

459
00:36:52,170 --> 00:36:53,480
but my dad says

460
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:56,690
Taoyuan Village is the best place,

461
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,090
and the outside world is dangerous,

462
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,560
nowhere near
as good as Taoyuan Village.

463
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:07,040
Indeed, Taoyuan Village is a paradise,

464
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:09,780
but the outside
isn't as bad as you think.

465
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,620
A-Tao,

466
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:13,060
there are countless beautiful sights
and delicacies in the world.

467
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,520
I want to see them all with you

468
00:37:15,020 --> 00:37:17,610
to travel to famous mountains and rivers

469
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,520
and tour scenic spots,

470
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:20,540
savoring the world's delicacies.

471
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,480
Wouldn't that be wonderful?

472
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,720
Can we really do that?

473
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,320
Since you all say so,

474
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,540
then...

475
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,800
We can talk about it later.

476
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,370
Sorry, everyone,

477
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,610
for the neglect.

478
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,410
Mr. Li, Hewen,

479
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:42,960
since you just arrived in our village,

480
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,460
let me introduce you

481
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:45,370
to our villagers.

482
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,820
Come, come, come.

483
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,410
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

484
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:55,930
Come.

485
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,130
Miss Lin, Miss Zhao,

486
00:37:57,130 --> 00:37:57,970
let's continue drinking.

487
00:38:01,330 --> 00:38:02,410
Enough, enough.

488
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:03,250
We've drunk plenty.

489
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:05,210
Come on.

490
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:06,780
A-Tao,

491
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,130
is your village always this lively?

492
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,280
Yes. Every night, we gather together,

493
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,850
drink, share our thoughts,

494
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,690
sing, and dance.

495
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:19,960
It truly is the life of the immortals.

496
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:23,610
I used to think so too,

497
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,450
but

498
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,090
ever since I met Hewen,

499
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,090
he always talks about the outside world,

500
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,240
making me yearn

501
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,560
to see it.

502
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,000
Yet, what my dad says also makes sense,

503
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,960
leaving me unsure

504
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,520
of what to do.

505
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:44,300
A-Tao,

506
00:38:45,170 --> 00:38:48,520
actually, where I lived before
is a lot like here.

507
00:38:50,940 --> 00:38:53,560
I felt the same as you do now,

508
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:58,210
and my grandmother
also never let me go out.

509
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,760
But eventually,

510
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,410
I did go out

511
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,090
and discovered the world is much bigger.

512
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:09,090
If you miss out on the scenery outside

513
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,650
because of these reasons,

514
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:14,690
you might end up regretting it.

515
00:39:15,890 --> 00:39:16,730
Miss Zhao,

516
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,280
did you decide to leave your home

517
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:21,280
because of Mr. Li?

518
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:36,040
Miss Zhao, Miss Lin,

519
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,960
why don't you stay a few more days?

520
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,800
The day after tomorrow
is my wedding day with Hewen.

521
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,210
You could stay and attend.

522
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,690
Thank you for the invitation,
Miss A-Tao,

523
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,170
but

524
00:39:50,570 --> 00:39:51,690
I don't think we can.

525
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:54,850
We have important matters to attend to.

526
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:58,040
Make the decision later.

527
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,560
After tonight,

528
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,210
maybe you'll change your mind.

529
00:40:04,370 --> 00:40:05,690
Miss Lin, Miss Zhao,

530
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:08,170
I'm going to find my dad and Hewen.

531
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:09,110
Take your time with the drink.

532
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,000
This place is truly wonderful,

533
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,520
and the people are kind.

534
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:26,610
After we find the Five Spiritual Beads,

535
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,330
if I can settle down

536
00:40:29,330 --> 00:40:30,960
in such a serene place,

537
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:33,000
that will be wonderful.

538
00:40:37,370 --> 00:40:38,210
This place

539
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:39,850
is indeed quite nice,

540
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:41,410
but for someone like me

541
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,090
who can't stay put for long,

542
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,320
I don't think

543
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:48,720
I could live here indefinitely.

544
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:52,210
I still prefer wandering the world
and upholding justice,

545
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,610
but Li Xiaoyao can be idle
and stay with you.

546
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,800
If that day really comes,

547
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,090
even if I have wandered
to the ends of the earth,

548
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,480
I'll come back to visit you,

549
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,690
rest in your little house,

550
00:41:04,090 --> 00:41:06,130
and tell you stories
about Lin the Heroine.

551
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,850
After resting enough,
I'll continue on my journey.

552
00:41:09,780 --> 00:41:10,620
Here, Ling'er.

553
00:41:19,810 --> 00:41:20,940
By then,

554
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,420
there would be no need
for you to tell stories.

555
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,980
The heroic deeds of Lin the Heroine

556
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:27,000
will surely be known
throughout the martial world.

557
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,090
Certainly.

558
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:36,170
We

559
00:41:37,810 --> 00:41:39,560
must all stay safe

560
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,040
until that day comes.

561
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,210
