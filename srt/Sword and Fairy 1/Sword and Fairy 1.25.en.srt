2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 25=

3
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,400
I'm a disciple of Taoist Mu.

4
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,040
I'm here to report
to the Head of Mount Shu.

5
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,090
I got here without invitation.
Please forgive me.

6
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,360
My master was brutally killed by a demon

7
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,250
and has passed away.

8
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:22,000
I am here

9
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,970
to return his magical instruments
and tokens,

10
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,050
and I have urgent matters
to report to the Head,

11
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,760
concerning the honor of Mount Shu.

12
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:54,220
(Mount Shu)

13
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,300
Mr. Dugu.

14
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,540
(Mr. Dugu, Saint of Sword)

15
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,640
He claims to be a disciple of Taoist Mu.

16
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,440
(Tai Wu)
He has important matters to report to you.

17
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:28,170
Greetings, I'm Bao Pu,
Taoist Mu's disciple.

18
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,280
Stand up and speak.

19
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,970
My master was killed by a demon.

20
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,720
I beseech you to uphold justice.

21
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:49,610
Taoist Mu was fond
of collecting rare treasures.

22
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:52,610
He harmed the innocent,
yet he did not repent.

23
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,130
He was stripped of his elder status
and left Mount Shu.

24
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,330
After many years,

25
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,840
I did not expect him to...

26
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,410
What caused his death?
Stand up and speak.

27
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:08,740
Yes, sir.

28
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:13,570
My master and I went by Taoyuan Village

29
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,810
and discovered that the villagers
were all peach demons.

30
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:18,090
They deceived mortals
to drain their vitality.

31
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,290
To save the people

32
00:04:21,050 --> 00:04:22,490
and uphold Mount Shu's honor,

33
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,130
my master took me to subdue the demons.

34
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,320
Unexpectedly,

35
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,530
a powerful demoness

36
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:29,480
suddenly appeared.

37
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,810
Despite our efforts against the demoness,

38
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,730
my master...

39
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,050
My master

40
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,010
was killed by her.

41
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:43,810
Before passing, my master worried
about me being alone,

42
00:04:44,170 --> 00:04:46,690
and instructed me to return
to Mount Shu to claim my heritage,

43
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,920
and encouraged me to cultivate well,

44
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,600
hoping I could be like him,
eliminate demons,

45
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,570
and protect the people.

46
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,360
Mu has continued
to follow the righteous path

47
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,200
despite leaving Mount Shu.

48
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,160
Since you are his disciple,

49
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:05,320
you are also a disciple
of Mount Shu now.

50
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,440
Thank you for accepting me.

51
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,730
But the demoness

52
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:11,730
is still causing harm in the world.

53
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,480
I pray for you to uphold justice.

54
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:17,920
If the demoness
is as powerful as you say,

55
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:20,320
there should have been disturbances
in the world,

56
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,360
yet Mount Shu has felt nothing.

57
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:29,540
Part of the reason my master was killed

58
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,730
is that a disciple of Mount Shu

59
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:32,250
was colluding with her.

60
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,260
A disciple of Mount Shu?

61
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,730
- A disciple of Mount Shu?
- Impossible.

62
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,880
How could this be?

63
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,730
A disciple of Mount Shu?

64
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:43,410
He is called Li Xiaoyao.

65
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:46,810
Li Xiaoyao?

66
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:51,130
I've never heard of him before.

67
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,410
Mr. Dugu, please discern the truth.

68
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,770
Mr. Dugu, we cannot allow outsiders
to impersonate Mount Shu disciples

69
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,010
and tarnish our reputation.

70
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,320
Mr. Dugu, Mr. Mu had merits
in killing demons,

71
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,290
and we must seek justice for him.

72
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:12,660
Now that a demon has appeared,

73
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,570
we of Mount Shu cannot ignore it.

74
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,250
Mr. Dugu!

75
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,040
Hasn't Situ returned to the mountain yet?

76
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,730
Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal
has always been elusive

77
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,190
and has not returned to the mountain.

78
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:02,130
Greetings, King of Prison.

79
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,440
(King of Prison)
For hundreds of years,

80
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:08,290
Mount Shu has been cutting down demons
and upholding the righteous path.

81
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:11,090
Now that a demon is causing trouble,

82
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,850
go to capture it now.

83
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,170
King of Prison,

84
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:16,660
this matter
has not yet been investigated.

85
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,090
The demon is causing trouble,

86
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:21,410
go to capture it now.
Make sure to subdue it.

87
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:22,450
King of Prison,

88
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:25,410
acting rashly without evidence
might be improper.

89
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,760
Do not hesitate.

90
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,200
Go to capture the demon now
and confine it in the Demon-Locking Tower.

91
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,990
Where are the disciples
for the Seven-Star Sword Formation?

92
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,260
- Here.
- Here.

93
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,200
Go immediately

94
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,450
to capture the demon.

95
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:50,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

96
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:51,570
You go with them.

97
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:53,850
Yes, Mr. Dugu.

98
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:11,880
All his possessions are gone.

99
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,970
The Wind Spiritual Bead

100
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,760
is not here.

101
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,360
He has fallen and is mangled.

102
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,050
Could it have fallen somewhere

103
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:26,010
during the fall?

104
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,760
He wasn't killed by the fall.

105
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:28,970
Look at that rock.

106
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,560
Could someone have killed Taoist Mu

107
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,970
and stolen his possessions?

108
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,880
It must have been Bao Pu.

109
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,980
Look.

110
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,780
It's Bao Pu.

111
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:51,290
Indeed, he took the Wind Spiritual Bead.

112
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:14,490
Master!

113
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,620
Master!

114
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,410
Your death is such a tragedy.

115
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,290
Mr. Dugu has agreed
to uphold justice for you.

116
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,290
Sir, it was them who killed my master.

117
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,550
You Taoist priest, stop spewing lies.

118
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,940
We found him already dead
when we arrived.

119
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,820
It's him. He's Li Xiaoyao.

120
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,090
He colluded with the demoness,
and they killed my master.

121
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,120
Shameless!

122
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:39,650
You're twisting the facts
and blaming others.

123
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,940
It's obviously you who killed Taoist Mu

124
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,050
and stole his treasures.

125
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,290
Right. Your vile deeds
will come to light upon investigation.

126
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,130
Miss Lin,

127
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,000
as the daughter
of the Martial Leader of the South,

128
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,680
how could you associate with such people?

129
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,850
It's not too late
to turn back from the wrong path.

130
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,820
You're full of lies,
betraying your master.

131
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,940
Don't be deceived by him.

132
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:55,090
Stop slandering people.

133
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:57,090
Young man,

134
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,460
if you claim to be from Mount Shu,

135
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,560
why are you mingling
with these demonic outsiders?

136
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,050
If you do not intervene,

137
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,200
we can take you back to Mount Shu

138
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:07,170
and ask Mr. Dugu to be lenient with you.

139
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:08,010
So,

140
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:09,530
you believe what he says?

141
00:10:09,970 --> 00:10:11,700
You believe that it was us
who killed Taoist Mu?

142
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,800
Right and wrong

143
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:14,290
will be judged fairly.

144
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,560
A bunch of people
who can't tell right from wrong,

145
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,140
and yet you talk about fairness.

146
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,370
If you remain deluded,

147
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,370
do not blame us for being ruthless.

148
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,120
Today, I must avenge my master!

149
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:48,570
Start the formation.

150
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,370
The Seven-Star Sword Formation!

151
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:17,290
This sword formation is so formidable.

152
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,730
Miss Fairy,

153
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,680
this is Mount Shu's
Seven-Star Sword Formation,

154
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,650
specifically powerful
against high-level demons,

155
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:24,120
suppressing all evil spirits.

156
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,100
Sir, look.

157
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,100
How do you know Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal's
Art of Thousands of Swords?

158
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:53,290
Want to know? I won't tell you.

159
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,860
In that case,

160
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:57,090
there's no need to hold back.

161
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:00,250
Fellow disciples,

162
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:02,610
the demoness is powerful.
We must capture her today,

163
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,930
to prevent further harm to the world.

164
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,060
Ling'er!

165
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,930
You demoness, surrender now.

166
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,200
Come with us to Mount Shu,
and we might spare your lives.

167
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,660
Xiaoyao!

168
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,000
Xiaoyao!

169
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:34,760
Xiaoyao...

170
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:36,330
Ling'er...

171
00:15:39,410 --> 00:15:40,250
Ling'er...

172
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,540
Xiaoyao...

173
00:16:06,650 --> 00:16:07,490
Xiaoyao!

174
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:16,930
You demoness,

175
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:19,050
surrender now!

176
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,400
Xiaoyao. Xiaoyao.

177
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:31,130
Yueru.

178
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,820
Yueru.

179
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,560
Yueru, wake up.

180
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,300
Ling'er...

181
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:40,210
Xiaoyao.

182
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:42,130
Ling'er...

183
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,580
Right now,

184
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,680
I will use magic to save you.

185
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:55,650
Demoness,

186
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,010
you've harmed so many today.

187
00:17:58,650 --> 00:17:59,970
We cannot let you go.

188
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,800
I'm the one you want.

189
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,200
I am the demoness.

190
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,920
Let them go, and I'll come with you.

191
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:53,660
Demoness,

192
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,920
you've injured so many of our fellows.

193
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,890
We can't let you go today.

194
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,160
Say another word,
and I'll perish together with you.

195
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,780
Sir, eliminating the demon is crucial.

196
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,090
Other matters can be considered later.

197
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,890
Let's take this demoness
back to Mount Shu first,

198
00:19:11,890 --> 00:19:12,970
hand her over to King of Prison,

199
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,690
and confine her
in the Demon-Locking Tower

200
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,560
so she can never reincarnate.

201
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
Alright.

202
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,340
Ling'er...

203
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,940
Ling'er...

00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,370
I'm sorry.

205
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,490
I have to break my promise again.

206
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:16,060
You both

207
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,650
must live well.

208
00:20:20,130 --> 00:20:21,560
Take good care of Yueru.

209
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,970
Why does it

210
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:36,610
always end up

211

271

you must protect Xiaoyao and Yueru.

272
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,970
Don't let them remember me.

Xiaoyao,

00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:47,250
in this life,

00:25:49,050 --> 00:25:49,890
we

276
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:56,610
shall never meet again.

277
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,340
Sir,

278
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,730
those two have fainted.

279
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,940
Maybe we...

280
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,850
Since I've promised to let those two go,

281
00:26:18,890 --> 00:26:20,090
I must keep my word.

282
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,340
Let's go back to the mountain.

283
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,660
Master,

284
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:04,130
we've brought the demoness back.

285
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:06,400
Is the demoness

286
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,850
as powerful

287
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,680
as Bao Pu said?

288
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:11,890
Indeed.

289
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,740
Our Seven-Star Sword Formation

290
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,090
used all its strength
to only fight her to a standstill.

291
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:20,410
Is the Mount Shu disciple real or fake?

292
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,520
He used Mr. Situ's
Art of Thousands of Swords.

293
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,980
In my opinion,

294
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,370
maybe Mr. Situ instructed him
at some point.

295
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:30,970
Although Situ is unconventional
in his actions,

296
00:27:31,370 --> 00:27:32,800
those he chooses to instruct

297
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:36,280
are unlikely to be villainous.

298
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:38,520
I think so too,

299
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,280
but he is quite impulsive.

300
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,650
We had hardly exchanged a few words
before we started fighting.

301
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,500
Has Mu's death

302
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,100
been thoroughly investigated?

303
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,090
They refuse to admit it,

304
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,560
even claiming it was Bao Pu who did it.

305
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:52,970
But I believe

306
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,160
Bao Pu had no reason
to kill his own master.

307
00:27:57,530 --> 00:27:58,770
Where is the demoness now?

308
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:01,890
I brought her back to Mount Shu.

309
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,920
King of Prison then ordered me
to take her to the Demon-Locking Tower.

310
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,940
I had no choice

311
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:08,850
but to comply.

312
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,560
There might be more

313
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,400
to the demoness's story.

314
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:21,090
It's handed over to you

315
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,090
to investigate this thoroughly.

316
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:25,940
Yes.

317
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,250
Master, I'm here to save you.

318
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,850
Little Phoenix,

319
00:28:53,530 --> 00:28:56,010
you should also find a way
to leave here quickly.

320
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:59,850
Master, I won't leave.

321
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:04,200
You only have me now.

322
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:06,800
Listen to me.

323
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,920
I can manage alone.

324
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,440
Little Phoenix.

325
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:29,610
Master, this place is strange.

326
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,560
I feel my spiritual power
rapidly vanishing.

327
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,440
You must find a way to escape.

328
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,090

00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,800
Xiaoyao

330
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,650
and Yueru...

331
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,440
I wonder

332
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:00,770
how they are now.

333
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,040
My head hurts so much.

334
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,160
Me too.

335
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,920
I clearly remember

336
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,090
you were covered in injuries.

337
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,920
How come they are gone now?

338
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:58,400
These two Spiritual Beads
are entrusted to you.

339
00:31:59,100 --> 00:31:59,940
Rest assured.

340
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:01,090
Be careful on the road.

341
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,370
Let's go.

342
00:32:06,670 --> 00:32:08,010
Luckily, the Spiritual Beads aren't lost.

343
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:21,130
What are you looking for?

344
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:22,560
I keep feeling like I lost something,

345
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,890
but I can't remember what it is.

346
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:28,440
I feel the same way.

347
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:34,490
Where are those
Mount Shu Taoist priests?

348
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:38,320
Those Mount Shu Taoist priests

349
00:32:38,530 --> 00:32:39,730
are as dumb as pigs.

350
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,550
How can they believe
that little Taoist priest's side of the story

351
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,800
and think we killed Taoist Mu?

352
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,460
When I come back, I'll tell my father

353
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,280
and have Saint of Sword
give them a good lesson.

354
00:32:57,580 --> 00:32:59,970
A'nu, drink the medicine now.

355
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:04,890
Master,

356
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:08,370
if I don't take the medicine,

357
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,730
will my injuries get worse?

358
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
A'nu,

359
00:33:12,410 --> 00:33:14,440
your injuries are severe this time.

360
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:15,970
You can't be stubborn.

361
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:22,090
Master,

362
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:24,290
you know I've hated taking medicine
since I was little.

363
00:33:24,290 --> 00:33:25,370
I don't want to take it.

364
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:27,730
This time you don't get to choose.

365
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:30,680
Master, did Tang Yu gather this medicine?

366
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:32,010
If it's from Tang Yu,

367
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,490
would you take it?

368
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:37,440
No, I wouldn't.

369
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:42,560
Then there's no need for him
to come see you.

370
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,890
Tang Yu is back?

371
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,970
Whether he comes back or not

372
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,370
is up to you.

373
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:15,850
Master,

374
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,760
I'll wait for Tang Yu
to come back before I take it.

375
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,010
Madam,

376
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,240
is A'nu getting better?

377
00:34:51,890 --> 00:34:52,730
Tang Yu,

378
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,720
why are you so unsettled?

379
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:58,650
I'm thinking

380
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,930
if I should leave now.

381
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:03,300
Tang Yu,

382
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:05,220
even if you leave now,

383
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,690
what you've done won't change.

384
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,280
But in my current situation,

385
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:15,720
I can no longer protect the young master,

386
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,210
and I might bring her new harm.

387
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:21,490
Tang Yu,

388
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,800
external injuries are easy to treat,

389
00:35:25,610 --> 00:35:27,170
while heart wounds are hard to heal.

390
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,690
I see.

391
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:51,650
Why is it so quiet after so long?

392
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:52,890
Can you even use this?

393
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,300
Let me try it.

394
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:56,980
Give it back after you're done.

395
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,560
You're clumsy. Don't break it.

396
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:02,170
Who's clumsy? I'm very adept.

397
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,960
See, I told you you're clumsy.

398
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,820
It smells good.

399
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:15,210
Are you hungry?

400
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:16,860
Flower scent.

401
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,520
Don't you smell it?

402
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,060
Your hands and feet are clumsy,
but I didn't expect your nose to have problems.

403
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:24,900
How come I didn't smell it?

404
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,850
What's wrong?
Are you fainting from hunger?

405
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,480
Bao Pu, you're sneaking around here.

406
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:41,690
What are you trying to do?

407
00:36:42,410 --> 00:36:43,930
If it weren't for that demoness,

408
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:46,610
you would have died
by my sword already.

409
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:50,850
Hand over the Spiritual Beads.

410
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:51,850
You're defeated.

411
00:36:51,850 --> 00:36:53,280
Where do you
get the confidence to beat us?

412
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:55,850
You've already been poisoned
by my Purple Poppy.

413
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,090
Those who are poisoned

414
00:37:01,570 --> 00:37:03,170
will soon go mad with delusion.

415
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,210
There's no need for me to act.

416
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:07,130
You will destroy each other.

417
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,610
You've ambushed us time and again.

418
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,320
I'll kill you today
to rid the people of a menace.

419
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,040
Bao Pu, I want you to die!

420
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
Are you crazy, savage girl?

421
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,410
I am Li Xiaoyao.

422
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:37,060
Let go of me.

423
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,060
Let go of me.

424
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:39,260
I can let you go,

425
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,760
but you can't hit me anymore.
Do you hear me?

426
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,090
If you keep doing this,
I won't be nice anymore.

427
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:48,240
Let go of me or I'll kill you.

428
00:38:05,170 --> 00:38:06,090
Unexpectedly,

429
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,450
even the Purple Poppy
can't help me defeat Li Xiaoyao.

430
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,890
How can I become stronger?

431
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,170
Greetings, King of Prison.

432
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,320
In Mount Shu,

433
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,170
even Mr. Dugu

434
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:28,370
must tread carefully
around King of Prison.

435
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,860
(Demon-Locking Tower)

436
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,720
This is the Demon-Locking Tower?

437
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:40,000
It has no doors.

438
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:41,960
How can I enter?

439
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,240
I'm Bao Pu, a disciple of Mount Shu.

440
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,610
I'm here to pay respects
to King of Prison.

441
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,890
My master, Taoist Mu,

442
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,930
was brutally murdered
by the demoness and her accomplices.

443
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:05,760
I swear

444
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,170
that in this life,
I will not coexist with demons.

445
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:10,000
I wish to serve under you,
King of Prison,

446
00:40:10,370 --> 00:40:12,800
to slay demons
and uphold righteousness for you.

447
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,890
I offer you this Wind Spiritual Bead,

448
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,130
hoping only to be taken as your disciple.

449
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:13,280
Who's disturbing my cultivation here?

450
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,090
I'm Bao Pu, a humble disciple.

451
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,190
Here I am, kneeling and begging you
to accept me as a disciple.

452
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:23,650
Is that the Wind Spiritual Bead
in your hand?

453
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:25,170
Indeed, it is.

454
00:41:25,650 --> 00:41:26,960
People are ignorant and vulgar,

455
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,560
unfit to wield the power
of this Wind Spiritual Bead.

456
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,130
Only you, King of Prison,
with your boundless magical power,

457
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,480
are worthy of this peerless treasure.

458
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:58,090
I am willing to accept you
and grant you magical power.
