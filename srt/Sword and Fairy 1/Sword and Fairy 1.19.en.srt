=Episode 19=

3
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,940
Thank you.

4
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:53,130
Sir, spare some change, please.

5
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,600
Sorry, I thought you were someone else.

6
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:02,860
Silly rat.

7
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,960
How did you get out?

8
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,260
You've never been here,
so I was just worried

9
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,480
that you might get lost in the capital.

10
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:14,660
Are you familiar with the capital?

11
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,690
Of course, I am.

12
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,250
Where do beggars usually gather?

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,170
Beggars?

14
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,820
The one we saved
when we entered the city.

15
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,970
Aren't you looking for Ling'er?
Why search for a beggar?

16
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,740
I'll explain later.

17
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:32,720
He's hiding something. Why?

18
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,810
Beggar...

19
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,200
Thank you.

20
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:54,380
Have you seen a person
missing a left arm,

21
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,690
with a withered and blackened right hand?

22
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,130
No, no.

23
00:02:57,130 --> 00:02:57,970
Keep looking.

24
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:01,890
Hello,

25
00:03:01,970 --> 00:03:04,050
have you seen a person
missing a left arm,

26
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,450
with a withered and blackened right hand?

27
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,560
You're talking about Big Eagle.

28
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,640
He's in that dilapidated house up ahead.

29
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,860
Okay, thank you.

30
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,580
Stop right there.

31
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,140
Miss,

32
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,360
you must be from a noble family.

33
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,090
Why come to such a place?

34
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:29,410
Get lost.

35
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,300
Catch her!

36
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,260
Don't worry.

37
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,540
It's just some muscle-relaxing stuff.

38
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,120
It's non-toxic.

39
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,640
Despicable.

40
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,380
Scholar,

41
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:23,540
are you alright?

42
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:25,130
I'm fine.

43
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,250
It's probably just a cold.

44
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:30,170
Right,

45
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,580
I've already asked my father

46
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,570
to send people to look for Miss Zhao.

47
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,050
When...

48
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,160
You need to get well first.

49
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,420
Sir, someone sent this,

50
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,410
specifically asking for you.

51
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,540
Who was it? Is he still here?

52
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,980
He's a beggar and is still at the door.

53
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,820
Lead the way.

54
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:02,890
Over there.

55
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:03,730
Okay.

56
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,850
- Let's go.
- Go.

57
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,570
Get lost!

58
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,020
- Are you okay?
- Go, go, go.

59
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:31,890
I'm fine.

60
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:32,850
Yueru.

61
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,730
Here.

62
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:37,890
Be careful.

63
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,130
Sir,

64
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,420
here.

65
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,130
Here.

66
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,380
Be careful.

67
00:05:55,010 --> 00:05:57,440
It was just some sleeping drugs,
thankfully, nothing serious.

68
00:05:58,290 --> 00:05:59,570
But why did she

69
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,440
suddenly go to such a remote place?

70
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:06,610
Sorry.

71
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:09,250
She got involved

72
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,440
because of me again.

73
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,480
Li, don't blame yourself.

74
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:15,590
Evil deeds are done by the wicked.

75
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,040
How could you be blamed for that?

76
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,940
That old man is still waiting
at the door for you.

77
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,480
You go. I'll stay here.

78
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,700
Okay.

79
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:41,100
(Perfect Virtues Are Mellow)

80
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:41,940
Sir,

81
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,320
thank you for coming to notify us.

82
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,860
(Huangfu Ying)

83
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,600
Is the lady okay now?

84
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,540
She's fine now.

85
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,100
Good.

86
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,500
Sir,

87
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,920
may I ask your name?

88
00:06:58,330 --> 00:06:59,170
It's not worth mentioning.

89
00:07:00,170 --> 00:07:01,090
Mr. Huangfu Ying.

90
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,360
How did you know?

91
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:15,880
My aunt

92
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,690
once mentioned
a close friend of my father's,

93
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:20,760
Iron-armed Eagle,

94
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:22,160
Huangfu Ying.

95
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,100
Sir,

96
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:29,810
why have you been avoiding me?

97
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,940
Because...

98
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:42,820
Because...

99
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,570
Your parents died because of me.

100
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,090
I'm responsible for their deaths.

101
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:12,010
Sir, let's talk after you stand up.

102
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:13,700
Come.

103
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,360
What exactly happened?

104
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,290
My parents died in Nanzhao, didn't they?

105
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:28,570
This

106
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,480
is a long story.

107
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:34,000
Your parents,

108
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,930
the couple
of the Southern Heroic Thieves,

109
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,290
lived a life of righteousness.

110
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:41,810
I knew it.

111
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,930
My parents weren't bandits.

112
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,100
Back then,

113
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,970
if your parents hadn't gone

114
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,820
to Nanzhao Imperial Palace to save me...

115
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,800
Sir, what are you saying?

116
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,240
My parents went to Nanzhao

117
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,780
to save you?

118
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:01,490
Back then,

119
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,000
I was ordered to capture your parents

120
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,800
but was repeatedly defeated by them.

121
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:12,490
In my desperation to win,

122
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,050
I practiced the Fierce Eagle Claw

123
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,290
with the Heartbroken Grass,

124
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:21,170
not expecting

125
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,410
the poison to seep into my organs,

126
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,290
putting me on the brink of death.

127
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,170
Only the poisonous dragon's gall

128
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,530
could cure it.

129
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:30,050
At that time,

130
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,610
your parents, bearing no grudges,

131
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,410
went to Nanzhao

132
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,000
to seek the poisonous
dragon's gall for me.

133
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,730
Though I lost all my martial arts skills,

134
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,850
I managed to save my life because of it.

135
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:46,880
But your parents

136
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,320
were poisoned by the Shadowless Poison.

137
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,410
That is Nanzhao's deadliest poison,

138
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,410
fatal to anyone infected.

139
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:01,540
They...

140
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,410
They got what they deserved.

141
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,780
Was it

142
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,440
the Witch Queen who poisoned them?

143
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:23,780
The Witch Queen?

144
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,610
The poisonous dragon's gall
was a gift from her to your parents.

145
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,850
How could she harm them?

146
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,760
Is this true?

147
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:36,410
Absolutely true.

148
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:38,170
Your parents

149
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,290
told me themselves before they passed.

150
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:46,220
Sir,

151
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,200
then do you know
who poisoned my parents?

152
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,050
I don't know.

153
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,560
I tried to investigate,

154
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,290
but never

155
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:02,200
found anything.

156
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,970
I will

157
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,120
find out the truth

158
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,760
and avenge my parents.

159
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:27,290
Xiaoyao.

160
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,970
I'm so tired.

161
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:51,020
Let's rest here,

162
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,050
eat something, and then go.

163
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,610
Ling'er, come.

164
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,540
Rest here.

165
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,660
Your Highness.

166
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,950
Who would want your dry stuff?

167
00:12:04,950 --> 00:12:06,090
I've eaten it several times already.

168
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,970
Then go hungry.

169
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,440
I won't starve.

170
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,610
Do you think I'm like you, old man?

171
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,880
Even if I starve, I won't eat your food.

172
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:28,820
Tang Yu, where are you going?

173
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,410
To find something you like to eat.

174
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,620
Wait.

175
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,200
Teach me how to whistle with leaves.

176
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,370
Why do you want to learn that?

177
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,060
Because...

178
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,970
Because whatever you can do,

179
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:49,850
I want to do it too.

180
00:12:50,170 --> 00:12:52,000
I want to keep pace with you.

181
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:53,540
Hurry.

182
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,490
Teach me first.

183
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,370
A'nu,

184
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,440
I won't be whistling with leaves anymore.

185
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,760
Why not?

186
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,120
Because

187
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:17,760
it's no longer necessary.

188
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,760
Not necessary?

189
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:22,880
What do you mean?

190
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,290
Let's just find something to eat first.

191
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,730
Hesitating again.

192
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,050
He must be hiding something.

193
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,740
Tang Yu,

194
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,740
wait for me.

195
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:44,320
Wait for me.

196
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:54,370
I hope the Five Color Woven Bracelet

197
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,530
can help Ling'er ward off evil spirits

198
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:00,440
and make her happy,

199
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,860
casting all worries away.

200
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Li Xiaoyao is the son of sinners.

201
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,730
If he appears in Nanzhao,

202
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,730
someone will certainly

203
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,930
kill him immediately.

204
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:11,760
That's impossible.

205
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,760
That's impossible.

206
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,370
How can this be?

207
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:20,120
How can this be?

208
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:23,240
Hope it can help Ling'er ward off evil spirits,
and make her happy.

209
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,680
Your parents
are Nanzhao's greatest sinners.

210
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,850
Without the Water Spiritual Bead,

211
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:47,590
the Witch Queen couldn't subdue
the Water Demon Beast

212
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:51,680
and had to sacrifice herself
to suppress it.

213
00:14:52,170 --> 00:14:54,930
This was all because of your parents.

214
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,000
This can't be true!

215
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,860
Li.

216
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,000
That savage girl.

217
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,450
How is she?

218
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,680
She's fine, asleep.

219
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:00,250
And you?

220
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:01,290
I'm fine, too.

221
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,130
Come on.

222
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,180
Li,

223
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,800
I didn't mean to eavesdrop.

224
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,300
So,

225
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,780
it was because of your parents

226
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,490
that you and Miss Zhao
had a misunderstanding

227
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:34,730
and parted ways.

228
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,050
Fortunately, all misunderstandings
are cleared now.

229
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:43,490
All I want now is to hurry
and find Ling'er in Yunmeng Marsh.

230
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,440
She must still be upset about this.

231
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,880
Fate plays tricks.

232
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:52,640
But good things take time.

233
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:55,610
I believe you two will find happiness.

234
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,330
Cheers.

235
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,490
Let's go out and talk.

236
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:11,770
Dad.

237
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:12,970
Dad.

238
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:21,980
Ling'er!

239
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:22,820
Ling'er.

240
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,490
Scholar,

241
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,770
I must leave.

242
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:42,850
Thank you all.

243
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,370
Don't go.

244
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,040
Yueru, don't go.

245
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,850
Yueru, don't go.

246
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,460
(Lizhao Residence)

247
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:17,300
Yueru,

248
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,160
Mr. Li suddenly left
without saying goodbye.

249
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,610
Is there something urgent?

250
00:19:24,650 --> 00:19:26,040
Actually,

251
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,650
I had anticipated

252
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,200
he would leave on his own.

253
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:31,580
Then, should I

254
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,620
send someone to bring him back?

255
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
No need.

256
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:36,920
If nothing had happened,

257
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:39,040
I should

258
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,160
be in Lin Fortress by now.

259
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,370
Yueru,

260
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,320
- you two...
- Auntie.

261
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,040
I've told you before.

262
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:50,250
Li Xiaoyao and I

263
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:53,010
are just friends.

264
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,490
Alright, alright.

265
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,650
I won't mention it again.

266
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,400
In a few days,

267
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,970
I will accompany you
back to Suzhou City by boat

268
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,730
to fully enjoy the scenery

269
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,440
along the way.

270
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,340
Okay.

271
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,100
Madam, it's not good.

272
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,130
The young master fainted.

273
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:12,180
What?

274
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:13,250
I...

275
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:20,700
Physician,

276
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,100
why did my son

277
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,160
suddenly faint?

278
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:27,540
Mrs. Liu,

279
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,890
please come with me.

280
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,010
Okay.

281
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,800
Why is it so hot?

282
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:41,560
Why did this suddenly happen?

283
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:00,250
(Ling'er,)

284
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,460
(wait for me.)

285
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:01,770
Jinyuan, you're awake.

286
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:03,580
How do you feel?

287
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:05,440
Any better?

288
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,340
Yueru,

289
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,280
Li has already left.

290
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:14,650
I know.

291
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,970
You should have gone after him.

292
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,460
Jinyuan,

293
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:20,970
I need to stay to take care of you.

294
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,460
Yueru,

295
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:30,200
since my mom isn't back yet,

296
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,780
maybe

297
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:33,850
you could accompany me somewhere?

298
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:40,210
Jinyuan,

299
00:22:40,530 --> 00:22:41,680
you're still sick.

300
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,200
You shouldn't have gone out.

301
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:44,890
Let's go back now.

302
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,440
Yueru, look.

303
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,090
You can't ride now.

304
00:22:54,410 --> 00:22:55,920
These two horses are for you.

305
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,320
I'm giving them to you.

306
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,490
The people I sent out last time are back.

307
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:03,400
They've found the map
to Yunmeng Marsh.

308
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,090
Take it with you.

309
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:11,940
Jinyuan,

310
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,560
I said I won't leave.

311
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:15,200
I want to stay and take care of you.

312
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,730
Yueru,

313
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:21,770
you said in Yangzhou City
you wanted to go home.

314
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,250
I know what you're avoiding,

315
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,680
but you must know

316
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:30,730
the hardest person to deceive

317
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:33,680
is yourself.

318
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,160
Along the way,

319
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:42,490
I feel

320
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,490
you've become less like yourself.

321
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:46,850
The Yueru I know

322
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:49,320
is bright and bold,

323
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,800
daring to love and hate.

324
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,920
How come you've become hesitant

325
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,680
and indecisive?

326
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,700
Jinyuan,

327
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,130
I just don't know

328
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,400
how to face my feelings.

329
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,610
Feelings are just a part of life.

330
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:11,800
One mustn't be blinded by a single leaf

331
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,400
and fail to see the whole picture.

332
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,770
Let's put it this way.

333
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,420
If

334
00:24:23,010 --> 00:24:24,130
there was no Li,

335
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:26,520
would you still
go looking for Miss Ling'er?

336
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:28,730
Of course, I would.

337
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,010
That's it then.

338
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,370
Thank you, Jinyuan.

339
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,540
Here,

340
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:40,770
I have a pair of jade pendants

341
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,460
that can be

342
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,440
put together.

343
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,290
When people see these jade pendants,

344
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,970
they often think of marriage.

345
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,370
But to me,

346
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:51,800
being able to...

347
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:08,850
Being able to be your cousin

348
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,010
is already more than enough.

349
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,920
What I said earlier,
I thought about it for a long time.

350
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:27,130
It's also meant for myself.

351
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,040
Let go of obsessions.

352
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,090
Let go of delusions.

353
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,130
Jinyuan,

354
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,060
thank you.

355
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,460
Come on.

356
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:23,610
Jinyuan,

357
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,010
once I find Ling'er,

358
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,210
I'll come back.

359
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,580
Let's go.

360
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:08,680
Yueru,

361
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,890
I hope we'll meet again.

362
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:11,920
Silly rat,

363
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:14,050
when do you expect to find Ling'er

364
00:28:14,050 --> 00:28:15,130
with just your legs?

365
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,090
Stop following me.

366
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:19,010
I'm not following you.

367
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:21,320
I'm taking you to find Ling'er.

368
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:24,250
Ling'er is my good friend.

369
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:26,100
Now that she's in trouble and missing,

370
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,320
how can I just stand by?

371
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:28,850
- You don't have to do this.
- Stop.

372
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:32,040
Do you know how
to get to Yunmeng Marsh?

373
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,800
If not, follow me.

374
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,370
By the way, that jade pendant.

375
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:38,410
Consider it my fee

376
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,520
to find my good friend.

377
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:41,850
Here.

378
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,100
According to Scholar's map,

379
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:15,940
it should be correct.

380
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,050
Rest here for a while.

381
00:29:18,050 --> 00:29:19,200
I'll go ahead and ask around.

382
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:23,010
Sir, miss,

383
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,530
we met again.

384
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:25,800
So destined.

385
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,800
Aren't you that...

386
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:29,970
Exactly, it's me.

387
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,890
Don't try to get close to us.

388
00:29:32,890 --> 00:29:34,010
Last time, because of you,

389
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:36,100
I ended up in jail

390
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,160
and almost got killed
by that foolish Governor.

391
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:39,490
Get lost.

392
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:41,250
Go anywhere you like.

393
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:43,000
Last time, it was a misunderstanding.

394
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,740
I just heard you two
were looking for someone.

395
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,130
Is it the lady who was with you two

396
00:29:47,130 --> 00:29:49,130
in Yangzhou City?

397
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:50,300
You've seen Ling'er?

398
00:29:51,370 --> 00:29:52,210
Which way did she go?

399
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:56,490
- Over there.
- This way?

400
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,610
Ling'er went this way?

401
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,010
Look at his shifty eyes.

402
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,560
How could he possibly know
where Ling'er went?

403
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,200
Miss, it's a misunderstanding.

404
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,890
Up ahead, they call it Toad Valley.

405
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:10,820
Hardly anyone has been there
in the last ten years.

406
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,100
If you want to go unnoticed,

407
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:15,010
this is the road you'd choose.

408
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,490
This road indeed goes southwest.

409
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:19,100
True or false,

410
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,940
I have to check it out.

411
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,050
I'm also going to Toad Valley.

412
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:24,740
Let's travel together.

413
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:26,010
If you dare to deceive us,

414
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,730
you know what will happen.

415
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,610
I dare not. I dare not.

416
00:30:46,050 --> 00:30:48,010
It seems Toad Valley is no simple place.

417
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,410
Savage girl, you've brought me here.

418
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:54,250
You can go back.

419
00:30:54,620 --> 00:30:56,280
If you're scared, you go back.

420
00:30:58,050 --> 00:30:58,890
Move.

421
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:02,040
Sir, the horse is yours.

422
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:04,130
Thank you, Miss.

423
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,250
Follow me.

424
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,250
Okay, okay, okay.

425
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,800
So, this is Toad Valley?

426
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:28,300
Let me ask you.

427
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:31,370
Why is the miasma here getting stronger?

428
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:36,540
I, I...

429
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,920
Tell us. Did you deceive us
into coming here?

430
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,180
Mr. Song,

431
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,820
tell me the truth.

432
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:44,920
Have you really seen Ling'er?

433
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,680
Sir, miss,

434
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:48,440
spare my life.

435
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:50,530
I had no choice.

436
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:52,440
This is an ancient trade route,

437
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:55,460
but in recent years,
a toad demon appeared,

438
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,400
and the route was abandoned.

439
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:59,370
You truly deceived us
into feeding the toad, huh?

440
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:01,100
Didn't expect you to be so malicious.

441
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:03,620
I was desperate, so I had to do this.

442
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:06,740
My child is sick,
and it can't be delayed.

443
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:09,500
This route takes only a day to get home.

444
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:10,890
Sorry to trouble you

445
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,280
to escort me through Toad Valley.

446
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,650
As a token of gratitude,

447
00:32:15,250 --> 00:32:17,490
I present you

448
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:19,650
this priceless Purple Gold Gourd.

449
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,700
If you hadn't brought it up,

450
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,800
I'd be less annoyed.

451
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,440
Spare my life, spare my life.

452
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:30,730
Let it go.

453
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,580
Yunmeng Marsh is located southwest.

454
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,460
The direction is correct.

455
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,300
Let's continue.

456
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,850
I'm telling you.

457
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:36,940
After passing Toad Valley,

458
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,890
see how I'll deal with you.

459
00:32:41,530 --> 00:32:42,650
Thank you, sir.

460
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:43,610
Thank you, miss.

461
00:32:48,050 --> 00:32:49,770
Amitabha, Amitabha.

462
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,130
Quiet, keep up.

463
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,370
Okay, okay.

464
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:56,850
There...

465
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,490
There's a dead body.

466
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,440
Must be a scholar traveling to exams.

467
00:33:10,770 --> 00:33:11,680
Be careful.

468
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,560
Amitabha.

469
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,520
It feels like we're going in circles.

470
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:41,730
How did we end up in a bamboo forest?

471
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,940
Indeed.

472
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,460
Where's the fat man?

473
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,850
He was right behind you just now.

474
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,860
What do you mean by "behind me"?

475
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,090
He was behind you.

476
00:33:56,890 --> 00:33:57,890
Where did he go?

477
00:34:00,010 --> 00:34:00,850
Over there.

478
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:21,760
He took this road for his child

479
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,520
but ended up losing his life for nothing.

480
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,820
It's all my fault.

481
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:29,560
I failed to protect him.

482
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:31,140
Let's go.

483
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:53,720
Honey...

484
00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:00,090
Honey, you died so miserably.

485
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,760
In the wild mountains,

486
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,480
how could there be a lady?

487
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,480
Might be a demon.

488
00:35:07,810 --> 00:35:08,650
Be cautious.

489
00:35:09,570 --> 00:35:10,410
Miss,

490
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:13,320
was your lover also harmed
by that toad demon?

491
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:17,620
I'll go check.

492
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:28,210
Miss?

493
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,370
You're the toad demon!

494
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:15,580
Go!

495
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,170
Savage girl!

496
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,760
I've missed you so much.

497
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:24,740
(Golden Toad Demon)

498
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:26,720
Honey.

499
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,740
All men deserve to die!
They are all cheaters!

500
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:38,130
They should all die!

501
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:42,260
You, this neither human
nor demon ugly freak,

502
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,130
who are you?

503
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,930
Do you think you and your lover

504
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:58,690
will still have a chance to leave

505
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,960
my Golden Toad Valley?

506
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,280
What have you done to Li Xiaoyao?

507
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,450
Of course, I killed him.

508
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:12,370
Little girl,

509
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:14,850
men are all cheaters.

510
00:38:14,850 --> 00:38:15,760
They all deserve to die.

511
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,340
Impossible.

512
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,780
I don't believe it.

513
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,610
He will definitely come back to save me.

514
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,800
Right.

515
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:29,130
I once believed

516
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,410
my lover would definitely come back.

517
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,610
With your demon look,

518
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,960
it would be strange if he came back.

519
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:43,930
Honey, I'm sorry.

520
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,780
I shouldn't be a demon,

521
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,330
I shouldn't be an ugly freak.

522
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:49,480
I was wrong. Please come back.

523
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,010
Honey.

524
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,370
Let's play a game,

525
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:57,520
so you can witness

526
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,450
the heart of a man.

527
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,240
What do you want to do?

528
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,370
Tell me.

529
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,480
If you become an ugly freak,

530
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:15,130
will your lover

531
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,760
stay with you through thick and thin,

532
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,450
or abandon you like an old shoe?

533
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,320
You malicious thing.

534
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,130
Li Xiaoyao will definitely
come back to save me.

535
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,650
What does malice matter

536
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:32,690
compared to the mockery and humiliation
of a faithless man?

537
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,960
Let the Five Poison Bead

538
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:48,370
show you

539
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:52,610
the ruthless heart of a man.

540
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,380
Savage girl!

541
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,250
Darn it.

542
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:19,370
Where did that toad demon take her?

543
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,140
Savage girl!

544
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:42,100
Li Xiaoyao!

545
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,620
Run!

546
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:44,900
Run!

547
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,580
Savage girl,

548
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,250
don't be afraid.

549
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,780
- Don't! Don't look at me!
- Savage girl, it's me.

550
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,960
Don't look at me.

551
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,380
What happened to you?

552
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,820
What happened to you, savage girl?

553
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,800
Don't look at me, Li Xiaoyao.

554
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,580
- Let me go.
- What...

555
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,930
- What happened to you?
- Don't look at me.

556
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,370
Let go! Let me go!

557
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,690
What exactly happened?

558
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:25,090
The toad demon made me swallow
the Five Poison Bead.

559
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,040
Li Xiaoyao, don't look at me.

560
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:34,490
It's okay.

561
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,140
It's okay.

562
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,140
Don't be afraid.

563
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:40,490
Don't be afraid.

564
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,210
Don't cry.

565
00:41:55,540 --> 00:41:56,520
I'll go find an antidote for you.

566
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:58,860
Don't look at me.

567
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,610
Don't look at my face.

568
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,650
Actually, I don't see much difference.

569
00:42:10,170 --> 00:42:12,210
Your appearance was ordinary before.

570
00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:13,520
