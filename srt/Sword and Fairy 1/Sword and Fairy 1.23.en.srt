00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:52,640
You thought you could let go.

4
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:55,570
You thought you could face it calmly.

5
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:07,920
Yet a mere jade pendant...

6
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,020
Consider that pendant

7
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,100
my fee for hiring you

8
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,410
to find my good friend.

9
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,920
You should have left long ago,

10
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,610
yet you can never seem
to make up your mind.

11
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,920
Is it because of Ling'er

12
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,410
or that silly rat?

13
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,250
Can you tell the difference?

14
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,280
You're always hesitating,

15
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,280
never truly carefree.

16
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,860
Who?

17
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,530
Where's my jade pendant?

18
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,360
Where did my jade pendant go?

19
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:24,170
Where's the pendant?

20
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,840
Miss, are you looking for this?

21
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,200
How come it's with you?

22
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:44,330
Who are you?

23
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,330
I am Bao Pu of Mount Shu,

24
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:47,530
passing by on my way to subdue demons.

25
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,000
Sorry

26
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,090
to have disturbed you.

27
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,410
Thank you.

28
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,660
Miss, you were so busy looking down.

29
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,890
You didn't notice the pendant
hanging on the peach tree branch.

30
00:03:59,970 --> 00:04:01,050
Thank you, sir.

31
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:04,810
You just said
you're a disciple of Mount Shu?

32
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,170
Indeed.

33
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:08,640
My family also has ties with Mount Shu.

34
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,090
My father and the Head of Mount Shu
are sworn brothers.

35
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:13,720
May I ask your father's name?

36
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,940
Lin Tiannan.

37
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,360
Ah, so you're the daughter of Mr. Lin.

38
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,780
My apologies.

39
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:21,420
Miss Lin.

40
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,850
What are you doing here

41
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,130
so late at night?

42
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,290
I was passing by with friends,

43
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:28,730
staying in Taoyuan Village ahead.

44
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:31,480
I just came out for some air.

45
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,260
I see.

46
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,360
Miss Lin, this forest
is thick with evil spirits.

47
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,290
You should be careful on your own.

48
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:40,160
I must leave

49
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,320
for other urgent matters.

50
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:42,890
Thank you, sir.

51
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:12,050
Ling'er!

52
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,330
Ling'er!

53
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,420
Ling'er!

54
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,220
Li Xiaoyao!

55
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,500
Where are they?

56
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:23,050
Li Xiaoyao!

57
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,810
Miss Lin, come have breakfast.

58
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:29,730
Have you seen Ling'er and Li Xiaoyao?

59
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:30,860
Miss Lin,

60
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,490
they already had breakfast

61
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:34,130
and went out to enjoy the scenery.

62
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,890
But yesterday,

63
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,140
we agreed to leave early this morning.

64
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:39,130
Miss Lin,

65
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,580
here is full of beautiful views.

66
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,920
It makes one want to stay forever.

67
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,730
After breakfast,
why not go and see for yourself?

68
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:46,040
You'll love it.

69
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,320
No. I need to find them now.

70
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:50,610
- What's the rush?
- Miss Lin,

71
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:52,100
it won't hurt to eat first and then go.

72
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:54,090
I won't eat. I need to find them right away.

73
00:05:54,290 --> 00:05:55,130
Sir,

74
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:56,920
please find someone to guide us out
as soon as possible.

75
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:58,570
We'll be on our way once we're back.

76
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,330
Okay, okay.

77
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,380
Have some breakfast.

78
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:02,640
No, I have to go now.

79
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,810
Thank you, sir.

80
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,200
Li Xiaoyao! Ling'er!

81
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:22,810
What's going on with you?

82
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:24,690
We...

83
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:28,690
We're just enjoying the scenery.

84
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:30,570
That's not what I'm asking.

85
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,440
What did you mean then?

86
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:35,050
Didn't we agree to leave early today?

87
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,130
Did you forget?

88
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,130
Did I say that?

89
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:41,490
Xiaoyao,

90
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:42,530
I don't remember.

91
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:44,570
I don't remember either.

92
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,880
Li Xiaoyao, why aren't you in a hurry?

93
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:49,760
What's the rush?

94
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,050
No rush.

95
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:52,690
Of course, it's urgent
to find the Spiritual Beads!

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,500
Right.

97
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,440
We need to find the Spiritual Beads.

98
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,420
But

99
00:06:58,770 --> 00:06:59,770
do you know where they are?

100
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,480
How would I know
where the Spiritual Beads are?

101
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,260
Since none of us know where they are,

102
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,360
there's no use rushing off.

103
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,210
Isn't that right, Yueru?

104
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,820
No, no, Ling'er, you forgot

105
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,010
what you told me last night.

106
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:12,920
Last night?

107
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:18,730
Yueru,

108
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,210
I think

109
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:22,920
we need to plan this carefully.

110
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:24,440
Right now,

111
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,410
the most important thing is...

112
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,850
What is it?

113
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,880
Of course, to enjoy the scenery
right in front of us.

114
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,570
Xiaoyao, pour some wine for Yueru.

115
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:42,130
Miss Lin.

116
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,360
What did you call me?

117
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,570
Miss Lin.

118
00:07:46,770 --> 00:07:48,410
I was impolite before.

119
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:49,600
My apologies.

120
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:52,140
Please forgive me.

121
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,160
Li Xiaoyao, are you feeling alright?

122
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:56,570
Ling'er,

123
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,250
don't you think
Li Xiaoyao is acting strange?

124
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,440
I think Xiaoyao is fine this way.

125
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,250
What's going on?

126
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,290
Xiaoyao,

127
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:12,600
look, how beautiful that butterfly is!

128
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,040
Ling'er, wait for me!

129
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:27,890
Madness, madness.

130
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,690
Why have they both gone mad?

131
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,410
What's going on?

132
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,370
Look.

133
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,290
It really is beautiful.

134
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,490
A-Tao!

135
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,620
A-Tao!

136
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,320
Miss Lin.

137
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:51,780
Sir.

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,850
Miss Lin, my daughter isn't home.

139
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:55,880
You seem very flustered.

140
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,900
Haven't you found Mr. Li and Miss Zhao?

141
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,090
I have found them.

142
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,440
Then what's the hurry?

143
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,880
They've suddenly
started acting very strangely.

144
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:06,410
Don't worry. Don't worry.

145
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,900
Come, sit down, and talk slowly.

146
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,740
Sir,

147
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,730
we originally planned to leave early today.

148
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,440
But they suddenly changed their mind

149
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:16,490
and started enjoying flowers and drinking
under the Peach Dock instead.

150
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,680
What's wrong with that?

151
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:21,240
But it wasn't like this yesterday.

152
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,560
How could everything change overnight?

153
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,090
That's normal.

154
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:26,940
Yesterday's thoughts are for yesterday,

155
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,560
while today's decisions are for today.

156
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,740
Miss Lin,

157
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,320
one night can change a lot.

158
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:33,970
- This...
- Calm down.

159
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,460
Your friends

160
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,640
are probably just too tired
from the previous journey,

161
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,640
so they want to rest here for a few days.

162
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,100
But we...

163
00:09:43,170 --> 00:09:45,530
Let them have a rest.

164
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,060
Alright then.

165
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,680
Thank you, sir.

166
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:11,440
Xiaoyao,

167
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,200
do you still have cherry candy?

168
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,440
As many as you want.

169
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,410
Where's my cherry candy?

170
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:25,330
Ling'er,

171
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:27,050
your hair tie is gone too.

172
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,850
Ling'er, let's leave tomorrow.

173
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,120
Leave? Where to?

174
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:40,560
To find the Five Spiritual Beads, of course.

175
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,680
But

176
00:10:43,090 --> 00:10:45,370
I'd like to stay here a bit longer.

177
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,560
No rush, no rush.

178
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,560
Miss Lin, come.

179
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:50,610
Let's have a drink.

180
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,380
What Miss Lin?

181
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,610
What's going on with you two?

182
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:54,970
We?

183
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:57,120
We're fine.

184
00:10:58,970 --> 00:11:00,760
Miss Lin, don't be hasty.

185
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,320
If you don't like drinking,

186
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,170
how about I pour you some tea instead?

187
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:05,410
Stop calling me Miss Lin.

188
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,640
What's happening?

189
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,560
It's all so strange.

190
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:40,120
I have to investigate this.

191
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,740
Who?

192
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,320
A-Tao, it's you.

193
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,260
I just saw someone
sneaking into the house.

194
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,290
I was worried it might be a bad person,
so I came to check.

195
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:32,540
Is that so?

196
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:52,690
Someone was here.

197
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,100
Who are you?

198
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,530
I am Bao Pu of Mount Shu.

199
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,680
A talisman of Mount Shu.

200
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,570
A-Tao,

201
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:14,930
I suspect a villain has sneaked
into the village with ill intentions.

202
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,170
I'm going to find him.

203
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,410
You go tell the Village Chief now

204
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,800
and tell the villagers to be more vigilant.

205
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,540
Okay.

206
00:13:33,410 --> 00:13:34,250
Stop right there!

207
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:35,930
Miss Lin,

208
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:38,680
why are you blocking my way?

209
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:39,980
Tell me!

210
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,410
Why did you go to my room just now?

211
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,130
I...

212
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,610
I didn't go to your room.

213
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,200
Then why are you here?

214
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:51,090
Miss Lin, you are mistaken.

215
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:53,260
I was just chasing a demon here.

216
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,820
I was about to subdue it,

217
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,320
but it escaped due to a careless mistake.

218
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,730
Miss Lin, what are you doing?

219
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,000
You just said

220
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,700
you were going to subdue a demon.

221
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,540
Correct.

222
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,760
For disciples of Mount Shu,
subduing demons is the right thing to do.

223
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,760
I don't believe you.

224
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,380
You arrived in Taoyuan Village yesterday,

225
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,320
and today my two friends are acting insane.

226
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,460
I found your talisman

227
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,760
in their room.

228
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,560
Tell me, did you do this?

229
00:14:28,170 --> 00:14:29,780
I didn't.

230
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:32,530
This has absolutely
nothing to do with me.

231
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,530
I'll give you one last chance.

232
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,490
Make Ling'er and Li Xiaoyao
back to normal,

233
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:37,730
or don't blame me for being rude.

234
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,800
You said your two friends

235
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,490
suddenly turned insane.

236
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:46,000
It must be related
to the demon I was chasing.

237
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,650
This place is thick with demonic energy,

238
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:48,760
which easily confuses the mind.

239
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,820
Where is this demon

240
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,660
you're talking about now?

241
00:14:58,140 --> 00:14:58,980
Just...

242
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,000
Just where I was just now.

243
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,880
I'll go check.

244
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,120
If you lie to me again,

245
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,320
I will not spare you.

246
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:12,690
Miss Lin.

247
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,660
Miss Lin,

248
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,610
it's very dangerous to go alone.

249
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:33,850
It seems Miss Lin

250
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,930
has let go of her troubles.

251
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,290
May the God of Peach Blossom bless us.

252
00:15:38,290 --> 00:15:41,050
May our Taoyuan Village
continue to flourish

253
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:42,560
with numerous descendants.

254
00:15:56,850 --> 00:15:57,690
You deceitful Taoist!

255
00:15:57,850 --> 00:15:58,880
How dare you to deceive me?

256
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:00,530
I searched all night and didn't see

257
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:01,560
the demon you spoke of.

258
00:16:06,850 --> 00:16:07,850
I'm talking to you!

259
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,320
Miss Lin,

260
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:14,050
the air in this forest is really fresh.

261
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:16,760
Close your eyes,

262
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:19,490
and you can even hear the wind.

263
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,640
Why have you changed too?

264
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,000
Could it really be
that there's a demon here?

265
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:31,200
No rush.

266
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,650
What do you mean, no rush?
Always no rush.

267
00:16:33,650 --> 00:16:34,880
No rush.

268
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,170
No rush.

269
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,140
No rush.

270
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,970
No rush, no rush.

271
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:45,850
After tonight,

272
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,260
perhaps you'll change your mind.

273
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,850
One night can change a lot.

274
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,690
Dad,

275
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:02,930
they say

276
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,090
the outside world is vast.

277
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,970
Actually, it's also quite nice outside.

278
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:11,680
I think they must really like it out there.

279
00:17:12,370 --> 00:17:13,320
Who

280
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,440
told you this?

281
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:18,320
It was Miss Zhao and Hewen.

282
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,160
A-Tao,

283
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:26,250
you're still young.

284
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,490
It's normal for you
to want to see the outside.

285
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,520
I also went out to see it before,

286
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,200
but the outside world

287
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,320
is nothing like they describe.

288
00:17:37,650 --> 00:17:38,920
There's a lot of hostility.

289
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,520
They're always talking
about fighting and killing.

290
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,370
I've even nearly died

291
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:45,010
out there several times.

292
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:54,250
You know what to do, right?

293
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,610
Abnormality means something's wrong.

294
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,250
There must be a problem with this village.

295
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,560
The peach blossom
highlights your beauty even more.

296
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,370
Hewen,

297
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,040
tell me more about the outside world.

298
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,370
A-Tao,

299
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:37,560
the outside world
isn't worth mentioning.

300
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,040
Taoyuan Village is the most beautiful place.

301
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:42,090
Really?

302
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,800
Do you truly believe this is the best place?

303
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:47,180
Of course.

304
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,560
As long as I can stay here with you,

305
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:51,370
I don't want to go anywhere else.

306
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,200
Actually,

307
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,370
I still want to go

308
00:19:58,370 --> 00:19:59,920
and see the outside world with you.

309
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,040
I remember you once said

310
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,160
your greatest desire
was to travel the world.

311
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,320
But if we stay in Taoyuan Village,

312
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:11,400
we'll never be able to leave.

313
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:20,940
There is no place more beautiful

314
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,040
than Taoyuan Village.

315
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:25,890
Staying here is good.

316
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:28,560
Hewen,

317
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,680
I want you to stay here,

318
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,770
but I don't want you to stay like this.

319
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:53,210
A-Tao,

320
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:55,010
don't overthink it.

321
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,520
Actually, neither I nor Taoyuan Village

322
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:04,890
is as good as you think.

323
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,850
Maybe

324
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,770
it's still not too late for you to leave.

325
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,010
Hewen,

326
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,650
you should go. Leave this place now.

327
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:21,060
Why?

328
00:21:22,170 --> 00:21:23,370
We are about to get married.

329
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:24,210
Because...

330
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,980
Higher up there.

331
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:02,250
Help me lay this out.

332
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,680
- Coming.
- Clean it up.

333
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,920
A-Tao, you're here.

334
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:17,770
Thank you for your trouble.

335
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:19,820
As long as it makes
your wedding splendid,

336
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:20,770
what does it matter?

337
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,850
No need to be polite with us.

338
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:23,530
Right, A-Tao, did you come here

339
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:25,490
to see if the wedding lacks anything?

340
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,650
Do you need our help?

341
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:28,820
No, no.

342
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:30,010
I just wanted to come and see

343
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:31,250
if there's anything I can help with.

344
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:32,740
Rest assured.

345
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,170
Everything is well prepared.

346
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,160
Don't worry about it.

347
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,500
We've just finished up,

348
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:38,130
and we need
to stop by the Village Chief's place.

349
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:40,800
Right, all done? Let's go.

350
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,060
Let's go now.

351
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:49,130
Come quickly then.

352
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:54,610
I... I forgot

353
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,250
my father asked me to pick some blossoms
to make peach blossom wine.

354
00:22:58,250 --> 00:22:59,400
You go ahead.

355
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:01,220
- We'll take off then.
- We'll go then.

356
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,520
- Alright.
- Hurry up and come.

357
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,160
We're leaving, A-Tao. Bye.

358
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,610
God of Peach Blossom,

359
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,250
please forgive what I must do next.

360
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,010
I can't selfishly

361
00:24:00,050 --> 00:24:01,520
keep Hewen here like this.

362
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:28,700
Dad.

363
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,400
A-Tao,

364
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,850
you've disappointed me greatly.

365
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:35,820
The peach blossom branch
is our village's sacred object,

366
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,650
the foundation of our Taoyuan Village.

367
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:40,200
How could you think of stealing it?

368
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,770
How could you do that
to the God of Peach Blossom

369
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:43,440
or the people of the village?

370
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,610
Dad,

371
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,800
I'm sorry.

372
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:51,050
I just wanted to save Hewen.

373
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,970
Nonsense.

374
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:55,090
As long as Song Hewen
lives in Taoyuan Village,

375
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,680
what danger could there be for him?

376
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,460
No.

377
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,920
I want him to leave Taoyuan Village.

378
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,130
Why?

379
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,420
Dad,

380
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:11,250
Taoyuan Village is wonderful,

381
00:25:13,170 --> 00:25:14,820
but I don't want

382
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,850
to keep Hewen here like this.

383
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,440
The Hewen I fell for

384
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:21,130
is not the one under the spell.

385
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,560
Child,

386
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:28,340
Song Hewen is still Song Hewen.

387
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,650
He still loves you

388
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:31,610
and still wants to marry you.

389
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,970
No.

390
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:36,130
Under the control
of the Peach Blossom Formation,

391
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,610
Hewen has changed.

392
00:25:40,370 --> 00:25:42,200
He's lost his true self.

393
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,250
Even his smile isn't genuine.

394
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,490
I really don't like it this way.

395
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,660
You...

396
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,400
Don't you want to be with him forever?

397
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,700
I do,

398
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,770
but I don't want him to lose himself.

399
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,770
Silly child.

400
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,610
You're young.

401
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,370
One day,

402
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:08,680
you'll understand

403
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:11,280
my good intentions.

404
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,250
Dad,

405
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,610
I'm begging you.

406
00:26:21,250 --> 00:26:23,010
Please let Hewen go.

407
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,400
Take her away.

408
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,300
Who?

409
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,160
Miss Lin, it's you.

410
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:44,770
I've heard everything you said.

411
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,410
No wonder Li Xiaoyao and Ling'er

412
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,440
have gone mad.

413
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:48,890
You did this to them.

414
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Miss Lin, don't be angry.

415
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,250
We mean no harm.

416
00:26:51,550 --> 00:26:53,170
They just fell
into our Peach Blossom Formation.

417
00:26:53,170 --> 00:26:54,320
There's no danger to their lives.

418
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,200
Why would you
cast such illusions on people?

419
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,970
We were originally transformed
from peach trees,

420
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,370
gentle by nature and close to humans.

421
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,400
We want to bring
joy and kindness to humans.

422
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,250
So, when people come here,

423
00:27:08,250 --> 00:27:09,280
the fragrance of the flowers

424
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,130
will alleviate their troubles and sadness.

425
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:14,370
But...

426
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,820
But...

427
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,740
But you're using that noble excuse

428
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,580
to do evil here.

429
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,820
Sorry.

430
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:23,370
You're right.

431
00:27:24,530 --> 00:27:25,560
If they

432
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:29,040
become too enamored with Taoyuan Village
and refuse to leave,

433
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:31,320
once they've stayed for seven days,

434
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,410
they'll turn into peach trees,

435
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:35,650
never to wake again.

436
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:37,010
What?

437
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:39,850
You demons are really harming people!

438
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:42,340
People should decide for themselves
whether to stay or leave.

439
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,850
What gives you the right
to decide for them?

440
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,770
I know this is not right,

441
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,320
so I'm asking you, Miss, to help us.

442
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:52,040
For Mr. Song?

443
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:58,890
Get up first.

444
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:06,040
How can we break this illusion?

445
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:08,370
The key to this illusion

446
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,250
lies in the things people cherish the most.

447
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,730
When people lose something they love,

448
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,790
they'll be controlled
by the Peach Blossom Formation,

449
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:17,280
desiring to stay here.

450
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,160
To break the illusion,

451
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,680
we must retrieve what they've lost.

452
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,280
Xiaoyao,

453
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,850
do you still have cherry candy?

454
00:28:28,530 --> 00:28:29,770
As many as you want.

455
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,250
Where's my cherry candy?

456
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Ling'er,

457
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,800
your hair tie is also gone.

458
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:49,890
Does that mean

459
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:51,820
if I find the items
Li Xiaoyao and Ling'er lost

460
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,770
and return them,

461
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,010
they can regain their consciousness?

462
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,200
Correct. Their items are on the Sacred Tree.

463
00:28:58,250 --> 00:28:59,090
However,

464
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,920
I'm afraid those items
have now turned into peach blossoms.

465
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,650
What? How can I find them
among so many peach blossoms?

466
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:08,740
If you can get the peach blossom branch
offered in the shrine,

467
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,970
you'll be able to break the illusion.

468
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:11,740
Only the peach blossom branch

469
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:13,890
can knock the items off the branches.

470
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:15,280
Humans can't do that.

471
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,130
Why are you here?

472
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,770
Don't be hasty.

473
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:38,220
It doesn't matter if things are lost,

474
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,460
we can take our time to find them.

475
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,300
Shut up.

476
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:41,610
Come with me.

477
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:51,440
Miss Lin, what are you doing?

478
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,060
Good.

479
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,350
The peach blossom branch is still here.

480
00:29:56,250 --> 00:29:57,170
Peach blossom branch?

481
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,160
What peach blossom branch?

482
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:04,850
Miss Lin.

483
00:30:07,650 --> 00:30:08,490
Is he over there?

484
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
- No.
- No.

485
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:15,040
Let's check over there then.

486
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:33,010
Miss Lin, taking something
without asking is stealing.

487
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:34,090
What you're doing isn't right.

488
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,200
Li Xiaoyao, I...

489
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:38,170
I really hope when you wake up,

490
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,340
you'll remember what you're doing now.

491
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:40,180
Wake up?

492
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:42,160
I've been awake.

493
00:30:42,890 --> 00:30:44,200
Your words are quite strange.

494
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,610
Stop there.

495
00:30:45,790 --> 00:30:46,850
Leave the peach branch behind.

496
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:49,820
Silly rat, I really can't stand you.

497
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,440
Even at this moment,
you don't forget to oppose me.

498
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,800
So many flowers!

499
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,730
Song Hewen's pouch.

500
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,610
Bao Pu's talisman.

501
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,770
Hurry. He seems to have gone that way.

502
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:56,210
Oh no.

503
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:58,440
Hurry. You go that way.

504
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:00,700
- Alright.
- The rest follow me.

505
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,090
- Alright.
- Alright, alright.

506
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:03,920
Not here.

507
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:06,890
Let's look over there then.

508
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,490
Okay, I'll go that way.

509
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,850
I'll go too. I'll go too.

510
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:11,610
Everyone, keep up,

511
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,400
Over here, quickly!

512
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,660
(Song)

513
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,020
(Song)

514
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,940
Sir,

515
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,300
are you alright?

516
00:33:25,010 --> 00:33:25,920
I was enchanted.

517
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,200
Sir, I wronged you before.

518
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,740
You've all been under the illusion here.

519
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,800
Now that the illusion is broken,

520
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:34,620
while the village is in chaos,

521
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,670
you all should hurry and leave.

522
00:33:38,370 --> 00:33:39,210
I see.

523
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:40,850
Thank you, Miss Lin.

524
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,280
How is A-Tao doing?

525
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,850
You still care about her?

526
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,860
The villagers used the demonic magic
to harm you.

527
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,700
Why don't you leave now?

528
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,920
Miss Lin, A-Tao didn't harm me.

529
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,540
I want to see her.

530
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,680
If you don't want to leave,

531
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,820
come with me.

532
00:34:14,610 --> 00:34:15,480
Hewen!

533
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:37,970
Hewen!

534
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,240
Are you okay?

535
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,410
Miss Lin,

536
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,930
thank you.

537
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,560
Miss Lin told me everything.

538
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,480
Hewen,

539
00:34:58,570 --> 00:34:59,520
aren't you mad at me?

540
00:35:06,460 --> 00:35:07,300
A-Tao,

541
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,780
I'm not mad at you.

542
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,890
I want to tell you

543
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,040
that though we haven't
known each other long,

544
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:15,650
from the moment you saved me,

545
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:17,690
I started to like you.

546
00:35:19,850 --> 00:35:21,000
Nothing

547
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,240
will change how I feel.

548
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:29,890
Hewen.

549
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:36,210
Miss Lin,

550
00:35:36,850 --> 00:35:38,040
thank you so much.

551
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,410
A-Tao,

552
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,370
I must hurry
and save Ling'er and Li Xiaoyao

553
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:44,930
or they'll turn into peach trees.

554
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,460
Miss Lin, if you need any help,

555
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,520
just tell us.

556
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,610
Help me divert the villagers elsewhere,

557
00:35:51,990 --> 00:35:53,300
and then I'll go to the Sacred Tree again

558
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,650
to retrieve their belongings.

559
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:56,410
- Alright.
- Alright.

560
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:58,860
Let's go.

561
00:36:07,170 --> 00:36:08,370
Where could they be hidden?

562
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:34,520
(Conjoined peach blossoms.)

563
00:37:04,650 --> 00:37:05,490
It turns out

564
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,960
you were meant to be together after all.

565
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:54,320
- Catch the thief! Catch the thief!
- Hurry, catch the thief!

566
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,930
Don't let him escape!

567
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,370
- Catch the thief!
- Catch the thief!

568
00:37:58,370 --> 00:37:59,210
Over here, this way!

569
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:00,610
Hurry, quickly!

570
00:38:03,410 --> 00:38:05,280
Miss, I'm a friend of Miss Lin.

571
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,850
She specifically asked me to find you.

572
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,170
Are you alright?

573
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,720
What's happening?

574
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:12,560
The villagers have lost valuable things.

575
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,720
They are catching the thief.

576
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:15,410
Where is Yueru?

577
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,040
I was entrusted by Miss Lin

578
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:18,130
to bring you to see her.

579
00:38:18,330 --> 00:38:19,170
Alright.

580
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:20,570
Let's go now.

581
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:21,410
Sure.

582
00:38:48,810 --> 00:38:50,040
Indeed, they are the Spiritual Beads.

583
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,140
Miss Zhao!

584
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,610
Miss Zhao, are you alright?

585
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,740
Hewen, keep an eye on her

586
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:10,740
until Miss Lin arrives.

587
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,750
I'll go after that Taoist priest.

588
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:13,610
A-Tao, I'll come with you.

589
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:14,890
No need. I'll be right back.

590
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,730
A-Tao!

591
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,240
With the Spiritual Beads,

592
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:28,610
my master will surely teach me
the techniques of Mount Shu.

593
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,610
The Talisman of Taoist Master!

594
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,090
A-Tao, let's go now.

595
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,410
Where is Miss Zhao?

596
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,650
I've placed her somewhere safe.

597
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:41,490
Let's go first.

598
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,410
No. I need to save the Sacred Tree.

599
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:44,450
Wait a moment.

600
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,340
A-Tao.

601
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,560
I'll call for help.

602
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:57,970
Miss Lin.

603
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:00,010
Miss Lin,

604
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,130
please return the peach blossom branch.

605
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,140
Miss Lin,

606
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:16,720
stop this.

607
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:17,930
Enough of these tricks.

608
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,100
You peach tree demons
have harmed many.

609
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:21,750
Destroying you
is ridding the people of a scourge.

610
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:22,500
Miss Lin, this is...

611
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,410
- Someone! Help!
- Fire! Help!

612
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,450
Someone! Help! Fire! Help!

613
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:31,130
It was you who set fire to the Sacred Tree!

614
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,560
I don't have time for that.

615
00:41:32,810 --> 00:41:34,020
You ignorant person,

616
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:35,610
hand over the peach blossom branch.

617
00:41:37,410 --> 00:41:38,370
Someone come quickly!

618
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:41,210
If you're any later,
the entire village will be burned down.

619
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:43,850
Someone! Quickly!

620
00:41:44,570 --> 00:41:46,170
Someone! Come!

621
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,800
Here, here! Water's here!

622
00:41:50,890 --> 00:41:52,170
Water's here! Water's here!

623
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:54,040
Quick! More water!

624
00:42:07,890 --> 00:42:08,730
Oh no.

625
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:10,170
My Spiritual Beads.

626
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,800
Why can't my magic dispel this fog?

627
00:42:31,450 --> 00:42:33,040
It seems I must return
and ask my master for help.
