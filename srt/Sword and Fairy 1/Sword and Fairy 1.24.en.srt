=Sword and Fairy 1=

2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,060
Ling'er, are you alright?

4
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:48,400
- I'm fine.
- That's great.

5
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:52,360
Yueru, where have you been?

6
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,640
Ling'er, what happened to you?

7
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,220
Miss Lin,

8
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,490
a Taoist priest
pretending to be your friend

9
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,720
attacked Ling'er

10
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,850
and stole her Spiritual Beads.

11
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,920
If he wanted it, we'd give him.
Why did he have to hurt Ling'er?

12
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,250
A Taoist priest?

13
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,050
Bao Pu?

14
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,660
Miss Lin, since you're back now,

15
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,680
please return the peach blossom branch
to the Village Chief.

16
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,170
Look at the mess
you've caused in the village.

17
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:16,540
If you hadn't been enchanted,

18
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,690
would I have had to steal?

19
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,890
Here.

20
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,760
Why is my cherry candy with you?

21
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,450
When did you take it?

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,480
And Ling'er's hair tie.
How come it's with you too?

23
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,530
Yueru, what's going on here?

24
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:07,000
If such important things

25
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,330
get stolen again,

26
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,560
I won't help you find them back.

27
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,330
We've already wasted three days.

28
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,170
Let's pack up and leave this cursed place.

29
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,130
Weren't we just arriving yesterday?

30
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,640
Let's hurry and leave.
I'll explain it on the way.

31
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,940
Fire! Fire!

32
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,840
Fire!

33
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,100
Someone come quickly!

34
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,450
Come and put out the fire!

35
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,460
Fire!

36
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,480
Someone come quickly!

37
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:30,690
The fire is so big.

38
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,300
It might burn down the entire village.

39
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,280
Let's hurry and leave.

40
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,610
They'll sort it out themselves.

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:35,720
You would leave them to die?

42
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,610
Savage girl, how can you be so heartless?

43
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,970
Silly rat, are you still dazed?

44
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:40,970
They're all demons.

45
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,090
Ling'er, let's go.

46
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,480
Bring more people to fight the fire!

47
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,330
I'm so furious with you all.

48
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:55,170
Quickly, pour water over there,
over there!

49
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:56,580
Hurry!

50
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,720
What are we going to do?

51
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,720
Gods,

52
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,000
please save us.

53
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,410
Save us!

54
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,860
These buckets of water are useless.

55
00:04:16,860 --> 00:04:18,290
There's no source of water at all.

56
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:23,880
Gods, save us!

57
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,570
Save us!

58
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,600
Save us!

59
00:04:57,050 --> 00:04:59,130
The fire is out! The fire is out!

60
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:01,880
The fire is out!

61
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,410
The fire is out!

62
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,570
We're saved!

63
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,880
We're saved!

64
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,380
The fire is out!

65
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:16,040
We're saved!

66
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:18,320
Thank you for stepping in to save us.

67
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,610
Our Taoyuan Village

68
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:20,730
is deeply grateful.

69
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:22,980
Please

70
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:24,010
stay a few more days,

71
00:05:24,010 --> 00:05:25,130
so our villagers

72
00:05:26,010 --> 00:05:27,170
can properly host

73
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,320
and repay you.

74
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,970
You peach tree demon
still aren't giving up?

75
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,210
Do you want me to shatter your soul

76
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,220
with this peach blossom branch?

77
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:34,700
It's a misunderstanding,
a misunderstanding!

78
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,540
What?

79
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,730
Peach tree demon?

80
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,290
Yes.

81
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,810
It was him causing trouble

82
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:41,610
and making you and Ling'er fall under a spell

83
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,660
and lose your senses.

84
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,320
You really thought
this was some paradise.

85
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,940
After seven days,

86
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:47,860
you would have turned
into peach trees like them.

87
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,090
Don't misunderstand us.
Please don't misunderstand us!

88
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:53,450
Didn't you also like our Taoyuan Village?

89
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:55,730
Didn't you want to stay here forever?

90
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,200
The outside world is too dangerous.

91
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,530
What's wrong with staying

92
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:02,010
in our peaceful place?

93
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:03,010
Who said we wanted to stay?

94
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,600
You almost messed up our big plan.

95
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:07,010
Xiaoyao.

96
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,260
Wait! Wait!

97
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:09,420
Sir,

98
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:10,490
- please don't hurt my father.
- Mr. Li,

99
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:11,360
please show mercy!

100
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,380
Miss Lin,

101
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,090
considering the little help I provided,

102
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,600
could you spare my father?

103
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:20,730
It was Miss A-Tao
who told me about Taoyuan Village

104
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,160
and taught me how to save you.

105
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,100
Dad,

106
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,570
please forgive me.

107
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,760
I just think

108
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,730
that while Taoyuan Village is wonderful,

109
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:37,210
whether people want to stay

110
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,810
should be their own choice.

111
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,450
Everyone has their own aspirations.

112
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,320
We can't force them.

113
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,530
Right, Miss Zhao,

114
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,850
this is yours, right?

115
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,420
The Spiritual Beads.

116
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,640
Thank you, Miss A-Tao.

117
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:03,290
Miss Zhao,

118
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:06,600
though my father's actions
were inappropriate,

119
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:08,640
he only wanted to keep people here.

120
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:11,410
Considering he never intended
to harm anyone,

121
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,130
can you

122
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,920
forgive us?

123
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,200
As long as your father promises us

124
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,920
that he will no longer use demonic magic

125
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,440
to force outsiders to stay

126
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,600
and turn them into peach trees,
that would be enough.

127
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,940
Dad.

128
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,920
You must no longer harm people.

129
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,980
Okay.

130
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,040
Thank you.

131
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,530
Thank you, Miss Lin.

132
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,730
Everything has grown back.

133
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,120
It seems even better than before.

134
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:38,780
It's growing!

135
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:41,540
That's great.

136
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
A-Tao.

137
00:09:23,290 --> 00:09:25,170
- A-Tao.
- Xiaoyao, let's set off.

138
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,100
Look.

139
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:29,180
Give it to me.

140
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,850
You can go with them.

141
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:32,800
I don't want to leave.

142
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,800
You're just confused for the moment.

143
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:38,290
Give it time, and you'll regret it.

144
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,020
No, I won't. I won't regret it.

145
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:40,860
You go.

146
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:46,140
I only liked you momentarily

147
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,290
out of curiosity about outsiders.

148
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,390
Actually, I've been tired of you
for a long time.

149
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,440
I don't want to see you anymore.

150
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,050
You staying here

151
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:55,880
will only harm us.

152
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,490
Master.

153
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,490
Have you got the peach blossom branch?

154
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:35,490
No, I haven't.

155
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,880
But I found something more precious

156
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,440
than the peach blossom branch,

157
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,620
the Spiritual Beads.

158
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,200
I've found other Spiritual Beads.

159
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,970
Are you sure it's a Spiritual Bead?

160
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,370
I saw it with my own eyes.

161
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,610
Although its color is not quite yours,

162
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,000
its size and shape are exactly the same
as the Wind Spiritual Bead.

163
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,380
Where is the Spiritual Bead now?

164
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,410
Right here in Taoyuan Village,

165
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,240
and there seems to be more than one.

166
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,220
Master, may I ask

167
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,410
what exactly

168
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:05,970
is the Spiritual Bead?

169
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:09,440
It is said that in ancient times,

170
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:12,200
Nuwa gathered the spiritual energy
of heaven and earth

171
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,170
to make five Spiritual Beads of wind,
thunder, water, fire, and earth

172
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,000
to suppress all demons.

173
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:20,330
Since then,

174
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,970
the power of the Five Spirits

175
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:26,200
has become the strongest spiritual force
in the world.

176
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,530
The Five Spiritual Beads...

177
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,970
Take me to get the Spiritual Beads.

178
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:33,810
Sure.

179
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:43,860
A-Tao,

180
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:47,370
no matter what you say,

181
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,530
I'm not leaving.

182
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,100
Let's go.

183
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:06,970
Let go!

184
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,680
I'll escort you out. Let's go.

185
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,680
It's the power of Spiritual Beads.

186
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:20,370
Hand over the Spiritual Beads now,

187
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:23,680
or I will scatter your souls.

188
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,050
Master, the Spiritual Beads are with her.

189
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,320
She's in league
with the peach demons here,

190
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:47,470
causing havoc among the people.

191
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:50,050
How dare you to slander us?

192
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,970
It doesn't matter
where you demons come from.

193
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,640
Hand over the Spiritual Beads.

194
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:56,800
I might consider sparing you.

195
00:12:57,170 --> 00:12:58,410
Such arrogance!

196
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,900
And which demon are you,

197
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,170
wanting to steal our Spiritual Beads?

198
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:03,220
Master, don't waste words

199
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,530
on these stubborn fools.

200
00:14:07,970 --> 00:14:09,850
Why do you know
our Mount Shu Swordsmanship?

201
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,640
Why do you know
our Mount Shu Swordsmanship?

202
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,680
Silly boy.

203
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:17,560
Regardless of whose disciple
you are from Mount Shu,

204
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,640
if you dare collude with evil spirits,

205
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,410
I have a duty to kill you for our sect.

206
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,490
If you want to fight, let's fight.

207
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:26,610
Stop talking!

208
00:14:26,610 --> 00:14:28,120
So blinded by ignorance.

209
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,760
Then don't blame me for being ruthless.

210
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,640
The Talisman of Taoist Master!

211
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,250
A-Tao!

212
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,200
Be careful!

213
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:53,780
Everyone, stop!

214
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,680
- Or I'll chop this peach demon!
- A-Tao!

215
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,560
Don't move!

216
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,180
A-Tao!

217
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:05,800
Release her now,

218
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,370
and perhaps we'll spare your lives.

219
00:17:07,890 --> 00:17:10,440
Fine then. In that case,

220
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,520
there's nothing more to say.

221
00:17:12,770 --> 00:17:13,890
Everyone back off!

222
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,180
Back off!

223
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,170
You have nowhere to run.

224
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,370
It's not too late to release her now.

225
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:45,620
Hand over the Spiritual Beads
if you want her to live.

226
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,460
Let us go.

227
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,610
- Don't ever think about it.
- A-Tao!

228
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,010
Sir, I beg you.

229
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:51,890
Please let her go.

230
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,730
- Right.
- Dream on.

231
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,680
Evil must be eradicated.

232
00:17:56,030 --> 00:17:57,350
Hand over the Spiritual Beads quickly!

233
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,460
A-Tao!

234
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,560
As long as you don't harm her,

235
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,560
we can give you the Spiritual Beads.

236
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:10,010
Master.

237
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:11,410
Go fetch the Spiritual Beads now.

238
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:12,250
Yes.

239
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,350
Give me the Spiritual Beads.

240
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,440
Don't!

241
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,090
Master!

242
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:24,730
Hewen!

243
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:28,850
Hewen!

244
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,890
Hewen!

245
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,890
- Hewen!
- Hewen!

246
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:33,130
Hewen!

247
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:34,130
Save him!

248
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,730
Mr. Li, please! Save him!

249
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:42,940
Hewen!

250
00:19:44,010 --> 00:19:44,850
Hewen!

251
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,440
Hewen, wake up!

252
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,650
Wake up, wake up!

253
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:54,010
Wake up!

254
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,200
This sword seems

255
00:19:58,220 --> 00:19:59,370
to be cursed.

256
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,420
The Guanyin Mantra

257
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:04,920
has no effect on him.

258
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,160
Hewen! Hewen!

259
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,180
What do we do?

260
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,370
Father, you must have a way, right?

261
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,580
Please save him.

262
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,250
I beg you to save him.

263
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,400
I'll do anything if you can save him.

264
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:42,770
I'll do anything.

265
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,060
Now,

266
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,010
there's only one way.

267
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,490
No!

268
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,420
No, it can't be.

269
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,610
Hewen can't become a peach tree.

270
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:02,680
He can't become a peach tree.

271
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,250
You must have another way.

272
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,560
You must have another way, right?

273
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,940
A-Tao...

274
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:16,940
A-Tao...

275
00:21:19,050 --> 00:21:20,010
A-Tao...

276
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,160
The peach tree.

277
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,010
The peach tree...

278
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,460
If that's the case,

279
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,520
you'll never be able to leave here.

280
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,800
I want to stay here

281
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,400
to be with you.

282
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,520
Mr. Song made such a sacrifice.

283
00:23:19,290 --> 00:23:22,800
May the gods bless Mr. Song
to wake up soon

284
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:26,010
and live happily ever after
with Miss A-Tao.

285
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:32,010
In the eyes of Song Hewen,

286
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,400
this isn't a sacrifice,

287
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,920
but rather deep affection.

288
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,440
This isn't deep affection.

289
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:53,920
This is fulfillment.

290
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,680
Hewen!

291
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,540
Hewen!

292
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,180
Hewen!

293
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,460
Hewen!

294
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:45,160
A-Tao.

295
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,090
You've awakened.

296
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,730
A-Tao.

297
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:31,970
Master!

298
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,970
Master!

299
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,970
How are you, Master?

300
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:37,420
Master!

301
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,940
Master!

302
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,490
The pill...

303
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
The pill...

304
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,410
Master, just hold on.

305
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:52,540
I'll get the pill for you right now.

306
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:03,040
The pill...

307
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:05,890
The pill...

308
00:26:26,650 --> 00:26:28,160
- You...
- Master,

309
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,370
thank you
for all the years of nurturing me.

310
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,160
I will not fail
to live up to your expectations.

311
00:26:36,570 --> 00:26:37,790
I will gather all the Spiritual Beads

312
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:40,560
and bring glory to our sect.

313
00:26:42,170 --> 00:26:43,010
You...

314
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:46,210
You...

315
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,090
Master, thank you for entrusting me
with your position.

316
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:49,850
I will avenge you.

317
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:13,680
You...

318
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,700
Master,

319
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:59,520
today you die at the hands of the demons.

320
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,130
I will avenge you

321
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,800
one day.

322
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,130
- Here's the wedding!
- Wait for me!

323
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,230
Hurry up!

324
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,360
- Hurry up!
- Let's go!

325
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,790
Wait for me!

326
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,440
Bow to the God of Peach Blossom.

327
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:57,970
First bow for a match made
under the peach tree.

328
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:06,160
Second bow for all things to grow
and people to prosper.

329
00:29:09,410 --> 00:29:13,680
Third bow for favorable weather
and abundant harvests.

330
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:16,400
Right.

331
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,560
Bow to each other.

332
00:29:48,250 --> 00:29:49,520
Congratulations, congratulations!

333
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:53,220
Congratulations, congratulations!

334
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,200
A union joined in bliss!

335
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:55,700
May you have children soon!

336
00:29:56,050 --> 00:30:01,400
Today, my daughter A-Tao and Song Hewen
have become husband and wife,

337
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,890
united forever in heart and spirit.

338
00:30:02,890 --> 00:30:04,650
Good.

339
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:07,280
- Good.
- Good.

340
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,580
Congratulations!

341
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,440
Congratulations, congratulations!

342
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,370
- Here comes the groom.
- Thank you, thank you.

343
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,130
Folks, thank you all.

344
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,650
Li Xiaoyao, if it weren't for me,

345
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:20,860
you wouldn't have leisure

346
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,970
to watch a wedding here.

347
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,040
That's just a simple demonic magic.

348
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:26,610
Even without you,
I could have woken up by myself.

349
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:28,800
I think even if the whole village woke up,
you wouldn't.

350
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:32,560
Savage girl, you've learned nothing of the peace,
goodness, and politeness of Taoyuan Village.

351
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,560
You really should think

352
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:36,250
about what you were like

353
00:30:36,250 --> 00:30:37,860
when you were under the spell.

354
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,850
Pretty much the same as now.

355
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:41,090
Pretty much the same?

356
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:44,050
Miss Lin, Miss Lin... Who called me that?

357
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:45,940
My head would have to be kicked
by a donkey to call you that.

358
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,780
Don't try to fool me.

359
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,540
Congratulations to both of you.

360
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:54,010
We should be leaving now.

361
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:55,500
Why not stay a few more days?

362
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,340
No, no.

363
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,100
Not everyone
wants to turn into a peach tree

364
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,090
like Mr. Song.

365
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:04,850
Miss Zhao,

366
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,500
when you and Mr. Li get married,

367
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,620
be sure to let us know.

368
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,820
We'll definitely attend.

369
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,660
That's right. That's right.

370
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:11,540
Come on, come on.

371
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,200
Come, sir, congratulations!

372
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:16,520
- Certainly.
- Congratulations, sir!

373
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:21,370
Excuse us.

374
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,060
Come on, come on.

375
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,370
Here, a toast to the Village Chief.

376
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:26,210
Come on.

377
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,060
Let's go drink.

378
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,490
I never want to come to this place again.

379
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,440
But I think being able to stay
with someone you love

380
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,440
in these mountains,

381
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,440
away from the world,

382
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,850
living peacefully,

383
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:23,560
is quite enviable.

384
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,730
Ling'er,

385
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:30,130
then later,

386
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,560
once everything is settled,

387
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:32,890
we'll retire to the mountains.

388
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,770
Conjoined peach blossoms.

389
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,250
Li Xiaoyao!

390
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,300
What are you up to now?

391
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:13,580
Ling'er, ignore her.

392
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:16,110
Seeing her so spirited, I bet she's
definitely looking for trouble again.

393
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:16,970
Let's go.

394
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,980

♪The setting sun lingers, unwilling to leave♪

397
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,620
What are you doing, you crazy girl?

398
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,680
Almost knocked us both over.

399
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:32,490
I've made my decision.

400
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:33,940
What decision?

401
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,060
From now on,

402
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,680
you'll always be my good friends, forever.

403
00:33:39,370 --> 00:33:40,280
Weren't we before?

404
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,130
You weren't.

405
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:44,760
But you are now and will always be.

406
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:46,920
What nonsense.

407
00:33:49,290 --> 00:33:50,280
Let's go, friends.

408
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:52,940
Let's roam the world together,

409
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,890
vanquishing demons and upholding justice.

411
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,620
Oh no.

412
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:02,400
Is there another illusion
in this Taoyuan Village?

413
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,970
The savage girl turned into a crazy girl.

414
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,250
Ling'er, maybe we shouldn't go
with her anymore.

415
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,410
Xiaoyao,

416
00:34:07,410 --> 00:34:09,610
in Taoyuan Village,
we were the ones under the illusion.

417
00:34:09,610 --> 00:34:11,280
Yueru has always been clear-headed.

418
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:15,010
Let's go, Ling'er.

419

♪Ancient folly and today's madness,
all turn into void♪

420
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,170
I think these two are crazy.

421
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,890
Without me, what should they do?

422
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,010
Wait for me.

(Sacred Woods, Sacred Maid's Cottage)

428
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,520
I'm going to heal A'nu.

429
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,170
You may leave us.

430
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,250
Yes.

431
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,260
(Sacred Maid)

432
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,240
Young man,

433
00:36:00,780 --> 00:36:01,850
you're awake.

434
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,340
Don't move.

435
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,610
Madam.

436
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,450
Is A'nu okay?

437
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:18,320
Thankfully, she was brought here in time.

438
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:19,960
Her life is saved,

439
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,450
but she still needs time to rest quietly.

440
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:29,370
It's good she's okay.

441
00:36:30,850 --> 00:36:31,690
It's good.

442
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,560
Do you know you're not well?

443
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,560
You were drained of vital blood
by the Golden Silkworm King.

444
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,760
You needed rest,

445
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:47,570
but you insisted on using your energy
to travel for days.

446
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:49,040
This excessive strain

447
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,280
has severely damaged
your Yin Wei Pulse.

448
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:55,370
Soon your Qiao, Dai, and Chong pulses
will be damaged,

449
00:36:55,940 --> 00:36:58,480
followed by damage to all your meridians.

450
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:01,040
Though I saved your life,

451
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:07,410
you will end up a wreck in endless pain.

452
00:37:13,890 --> 00:37:15,240
As long as she's okay.

453
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,240
Only one person

454
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,610
could have healed you,

455
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:25,130
but it now seems

456
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,800
impossible.

457
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:29,930
Master!

458
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,800
Master, A'nu is awake.

459
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,170
You shouldn't be moving now.

460
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:39,850
I'm fine.

461
00:37:41,410 --> 00:37:43,930
In a moment, you'll collapse.

462
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:47,320
Do you want her to see that?

463
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:11,730
A'nu,

464
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:13,850
you've been through a lot.

465
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,210
Master.

466
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,760
You're finally awake.

467
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,410
You were severely injured
by Bai Yue and nearly died.

468
00:38:23,090 --> 00:38:24,020
Thankfully, Tang Yu and I

469
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:26,170
managed to bring you back here

470
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,800
in time to save your life.

471
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,700
If it weren't for the Golden Silkworm...

472
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,560
If Master hadn't used
the Golden Silkworm King,

473
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,130
you wouldn't have recovered so quickly.

474
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,370
Thank you, Master.

475
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:44,490
Luojiao,

476
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:45,760
where are Ling'er and the others?

477
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,650
Tang Yu. Where's Tang Yu?

478
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:50,560
Princess Ling'er,
Li Xiaoyao, and Lin Yueru

479
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,390
continued on their journey
to find the Spiritual Beads.

480
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:53,760
I believe it won't be long

481
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,450
before we reunite with them in Nanzhao.

482
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:58,320
As for Tang Yu...

483
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:00,740
A'nu,

484
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,610
Tang Yu can't come to see you now.

485
00:39:06,020 --> 00:39:06,960
Why?

486
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:11,890
He went to help me gather herbs.

487
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,240
Then I must go find him.

488
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,540
I also need to find Ling'er and join her

489
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:20,290
to continue our quest
for the Five Spiritual Beads.

490
00:39:22,170 --> 00:39:24,450
A'nu, listen to me carefully.

491
00:39:25,170 --> 00:39:27,450
Bai Yue is cunning and treacherous,

492
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:29,210
and now his powers are vast.

493
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,760
So, we need to find other ways

494
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:33,130
to combat his Moon Worship Sect.

495
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,450
You are the hope of the Witch Moon Sect,

496
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,320
so you absolutely

497
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,520
must not come to harm.

498
00:39:41,330 --> 00:39:42,850
The most important thing for you now

499
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:44,720
is to quickly recover.

500
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:46,560
This isn't just for your own sake.

501
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:47,970
Understand?

502
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,370
Don't worry.

503
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:55,780
Princess Ling'er has Li Xiaoyao

504
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:57,650
and Lin Yueru to protect her.

505
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,930
She'll be fine.

506
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:03,930
I need to return to Nanzhao first

507
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,280
to meet with the Witch King
with the Lady of the South

508
00:40:06,700 --> 00:40:07,930
and expose Bai Yue's conspiracy.

509
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,380
Luojiao,

510
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,760
are you leaving now?

511
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,320
I'll come back to visit you.

512
00:40:15,170 --> 00:40:16,010
Luojiao,

513
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,040
you must also be careful yourself.

514
00:40:20,370 --> 00:40:21,210
Rest now.

515
00:40:21,850 --> 00:40:23,090
Have a good rest.

516
00:40:32,850 --> 00:40:34,450
Have you already decided?

517
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:37,300
Master,

518
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,800
I secluded myself for ten years

519
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,800
to avoid conflict,

520
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,090
but with the current situation in Nanzhao,

521
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:45,480
I can no longer remain an outsider.

522
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,720
Everything has its causes and effects.

523
00:40:49,610 --> 00:40:53,610
Do you know that Nanzhao
has changed completely now?

524
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,610
The journey there
is fraught with uncertainty.

525
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,890
Year by year, the blossoms are similar,

526
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,720
but the people are not the same.

527
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:06,930
It's said that life is like a game of chess.

528
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,480
We are now unavoidably involved.

529
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,850
If someone must sacrifice their life
for this cause,

530
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,760
I hope that A'nu and the others can survive.

531
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:22,520
What are your plans
when you return to Nanzhao?

532
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,320
I plan to return to the Lady of the South

533
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:28,090
and lead the soldiers
to resist the Moon Worship Sect.

534
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:31,700
This might be the only force in Nanzhao

535
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:33,480
capable of counterbalancing Bai Yue now.

536
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,650
Master, there's something else
I don't understand.

537
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:41,690
Bai Yue went to great lengths

538
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,170
only to destroy the Witch Queen's statue.

539
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,800
It seems he intentionally spared our lives.

540
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:49,320
I'm not sure what he intends by this.

541
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,760
This might be related

542
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,370
to the Water Demon Beast.

543
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,320
The Water Demon Beast?

544
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,610
I will send people to investigate this.

545
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,690
Tang Yu...

546
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:12,410
Master,

547
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:16,000
Mr. Shi once suspected that Tang Yu

548
00:42:16,270 --> 00:42:17,720
might be connected
to the Moon Worship Sect.

549
00:42:19,850 --> 00:42:21,930
I have my own judgment on this.
