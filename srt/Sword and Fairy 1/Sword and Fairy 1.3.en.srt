=Episode 3=

3
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,370
Come and look. Tasty and cheap.

4
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,100
Buns. Hot buns.

5
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,340
Xiaoyao.

6
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,180
Miss Ling'er, you're awake.

7
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,730
Last night,

8
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,820
I dreamed about my grandma.

9
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,180
Miss Ling'er,

10
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:48,930
I'm sorry for your loss.

11
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:50,290
Don't be too sad.

12
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,930
In my dream, my grandma

13
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:56,980
went back to our hometown.

14
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,180
She asked me to keep my spirits up

15
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,770
and get back to Nanzhao early.

16
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,150
So,

17
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,210
I can't just mope around.

18
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:07,870
That's right.

19
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,470
Hold on a second, Miss Ling'er.

20
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:11,650
I'll go get you something to eat.

21
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,540
Xiaoyao,

22
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,210
why do you keep calling me Miss Ling'er?

23
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,370
What else am I supposed to call you?

24
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:22,770
Ling'er.

25
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,980
Ling'er?

26
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,900
Yeah.

27
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,540
I'm your wife Ling'er.

28
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,980
Wife?

29
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,700
Mi... Miss.

30
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:34,930
I saved your life,

31
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,830
but I was just trying to help a weak girl.

32
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:38,550
I didn't mean to force you to marry me.

33
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,420
Xiaoyao,

34
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:40,930
what are you talking about?

35
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:43,270
We got married.

36
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:44,110
We did?

37
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:45,860
No way. I've never even seen you before.

38
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,130
How could I marry you?

39
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:49,060
Xiaoyao.

40
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:51,010
Why did you forget again?

41
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:52,210
Again?

42
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,980
I forgot again?

43
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,930
I forgot...

44
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:57,590
I...

45
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,900
- Did I...
- Xiaoyao,

46
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,010
what is wrong?

47
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,570
Xiaoyao. Xiaoyao!

48
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,580
Xiaoyao! Xiaoyao, wake up!

49
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:17,860
Xiaoyao!

50
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,210
Xiaoyao!

51
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:20,230
Xiaoyao.

52
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:21,550
Xiaoyao!

53
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:27,770
(Xiaoyao Inn)
Meat for sale.

54
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:32,260
You said you met Xiaoyao ten years ago?

55
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,020
Ten years.

56
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,330
Then who was the young man I met

57
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:46,700
ten years ago?

58
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,580
Auntie,

59
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:52,980
now,

60
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,740
Xiaoyao is the last family member I have.

61
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,020
But he doesn't remember me.

62
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,860
I've heard

63
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:02,770
there's a poison in Nanzhao

64
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:05,100
named the Worry-free Poison.

65
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,450
Anyone who takes it

66
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,100
will lose his memory.

67
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,820
If he forcibly tries to recall something,

68
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,890
he'll fail and get a terrible headache.

69
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,300
Is there an antidote?

70
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,300
I'm not sure.

71
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:26,260
I got him involved in this.

72
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,430
Ling'er,

73
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,740
you care for Xiaoyao sincerely, right?

74
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,430
That's helpful.

75
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,490
I decide who Xiaoyao will marry.

76
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,020
I'll make him hold you accountable.

77
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,650
Auntie.

78
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,860
You just spend some time with him.

79
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,330
Maybe he'll recall something.

80
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,610
It doesn't matter even if he fails.

81
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,170
Old memories may be lost.

82
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,260
But a new relationship can be built.

83
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:02,610
I get it,

84
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:03,830
Auntie.

85
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:07,860
Good girl.

86
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,020
Vegetables. Come have a look.

87
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,420
Look. Who's that girl beside Xiaoyao?

88
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,740
I don't know her.

89
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:18,060
She isn't local.

90
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:20,020
Xiaoyao is really blessed.

91
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,420
Xiaoyao.

92
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,930
Does your head still hurt?

93
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,660
Come have a look.

94
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:26,790
No.

95
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,100
Oh, why did I feel dizzy yesterday?

96
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,830
It must be the after-effect

97
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,220
of my aunt's hitting my head all the time.

98
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,060
Come have a look.

99
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,460
Such a beautiful and elegant girl.

100
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,500
He's so lucky.

101
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,300
Xiaoyao. Miss Fairy.

102
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,330
- Xiaohu.
- I'm Wang Xiaohu.

103
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,620
Do you remember me?

104
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:43,150
I do, of course.

105
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:44,380
Is your grandfather getting better?

106
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,670
After taking the medicine you gave him,

107
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:46,870
he got much better.

108
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,020
Come have a look.

109
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,340
Mr. Wang.

110
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,740
Thank you for saving my life, Miss Fairy.

111
00:06:54,670 --> 00:06:55,950
Don't thank me, sir.

112
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:57,700
And I'm not a fairy.

113
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,260
Just call me Ling'er.

114
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,820
Miss Ling'er,

115
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:02,980
you and Xiaoyao

116
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,170
make a really perfect couple.

117
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,110
When will you hold the wedding?

118
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,580
Let us celebrate it for you.

119
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,550
Don't be kidding, Mr. Wang.

120
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:12,700
She's right here.

121
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,340
And don't joke when she isn't around.

122
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,500
May you have a baby soon.

123
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,740
What are you talking about?

124
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,340
Xiaohu, take your grandfather away.

125
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,260
May you have a baby soon.

126
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,770
Take it.

127
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:29,580
Xiaoyao.

128
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:32,270
If...

129
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,930
Come have a look.

130
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:37,860
If you have to marry me, will you feel bad?

131
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,340
No, no. I...

132
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,100
My point is...

133
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:46,050
I never thought about it.

134
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:50,330
Fancy silk. Come have a look.

135
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:53,300
Come on. Don't listen to them.

136
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,980
Let me take you
to have some red bean congee.

137
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,510
All right.

138
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,740
(Red Bean Congee)
Li Xiaoyao is getting married!

139
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,930
When?

140
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,060
No idea.

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,180
Neighbors are talking about that.

142
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,580
With a fairy from the Fairy Island, I heard.

143
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,150
There he is.

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,890
- Congratulations.
- How does he have the nerve to come?

145
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:15,460
Thank you.

146
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,170
- Thank you.
- That girl

147
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,540
looks exactly like a fairy from the painting.

148
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:22,420
Xianglan, Xiulan,
two bowls of red bean congee.

149
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:23,710
All right.

150
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
Xiulan,

151
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,830
are your hands cramping?

152
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,770
Why did you slam them down?

153
00:08:35,470 --> 00:08:36,420
So sweet.

154
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,500
Have some more.

155
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,340
Li Xiaoyao.

156
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,750
Who is she?

157
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:44,810
She...

158
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,700
She is Ling'er.

159
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,980
What is she to you?

160
00:08:51,590 --> 00:08:53,060
She is...

161
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,660
The great-granddaughter

162
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:02,380
of a distant relative

163
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,010
of my aunt's sister.

164
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,670
Come on, Xiulan.

165
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,070
Don't ask.

166
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:11,500
Miss, you look so pretty.

167
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,300
A fairy, indeed.

168
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:14,940
The bill, please.

169
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,540
- Have it before it gets cold.
- Li Xiaoyao!

170
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,350
What again?

171
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,860
Men like you are just annoying!

172
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:22,500
You always love someone prettier!

173
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:24,860
What is she talking about?

174
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,250
Xiaoyao.

175
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:35,860
Are you close to that lady?

176
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:38,650
We grew up together.

177
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:41,210
Oh, I see.

178
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:42,820
Then...

179
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:46,860
Will you marry her? Do you adore her?

180
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,710
How would I marry her?

181
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:49,860
I don't adore her.

182
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,740
When you were five,

183
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,250
you said you would marry my sister!

184
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,390
Back then, I also said

185
00:09:56,390 --> 00:09:57,470
I would feed you to a sea turtle!

186
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:58,310
You...

187
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,950
You know what?

188
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,950
I'll tell this girl

189
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,450
all your stupid childhood stories.

190
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,100
Don't make up stories.

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,150
Don't talk nonsense.

192
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:07,950
This isn't nonsense.

193
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,060
- Make the congee instead of disturbing us.
- Give us the money back.

194
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,270
- Hey, people are around.
- Come on.

195
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,180
Say no more.

196
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,540
It's their own business.

197
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,030
- Stay out of this.
- That's right.

198
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,980
It's none of your business.

199
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:17,500
- How could you...
- Don't interfere.

200
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,140
Miss Ling'er.

201
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,740
Are you tired?

202
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,190
No.

203
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,420
Then why do you look unhappy?

204
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:35,890
That's not true. I'm happy.

205
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,890
And I love this town.

206
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:41,940
The people here are great.

207
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:44,100
In this case, stay for a longer time.

208
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,300
As long as you like.

209
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,270
We can go fishing on the sea.
You know what?

210
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:48,540
Fish are silly.

211
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:52,770
It's raining.

212
00:10:53,590 --> 00:10:54,570
Ling'er, come with me.

213
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,740
(If...)

214
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,180
(If I can have a wife like her,)

215
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,620
(I'd be really blessed.)

216
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:33,650
(Whatever happens,)

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,060
(I'll always keep Miss Ling'er safe.)

218
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,860
(I won't let her get hurt again.)

219
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:19,620
(Nanzhao Imperial Palace)

220
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,980
(Canglan Hall)

221
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,300
Your Majesty, Elder Shi is here.

222
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,430
Yes.

223
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:36,100
Your Majesty, thinking of the Queen again?

224
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,940
Since Qing'er died

225
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,010
(The Witch King)
and Ling'er went missing,

226
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,020
I've been expecting to dream about them

227
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,500
(Elder Shi)
day and night.

228
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,940
Lately, I've been dreaming about Qing'er.

229
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:50,330
Is she worried about Ling'er?

230
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:53,010
Ling'er can't be in danger, can she?

231
00:12:53,710 --> 00:12:55,980
I've been sending guards
to look for Princess Ling'er.

232
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,550
But so far...

233
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,620
So far, there's been no word on her.

234
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,330
If Princess Ling'er is really in danger,

235
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,590
I believe our priestess, Lady of the South,

236
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,010
will feel it.

237
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,300
Go give out my order.

238
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:10,390
When she's back in town,
get her to me immediately.

239
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:12,540
Your Majesty, be careful.

240
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,390
You're having
more frequent headaches lately.

241
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:18,710
I'll go get you an imperial physician.

242
00:13:18,710 --> 00:13:19,740
No need.

243
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,590
The Queen is your disease.

244
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:26,210
Until you let go of the Queen,

245
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,650
you won't get rid of the headaches.

246
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,010
Take some rest, Your Majesty.

247
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,690
I'll keep trying to find Princess Ling'er.

248
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,250
All right.

249
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:51,540
Qing'er,

250
00:13:52,470 --> 00:13:53,810
may your soul in heaven

251
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,980
bless our daughter.

252
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,340
Miss Ling'er.

253
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,400
What are you doing here?

254
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:26,740
I bought you some square-shaped rice cake

255
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,890
made by Mr. Ye of our town.

256
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:28,990
Try some.

257
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,060
Xiaoyao,

258
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,620
this is such a great town.

259
00:14:36,830 --> 00:14:39,890
It has fancy scenery,
tasty food, and nice people.

260
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:41,940
Friends and family members are around.

261
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,300
I'm so jealous.

262
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:45,420
Don't be jealous.

263
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:47,330
I'll keep you company from now on.

264
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,350
I'll take you to better places,

265
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:50,390
enjoy nicer food,

266
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,330
and meet funnier people.

267
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:52,600
Just like my parents.

268
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,940
They've been traveling around the world

269
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:55,010
and helping the weak.

270
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:02,690
Thank you,

271
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,380
Xiaoyao.

272
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,340
Miss Ling'er,

273
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,420
I promised your grandmother

274
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:11,740
and I will keep my word.

275
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:23,690
But...

276
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,450
Now,

277
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,650
I do have some trouble

278
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:29,570
and I need to do something.

279
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,660
(Xiaoyao Inn)

280
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,590
I... I promised

281
00:15:42,590 --> 00:15:43,590
Ling'er's grandmother

282
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,810
to escort her back to Nanzhao.

283
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,590
The trip may not be dangerous.

284
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,500
But it has to be long.

285
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,770
She's a girl, you know. What if...

286
00:15:53,590 --> 00:15:55,770
Well, it's not that I have to go.

287
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,660
But I'm a man, after all.

288
00:15:57,660 --> 00:15:58,590
If I break my promise,

289
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,860
it'll be a shame.

290
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,910
Don't you

291
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:01,980
think so?

292
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:04,570
Who are you to escort her?

293
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:06,790
Look.

294
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,420
I'm clever and smart.

295
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,830
I can cook and do the laundry.

296
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:10,670
I can even do martial arts.

297
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,010
Your poor martial arts?

298
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,570
But isn't it safer to travel together?

299
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:24,250
You really want to go?

300
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,820
Auntie,

301
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:28,100
you'll let me go?

302
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:30,980
I give you my word. I won't make trouble.

303
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,600
And I'll come back home
as soon as Ling'er arrives.

304
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,790
Auntie, rest assured. I won't get into trouble.

305
00:16:37,790 --> 00:16:39,420
This world isn't that dangerous, after all.

306
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:43,980
Early tomorrow morning,

307
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,570
Mr. Fang's fleet is going out to sea.

308
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,620
His ship often sails to Nanzhao.

309
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:50,940
Auntie.

310
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,770
You really said yes, Auntie.

311
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,450
Auntie, it's so nice of you.

312
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,550
Stay back.

313
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:59,180
Auntie, thank you.

314
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,500
I knew you would let me go.

315
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,500
Xiaoyao.

316
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:10,900
This is

317
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,330
your father's...

318
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:15,860
The sword your father used.

319
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,900
My father's sword?

320
00:17:19,510 --> 00:17:20,690
Why haven't I ever seen it before?

321
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,140
You haven't, of course.

322
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:23,590
If I had given it to you before,

323
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:25,530
you would have
turned the town upside down.

324
00:17:27,110 --> 00:17:29,260
Now, you're calm enough.

325
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:31,810
And I don't need this sword.

326
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:33,530
I'm just giving it to you, then.

327
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:38,140
I have a real weapon, at last.

328
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,380
Look, boy.

329
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,780
(Dragon Pick, Heart Freezing Art)

330
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,900
Heart Freezing Art?

331
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,450
Dragon Pick?

332
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,180
These are unique techniques

333
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,290
your parents developed from their trips.

334
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,930
On your way to Nanzhao,
practice as much as you can.

335
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,830
Don't waste your time

336
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:02,170
on those useless moves out of nowhere.

337
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:04,330
What useless moves?

338
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,900
Auntie, you don't know...

339
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,740
I know.

340
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:07,980
I certainly know.

341
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:10,550
Xiaoyao,

342
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:12,830
you've just learned martial arts

343
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:16,110
and you think you're invincible.

344
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:18,060
You've never traveled around before.

345
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,420
When you go out there, you'll realize

346
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,380
there are always stronger people.

347
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:22,930
If you can't defeat them...

348
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:24,470
I understand, Auntie.

349
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:25,750
I totally do. Don't worry.

350
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,660
I'll work on my father's martial arts

351
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:30,260
and advance gradually and cautiously.

352
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,050
I'll fight when I can win.
And when I can't...

353
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:36,210
There's no one that I can't defeat.

354
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,740
In the end, you're going to travel around,

355
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,900
just like your father.

356
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:49,590
Auntie,

357
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:50,710
don't worry.

358
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,380
I won't be like my father

359
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,290
who hasn't come back yet.

360
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,100
Xiaoyao,

361
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,900
how about I go with you?

362
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,100
No...

363
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,500
No need.

364
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,630
(Yuhang Town)

365
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,060
Whatever happens,

366
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,140
tolerate as much as you can.

367
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:12,860
Because you have Ling'er to take care of.

368
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:13,950
Got it?

369
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,660
Besides,

370
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,410
you can only do

371
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,530
very poor martial arts.

372
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,620
If you run into someone strong,

373
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,950
just run away.

374
00:19:24,950 --> 00:19:25,790
Auntie,

375
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:27,620
you're repeating this
and I've kept it in mind.

376
00:19:29,830 --> 00:19:32,860
You've never left this town before.

377
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:34,020
How about this?

378
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,530
I'll go pack

379
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,060
and close the inn.

380
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,110
Then I'll go with you.

381
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:38,950
Auntie.

382
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:41,670
Auntie,

383
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,020
I've grown up.

384
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,100
I can take good care of myself.

385
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:45,100
Don't worry about me.

386
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,980
I'm not worried about you.

387
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,620
I'm worried about Ling'er.

388
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:55,140
Auntie...

389
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:57,950
Auntie, you're crying?

390
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:58,900
I'm not.

391
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,410
I just feel happy.

392
00:20:03,110 --> 00:20:04,660
The troublemaker is finally leaving.

393
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,210
I'll even set off some firecrackers.

394
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,860
Let me remind you something.

395
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,020
When you see Ling'er's mother,

396
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,180
ask her for Ling'er honestly

397
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,140
and then hold a wedding.

398
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,830
Ask her for Ling'er?
Auntie, are you serious?

399
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:21,670
Yes.

400
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:22,550
Don't ask.

401
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:23,900
- Just listen to me.
- But...

402
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:25,930
- Why...
- The ship is setting sail.

403
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,870
- There you go.
- Auntie, I should go.

404
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:28,710
Just go.

405
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:29,900
Let's go.

406
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,070
Sail.

407
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:39,220
Let's go.

408
00:20:40,830 --> 00:20:43,020
Xiaoyao, Miss Fairy,

409
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,410
wish you a happy voyage!

410
00:20:56,230 --> 00:20:57,070
Auntie,

411
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,410
wait to hear my name

412
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:00,950
go all around

413
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:02,260
and captivate the world!

414
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,050
Why do I find it familiar?

415
00:22:04,350 --> 00:22:05,260
Oh, I see.

416
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:08,190
Miss Ling'er.

417
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:10,310
I remember now.

418
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:11,990
Such moves

419
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,860
are what Auntie used
when she ran after me.

420
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,020
So, Xiaoyao, you move so agilely

421
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:21,470
because your aunt

422
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:23,020
has been secretly training you.

423
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,860
Well, this lady,

424
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,620
she's smart.

425
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:31,190
Mr. Fang,

426
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,210
when are we arriving in Nanzhao?

427
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,780
(Mr. Fang)
Nanzhao? I didn't say I was going there.

428
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,300
This ship isn't heading for Nanzhao.

429
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:41,500
You have to arrive in Suzhou City

430
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,660
and travel over the land.

431
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:47,740
Your ship used to sail to Nanzhao, didn't it?

432
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,330
Nanzhao has been in trouble these years.

433
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,050
I heard there was even a natural disaster.

434
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,500
As for what exactly happened...

435
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,900
Oh.

436
00:22:55,830 --> 00:22:58,050
They two are going to Nanzhao for business.

437
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,740
Ask them and you'll know.

438
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,740
Gentlemen,

439
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:02,780
come over here.

440
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,500
Mr. Fang.

441
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
Mr. Fang.

442
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,350
My young friend is going to Nanzhao.

443
00:23:08,350 --> 00:23:09,780
How's everything going there lately?

444
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,380
Don't travel to Nanzhao

445
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:13,420
unless you really have to.

446
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,690
- Yeah.
- That's too dangerous.

447
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:15,860
Why?

448
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,950
It's going through a civil unrest.

449
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:19,260
The Witch Moon Sect is fighting
the Moon Worship Sect.

450
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:20,830
There is a drought, too.

451
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:24,260
And the Moon Worshippers often hurt
businessmen from the Central Plains.

452
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,810
I didn't know

453
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,930
Nanzhao could be so dangerous.

454
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,100
Ling'er,

455
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:35,930
don't be scared. You have me.

456
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,140
Have a drink with me.

457
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,050
All right.

458
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,740
- Come on, Mr. Fang.
- Let's go.

459
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,310
Ling'er,

460
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,210
don't worry too much.

461
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:01,140
Nanzhao isn't peaceful,

462
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,660
but your mother may not be in danger.

463
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,310
Oh, no.

464
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:08,290
She'll be all right, I'm sure.

465
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:15,930
When I was little,

466
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,740
I grew up in the Imperial Palace.

467
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,660
Later I went to the Fairy Island
and never traveled away.

468
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,140
I'm thinking

469
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:26,170
what the outer world will be like.

470
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,260
And what will happen

471
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:29,930
on our way to Nanzhao?

472
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,260
That's me, too.

473
00:24:31,630 --> 00:24:33,690
I've never left Yuhang Town before.

474
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:36,260
But I'm not scared at all.

475
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,410
Instead, I'm excited.

476
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:38,950
Why?

477
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,410
Because I can travel to different places

478
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,570
and experience various things.

479
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,710
A swordsman

480
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,450
should travel around the world,

481
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,020
helping the weak.

482
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:48,860
And anyway,

483
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,180
when I'm tired,

484
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:51,570
I can come back home.

485
00:24:58,870 --> 00:24:59,710
Ling'er.

486
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:02,740
From this day on,

487
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:06,210
take my home as yours, too.

488
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,050
When we're tired,

489
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,380
we can come back together.

490
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:13,670
Cheer up.

491
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:14,790
I'm here with you.

492
00:25:15,750 --> 00:25:17,140
I will protect you.

493
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,300
(Nanzhao)

494
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,900
Stop!

495
00:25:49,470 --> 00:25:50,310
Stop running!

496
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:05,340
(A'nu)

497
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:06,740
They just never leave me alone.

498
00:26:14,590 --> 00:26:16,140
Listen up, all of you.

499
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:17,780
From now on,

500
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,810
whoever dares to touch me

501
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,900
will be executed!

502
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,020
Let me go, you bad guy!

503
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,260
Do you know who I am?

504
00:26:58,260 --> 00:26:59,100
How dare you...

505
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,660
(Tang Yu)

506
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,980
Mother,

507
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:21,380
give me the man who caught me.

508
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,740
He knocked me out behind your back.

509
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,660
It's you.

510
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:29,110
How dare you come here?

511
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:29,950
A'nu.

512
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:32,930
(Lady of the South)
You left Nanzhao without permission

513
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,450
and I haven't punished you yet.

514
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,020
Mother,

515
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:45,110
I just found Nanzhao so boring

516
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,100
that I wanted to travel to the Central Plains.

517
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,620
There has been a drought for years.

518
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:52,930
The Moon Worship Sect
is eager to destroy us.

519
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:56,620
Instead of caring for our people,
you want to travel around!

520
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:59,050
How could you be the young master?

521
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,620
I won't be it, then.

522
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:01,830
Stop!

523
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,100
Get your order, A'nu.

524
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,530
Head for the Central Plains immediately

525
00:28:09,750 --> 00:28:12,140
to look for the Five Spiritual Beads,
the Sacred Relic of our sect,

526
00:28:12,710 --> 00:28:15,100
and pray for the rain
to get Nanzhao out of misery.

527
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:17,930
Head for the Central Plains?

528
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,930
The Five Spiritual Beads?

529
00:28:23,380 --> 00:28:24,620
In the ancient times,

530
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:27,260
the Five Great Beasts

531
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:28,980
raged across the world.

532
00:28:29,630 --> 00:28:31,620
To prevent the misery,

533
00:28:32,230 --> 00:28:33,660
Nuwa gathered the power of the earth

534
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,950
to make five spiritual beads
against the Beasts.

535
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,740
The Five Spiritual Beads scattered.

536
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:42,060
The most terrible Water Demon Beast,
rose from the water

537
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,210
and raged again.

538
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:45,780
Ten years ago,

539
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,590
the Witch Queen,

540
00:28:47,590 --> 00:28:49,500
the Sacred Lady of our sect,

541
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:51,540
sacrificed herself to have suppressed
the Water Demon Beast,

542
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:54,020
so Nanzhao enjoyed a peace of ten years.

543
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,860
There has been a drought for years.

544
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:59,860
I guess it has something to do
with the Water Demon Beast, too.

545
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:02,530
Now, only the Five Spiritual Beads

546
00:29:02,830 --> 00:29:04,260
can free us from the trouble.

547
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,260
This is the Sacred Spiritual Bead.

548
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,570
It has the same origin
as the Five Spiritual Beads.

549
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:21,210
It can tell you where the beads are.

550
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:24,570
When you approach different beads,

551
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,900
it will display different colors.

552
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,450
Red for the Fire Spiritual Bead.

553
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,660
Blue for the Water Spiritual Bead.

554
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,990
Green for the Wind Spiritual Bead.

555
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:36,300
Purple for the Thunder Spiritual Bead.

556
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,100
Yellow for the Earth Spiritual Bead.

557
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,500
The Sacred Spiritual Bead...

558
00:29:42,830 --> 00:29:45,260
The Five Spiritual Beads were made by Nuwa.

559
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,510
Only a descendant of hers

560
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,330
can activate them.

561
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:53,260
Now, only Princess Ling'er,
who was lost ten years ago,

562
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:55,260
can activate the beads

563
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,410
and pray for rain in our kingdom.

564
00:29:58,470 --> 00:29:59,620
Princess Ling'er?

565
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,140
Mother, have you got any word from her?

566
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,780
In that disaster,

567
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,500
Princess Ling'er was lost.

568
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:09,020
The Witch Queen's statue
drifted away in the flood.

569
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,860
I suspect

570
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:12,860
the Moon Worship Sect was behind all this.

571
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,590
After many inquiries,

572
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:16,620
I finally found the Witch Queen's statue

573
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,140
and got to know

574
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,710
the Witch Queen

575
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,300
had Princess Ling'er sent

576
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,500
to the Central Plains.

577
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:25,510
The Five Spiritual Beads and Princess Ling'er

578
00:30:25,510 --> 00:30:27,570
are the only hope of Nanzhao.

579
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,570
I get it.

580
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,620
But Mother,

581
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:37,210
you're giving me such an important mission.

582
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,290
Can I do it?

583
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:39,470
You can't.

584
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:42,020
Then why did you explain so much to me?

585
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,140
Tang Yu.

586
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:46,950
Yes.

587
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,740
When Tang Yu goes with you,

588
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:50,500
you'll be able to do it.

589
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,210
From this day on,

590
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,710
Tang Yu, you'll go to the Central Plains

591
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:59,780
as the guard of your young master.

592
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:02,310
- No way!
- No way!

593
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,980
Chief,

594
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:07,330
I'd do anything for our sect.

595
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,330
But could you please consider

596
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,810
giving me another mission?

597
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,500
You...

598
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:14,230
I don't want to go with me, either!

599
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:15,070
Tang Yu,

600
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,100
to find the Five Spiritual Beads

601
00:31:18,350 --> 00:31:19,980
is critical to Nanzhao.

602
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:27,200
Mother,

603
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,140
you want me to get back
the Five Spiritual Beads and Ling'er

604
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:30,300
and I'm all right with it.

605
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,540
But in no case will I go with him.

606
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:32,500
I've made up my mind.

607
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,570
Tang Yu has to be your guard.

608
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:36,380
I don't accept this.

609
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,380
Don't go, then.

610
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:39,350
Somebody.

611
00:31:39,590 --> 00:31:41,020
Take her back to her room

612
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,210
and keep her under the watchful eye!

613
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:43,620
Mother.

614
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,330
Mother.

615
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,780
I'll just go, all right?

616
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:56,830
A'nu,

617
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,380
go get packed.

618
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:00,690
You'll leave tomorrow morning.

619
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:28,670
Come on. Be careful.

620
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:31,500
I'll bring you something better next time.

621
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,980
- Put it here.
- Let's have a drink someday.

622
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,690
We'll drink more next time.

623
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:35,710
All right, Mr. Fang.

624
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:36,590
See you next time.

625
00:32:38,350 --> 00:32:40,210
Xiaoyao, this is where I have to leave you.

626
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:42,510
You have to take care of each other

627
00:32:42,510 --> 00:32:43,410
and stay safe.

628
00:32:43,990 --> 00:32:46,230
Suzhou City is some little way further on.

629
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,860
You can go ask around in the city.

630
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,110
There are many big businessmen groups.

631
00:32:50,110 --> 00:32:51,660
Maybe some of them are going to Nanzhao.

632
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,020
I get it. Thanks, Mr. Fang.

633
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,020
We should go.

634
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,260
Come on.

635
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,020
Ling'er, look over there.

636
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,530
Let's go. Hurry.

637
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,780
Suzhou City looks really nice.

638
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:06,380
Much better than our small village.

639
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,140
But Xiaoyao,

640
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:10,450
all the forests look similar, don't they?

641
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,790
You're right.

642
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,290
But thinking that
Auntie can no longer scold me

643
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:20,260
even makes the air sweeter.

644
00:33:21,710 --> 00:33:23,590
I beg you. Stop beating him.

645
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:24,810
Help!

646
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:28,630
Stop it. We're sorry.

647
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:30,260
Help!

648
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,860
Sounds like a girl's cry.

649
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:34,540
I beg you. Stop it!

650
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,410
What a surprise!

651
00:33:36,110 --> 00:33:37,210
Shortly after I came out here,

652
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:40,100
I got a chance to help someone.

653
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,760
- Let's go.
- Please stop.

654
00:33:43,380 --> 00:33:44,000
Stop it.

655
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,380
- How dare you run away?
- I know I'm wrong.

656
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,450
Will you keep running away, huh?

657
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:47,810
How daring!

658
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,020
Miss, I know you care for me.

659
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,590
Changgui swore he would be nice to me

660
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,970
(Changgui)
and marry me.

661
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,200
If he really wanted to marry you,

662
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:55,380
why would he trick you into eloping?

663
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,750
Miss, I didn't. I didn't trick her.

664
00:33:56,750 --> 00:33:57,900
I swear to God.

665
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,060
(Yinhua)
I really love her.

666
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:01,020
Still lying, huh?

667
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,450
Tell the truth! Still lying, huh?

668
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:09,340
(Lin Yueru)

669
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:14,500
Let go of me!

670
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,660
Are you all right?

671
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:25,140
Woman, how could you be so brutal?

672
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:27,220
I can do whatever I want
and it's none of your business.

673
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:29,100
Such an unreasonable woman!

674
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,700
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

675
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,700
Thank you, Miss.

676
00:34:55,530 --> 00:34:56,380
Changgui.

677
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,900
I'll be nice to you, Yinhua.

678
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:04,810
- Changgui!
- Run!

679
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,260
Thank you, Miss.

680
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,460
Changgui!

681
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,380
Dragon Pick!

682
00:35:41,470 --> 00:35:43,490
I... I meant to grab the whip.

683
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,940
- I'm sorry.
- Flirt!

684
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,390
Let go of me!

685
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:51,180
I didn't mean it.

686
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:52,790
I can let you go, but you have to stop.

687
00:35:52,790 --> 00:35:54,420
Flirt, I'm going to kill you!

688
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:11,900
- Let me go!
- Behave yourself!

689
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:16,590
Let me go!

690
00:36:17,180 --> 00:36:18,490
Let me go! Hurry!

691
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,750
You can experience how others feel.

692
00:36:20,750 --> 00:36:22,700
What? It feels bad to be tied, huh?

693
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:24,230
Let me go!

694
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,100
Or I'll ask my father

695
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,180
to have your legs broken!

696
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:28,660
Xiaoyao,

697
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,380
how about we let her go?

698
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,100
Did you hear? She asked you to let me go.

699
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,790
She said she would
have her father break our legs.

700
00:36:34,790 --> 00:36:35,630
How could we let her go?

701
00:36:35,790 --> 00:36:36,770
Let me go! Hurry!

702
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,550
Ling'er, let's go.

703
00:36:39,550 --> 00:36:40,750
Suzhou City is right ahead.

704
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:42,420
It's bustling, I heard.

705
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,290
Let's go have a look.

706
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,310
Let me go!

707
00:36:46,990 --> 00:36:47,860
The two of you,

708
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:48,700
let me go!

709
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,860
But Xiaoyao,

710
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,420
isn't it inappropriate to leave her here

711
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:52,260
all alone?

712
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:53,620
If you let her go now,

713
00:36:53,790 --> 00:36:55,550
she'll catch up with that couple.

714
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,820
We won't return and let her go

715
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,490
until they run far enough.

716
00:36:58,790 --> 00:36:59,900
Don't worry, Ling'er.

717
00:37:01,750 --> 00:37:03,530
I'm talking to you. Let me go!

718
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:04,940
Come on.

719
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,570
Let me go!

720
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,220
Anybody?

721
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,250
Help!

722
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:21,950
- Help!
- Xiaoyao,

723
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:23,470
she's been shouting for help.

724
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,180
Anybody?

725
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,020
Ignore her.

726
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,660
- She must be acting to get us back.
- Help!

727
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:30,680
- But...
- Help!

728
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,900
How about we go back and check on her?

729
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:33,970
Anybody?

730
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,180
Help!

731
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,050
Fine. Let's get back there, then.

732
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:42,330
Help! Hel...

733
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,460
Ling'er, see?

734
00:37:51,550 --> 00:37:52,700
You're just being too kind.

735
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,550
What's wrong with you?

736
00:37:57,470 --> 00:37:58,310
Scared?

737
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,660
Want some mercy?

738
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,330
Who's scared?

739
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:03,050
I just shouted. Why do you care?

740
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,220
We should go, then.

741
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:10,420
Whatever.

742
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,620
Don't let me see you again.

743
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:12,730
Or I'll break your legs!

744
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:15,810
Such a scary savage girl!

745
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:16,910
Let's go.

746
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,310
Come on.

747
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:19,460
You...

748
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:27,100
Help! Anybody?

749
00:38:27,950 --> 00:38:29,010
So annoying.

750
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,270
Mr. Fang told me

751
00:38:31,270 --> 00:38:32,460
Suzhou City was big and pretty.

752
00:38:32,620 --> 00:38:34,070
I've never been there before.
When we arrive,

753
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:35,590
how about we
have a meal in a restaurant first?

754
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,730
- Anybody?
- Xiaoyao,

755
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,250
- listen.
- Help!

756
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:41,900
Don't touch me!

757
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,100
What are you doing? Stay off me!

758
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:45,550
Go away!

759
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:48,050
- Get lost!
- Come on.

760
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:49,900
Help!

761
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,950
Who are you?

762
00:38:55,950 --> 00:38:56,790
Your ancestor!

763
00:38:58,550 --> 00:38:59,470
Oh, real bad guys.

764
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,380
How dare you flirt with a...

765
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:03,460
A shrew.

766
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,180
Man, don't talk nonsense!

767
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,800
Oh, another girl. It's our lucky day.

768
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,000
- Take her back.
- You have a death wish!

769
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:13,900
Boss will be pleased.

770
00:39:25,470 --> 00:39:26,420
- Just you wait.
- Don't run away.

771
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,260
I'll go get some helpers.

772
00:39:27,420 --> 00:39:28,490
You're lucky to have run away.

773
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,490
Miss, are you all right?

774
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,730
Don't pretend you care!

775
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:34,660
If Ling'er hadn't urged me to come back,

776
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:35,660
I wouldn't have helped you out.

777
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:36,990
I should have let them flirt with you

778
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:37,830
and make you writhe.

779
00:39:37,990 --> 00:39:38,860
You shrew.

780
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,790
You're so wicked

781
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:41,780
and you'll get what you deserve.

782
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,140
Ling'er, let's go.

783
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,740
Rat!

784
00:39:48,070 --> 00:39:48,940
What? Want another fight?

785
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,250
I'm going to kill you!

786
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:04,900
Xiaoyao!

787
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:24,420
You...

788
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,330
Why didn't you dodge?

789
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,700
You stabbed

790
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:31,460
fast and fiercely.

791
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,380
How could I possibly dodge?

792
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:48,810
Xiaoyao!

793
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:50,010
Xiaoyao!

794
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,500
Xiaoyao!

795
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,500
Xiaoyao!

796
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:57,740
Xiaoyao!

797
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,380
Xiaoyao, wake up!

798
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,660
Xiaoyao!

799
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,590
What do I do?

800
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:04,700
What do I do?

801
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:07,380
What am I supposed to do?

802
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,740
The Resurrection Spell.

803
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:11,310
The Resurrection Spell.

804
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:16,710
I hear there will be
a combat for marriage in a couple of days.

805
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,550
Let's go have a look.

806
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:20,290
Yeah. In Lin Fortress, Suzhou City.

807
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:26,070
What's that?

808
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,740
Snake Demon!

809
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,070
Snake Demon!

810
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,180
- Snake Demon!
- Snake Demon!

811
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,290
A Snake Demon!

812
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:37,700
- Snake Demon!
- Snake Demon!
