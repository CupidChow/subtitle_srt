=Episode 35=

3
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,600
My Lady, the young master

4
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,170
has been refusing to eat and rest.

5
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,920
If this continues,
her body might not be able to bear it.

6
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,940
Understood.

7
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,370
Leave us.

8
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:07,610
Yes.

9
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:17,450
A'nu.

10
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,890
Mother, you're here.

11
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:27,890
You can't be like this.

12
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:31,170
Apart from hurting yourself,

13
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,560
it's futile.

14
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,120
Isn't it just that
Tang Yu killed Luojiao?

15
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,380
Anyway,

16
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,120
everyone will die sooner or later.

17
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:48,920
It's just a matter of time.

18
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,090
Don't say that.

19
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:54,610
Mother,

20
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:58,970
I'm really okay.

21
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,260
It's all my fault.

22
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:03,280
No, it's not.

23
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,610
It's my fault.

24
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,890
Luojiao and Mr. Shi

25
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:10,940
died because of me.

26
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:12,460
It's my fault.

27
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,130
It was me who believed him.

28
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:14,970
It's...

29
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,690
It's me who liked him.

30
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,560
Mother.

31
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:34,690
Feelings often

32
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,610
come suddenly and strongly.

33
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,690
They are true

34
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,090
when they come.

35
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:47,610
No matter who he is,

36
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:51,280
and no matter if he has deceived you,

37
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,020
your feelings for him

38
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,970
are real.

39
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:06,410
Child,

40
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,840
liking someone

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,560
has nothing to do with right or wrong.

42
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:15,250
Even if he betrayed you before,

43
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,970
never doubt

44
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:20,480
the beautiful moments

45
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,760
in your life.

46
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,260
My Lady,

47
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,320
my life is not important.

48
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,160
Please think of the bigger picture.

49
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:55,730
A'nu,

50
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:58,170
it's you.

51
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,010
Rest assured.

52
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:09,500
I will

53
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,920
eradicate the Moon Worship Sect,

54
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,290
kill Bai Yue,

55
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,320
kill Tang Yu,

56
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,530
and avenge General Gai

57
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,010
and Mr. Shi.

58
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:19,850
Mother,

59
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,730
I will personally kill him.

60
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:37,180
(Shuimu Residence)

61
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:43,820
Xiaoyao,

62
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,890
you're back.

63
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:50,980
Madam,

64
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,640
I found the puppet bug.

65
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,440
Thank Nuwa for her blessings.

66
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,290
Sorry to worry you

67
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:01,570
a few days ago.

68
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,690
Madam, I understand your intention,

69
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,090
and I will always remember it.

70
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,040
How is Ling'er?

71
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,140
Ling'er is fine now.

72
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,210
You don't need to worry.

73
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:14,200
Thank you, Madam.

74
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,530
I'll go refine the puppet bug now.

75
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,780
Xiaoyao,

76
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,920
you saw Jiang

77
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,530
at the Demon-Locking Tower, right?

78
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,690
May Mr. Jiang rest in peace.

79
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,760
He gave me this Seven-Star Sword

80
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,920
to help me defeat the King of Prison.

81
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,010
Right.

82
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,920
When Jiang

83
00:06:56,610 --> 00:06:58,010
left the mountain,

84
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,640
he brought
this Seven-Star Sword with him.

85
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:06,360
I stood at the gate,

86
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,010
watching him gradually disappear

87
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,880
into the sea of clouds.

88
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,290
But I never thought

89
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,640
from that moment on,

90
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:29,090
I'd never see him again.

91
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,290
Now I understand.

92
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,760
We can't always dwell
on assumptions about the past.

93
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:53,730
We can't change the past.

94
00:07:54,890 --> 00:07:56,440
We can only gain strength from it

95
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,200
and move forward.

96
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:05,600
Kid, you've improved a lot.

97
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:08,100
Sir,

98
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,040
after passing through
the Rakshasa Ghost Cave,

99
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,640
I realized one thing.

100
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,890
What?

101
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,810
Death

102
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,480
is not the end,

103
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:21,760
but forgetting is.

104
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:33,290
This belongs to Mount Shu.

105
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,730
It should be returned to Mount Shu.

106
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,490
Jiang left it for you.

107
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,290
You should take it.

108
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,540
I'm getting older

109
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,610
and older.

110
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,610
It's time for me to go back.

111
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:55,570
Kid,

112
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,610
remember my words.

113
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:02,880
With a righteous heart,

114
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,120
the world is vast.

115
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:18,120
Sir, we shall meet again.

116
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,440
Xiaoyao, Xiaoyao!

117
00:12:13,050 --> 00:12:13,890
Madam.

118
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,050
Ling'er is not doing well.

119
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:21,620
Ling'er.

120
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:25,970
Why are you so cold?

121
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:27,330
Ling'er,

122
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:29,000
why are you so cold?

123
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,290
Although she is unconscious,

124
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:36,490
she is still gathering her vital qi

125
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,560
to protect the fetus in her belly,

126
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:40,850
regardless of herself.

127
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,780
Fetus?

128
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:53,370
Madam,

129
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,490
you must be kidding.

130
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,760
How could Ling'er be pregnant?

131
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,020
Ling'er is not an ordinary person.

132
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,880
She is a descendant of the Deity Clan.

133
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,370
Being pregnant is not the same for her

134
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:11,560
as it is for ordinary people.

135
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:13,090
If you didn't know,

136
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,370
it's understandable.

137
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:33,180
Ling'er,

138
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,730
why didn't you tell me?

139
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:39,800
I'm such a jerk.

140
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,440
I knew nothing.

141
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:48,490
Madam,

142
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,000
you must have a way to save Ling'er.

143
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:52,370
Tell me.

144
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,290
I'll do anything

145
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:54,320
to save her.

146
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:59,380
Only the Qilin Horn
can save her and her child.

147
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,780
Where is the Qilin Horn?

148
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,620
I'll go and find it.

149
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,640
The Qilin Horn
belongs to the divine beast, Fire Qilin.

150
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,200
It's hidden in the Fire Qilin Cave,

151
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,930
half a day's journey south
of the Rakshasa Ghost Cave.

152
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:15,330
Thank you, Madam.

153
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,780
Ling'er,

154
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,290
you wait for me here.

155
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,930
After going through hardships

156
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:36,370
and finally reuniting,

157
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,610
I won't let anything happen to you.

158
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,490
From now on, the three of us

159
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:48,440
will never be separated again.

160
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,800
Is the Fire Qilin

161
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:38,170
really hiding in this ice cellar?

162
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,000
This is the Fire Qilin?

163
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,420
Sorry.

164
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,520
I have to get the Qilin Horn.

165
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:09,780
(Mr. Qilin)

166
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,460
Old man,

167
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,130
are you alright?

168
00:18:28,050 --> 00:18:30,010
Much better now.

169
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:32,400
Old man, it's your bead.

170
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,740
It's this little bead

171
00:18:40,740 --> 00:18:43,160
that caused trouble for me.

172
00:18:51,050 --> 00:18:53,130
Thank you so much, kid.

173
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:55,490
Old man,

174
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:57,770
are you

175
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,890
the Fire Qilin

176
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,890
that I saw just now?

177
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,610
That's right. I am the Fire Qilin.

178
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:06,920
Hurry and leave.

179
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,340
This is not a place for sightseeing.

180
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:10,490
Don't disturb my sleep.

181
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,370
Mr. Qilin,

182
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,010
my wife is seriously injured,

183
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:17,850
and the fetus is unstable.

184
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,100
Both their lives are at stake.

185
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,650
Please grant me the Qilin Horn

186
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:22,040
to save my wife and child.

187
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:26,560
Where did you hear
about this secret prescription, kid?

188
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,370
It's impossible.

189
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,530
It's not that I'm stingy
and won't give it to you.

190
00:19:31,530 --> 00:19:34,280
It's just that the sacred medicine
from the divine beasts

191
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,320
is something ordinary people can't bear.

192
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,170
Hurry back

193
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:41,680
and find a good physician
in the mortal world.

194
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,250
But the Sacred Maid insisted

195
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:45,090
that only the Qilin Horn can save them.

196
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:47,610
The Sacred Maid?

197
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,370
Are you referring to the old woman

198
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,970
living in the small wooden house
in Sacred Woods?

199
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:56,130
Exactly.

200
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,650
You're quite ordinary.

201
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,250
Is your wife a deity?

202
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:11,490
My wife is a descendant of Nuwa.

203
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,040
A descendant of Nuwa?

204
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,650
The Nuwa descendants I know

205
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:17,850
are old enough

206
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,490
to be your mother.

207
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,540
Sir,

208
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,130
my wife is in her prime.

209
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,770
She is the daughter
of the Witch Queen of Nanzhao,

210
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,180
Zhao Ling'er.

211
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:30,250
Oh, so she's Qing'er's child.

212
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:34,290
I didn't know she already got married
and gave birth to a girl.

213
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:36,400
How many years have passed

214
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,680
in the outside world?

215
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,580
Sir,

216
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:46,560
may I take the Qilin Horn?

217
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,250
Take it.

218
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,850
Sir, you're so generous.

219
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:06,370
I don't know how to repay you.

220
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,290
For hundreds of years,

221
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,050
the descendants of Nuwa

222
00:21:10,050 --> 00:21:12,010
have needed this Qilin Horn
for childbirth.

223
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:13,500
I'm used to it.

224
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,400
Take it back quickly.

225
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,370
This Horn will help Ling'er
give birth smoothly

226
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,440
and help her transform

227
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,040
and recover her spiritual power.

228
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,660
Thank you, sir.

229
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:29,680
And

230
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,200
this Fire Spiritual Bead.

231
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,090
Take it as well.

232
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,370
It will be useful in the future.

233
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,580
Thank you.

234
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,090
She will be delighted
to see the Fire Spiritual Bead

235
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,200
when she wakes up.

236
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,890
You're a good boy.

237
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:48,770
Ling'er

238
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:51,130
has chosen the right guy.

239
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,850
Unfortunately,

240
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:59,130
she may not be blessed enough
to grow old with you.

241
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,440
Sir, what do you mean?

242
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:09,970
Since ancient times,

243
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:13,680
descendants of Nuwa have always ended up
sacrificing themselves for their cause.

244
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,920
You mean

245
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:19,210
Ling'er...

246
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,770
Things are not the same
as they once were.

247
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,800
Life and death are separated
by vast distances.

248
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:29,890
It's fate,

249
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,160
hard to defy.

250
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:35,660
No.

251
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,970
It can't be.

252
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:42,850
It can't be.

253
00:22:43,010 --> 00:22:44,490
I don't care about the past.

254
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,730
I won't let anything happen
to Ling'er now.

255
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:48,250
You

256
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:51,160
should still prepare yourself.

257
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,340
Sir.

258
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,780
Sir!

259
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:01,490
Sir!

260
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,610
No matter what,

261
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,610
I must save Ling'er.

262
00:23:31,130 --> 00:23:31,970
She's warmed up.

263
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:34,460
She's warmed up.

264
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:38,010
Let her rest properly.

265
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,280
With the Qilin Horn,

266
00:23:40,530 --> 00:23:43,370
she and the baby will be safe.

267
00:23:45,530 --> 00:23:46,370
Madam,

268
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:48,680
I want to stay with Ling'er.

269
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:04,540
Ling'er,

270
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,730
don't you like revolving scenic lanterns?

271
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,200
I'll make you one

272
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,650
that's even better and prettier.

273
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:23,130
It'll be ten times prettier
than the one in Yangzhou City.

274
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,560
When it lights up,

275
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,250
it's like being in a sea of stars.

276
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,800
Wake up soon.

277
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:38,130
I want to take you to see it.

278
00:24:42,010 --> 00:24:42,850
And in the future,

279
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,090
we'll live on Fairy Island.

280
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,490
I'll set up various
revolving scenic lanterns

281
00:24:54,410 --> 00:24:56,280
on the island.

282
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,890
I'll take you

283
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:05,680
and our child to see them every day.

284
00:25:08,170 --> 00:25:09,010
What do you say?

285
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:12,610
What do you say?

286
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:14,370
Is that a good idea?

287
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:25,370
Ling'er.

288
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,420
Ling'er.

289
00:25:34,770 --> 00:25:35,610
Ling'er.

290
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,540
Ling'er.

291
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:23,770
Xiaoyao,

292
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,250
your heart is troubled.

293
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:30,160
What happened

294
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:32,250
at Fire Qilin Cave?

295
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,160
Mr. Qilin said

296
00:26:37,370 --> 00:26:38,490
that since ancient times,

297
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,780
Nuwa descendants have always ended up
sacrificing themselves for their cause.

298
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,770
Is this true?

299
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,730
What do you think?

300
00:26:47,010 --> 00:26:47,850
I...

301
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,300
I don't know.

302
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,200
I've heard some things
about Ling'er's mother,

303
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,060
so I...

304
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm not sure.

305
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,560
Could Ling'er also...

306
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,100
Something came into being

307
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,490
before the universe was born.

308
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:10,130
Everything happens for a reason,

309
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,890
and the same thing happens

310
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,280
over and over again.

311
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,650
Everything

312
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,520
has its rules.

313
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,130
Why is there always injustice
and bias in this world?

314
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,980
Why is there so much to fight against?

315
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,440
Why are there so many regrets?

316
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,920
This world

317
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,560
is like a mirror.

318
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,970
What you are

319
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,730
will be reflected.

320
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,040
Why is all this so,

321
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,520
and for what purpose?

322
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,890
All beings in this world

323
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,560
were created by Nuwa.

324
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,490
You might ask her.

325
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:52,280
Nuwa?

326
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,800
You might find your answer

327
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,920
at the Temple of Nuwa.

328
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,680
Tang Yu.

329
00:29:07,410 --> 00:29:10,010
You still made the wrong choice.

330
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,700
Stop while you can.

331
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,280
Your schemes won't succeed.

332
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,610
Tang Yu,

333
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,520
every choice comes

334
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:24,920
at a cost.

335
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,680
It's been over half a month
since Chief sent us here.

336
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,800
I wonder what's so important
about guarding this old temple.

337
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,650
They say the Witch Moon Sect
might cause trouble.

338
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,970
Maybe that's why.

339
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,490
What could go wrong?

340
00:29:50,650 --> 00:29:52,130
It's been quiet these past few days.

341
00:29:54,410 --> 00:29:56,100
I suddenly need to relieve myself.

342
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,140
I'm going to step out for a moment.

343
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,010
Be careful on your own.

344
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,130
Wait, I'll go too.

345
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,850
Goddess Nuwa,

346
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,890
I, Li Xiaoyao, am helpless,

347
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:04,010
implicating my wife

348
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:06,160
and our unborn child.

349
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:08,440
I pray to you

350
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,160
for their safety.

351
00:31:24,370 --> 00:31:25,320
Goddess Nuwa

352
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:27,770
looks so much like Ling'er.

353
00:32:30,410 --> 00:32:31,770
Li Xiaoyao.

354
00:32:32,410 --> 00:32:33,280
Goddess Nuwa,

355
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,170
you know me?

356
00:32:35,170 --> 00:32:36,850
Everything

357
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,050
has its cause and effect.

358
00:32:39,050 --> 00:32:40,250
Go.

359
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,890
Where are you sending me?

360
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,780
Goddess Nuwa.

361
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,780
Goddess Nuwa.

362
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:50,850
Goddess Nuwa.

363
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:52,490
Goddess...

364
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:08,090
Who's this little rat

365
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,970
daring to attack me behind my back?

366
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,580
Sir?

367
00:33:11,650 --> 00:33:13,050
(Ten years ago)
Didn't you return to Mount Shu?

368
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:13,890
What are you doing here?

369
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,800
What are you talking about?

370
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,370
Watch the sword!

371
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,090
Kid, not bad.

372
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:26,860
Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal,
I am Li Xiaoyao.

373
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:29,040
Mr. what? Watch the sword!

374
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,090
Seven-Star Sword?

375
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,580
Sir,

376
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,040
how did you suddenly become young?

377
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:41,890
Kid, save the chit-chat.

378
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:43,130
Tell me.

379
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:45,890
Why do you have
Jiang's Seven-Star Sword?

380
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,500
Sir, is this the Temple of Nuwa
in Nanzhao?

381
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:50,860
Of course. If it's not,

382
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:51,940
do you think this is your home?

383
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:53,410
Then why are you here?

384
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:54,250
I...

385
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:55,680
Recently,

386
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:57,860
Nanzhao has been plagued by floods,

387
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:59,910
so I came here to exorcise demons
and relieve the disaster.

388
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,500
Wasn't Nanzhao suffering
from a severe drought?

389
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,490
Where did the floods come from?

390
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,420
You...

391
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,450
Sir, do you really not recognize me?

392
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:19,690
Now that you mention it,
I do recall something.

393
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:20,820
You...

394
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,800
Who exactly are you?

395
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,280
What's going on here?

396
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:28,280
I'll ask you one last time.

397
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:33,480
Where did you get
Jiang's Seven-Star Sword?

398
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,720
I am Li Xiaoyao.

399
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,560
This Seven-Star Sword
was given to me by Mr. Jiang

400
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,760
just before he vanished
in the Demon-Locking Tower.

401
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,450
Do you have any proof?

402
00:35:25,220 --> 00:35:28,090
This... Did Jiang teach you this as well?

403
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:29,170
Well...

404
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:33,930
This was taught by my master.

405
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:36,460
Kid, you're a disciple
from Mount Shu too?

406
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,850
How come I don't know you?

407
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,800
It's a long story.

408
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:43,930
I remember

409
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:46,040
I came here
after praying to Goddess Nuwa.

410
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:50,760
Could it be because of Goddess Nuwa?

411
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,500
Goddess Nuwa, please show mercy

412
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,410
and let me return.

413
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,880
Please. Why haven't I gone back yet?

414
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,500
- Goddess Nuwa...
- Silly boy, stop kowtowing.

415
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,930
- Why haven't I gone back?
- You're crazy.

416
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,280
Don't worry about me.

417
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,370
- Goddess Nuwa...
- You have the Sword, so I have to worry.

418
00:36:13,410 --> 00:36:15,930
Back then, your parents
broke into the Nanzhao Imperial Palace

419
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,410
and stole the sacred Water Spiritual Bead
from the Witch Queen.

420
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:20,760
Without the Water Spiritual Bead,

421
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:23,210
the Witch Queen
couldn't subdue the Water Demon Beast

422
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,060
and had to sacrifice herself
to suppress it.

423
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:28,320
Since then,
Nanzhao has been in drought for years.

424
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,560
Ten years ago...

425
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,280
Ten years ago.

426
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,370
I actually returned
to the world ten years ago.

427
00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:40,010
Kid,

428
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,650
based on the sword technique
you just used,

429
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,460
which was identical to mine,

430
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,760
I'll tentatively trust you.

431
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:47,480
Would you dare

432
00:36:48,170 --> 00:36:50,020
to take the Seven-Star Sword

433
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:52,210
and join me
in hunting the monster of Nanzhao?

434
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,250
Nanzhao...

435
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,100
Nanzhao!

436
00:36:58,810 --> 00:36:59,650
That was fast.

437
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,720
Kid, kid.

438
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:11,090
Kid, kid, wait for me!

439
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,480
Wait for me!

440
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:16,940
Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal,

441
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:18,170
I can't help you hunt demons right now.

442
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,570
I have more important things to do.

443
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,560
Wait, wait.

444
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,410
What did you call me just now?

445
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:23,690
Mr. Drunken Sword Immortal.

446
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,930
Drunken Sword Immortal?

447
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:28,850
Who is Drunken Sword Immortal?

448
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:32,760
A sword,

449
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:36,850
a drink, and a hermit
seeking immortality.

450
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,690
What a great name!

451
00:37:39,410 --> 00:37:40,890
From now on,
I'll call myself that way.

452
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:44,130
I never thought that I would be the one

453
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,280
to give him his name.

454
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:17,890
Chief has come out.

455
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:32,480
Great ancestor,

456
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,450
Nanzhao

457
00:38:35,090 --> 00:38:36,960
is facing calamity.

458
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:41,480
We pray for your spirit to guide us.

459
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,170
Who

460
00:38:44,410 --> 00:38:46,480
turned Nanzhao into a marshland?

461
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:47,930
Who

462
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,930
put our people through such suffering?

463
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
Save us!

464
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,210
The ancestor has appeared!

465
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:01,130
The ancestor has appeared!

466
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:05,040
Save us!

467
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,890
- The Witch Queen.
- Why is it the Witch Queen?

468
00:39:09,570 --> 00:39:10,690
How could it be her?

469
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,760
What's going on?

470
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:17,760
What's happening?

471
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:20,890
Demon!

472
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,760
The Witch Queen is a demoness!

473
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,280
A snake demon!

474
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:27,690
Demon!

475
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,320
The Witch Queen is a snake demon!

476
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,450
How could it be her?

477
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,480
Chief, save us!

478
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,930
Chief, save us!

479
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,320
Great ancestor,

480
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:45,560
when a nation faces such disasters,

481
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,170
there must be a demon behind it.

482
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,520
Who

483
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:52,800
brought us into this?

484
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:57,890
- It's the snake demon.
- It's the Witch Queen.

485
00:39:57,890 --> 00:39:59,300
- Yes, it's the Witch Queen.
- It's the snake demon.

486
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,280
- It's the snake demon.
- It's the Witch Queen.

487
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:03,370
- It's the snake demon.
- It's the Witch Queen.

488
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,000
People of Nanzhao,

489
00:40:06,330 --> 00:40:08,610
you must act quickly

490
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,450
to save Nanzhao

491
00:40:11,570 --> 00:40:13,650
and protect your homeland.

492
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,610
Today,

493
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,800
we will have the King

494
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,170
execute this demoness

495
00:40:20,410 --> 00:40:22,040
and eliminate her followers.

496
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,720
Kill the Witch Queen!

497
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,500
Cleanse the court!

498
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:31,520
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

499
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:43,040
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

500
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:55,920
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

501
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,130
(Canglan Hall)
Kill the Witch Queen!

502
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,560
This is Nanzhao's Imperial Palace.

503
00:40:58,810 --> 00:41:00,220
Are you all rebelling?

504
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,850
We want to kill the Witch Queen!

505
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,040
Mr. Shi.

506
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:06,320
All soldiers, on my command!

507
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,370
Anyone who crosses this line

508
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,410
- will be executed immediately!
- Yes!

509
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:21,570
Kill the Witch Queen! Cleanse the court!

510
00:41:21,570 --> 00:41:22,800
Mr. Shi.

511
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,060
Bai Yue.

512
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,450
Mr. Bai Yue,

513
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:28,410
why are you here?

514
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,690
The voice of the people

515
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:33,450
should be heard by the King.

516
00:41:33,780 --> 00:41:34,650
Mr. Bai Yue,

517
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,760
you are committing insubordination!

518
00:41:39,890 --> 00:41:40,890
Mr. Shi,

519
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:45,090
the current situation in Nanzhao
is precarious.

520
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:47,650
Extraordinary measures are necessary.

521
00:41:47,650 --> 00:41:50,090
Your adherence to tradition

522
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,690
overrules greater justice

523
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:54,130
and focuses on trivial matters.

524
00:41:54,130 --> 00:41:55,850
- But...
- No buts.

525
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:58,210
I will bear

526
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:00,130
all consequences.

527
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,300
Chief is wise!

528
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:10,130
Long live the Chief!

529
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:15,040
Chief is wise! Long live the Chief!

530
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,760
It seems we should not stay here long.

531
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,800
Let's think of another way.

532
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,610
