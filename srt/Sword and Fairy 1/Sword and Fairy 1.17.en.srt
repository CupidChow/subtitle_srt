2
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,170
Look, it's the phoenix fireworks!

4
00:01:54,980 --> 00:01:56,130
Shaped like a phoenix!

5
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:57,690
- The phoenix fireworks are coming this way!
- Look!

6
00:01:58,810 --> 00:01:59,770
Phoenix fireworks!

7
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,210
So beautiful.

8
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:05,810
The phoenix fireworks are flying away.

9
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:14,050
Then light it up for me.

10
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,020
It looks good there.

11
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,450
Let's go. Let's go check it out.

12
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,090
Lanterns!

13
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,900
Look, mine floated further than yours.

14
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,720
It means my wish
will come true before yours.

15
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,560
Yueru, here, this one is ready.

16
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,740
Yueru.

17
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:54,480
Lanterns!

18
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,810
Squat down.

19
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,120
Lanterns!

20
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:01,170
Make a wish.

21
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,410
Hurry.

22
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,020
Look.

23
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,810
Your wish will definitely come true too.

24
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,380
Yueru,

25
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,480
you can't drink like this. It'll get you drunk.

26
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,480
I wish I could get drunk,

27
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,950
but the more I drink,
the clearer my head gets.

28
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,680
There must be something wrong
with this wine.

29
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,360
You can't drink like this, Yueru.

30
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,940
You...

31
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,650
I'm not drunk. You don't need to hold me.

32
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:26,980
No need to hold me.

33
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,700
- Ling'er, where are you?
- Yueru, Yueru.

34
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,810
I'm here, I'm here.

35
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,760
Ling'er, why are you here?

36
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,330
Ling'er,

37
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,920
are we good friends?

38
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,850
Yes, we'll always be.

39
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,420
Ling'er,

40
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,290
promise me

41
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,160
you won't leave again.

42
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,530
Whether it's for me or for...

43
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,050
Whoever it is, right?

44
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:00,600
Yueru, I promise you

45
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:02,700
that from now on,

46
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,250
I won't leave.

47
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:07,530
No matter what happens,

48
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,530
I will stay with you all.

49
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,690
Stay with us, stay with us.

50
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,010
Ling'er is the best.

51
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:23,140
Ling'er won't make people sad or upset.

52
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,980
Yueru.

53
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,450
Yueru, actually, I...

54
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:27,290
Ling'er,

55
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,440
listen to me.

56
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,810
I'm only telling you this.

57
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:36,010
It's like

58
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,360
suddenly,

59
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:41,440
something bad appeared in my mind.

60
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,250
Really annoying.

61
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:46,210
I just wanted to shake it off, shake it,

62
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:48,530
but no matter how I shook,
it wouldn't leave.

63
00:05:49,010 --> 00:05:52,570
Sometimes, I really
get annoyed with myself.

64
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,040
But now, it's okay.

65
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:01,130
It seems like it can get out.

66
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,920
I'll shake it out.

67
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:05,610
- Out! Out!
- Yueru.

68
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,330
- Yueru!
- Out!

69
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,880
Yueru, Yueru, it's okay.

70
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:10,050
It's alright now.

71
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:11,820
It's alright.

72
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,360
Out!

73
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:18,160
It's okay, Yueru.

74
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,640
Tang Yu, send Scholar
back to the inn first.

75
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,010
Ling'er.

76
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,780
Ling'er,

77
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,760
it's not your fault.

78
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,010
She's crazy enough,

79
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:36,610
and even crazier when drunk.

80
00:06:36,610 --> 00:06:38,640
Xiaoyao, don't be like this to Yueru.

81
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:40,010
I...

82
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,530
Why am I the bad one?

83
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,440
Li Xiaoyao,

84
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,290
you're the worst.

85
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,500
That's right. That's right.

86
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:55,700
I'm the worst.

87
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:58,580
Stop!

88
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:59,850
Stop! Stop running!

89
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:02,130
Help! Catch the thief!

90
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,320
Stop! Stop running!

91
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:06,330
- Yueru!
- Catch the thief!

92
00:07:06,330 --> 00:07:07,440
- Ling'er, are you okay?
- I'm fine.

93
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,540
- Catch the thief!
- Stop running!

94
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:09,380
I'll chase her.

95
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,590
You go back to the inn with them first.

96
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
We'll meet at the inn.

97
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,010
Savage girl!

98
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,970
Still running, huh?

99
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:21,690
Here's your purse.

100
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,410
Now let me go.

101
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,730
You!

102
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,880
You can do anything,

103
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,480
but why be a thief?

104
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,200
I hate thieves the most.

105
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:32,570
Let me ask you.

106
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,380
Am I gentle?

107
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:35,380
Gentle, gentle.

108
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,220
Am I pretty?

109
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,210
Pretty, pretty.

110
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:39,770
Then why doesn't anyone like me?

111
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:40,920
Like?

112
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,730
I like you.

113
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:46,570
What?

114
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,360
You can't like me.

115
00:07:50,610 --> 00:07:52,320
You can only like her.

116
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:57,330
Miss,

117
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,600
just end it quickly for me, please.

118
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,480
- I'm begging you.
- Let me ask you.

119
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,890
Am I not nice? Say something!

120
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,020
- Savage girl!
- Why not speak?

121
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,890
Stop it.

122
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,330
Don't go.

123
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,920
- Come back!
- Thief, don't run!

124
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:13,730
You're drunk.
Let's go back and rest early.

125
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,640
I'm not drunk.

126
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,200
I'm very clear-headed.

127
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,810
I recognize you.

128
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,770
You're the thief who stole my things.

129
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:23,730
Nonsense. When have I
ever stolen your things?

130
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,490
You did steal my things.

131
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,760
Give them back to me.

132
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
Ling'er.

133
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:48,290
Yueru is okay, right?

134
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:49,850
What could happen to her?

135
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,170
- Let's go and take her back.
- She's just drunk.

136
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:58,250
Here.

137
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:07,780
What's wrong?

138
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,850
Do you think this person

139
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,640
looks a bit familiar?

140
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:14,980
Never seen him.

141
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,120
How come I feel

142
00:09:18,490 --> 00:09:19,680
I have seen him somewhere before?

143
00:09:43,050 --> 00:09:43,970
Xiaoyao.

144
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:47,170
Is the savage girl okay?

145
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,730
She's asleep now.

146
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,380
Ling'er, it's late.

147
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,560
I'll take you back to your room to rest.

148
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,820
Ling'er, you don't know how heavy she is.

149
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,000
It was so hard to carry her back.

150
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,100
Really.

151
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,370
Greetings, Your Highness.

152
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,560
You are...

153
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,800
Mr. Shi?

154
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,440
It's been ten years.

155
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,760
I didn't expect you to remember me.

156
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:01,730
Mr. Shi,

157
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:03,560
how come you are here?

158
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,290
Your Highness,

159
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,200
I'm here this time,

160
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,240
firstly, to ask you to return to Nanzhao.

161
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,530
The king misses you very much.

162
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,880
No matter what misunderstandings
occurred before,

163
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,460
I hope you can return to the King's side

164
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,090
for the sake of your kinship.

165
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:20,930
Mr. Shi,

166
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:25,490
I indeed plan to return to Nanzhao,

167
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,410
but

168
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,490
not with you.

169
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:35,240
There's another
important message for you.

170
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
It's about the Witch Queen.

171
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,420
My mother?

172
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:40,680
I have discovered

173
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,410
the Witch Queen's statue
is at Yunmeng Marsh.

174
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,260
Back then, she sacrificed herself
to suppress the Water Demon Beast,

175
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,610
turning into a stone statue.

176
00:11:48,050 --> 00:11:49,410
Afterwards, due to the floods,

177
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:51,170
her statue went missing.

178
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:54,090
For ten years,
I have visited various places

179
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:56,090
and finally found the statue.

180
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,340
This time, I came to find you,

181
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:03,610
hoping you could go with me to check.

182
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,290
If the statue is indeed the Witch Queen,

183
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,780
you might be

184
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,800
the only one who can revive her.

185
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,120
I can revive my mother?

186
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,850
There are rumors as such.

187
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,680
So, Your Highness,

188
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,290
please go with me to Yunmeng Marsh.

189
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,320
Even if I go,

190
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,820
I'll go with my friends.

191
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,660
Your Highness,

192
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:31,560
the rebels of the Moon Worship Sect
are also looking for the statue.

193
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:35,240
It's better that fewer people know about it.

194
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,530
Let me think it over.

195
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,810
Tang Yu.

196
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:13,180
Tang Yu.

197
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:16,680
What's wrong, My Lady?

198
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:19,170
What did you just call me?

199
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:20,300
My...

200
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,690
A'nu.

201
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:27,000
I'm telling you.

202
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,000
I know you have no friends.

203
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:34,530
I want to be your good friend,

204
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:38,000
your only good friend.

205
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,620
My Lady,

206
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,660
you're drunk.

207
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:46,880
Call me A'nu.

208
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:52,660
A'nu.

209
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,490
I don't care
whether you accept it or not.

210
00:13:58,490 --> 00:13:59,490
I have decided

211
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,680
I'm your only good friend,

212
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:03,690
A'nu.

213
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:20,680
I have to share this great news
with Ling'er.

214
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,640
I shall take my leave, Your Highness.

215
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,290
Ling'er, are you okay?

216
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,130
I'm fine.

217
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,560
I finally remembered
who that weird old man was.

218
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:03,050
He's Elder Shi, the leader
of the Witch King's guards.

219
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,640
Why did he come to you?

220
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:06,450
A'nu,

221
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:07,420
Tang Yu,

222
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:08,930
I have something to tell you.

223
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,140
Indeed, there are rumors

224
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,640
that the Witch Queen
is still in this world.

225
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,800
So, I want to go and see.

226
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,640
Ling'er,

227
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,050
it's been ten years
since you saw that weird old man.

228
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,970
Now, with factions
within the Nanzhao court,

229
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:34,240
it's uncertain where his loyalties lie.

230
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,200
Listening to him

231
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:37,880
might be risky.

232
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:41,130
But,

233
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:45,120
I don't want to miss
any clues about my mother.

234
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,420
Ling'er,

235
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,170
if you want to go,

236
00:15:55,730 --> 00:15:57,090
I will definitely accompany you.

237
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,780
Even if that weird old man
means you harm,

238
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,050
Tang Yu and I won't let him succeed.

239
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:04,730
Thank you, A'nu.

240
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:19,890
Who's there?

241
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:22,010
Coming.

242
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:29,450
Ling'er,

243
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,850
why haven't you rested yet?

244
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,370
So, Xiaoyao,

245
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,120
I want to go to Yunmeng Marsh to see

246
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:42,610
if my mother's statue

247
00:16:43,050 --> 00:16:44,370
is really there.

248
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,410
This Elder Shi suddenly appeared.

249
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,200
What if it's a trap?

250
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,120
Xiaoyao,

251
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:56,490
but,

252
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,320
that's the only clue

253
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,760
to my mother.

254
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,290
And I have always had a question
I want to ask my mother.

255
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,820
Ling'er,

256
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,130
if you must go,

257
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,440
I'll go with you.

258
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,090
Even to the ends of the earth,

259
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:19,650
I'll accompany you.

260
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:25,010
Thank you, Xiaoyao.

261
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:34,130
Why thank me?

262
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,800
Wherever you want to go,

263
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,850
I, Li Xiaoyao,

264
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,610
will accompany you.

265
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,700
Ling'er,

266
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,770
let me hug you.

267
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,890
Only then

268
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,970
can I truly confirm

269
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,490
you're by my side.

270
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,130
Ever since you left last time,

271
00:18:11,370 --> 00:18:12,920
I have occasionally been afraid

272
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,520
that you might disappear again

273
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,680
at any moment.

274
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,800
Xiaoyao,

275
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:31,730
I won't leave you again.

276
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:57,160
One must be careful with drinking.

277
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,920
Not listening to the sage's words
brings a headache to me right away.

278
00:19:02,370 --> 00:19:04,010
Last night, it was Tang Yu

279
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:04,850
who carried you back.

280
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,490
Thank you, Tang.

281
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:10,560
And what about me?

282
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,740
With your valor,

283
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,970
of course,
you walked back on your own.

284
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,820
Of course.

285
00:19:16,820 --> 00:19:18,370
I always behave when I'm drunk,

286
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,370
never causing trouble.

287
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,850
Come on, Yueru, have some porridge.

288
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,440
I'm done. Let's go.

289
00:19:27,530 --> 00:19:28,800
What are you rushing off to do?

290
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,620
Today is the Dragon Boat Festival.

291
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,980
I heard it's very lively outside.

292
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:33,700
Tang Yu and I will wander around all day.

293
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,570
We're not leaving
until tomorrow morning anyway. Bye.

294
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,050
I also have important things to do,

295
00:19:41,050 --> 00:19:43,280
unlike some people
who just roam around all day.

296
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:46,520
You're all leaving? Where to?

297
00:19:47,290 --> 00:19:48,130
I won't tell you.

298
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,520
Don't flatter yourself.
I'm not following you.

299
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,250
Then why ask?

300
00:19:54,130 --> 00:19:55,200
Of course, I have to ask,

301
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:57,250
so I don't run into you
and get dragged into trouble.

302
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,890
Yueru,

303
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:03,040
we suddenly learned
of my mother's news yesterday,

304
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,980
so we're going to investigate.

305
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,490
If you can really find your mother,
that would be wonderful.

306
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,730
Ling'er, let's go.

307
00:20:12,050 --> 00:20:13,440
Let's pack our things in the room.

308
00:20:15,010 --> 00:20:15,850
Goodbye.

309
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,060
Let's go.

310
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,250
When do we leave tomorrow?

311
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,620
Once Mr. Shi has prepared the boats,

312
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,730
we can depart.

313
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,170
I just went out for a look.

314
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,770
Today, Yangzhou City is very lively.

315
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,010
Let's enjoy ourselves today.

316
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:51,250
Okay, I'll listen to you.

317
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,520
Then I'll wait for you
in the lobby after packing.

318
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,200
Okay, I'll go in.

319
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:31,490
Greetings, Your Highness.

320
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,520
Mr. Shi.

321
00:21:36,050 --> 00:21:37,650
Mr. Shi, why are you here?

322
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,850
Your Highness,

323
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,130
who was that just now?

324
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:43,040
He's Xiaoyao.

325
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,320
When we were on the Fairy Island,

326
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,340
he saved me and Grandma

327
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,010
and said he would go with us
to Yunmeng Marsh.

328
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:53,010
Is his father named Li Sansi?

329
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,370
Exactly.

330
00:21:56,770 --> 00:21:58,490
Mr. Shi, do you know him?

331
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,010
He cannot go with us.

332
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:06,890
Why?

333
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,610
Xiaoyao is not only my savior,

334
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:12,340
but I also promised him before...

335
00:22:12,340 --> 00:22:13,180
Your Highness,

336
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,800
Li Xiaoyao's parents

337
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,680
are great sinners of Nanzhao.

338
00:22:19,940 --> 00:22:20,780
Sinners?

339
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,770
How could that be?

340
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,370
Ten years ago, Li Sansi and his wife

341
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,890
sneaked into the Nanzhao Imperial Palace

342
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,370
and stole the Witch Queen's
Water Spiritual Bead,

343
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,920
so the Witch Queen

344
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:35,400
lacked the power to suppress
the Water Demon Beast causing the flood.

345
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,890
In the end,

346
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:39,370
she had to perish along with it.

347
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:47,130
Later, they were poisoned
by the Shadowless Poison,

348
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:50,090
fled Nanzhao, and soon died violently.

349
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:08,890
That's impossible.

350
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,090
Impossible.

351
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:14,730
How could this be?

352
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,970
How could this be?

353
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,060
Your Highness,

354
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,890
this is widely known in Nanzhao.

355
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,770
What I have said
contains not a single lie.

356
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:38,540
Ling'er.

357
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:42,180
Your Highness,

358
00:23:42,370 --> 00:23:44,280
Li Xiaoyao is the son of sinners.

359
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,860
Our people will never allow Li Xiaoyao

360
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,490
to enter Nanzhao.

361
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,280
If he appears in Nanzhao,

362
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,730
someone will certainly
kill him immediately.

363
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,490
Ling'er,

364
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:05,730
are you done?

365
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:10,730
Your Highness.

366
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,180
Ling'er.

367
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,210
Ling'er.

368
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,130
Cut ties if necessary.
If you find it difficult,

369
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:17,970
let me do it.

370
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,010
Are you ready?

371
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:22,130
It's very lively outside today.

372
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:26,650
Xiaoyao.

373
00:24:29,530 --> 00:24:31,040
- That's...
- Xiaoyao,

374
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:32,560
let's go now.

375
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,770
That must be Elder Shi, right?

376
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,340
Ling'er, why the rush?

377
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,770
- Li.
- Scholar.

378
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,680
Shall we also take a walk outside?

379
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:52,200
Which direction did they go just now?

380
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,010
Probably east.

381
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:55,890
Then I'll go west.

382
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,650
Yueru, I'll come with you.

383
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:02,280
What did you say is fun in Yangzhou?

384
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:13,210
Tang Yu.

385
00:25:13,370 --> 00:25:14,440
Tang Yu, look.

386
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,970
There's a weak aura of Spiritual Beads
in the southwest direction.

387
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:18,650
But the light is so faint.

388
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:19,890
It means it's still very...

389
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,280
Tang Yu,

390
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,560
you smiled.

391
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:32,300
A'nu,

392
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:34,060
I have decided.

393
00:25:34,370 --> 00:25:35,210
From now on,

394
00:25:36,770 --> 00:25:38,440
you are my only good friend.

395
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:55,820
No, wait,

396
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,290
you just said "from now on".

397
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,340
What about before?

398
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,440
Did you have good friends before?

399
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,540
Yes.

400
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,130
Who?

401
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,130
Do I know them?

402
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,660
No.

403
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,010
Was that person important to you?

404
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,320
Used to be very important.

405
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,560
But from now on,

406
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,560
not anymore.

407
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,700
Tell me.

408
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,010
Who was that person?

409
00:26:33,860 --> 00:26:35,040
Five Color Woven Bracelet!

410
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,940
Sir, would you like to buy
two Five Color Woven Bracelets?

411
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,780
Ling'er.

412
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:40,460
Come take a look.

413
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,130
These are Five Color Woven Bracelets.

414
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:43,620
It's the Dragon Boat Festival now

415
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,570
when the pure yang energy
of heaven and earth is at its peak.

416
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:48,050
Wearing these bracelets

417
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:50,410
can attract good fortune and ward off evil,
bringing blessings.

418
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:51,250
Two, please.

419
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,090
Alright.

420
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:53,490
Here you go.

421
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,290
Thank you. Take care.

422
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,130
Let's go.

423
00:26:56,410 --> 00:26:57,610
Five Color Woven Bracelet!

424
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,280
Look at these Five Color Woven Bracelets!

425
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,730
Five Color Woven Bracelet!

426
00:27:10,010 --> 00:27:11,010
Sir, have a look.

427
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:32,970
I hope the Five Color Woven Bracelet

428
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:34,650
can help Ling'er

429
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,200
ward off evil spirits

430
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,800
and make her happy,

431
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,440
casting all worries away.

432
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:44,770
Xiaoyao,

433
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,650
I also hope

434
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,650
that you can live a happy

435
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,320
and peaceful life

436
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,730
and soon become

437
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:01,200
a renowned hero.

438
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:09,890
Ling'er,

439
00:28:11,530 --> 00:28:12,370
before,

440
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:15,130
I always wanted to be a hero,

441
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,090
but now,

442
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:21,890
I'd rather be your Xiaoyao.

443
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,660
Yueru.

444
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,610
Yueru, where are you going?

445
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,560
I'm shopping,

446
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:47,010
just walking around and looking.

447
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,860
This doesn't look like shopping.

448
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,440
It looks more like
you're rushing somewhere.

449
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,770
Not at all. Yangzhou City is so big.

450
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,890
If you don't walk fast,
how can you see everything?

451
00:28:56,290 --> 00:28:57,890
You're just skimming,

452
00:28:57,890 --> 00:28:59,400
so you can't see anything at all.

453
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:01,970
Look,

454
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,250
there's a performance over there.

455
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:04,800
I'm going to check it out now.

456
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:08,620
If it weren't for me stopping you,

457
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,850
you would have already walked past it.

458
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,490
Bravo!

459
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,770
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

460
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:13,610
Excuse me. Pardon me.

461
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,340
Excuse me.

462
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,780
Bravo!

463
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,630
Thank you, thank you.

464
00:29:17,980 --> 00:29:20,090
Bravo!

465
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:22,010
Bravo!

466
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:23,250
Bravo!

467
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:25,130
Bravo!

468
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,340
Very good!

469
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:28,320
Bravo!

470
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,580
Bravo!

471
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,130
Bravo!

472
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:38,610
Bravo!

473
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,610
This way! This way!

474
00:29:42,770 --> 00:29:43,850
Yueru, look, look.

475
00:29:44,010 --> 00:29:44,850
They're about

476
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:45,920
to start the show.

477
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:50,050
Bravo! Bravo!

478
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:50,890
Jinyuan,

479
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:52,580
I don't want to watch anymore. Let's go.

480
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,420
Bravo!

481
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,540
Bravo!

482
00:30:06,250 --> 00:30:09,130
Do you think the "Legend of the White Snake"
is that interesting?

483
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,890
Why do these people watch it
over and over again?

484
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,500
Right. I have seen it

485
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,610
like ten or twenty times.

486
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,130
The white snake demon

487
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,220
transforms into a lady

488
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:18,940
and marries Xu Xian
to repay the debt of gratitude.

489
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,580
But it ends tragically.

490
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,010
What a great and touching story.

491
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:22,850
But,

492
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:24,680
the white snake really seems pitiful.

493
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,560
I don't see it that way.

494
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,650
I think Xu Xian is the pitiful one.

495
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,460
He could have lived

496
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:31,560
a normal life,

497
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:33,850
but ended up
with his family destroyed by a snake,

498
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:36,010
disenchanted with the world,

499
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:37,370
and became a monk in the end.

500
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:38,370
Who's more pitiful?

501
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,890
The white snake isn't bad either.

502
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:53,770
Right.

503
00:30:53,770 --> 00:30:55,280
She's a good demon.

504
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,090
Humans and demons have different paths.

505
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,920
Honey!

506
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,890
Honey!

507
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:06,730
Honey!

508
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,340
Ling'er,

509
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:15,210
why are you crying?

510
00:31:16,050 --> 00:31:17,290
This play is all fictional.

511
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,160
Don't take it seriously.

512
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:20,130
But some things

513
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,490
are real.

514
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,650
They're just stories,
not to be taken seriously.

515
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,300
Right.

516
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:35,130
Right.

517
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,520
Ling'er, stop crying.

518
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,800
It's not a good play. Forget it.

519
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,650
Let's go. There are
revolving scenic lanterns over there.

520
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,710
I'll take you to watch it.

521
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,060
Xiaoyao,

522
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,400
let's go back.

523
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,480
Rice wine, yellow wine! We have it all!

524
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,890
- Jinyuan.
- Come take a look.

525
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,440
I want to go back.

526
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,730
Back where?

527
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,730
Back to the inn.

528
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:12,400
Alright, I'll go with you.

529
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,540
No,

530
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,680
I want to go home.

531
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,970
To Suzhou City?

532
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,920
I haven't been back
to Lin Fortress for too long.

533
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,520
My dad must be worried.

534
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,520

where should I go?

Don't worry. Don't rush.

I know you have been upset

I understand.

But you also need to understand

00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:04,730
love must be voluntary.

Legend has it
that under Qingcheng Mountain,

592
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:21,550
there was a white snake
that had cultivated for a thousand years,

593
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,930
named Bai Suzhen.

594
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,260
Because she once received kindness
from Xu Xian,

595
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:29,370
she transformed into a beautiful woman

596
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:30,930
to repay him.

597
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,480
Together, they visited the West Lake,

598
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,850
shared a boat in the rain,

599
00:35:35,090 --> 00:35:37,760
and fell in love at first sight,
eventually becoming a couple.

600
00:35:39,810 --> 00:35:42,000
However, Fahai interfered.

601
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,130
Bai Suzhen revealed her true form
on the Dragon Boat Festival,

602
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,130
stole the immortal grass to save her lover,
and Jinshan Temple was flooded.

603
00:35:50,330 --> 00:35:53,410
In the end, she was suppressed
under the Leifeng Pagoda,

604
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,690
while Xu Xian

605
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,000
guarded the Leifeng Pagoda day and night.

606
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:02,000
His sincere love moved heaven and earth.

607
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,340
Later,

608
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:05,650
by the grace of heaven,

609
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:07,370
the Leifeng Pagoda collapsed,

610
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,960
and they were reunited,

611
00:36:11,270 --> 00:36:12,800
spending the rest of their lives together.

612
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:16,730
Ling'er,

613
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,930
we didn't see the revolving scenic lantern
during the day,

614
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,560
so I specifically borrowed this to tell you

615
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,100
the "Legend of the White Snake"
we watched during the day was incorrect.

616
00:36:24,410 --> 00:36:26,000
This is the true "Legend of the White Snake".

617
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:29,370
Whether human or demon,

618
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:32,370
as long as there is true love,
it can move heaven and earth.

619
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:36,760
Xiaoyao.

620
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,320
Efforts lead to outcomes.

621
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:45,560
Different choices

622
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:47,240
lead to different endings.

623
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:50,210
Ling'er,

624
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,170
I know that along the way,

625
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:55,130
you have had many worries

626
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,800
and many concerns.

627
00:36:57,330 --> 00:36:58,610
You fear becoming a burden to me.

628
00:36:58,810 --> 00:37:00,170
That's why you always choose

629
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,690
to bear everything alone silently.

630
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:06,690
But I have something

631
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,370
I want to tell you.

632
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,240
Xiaoyao, don't say it.

633
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,450
Let me finish.

634
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,060
Ling'er,

635
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,040
what I want to say is,

636
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,100
from now on,

637
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,560
you shouldn't bear
everything alone anymore.

638
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,540
In the future,

639
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,090
we might face many hardships,

640
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,890
but I believe,

641
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,520
like the story
in this revolving scenic lantern,

642
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,930
although the journey
may have twists and turns,

643
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,280
the ending

644
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:08,800

00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,280
Everything will turn out the best.

646
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:04,760
Xiaoyao,

647
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:08,720
no matter what happens in the future,

648
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,370
let's not be apart anymore,

649
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:14,300
okay?

650
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:15,730
Okay.

651
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,450
We will always be together.

652
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,540
Your Highness.

653
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
Mr. Shi.

654
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:32,060
Your Highness,

655
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:33,520
cut ties when necessary.

656
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:36,970
Li Xiaoyao,

657
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,320
you and the Princess cannot be together.

658
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:40,970
What?

659
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,210
You old fool,
what nonsense are you spouting?

660
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,890
Mr. Shi, please don't say it anymore.

661
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:47,210
Your Highness,

662
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,040
it's better to end the pain quickly.

663
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,210
He's going to find out the truth
sooner or later.

664
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,000
What truth?

665
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,370
Ling'er, what's going on?

666
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,620
Li Xiaoyao,

667
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,610
you and the Princess
can never be together,

668
00:40:00,260 --> 00:40:02,720
because your parents
are sinners of Nanzhao.

669
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,820
Nanzhao?

670
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:08,410
Were my parents really in Nanzhao?

671
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:10,980
Years ago, your parents broke
into the Nanzhao Imperial Palace

672
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:13,610
and stole the Water Spiritual Bead
from the Witch Queen.

673
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:17,170
At that time, the Water Demon Beast
caused havoc in Nanzhao,

674
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:19,020
and without the Water Spiritual Bead,

675
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:20,790
the Witch Queen couldn't subdue
the Water Demon Beast

676
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:24,130
and had to sacrifice herself
to suppress it.

677
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:27,340
All of this

678
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,690
started because of your parents.

679
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:34,040
Your parents
are Nanzhao's greatest sinners!

680
00:40:36,090 --> 00:40:36,960
This can't be.

681
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,100
This can't be.

682
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,850
You just want to separate me and Ling'er.

683
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,060
Ling'er,

684
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,570
he's talking nonsense.

685
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:46,930
Don't believe a word he says.

686
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:49,760
A thief's son

687
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,800
is not worthy of being with the Princess.

688
00:40:52,570 --> 00:40:53,410
You!

689
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,280
You slander my parents like this.
I'll kill you.

690
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,580
Mr. Shi!

691
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,140
Xiaoyao!

692
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:02,900
Xiaoyao!

693
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:05,170
Thankfully, heaven sees the truth.

694
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:07,800
In the end,
evil people will get their retribution.

695
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:10,960
No.

696
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,040
No, you're lying to me.

697
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:14,140
Lying to you?

698
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,410
Do I need to lie to a kid?

699
00:41:18,570 --> 00:41:21,090
This is well known in Nanzhao.

700
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,720
Someone said
my parents died in Nanzhao.

701
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:25,930
Is that also true?

702
00:41:26,130 --> 00:41:26,970
They

703
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:28,800
got what they deserved.

704
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:31,970
No.

705
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,450
This all can't be true.

706
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,170
You're lying to me.

707
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:39,560
You're all lying to me.
