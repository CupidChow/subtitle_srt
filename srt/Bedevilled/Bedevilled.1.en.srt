1
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:35,362
The story of the week.

2
00:00:35,445 --> 00:00:36,154
Oh...

3
00:00:36,238 --> 00:00:38,657
Here it goes

4
00:00:41,743 --> 00:00:46,665
5 years ago, when I was 21...

5
00:00:46,748 --> 00:00:52,587
Becoming a vegetarian was a major trend.

6
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:57,801
So I went on a vegetarian
camp for four days.

7
00:00:57,884 --> 00:01:01,388
As soon as we arrived, we took a walk.

8
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:06,101
The guide pointed to a clover and said...

9
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:11,022
'We can eat this' and ate it.

10
00:01:11,064 --> 00:01:15,402
Then a few people tried it.

11
00:01:15,485 --> 00:01:18,822
It tasted strange and bitter...

12
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:22,200
But we thought it was a good experience...

13
00:01:22,284 --> 00:01:25,412
But they wouldn't give us any food.

14
00:01:25,495 --> 00:01:28,707
When we asked at night
why there's no food...

15
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,126
He said, "Didn't you eat
the plants during the walk?"

16
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:36,548
- Who? Who?
- What!

17
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,551
The darn guide said!

18
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,845
"Didn't you eat the grass on our walk?"

19
00:01:50,228 --> 00:01:51,728
Let go!

20
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:59,029
Co-producer Seok-bin JANG.

21
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,867
Help me!

22
00:02:06,036 --> 00:02:07,954
BEDEVILLED

23
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:09,664
How many times did I tell you?

24
00:02:09,748 --> 00:02:12,667
Low-income families can get up to $30,000.

25
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:15,879
But you have no income,
so the maximum is $20,000.

26
00:02:15,962 --> 00:02:19,049
But you said I could I already moved.

27
00:02:19,132 --> 00:02:21,968
That was the maximum.

28
00:02:22,052 --> 00:02:25,263
Anyway, we can't lend you $30,000
so borrow it from someone.

29
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:27,766
If I could, why would I ask for a loan?

30
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,184
Then move to a different place.

31
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:34,689
But I paid the deposit
and moved my stuff in!

32
00:02:34,773 --> 00:02:37,609
So, try borrowing from someone else.

33
00:02:37,651 --> 00:02:40,612
Who'd lend money to a single, old woman!

34
00:02:40,654 --> 00:02:43,782
You should've made sure
before signing the lease.

35
00:02:43,865 --> 00:02:46,326
But you said I could have the money!

36
00:02:46,368 --> 00:02:48,078
I never said that!

37
00:02:52,874 --> 00:02:54,374
Ma'am.

38
00:03:00,173 --> 00:03:03,301
Hello? Stop calling, please

39
00:03:09,182 --> 00:03:12,727
I'll be out for a sec.
If the manager asks for me...

40
00:03:13,395 --> 00:03:15,855
Please leave now, ma'am.

41
00:03:15,897 --> 00:03:17,732
Next Counter Please.

42
00:03:23,905 --> 00:03:25,532
I'm working.

43
00:03:25,615 --> 00:03:30,245
Sorry, but you're always so busy.

44
00:03:30,328 --> 00:03:33,540
And you never write back.
Can't you come for a visit?

45
00:03:33,623 --> 00:03:35,123
I got to go.

46
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:43,258
They can't see me for sure?

47
00:03:44,134 --> 00:03:47,345
Of course Strictly confidential.

48
00:03:48,847 --> 00:03:51,975
They look about right.

49
00:03:52,642 --> 00:03:54,185
You're right...

50
00:03:54,936 --> 00:03:56,062
Excuse me?

51
00:03:56,146 --> 00:04:00,567
The victim's friends saw them
bothering her at a nightclub.

52
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:02,859
Isn't that all you need?

53
00:04:03,862 --> 00:04:07,574
But they didn't witness the assault.
That's why we need your statement.

54
00:04:07,657 --> 00:04:10,994
But, I didn't get a good
look at their faces...

55
00:04:13,371 --> 00:04:15,081
Just try to remember.

56
00:04:15,165 --> 00:04:17,375
It's them, but we have no proof.

57
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,959
Sergeant Choi!

58
00:04:21,046 --> 00:04:22,546
Sorry, ma'am.

59
00:04:25,383 --> 00:04:27,218
- He doesn't have the ring.
- A ring?

60
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:32,724
Yes. One of them had
a ring with a skull on it.

61
00:04:36,269 --> 00:04:38,897
The doctor said it
looked like a ring, too.

62
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:42,817
But it's hard to tell the shape
on multiple wounds.

63
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:43,902
Don't contact me anymore.

64
00:04:43,985 --> 00:04:46,613
- But if you remember...
- Then I'll call you.

65
00:04:46,696 --> 00:04:48,196
But unlikely!

66
00:05:10,428 --> 00:05:15,433
You bastards! Why won't you admit it!
You did it!

67
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:20,647
I'll kill all you bastards!

68
00:05:22,023 --> 00:05:23,358
- Please tell me everything!
- Please!

69
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:24,941
You said you saw them...

70
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:31,283
Please tell me everything! You saw them!

71
00:05:33,034 --> 00:05:38,373
You saw them! Please, say what happened!

72
00:05:38,456 --> 00:05:42,294
You saw them! Please!

73
00:05:57,767 --> 00:06:02,689
Let's not meet again.
I got real scary buddies...

74
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:05,692
Fucking up a bitch is nothing.

75
00:06:17,787 --> 00:06:20,498
- Did they say anything to you?
- No.

76
00:06:21,166 --> 00:06:23,209
Would you like to go inside and talk?

77
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:26,294
No.

78
00:06:47,317 --> 00:06:49,736
- You're back.
- She's still here?

79
00:06:49,819 --> 00:06:54,950
Everything's set.
Have your landlord sign this.

80
00:06:55,033 --> 00:07:04,376
Thank you very much! Thank you so much.
Thank you!

81
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:06,044
What happened?

82
00:07:06,127 --> 00:07:10,048
- What did you tell the manager?
- I didn't say anything about you.

83
00:07:11,633 --> 00:07:14,177
Ji-soo, you talk as if I made a mistake.

84
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:17,847
Of course not I just felt so bad for her.

85
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:23,478
Are you close with the manager?
Or close with all your male superiors?

86
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:25,772
Be careful!

87
00:07:25,855 --> 00:07:30,360
There's a limit to how far a flirt can
go in the financial world.

88
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:47,586
Ji-soo...

89
00:07:50,088 --> 00:07:53,425
I'm really sorry. A drink tonight?

90
00:07:59,973 --> 00:08:02,517
Ok, let's make up. Where to?

91
00:08:16,615 --> 00:08:18,115
Hello?

92
00:08:19,326 --> 00:08:20,826
Hello!

93
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,260
How about...

94
00:09:36,403 --> 00:09:37,903
Ms Chung!

95
00:09:39,573 --> 00:09:41,073
Get out!

96
00:09:45,495 --> 00:09:46,997
Take a vacation.

97
00:10:06,099 --> 00:10:07,599
Who is it?

98
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:14,941
- Who is it?
- The superintendent.

99
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,155
- I don't recognize your voice.
- I'm a superintendent.

100
00:10:23,617 --> 00:10:24,659
What is it?

101
00:10:24,743 --> 00:10:28,455
Your mailbox is way overloaded.

102
00:11:03,073 --> 00:11:04,616
On vacation.

103
00:11:32,394 --> 00:11:37,023
Up until 10 years ago,
boats went in twice a day.

104
00:11:37,107 --> 00:11:40,443
Now there are only 9 people left.

105
00:11:40,485 --> 00:11:44,030
Who are you visiting on Moo-do Island?

106
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:51,121
My grandfather used to live there.

107
00:11:52,122 --> 00:11:56,459
- What was his name?
- Suk-hwan KIM.

108
00:11:57,127 --> 00:12:02,048
I knew it! You're Hae-won, right?
I thought it was you!

109
00:12:02,132 --> 00:12:06,052
Remember me? Of course you don't.

110
00:12:06,136 --> 00:12:11,057
You were so pretty back then...
Still damn pretty!

111
00:12:11,141 --> 00:12:13,351
You married?

112
00:12:15,729 --> 00:12:19,065
Of course you are! I'm not.

113
00:13:19,793 --> 00:13:21,336
Hurry! Hurry!

114
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:30,762
- You're Hae-won, right?
- Yes.

115
00:13:30,804 --> 00:13:32,138
Really Hae-won?

116
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:35,850
Don't touch her with those dirty hands.

117
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:37,809
Sorry.

118
00:13:38,728 --> 00:13:42,649
- You're really Hae-won, right?
- Yes, I'm really Hae-won.

119
00:13:43,942 --> 00:13:46,444
It's you! Hae-won!

120
00:13:47,654 --> 00:13:49,155
Well, I'm off.

121
00:13:57,330 --> 00:13:59,291
She's here.

122
00:13:59,332 --> 00:14:02,168
Who? Kim's granddaughter?

123
00:14:02,252 --> 00:14:03,752
You're Hae-won?

124
00:14:05,255 --> 00:14:10,260
It's you alright. You haven't changed a bit.

125
00:14:10,343 --> 00:14:11,386
Remember us?

126
00:14:11,469 --> 00:14:16,891
So pretty and white. Is it from drinking
Seoul's water?

127
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:19,895
- That's right.
- Of course.

128
00:14:20,645 --> 00:14:24,316
That's my hubby. Remember? Man-jong.

129
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:28,695
That's his brother, Chul-jong
Man-jong and Chul-jong.

130
00:14:28,778 --> 00:14:34,200
Oh please. Don't call them
by their names like that.

131
00:14:34,784 --> 00:14:38,496
Why'd you come here on vacation?
There's nothing here...

132
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:42,709
City folks like to come for...

133
00:14:42,792 --> 00:14:46,630
fresh. Air and water on vacations.

134
00:14:46,713 --> 00:14:48,632
This is no tourist attraction!

135
00:14:50,592 --> 00:14:53,511
- When are you going back?
- I'm staying for about a week.

136
00:14:53,595 --> 00:14:56,222
You'll change your mind in a day.

137
00:14:56,306 --> 00:14:59,643
Back to work. If it rains,
the potatoes will rot.

138
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:03,230
Aren't you coming?

139
00:15:04,314 --> 00:15:06,316
Bok-Nam, come and help out.

140
00:15:07,317 --> 00:15:09,736
After I take Hae-won to her house.

141
00:15:11,821 --> 00:15:14,741
What's Chul-jong and that
old man chewing on?

142
00:15:15,325 --> 00:15:16,534
Don't know?

143
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:21,873
It's called bozo leaf because you
become a bozo chewing on it.

144
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:51,276
Here.

145
00:15:52,445 --> 00:15:53,945
It's hot, isn't it?

146
00:15:57,450 --> 00:16:01,413
Remember? We wrote that there.

147
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,292
Your grandpa got mad like hell.

148
00:16:05,959 --> 00:16:07,459
Mama?

149
00:16:10,463 --> 00:16:14,009
Go on. Say hello to mama's friend.

150
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:17,304
Come here. What's your name?

151
00:16:25,186 --> 00:16:29,316
Yeon-hee don't know
how to act around others.

152
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:30,899
What grade is she in?

153
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,322
She's 10, but she doesn't go to school.

154
00:16:36,406 --> 00:16:38,909
I want to send her.

155
00:16:39,993 --> 00:16:44,539
But Man-jong and his aunt don't think
girls need schooling.

156
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:50,921
Said, if she gets educated,
she'll run away from us.

157
00:16:52,923 --> 00:16:55,342
Who doesn't send kids to elementary
school these days?

158
00:16:55,425 --> 00:16:57,344
They even send kids to study
abroad in kindergarten.

159
00:16:57,427 --> 00:16:58,927
Really?

160
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:02,974
I hope I can send her to school next year.

161
00:17:04,517 --> 00:17:09,981
She goes to the school
to read books these days.

162
00:17:10,815 --> 00:17:13,860
So I was wondering...

163
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:16,363
It's been 15 years since
grandpa passed away.

164
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:19,449
How's this place so clean?

165
00:17:22,244 --> 00:17:24,579
Take a guess

166
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:31,378
I spent three whole days
cleaning this place.

167
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:36,800
Thanks you were saying?

168
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:38,967
Huh?

169
00:17:38,969 --> 00:17:42,097
You were going to say
something about Yeon-hee?

170
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,183
It's nothing. You just got here.

171
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:49,813
You must be starving I'll go get some food.

172
00:18:33,899 --> 00:18:35,942
I'm going night fishing with Yeon-hee.

173
00:18:36,026 --> 00:18:38,236
- Really?
- Yup.

174
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:40,655
You always come back empty-handed.

175
00:18:44,743 --> 00:18:47,454
You love going fishing with papa?

176
00:20:13,832 --> 00:20:17,669
- Lazy-head not sleeping?
- You're back?

177
00:20:19,838 --> 00:20:23,258
Was it fun? Did you catch anything?

178
00:20:38,648 --> 00:20:42,360
How can an islander be so bad at fishing?

179
00:20:42,444 --> 00:20:45,155
You caught no fish for over 2 weeks.

180
00:20:45,238 --> 00:20:49,284
Why, so you can pig out if I do catch them?

181
00:20:49,367 --> 00:20:54,372
Not only me Yeon-hee, you,
and that brother of yours.

182
00:21:03,381 --> 00:21:07,719
Didn't I tell you to show respect
talking about me and my family?

183
00:21:08,887 --> 00:21:14,809
Even dogs and pigs learn
if they get beaten. Why not you!

184
00:21:37,290 --> 00:21:40,126
You a dog? Don't eat on the floor.

185
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,879
This is why you need a man around.

186
00:22:25,463 --> 00:22:28,383
Even a dozen women. Can't do that.

187
00:22:28,466 --> 00:22:30,385
Damn right.

188
00:22:30,468 --> 00:22:35,181
Nephew? Can you fix our shed after this?

189
00:22:35,265 --> 00:22:36,182
Sure.

190
00:22:36,266 --> 00:22:40,103
- How about our door?
- Sure.

191
00:22:40,145 --> 00:22:42,105
Do it yourself.

192
00:22:42,147 --> 00:22:46,276
My nephew's dying doing all the work.

193
00:22:46,359 --> 00:22:47,402
Damn right.

194
00:22:47,485 --> 00:22:51,698
He can't die. Without him, we're all dead.

195
00:22:51,781 --> 00:22:53,281
Damn right!

196
00:23:00,081 --> 00:23:01,581
What you doing?

197
00:23:02,375 --> 00:23:05,420
Don't just sit there. Make some noodles.

198
00:23:05,503 --> 00:23:08,340
- Yes, ma'am.
- Finish that up, first.

199
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:09,716
Yes, ma'am.

200
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:12,719
Let her rest, she must be tired.

201
00:23:12,802 --> 00:23:16,014
It's nothing compared to men's work.

202
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:19,309
What's Kim's granddaughter up to?

203
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:21,436
Still sleeping!

204
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:25,023
Damn woman still in bed in broad daylight.

205
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:29,527
Seoul life must be really hard.

206
00:23:29,611 --> 00:23:33,156
A woman's most happy
with a dick in her mouth.

207
00:23:33,198 --> 00:23:37,744
Still not married and taking vacation?
Stupid little girl.

208
00:23:37,827 --> 00:23:42,165
There's lots of women in Seoul
who aren't married.

209
00:23:42,207 --> 00:23:43,707
So?

210
00:23:44,417 --> 00:23:47,754
You've been yapping about
Seoul a lot these days.

211
00:23:54,928 --> 00:23:58,056
- It's so good.
- Here, have some more.

212
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:03,061
All this trouble for me I'll cook for
myself now.

213
00:24:03,144 --> 00:24:05,480
It's no trouble.

214
00:24:06,856 --> 00:24:10,569
Want to go and take a bath in the pond?

215
00:24:10,652 --> 00:24:12,152
The pond?

216
00:24:12,654 --> 00:24:16,783
Remember where we used to go when we
were little?

217
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,786
No one will look.

218
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:23,290
People here all sleep after sundown.

219
00:24:23,873 --> 00:24:27,210
I'll go first to do some laundry. Hurry up.

220
00:24:27,961 --> 00:24:31,089
- Give me your laundry, too.
- It's okay I'll do it...

221
00:24:32,591 --> 00:24:34,091
With these hands?

222
00:24:37,971 --> 00:24:39,514
No laundry rooms here, right?

223
00:24:41,266 --> 00:24:44,102
Seoul people do laundry in rooms?

224
00:24:45,186 --> 00:24:46,813
How strange!

225
00:25:17,636 --> 00:25:19,136
Bok-Nam!

226
00:25:23,141 --> 00:25:25,143
This island has a lot of fresh water.

227
00:25:25,936 --> 00:25:28,939
We even had rice farms in the past.

228
00:25:48,250 --> 00:25:51,878
So clean and white.

229
00:25:53,171 --> 00:25:57,884
So smooth and slippery.

230
00:26:03,348 --> 00:26:08,979
Remember we used to bathe here at
nights when we were kids?

231
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:12,107
Yeah, the water was nice and cool.

232
00:26:17,779 --> 00:26:19,279
What are you doing!

233
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:24,536
Oh, come on. It's just me.

234
00:26:25,287 --> 00:26:26,913
Just scared me, that's all.

235
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:29,790
About what?

236
00:26:32,210 --> 00:26:33,710
Nothing.

237
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:41,720
Bet you got men lined up like flies on
a corpse, huh?

238
00:27:34,064 --> 00:27:38,985
Phones should work since they set
a base station or something up there.

239
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:39,986
But who knows?

240
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:44,991
The only phone here is
the one at Auntie's house.

241
00:29:10,368 --> 00:29:11,870
What are you doing, Uncle?

242
00:29:18,668 --> 00:29:20,378
You like flowers?

243
00:29:30,472 --> 00:29:32,224
What are you doing, mama's friend?

244
00:29:33,391 --> 00:29:36,603
Mama's friend? Just call me auntie...

245
00:29:36,686 --> 00:29:37,395
Auntie?

246
00:29:37,479 --> 00:29:39,814
That's better. Want me to read it to you?

247
00:29:39,898 --> 00:29:41,233
Fold them for me.

248
00:29:41,274 --> 00:29:43,610
Your mom will be upset
if you fold up your textbooks.

249
00:29:43,693 --> 00:29:46,196
Mama gave them to me to fold them.

250
00:29:46,279 --> 00:29:47,113
What?

251
00:29:47,197 --> 00:29:49,699
All except this one Social Studies.

252
00:29:49,783 --> 00:29:52,827
- Why not?
- Because it talks about Seoul here.

253
00:30:18,812 --> 00:30:21,856
I want to get holes in my ears like you.

254
00:30:22,732 --> 00:30:24,232
Why you!

255
00:30:26,236 --> 00:30:29,155
I wish my boobs will
grow big like yours soon.

256
00:30:46,715 --> 00:30:51,136
Scream! Scream bitch!

257
00:31:04,858 --> 00:31:06,985
- What's going on?
- It's nothing.

258
00:31:07,068 --> 00:31:09,195
She's here again?

259
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:10,989
I said scream!

260
00:31:13,992 --> 00:31:15,493
What's going on?

261
00:31:16,494 --> 00:31:21,499
Nothing. Just fooling around. Watch Yeon-
hee for me?

262
00:31:21,583 --> 00:31:23,083
Stay at auntie's house.

263
00:31:45,815 --> 00:31:50,320
Hold hands.

264
00:31:53,031 --> 00:31:54,531
Go on.

265
00:32:01,831 --> 00:32:04,668
Tell her to sell our honey, too.

266
00:32:05,335 --> 00:32:06,835
Yes, ma'am.

267
00:32:15,929 --> 00:32:18,265
How can you eat listening to that?

268
00:32:19,432 --> 00:32:22,269
When another bitch is sucking
on your hubby's dick.

269
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:27,274
Look at you. You're eating like a damn pig.

270
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,532
I'm sorry.

271
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:30,629
You're really tanned. Put this on your
face. It's sunscreen.

272
00:33:30,712 --> 00:33:32,839
Don't need your pity.

273
00:33:32,923 --> 00:33:34,841
I didn't want to come,

274
00:33:34,925 --> 00:33:37,928
but he paid my boss three times the rate.

275
00:33:38,845 --> 00:33:40,430
I'm sorry. Really.

276
00:33:41,431 --> 00:33:44,851
Why are you sorry? You aren't the monster.

277
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:48,772
You'll ruin your body like that.

278
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,442
I know that.

279
00:33:58,240 --> 00:33:59,740
What the...

280
00:34:00,825 --> 00:34:03,495
How can you live with him? I'd run away.

281
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:07,874
Probably kill me if I tried again.

282
00:34:10,961 --> 00:34:12,796
Where'd you run away to?

283
00:34:14,965 --> 00:34:17,592
Should've gone to Seoul.

284
00:34:17,676 --> 00:34:21,888
No one can find you there.

285
00:34:24,182 --> 00:34:27,894
Don't even need this. Seoul water will
make you white.

286
00:34:30,564 --> 00:34:33,692
Then why you living like that?

287
00:34:42,492 --> 00:34:44,119
Want to run away together?

288
00:34:44,202 --> 00:34:47,414
We'll go to Seoul and work at
restaurants or something.

289
00:34:51,793 --> 00:34:56,256
But a kid needs her father.

290
00:34:56,298 --> 00:35:00,427
Who needs that?
I grew up fine without a dad.

291
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,222
Oh, right. Real fine.

292
00:35:28,121 --> 00:35:31,166
Aren't you fixing dinner?

293
00:35:36,546 --> 00:35:38,046
Hey!

294
00:35:54,272 --> 00:35:56,274
Dumb bitch.

295
00:36:25,303 --> 00:36:29,307
- What?
- Get the rest of the honey.

296
00:36:30,308 --> 00:36:32,143
The boat's coming in tomorrow.

297
00:36:34,604 --> 00:36:38,942
- After I cool off the stings.
- Why you little!

298
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:51,955
Put bean paste on it.

299
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:05,760
- What the hell you up to?
- Stop cursing.

300
00:37:09,139 --> 00:37:10,639
What's with your face?

301
00:37:13,643 --> 00:37:15,770
Just stung by bees.

302
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:20,358
You let your husband get away with that?

303
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:23,570
It's just a couple of stings.

304
00:37:27,032 --> 00:37:28,575
Not that...

305
00:37:29,367 --> 00:37:31,369
Right in front of you!

306
00:37:31,453 --> 00:37:33,872
He had sex with a girl in your room.

307
00:37:33,955 --> 00:37:35,582
And you act like it's nothing?

308
00:37:37,042 --> 00:37:40,587
We keep things to ourselves here.

309
00:37:43,673 --> 00:37:46,801
Not like you're going to take me in.

310
00:37:48,678 --> 00:37:50,597
You need someone to take care of you?

311
00:37:51,473 --> 00:37:53,600
You're an adult.
You should take care of yourself.

312
00:38:06,988 --> 00:38:10,909
- Come on.
- It's hard.

313
00:38:26,299 --> 00:38:28,134
Not too close!

314
00:38:28,218 --> 00:38:34,140
5 minutes. No, just for 1 minute, please.

315
00:38:54,953 --> 00:39:00,792
My baby girl's home. Let's go take a bath.

316
00:39:21,563 --> 00:39:23,063
What are you doing?

317
00:39:23,773 --> 00:39:26,693
I want to be loved by papa, too.

318
00:39:30,155 --> 00:39:33,325
You said to try to get loved by papa.

319
00:39:39,497 --> 00:39:42,000
That isn't what I was talking about.

320
00:39:43,793 --> 00:39:46,504
Where'd you get this? Did you steal it
from that girl?

321
00:39:46,588 --> 00:39:48,088
No!

322
00:39:48,089 --> 00:39:50,216
- Then where?
- Gave it to me.

323
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,135
The girl gave it to you?

324
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:59,309
Answer me! Want me to beat it out of you!

325
00:39:59,392 --> 00:40:01,728
Papa gave it to me!

326
00:40:03,104 --> 00:40:06,149
Why would he give this to you?

327
00:40:06,191 --> 00:40:09,319
What about these bunny undies?

328
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:25,752
Why's the laundry on the ground?

329
00:40:33,927 --> 00:40:36,972
Did you fight? Over this?

330
00:40:38,265 --> 00:40:40,058
Damn girls.

331
00:40:42,352 --> 00:40:47,566
Put it on. All over your body, bitch!
Don't get jealous of the kid!

332
00:40:53,071 --> 00:40:55,282
Let's just give it to your mama.

333
00:40:56,866 --> 00:40:59,494
I'll get you something better.

334
00:41:01,955 --> 00:41:05,792
Take it and scram! Get the hell out of
my sight.

335
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:12,859
You've been laid off as per the
Employment Law.

336
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,820
Manager!

337
00:42:16,947 --> 00:42:19,366
The caller you have reached is...

338
00:42:36,758 --> 00:42:38,258
Oh, hi.

339
00:42:40,345 --> 00:42:44,599
I'm leaving on the next boat. I had a
good rest thanks to you.

340
00:42:45,475 --> 00:42:48,687
I'm going be a new me when I get back
to Seoul.

341
00:42:54,568 --> 00:42:57,195
Though it won't be easy to change all
of a sudden.

342
00:43:13,003 --> 00:43:14,504
Thank you for everything.

343
00:43:16,214 --> 00:43:17,714
Can I come by often?

344
00:43:24,723 --> 00:43:26,223
What's this? Blood?

345
00:43:27,726 --> 00:43:29,226
It's not blood.

346
00:43:30,812 --> 00:43:32,355
Why's this on your face?

347
00:43:34,524 --> 00:43:37,944
- Hae-won...
- What's with you?

348
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:43,074
- Hae-won...
- What?

349
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:50,457
Can't you take Yeon-hee and
me with you to Seoul?

350
00:43:51,625 --> 00:43:53,960
You can go anywhere you want.

351
00:43:54,044 --> 00:43:57,547
But I don't know how
to live on the mainland.

352
00:43:58,214 --> 00:44:02,969
It's the same Seoul is scarier to live
in then here.

353
00:44:04,554 --> 00:44:10,268
- You said you'd take me.
- When? 15 years ago?

354
00:44:10,352 --> 00:44:14,481
Yeah. Don't that count as a promise?

355
00:44:15,649 --> 00:44:20,111
Next time. After I take care of
something first.

356
00:44:22,072 --> 00:44:23,698
Next time, again?

357
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:35,001
Fine. Then just take Yeon-hee? Please?

358
00:44:36,086 --> 00:44:37,586
Why Yeon-hee?

359
00:44:40,674 --> 00:44:42,509
Don't ask why.

360
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:53,019
Please, I'm begging you...

361
00:44:53,603 --> 00:45:01,736
If you take her, I won't call or write
you no more.

362
00:45:04,322 --> 00:45:06,116
Oh, come on!

363
00:45:07,117 --> 00:45:11,037
Just tell me. If you don't, I'm not
taking her.

364
00:45:20,714 --> 00:45:31,558
I think Man-jong... must have screwed...
Yeon-hee.

365
00:45:41,443 --> 00:45:43,695
That makes no sense.

366
00:45:45,947 --> 00:45:46,656
What?

367
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:49,200
I know you want to go to Seoul...

368
00:45:50,535 --> 00:45:54,372
But still, how can you say something
like that?

369
00:45:59,461 --> 00:46:01,504
Try a more believable lie next time!

370
00:46:03,173 --> 00:46:05,383
You think I'm lying?

371
00:46:05,467 --> 00:46:08,803
You know what the bastards are like!

372
00:46:10,180 --> 00:46:11,890
I don't know anything!

373
00:46:52,806 --> 00:46:54,306
Reading?

374
00:47:01,439 --> 00:47:03,525
Why do you want your boobs to grow?

375
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:07,571
Don't you know? That's how girls are loved.

376
00:47:08,405 --> 00:47:12,367
Yeon-hee... Does daddy love you?

377
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:17,455
How does daddy love you?

378
00:47:22,335 --> 00:47:23,962
What you doing here?

379
00:47:26,047 --> 00:47:27,547
Yeon-hee, come here.

380
00:47:28,258 --> 00:47:30,677
You're old enough to earn your keep.

381
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,179
Stop idling around.

382
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:36,182
- Take her and feed her.
- Sure thing.

383
00:47:41,479 --> 00:47:44,316
- But I need that book.
- Let's just go and eat.

384
00:47:56,786 --> 00:47:59,789
- You should take the next boat.
- There's something...

385
00:47:59,873 --> 00:48:04,210
Laws are meant to change according to
circumstances.

386
00:48:04,294 --> 00:48:08,298
And Bok-nam's damn good at lying.

387
00:48:08,381 --> 00:48:10,634
She grew up like a beggar.

388
00:48:10,675 --> 00:48:15,222
She'll beg like a dog to get anything.

389
00:48:15,305 --> 00:48:17,015
Then let the police investigate.

390
00:48:18,475 --> 00:48:21,853
If you're so sure, why don't you report it?

391
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:26,316
You know that Yeon-hee is not
Man-jong's real daughter?

392
00:48:27,525 --> 00:48:27,817
What?

393
00:48:27,901 --> 00:48:33,531
If you're not going to protect this
island, stop worrying and go.

394
00:49:43,476 --> 00:49:46,313
Mi-ran? It's me.

395
00:49:47,188 --> 00:49:49,316
It's Moo-do Island.

396
00:49:50,609 --> 00:49:55,030
Remember what you said before?

397
00:49:57,699 --> 00:49:59,743
About going to Seoul?

398
00:50:24,517 --> 00:50:26,770
- Mom!
- Quiet!

399
00:50:59,678 --> 00:51:03,390
- Where are we going? I'm sleepy.
- We running away...

400
00:51:03,473 --> 00:51:05,976
- Where?
- To the mainland.

401
00:51:06,059 --> 00:51:08,520
Papa said the mainland's trouble.

402
00:51:09,187 --> 00:51:12,607
- You can go to school there.
- I don't want to go to school!

403
00:51:12,691 --> 00:51:15,193
Then fine. Just go where papa isn't!

404
00:51:15,277 --> 00:51:18,613
But I like papa I like it here!

405
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,907
So you don't want to go?

406
00:51:20,991 --> 00:51:25,996
- If I don't, you're not going either?
- Of course not.

407
00:51:27,497 --> 00:51:30,834
If we don't go now, you'll get beat all
your life?

408
00:51:33,587 --> 00:51:36,214
Then I'll go with you mama.

409
00:51:36,298 --> 00:51:39,426
Because I can't stand you getting beat.

410
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:44,723
Let's go. The boat's coming.

411
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:49,728
That hurts. Not so hard.

412
00:51:51,313 --> 00:51:55,859
- You crying, mama?
- Never saw mama cry, huh?

413
00:51:55,901 --> 00:52:00,655
No, I heard you cry and say you'd
rather die than live like this.

414
00:52:00,739 --> 00:52:05,243
- What's good about dying?
- I'm sorry. You're right.

415
00:52:05,327 --> 00:52:08,663
Rolling in dung is better than dying.

416
00:52:08,705 --> 00:52:11,583
I don't want to roll in dung!

417
00:52:41,571 --> 00:52:43,698
I warned you, not him!

418
00:52:43,782 --> 00:52:47,202
No one else would come here at this hour.

419
00:52:47,285 --> 00:52:50,622
Still, not him. You stupid!

420
00:52:52,082 --> 00:52:56,086
Don't worry I don't care
for people's business.

421
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,796
Just pay me enough for the boat.

422
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:12,100
Where'd you get this?

423
00:53:18,775 --> 00:53:23,738
Oh no! Look!

424
00:53:23,822 --> 00:53:27,951
Mama! Hurry! Hurry! Come on!

425
00:53:30,203 --> 00:53:33,748
Let's go now! Man-jong's coming!

426
00:53:33,832 --> 00:53:34,749
Hurry!

427
00:53:34,833 --> 00:53:37,043
Please hurry! He's coming!

428
00:53:37,127 --> 00:53:40,338
I got to count it! Shit, I lost my count!

429
00:53:51,641 --> 00:53:52,559
Let's go!

430
00:53:52,642 --> 00:53:55,854
- Hurry!
- Let me count first!

431
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:58,148
Where's my damn lighter?

432
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:02,277
Got a light?

433
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,155
- Hurry!
- Hurry up!

434
00:54:05,238 --> 00:54:13,580
We'll go when I'm done counting.
One, two, three...

435
00:54:13,663 --> 00:54:15,999
Sis! Sis!

436
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,960
Sis!

437
00:54:28,762 --> 00:54:30,305
Papa!

438
00:54:31,264 --> 00:54:33,391
- Papa!
- Come here, you bitch!

439
00:54:34,684 --> 00:54:40,023
I take in a bitch with a kid! And you
sneak off on me! You bitch!

440
00:54:41,066 --> 00:54:42,025
You bitch!

441
00:54:42,067 --> 00:54:45,028
Don't just stand there! Stop him!

442
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:47,614
Break her damn legs!

443
00:54:47,697 --> 00:54:54,037
Like dogs and bitches who try to run
away... Break them so she can't go!

444
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,579
Get up!

445
00:54:57,207 --> 00:54:59,834
Stop your brother. She's going to die!

446
00:55:00,418 --> 00:55:02,128
Papa!

447
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:07,342
Get up!

448
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,722
Dumb fucking whore!

449
00:55:12,806 --> 00:55:15,058
Warned you to stay away
from people's business!

450
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,851
Stop it, papa!

451
00:55:16,935 --> 00:55:20,355
I'll live with you! Stop hitting her!

452
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,861
I treated you good! And you betray your papa?

453
00:55:26,945 --> 00:55:28,863
Is it because I'm not your real dad?

454
00:55:30,448 --> 00:55:32,450
I'll show you how papa can get real mad!

455
00:55:36,830 --> 00:55:38,665
Are you okay!

456
00:55:38,748 --> 00:55:42,460
Stop it! Not Yeon-hee.

457
00:55:46,131 --> 00:55:47,757
Careful, Man-jong!

458
00:55:49,843 --> 00:55:51,970
Are you crazy?

459
00:55:52,053 --> 00:55:55,891
You can't throw stones at your husband!

460
00:55:56,766 --> 00:56:00,186
A woman can get stoned
to death but not a man?

461
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:03,481
He took you and your kid in!

462
00:56:03,565 --> 00:56:05,191
You should be grateful, bitch!

463
00:56:05,275 --> 00:56:07,777
- Damn right!
- Of course!

464
00:56:07,861 --> 00:56:10,405
Quit saying that!

465
00:56:10,488 --> 00:56:13,909
Why don't I know who the father is?

466
00:56:13,992 --> 00:56:17,704
I was raped by more than one bastard!

467
00:56:17,787 --> 00:56:22,292
- By every single one of them!
- Shut up! You filthy bitch!

468
00:56:30,884 --> 00:56:33,511
- Damn bitch!
- Papa!

469
00:56:35,597 --> 00:56:37,097
You damn bitch!

470
00:56:58,995 --> 00:57:01,748
Yeon-hee? Wake up, Yeon-hee!

471
00:57:04,542 --> 00:57:06,962
- Get some water. Hurry!
- Yes, sis.

472
00:57:08,129 --> 00:57:09,629
Yeon-hee...

473
00:57:18,848 --> 00:57:20,348
Yeon-hee...

474
00:57:31,152 --> 00:57:35,574
Yeon-hee... Wake up.

475
00:57:37,242 --> 00:57:40,078
Let's go to Seoul...

476
00:57:43,957 --> 00:57:45,500
Yeon-hee...

477
00:57:46,585 --> 00:57:51,298
Stop fussing bitch. She'll be fine with
some bean paste. Move!

478
00:57:51,381 --> 00:57:52,881
Let go!

479
00:57:53,466 --> 00:57:58,513
Don't touch her! Let go!

480
00:57:59,055 --> 00:58:03,101
Get away!

481
00:58:06,479 --> 00:58:08,815
Get away!

482
00:58:39,930 --> 00:58:41,848
Thanks for coming all this way.

483
00:58:44,517 --> 00:58:46,561
Must be hard taking care of the elders.

484
00:58:48,521 --> 00:58:52,067
Why'd your aunt call me out here?

485
00:58:56,655 --> 00:58:59,074
How's your father doing?

486
00:58:59,115 --> 00:59:02,494
He said to say hello
when I said I'm coming here.

487
00:59:03,662 --> 00:59:07,874
If you told me before, I would've
called a doctor.

488
00:59:08,541 --> 00:59:14,172
You need a medical report to file a
death these days.

489
00:59:14,256 --> 00:59:19,469
She just slipped and fell. Makes no
difference if a doctor sees her.

490
00:59:19,553 --> 00:59:24,015
Actually, I can draw up the report
myself.

491
00:59:24,057 --> 00:59:25,976
I'm Yeon-hee's grandma.

492
00:59:26,059 --> 00:59:29,312
If you look at it, I'm her grandma, too.

493
00:59:29,396 --> 00:59:35,193
How would I look if you are
suspicious of her death.

494
00:59:35,277 --> 00:59:40,115
- But her bruises are...
- Bok-Nam? Why don't you tell him?

495
00:59:41,992 --> 00:59:46,413
If we were lying, would her mama stay
still?

496
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:53,712
She's quiet. Then, did she kill the kid?

497
00:59:56,006 --> 00:59:58,925
What did you say?

498
01:00:04,514 --> 01:00:06,016
Move for a sec.

499
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:08,935
What did you just say?

500
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:17,944
That bastard killed her. He kicked her.

501
01:00:20,405 --> 01:00:23,033
She fell...

502
01:00:24,743 --> 01:00:27,037
I wasn't going to say this but...

503
01:00:28,204 --> 01:00:32,250
If you're going to blame me,
I have no choice.

504
01:00:33,251 --> 01:00:39,049
This bitch here tried to pack up and
run away this morning.

505
01:00:39,132 --> 01:00:43,678
- Isn't that right?
- Huh? Yes, sir.

506
01:00:43,762 --> 01:00:46,973
Were you there too, when she died?

507
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:54,981
- You don't believe me?
- Go on I'm listening.

508
01:00:55,065 --> 01:01:00,487
I knew she was going to run away. But
she tried to take Yeon-hee, too

509
01:01:01,071 --> 01:01:03,073
I couldn't let that happen.

510
01:01:03,156 --> 01:01:08,703
So, I told her to leave the kid and go
if she wants.

511
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:14,793
- I even gave her some money.
- Yeah right!

512
01:01:14,876 --> 01:01:17,587
You never gave me a dime all these years!

513
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:19,631
Then where's that money from?

514
01:01:20,590 --> 01:01:24,302
I stole it. From that bastard's pocket.

515
01:01:24,386 --> 01:01:26,388
Boast why don't you? Damn thief!

516
01:01:28,265 --> 01:01:32,519
Our nephew's trying to cover up

517
01:01:32,602 --> 01:01:36,106
that run-away bitch's sins.

518
01:01:36,189 --> 01:01:40,318
- He's got a good heart.
- Good heart my ass!

519
01:01:40,402 --> 01:01:43,029
- Watch your fucking language.
- Man-jong...

520
01:01:43,113 --> 01:01:46,032
It's money I made from the honey, anyways!

521
01:01:49,911 --> 01:01:54,541
Fine... I'm sorry for not
providing you with much.

522
01:01:57,127 --> 01:02:00,547
There's not much here for her.

523
01:02:02,132 --> 01:02:05,552
So I told her to go and start a new life.

524
01:02:06,428 --> 01:02:07,928
But...

525
01:02:08,805 --> 01:02:13,268
- But the kid... Not her!
- Man-jong.

526
01:02:14,227 --> 01:02:16,271
Let the kid decide.

527
01:02:17,355 --> 01:02:20,275
So? What did she say?

528
01:02:23,153 --> 01:02:26,489
A child would normally follow the mother.

529
01:02:27,157 --> 01:02:32,871
But her mama was so mean,
the kid chose the stepfather.

530
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:38,084
She held my ankle tight and begged to stay.

531
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,087
But she pulled her away!

532
01:02:41,171 --> 01:02:48,803
And fell down. Then bumped her head on a rock.

533
01:02:48,845 --> 01:02:53,808
God damn it.

534
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:58,104
Bok-Nam? Is that right?

535
01:03:06,905 --> 01:03:08,615
Then what about Bok-nam's friend?

536
01:03:09,616 --> 01:03:11,409
Did you see the child die?

537
01:03:25,006 --> 01:03:28,134
No I was sleeping at the time.

538
01:03:35,809 --> 01:03:37,644
Good work.

539
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:42,148
The honey's for you in the mornings.

540
01:03:42,232 --> 01:03:45,443
A big spoonful when you wake up

541
01:03:45,527 --> 01:03:48,238
I should save good honey like this.

542
01:03:49,656 --> 01:03:54,578
Wait Bok-nam's friend said
she's going back, too.

543
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:57,872
Don't worry. You're busy. Go on!

544
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:01,585
Get the stuff on the boat.

545
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:05,881
- No, I'll carry them.
- It's okay!

546
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:12,888
- What's this?
- Boat fare. It's not much.

547
01:04:27,485 --> 01:04:31,197
Wait! Wait up!

548
01:04:35,285 --> 01:04:39,289
She got something to say to him?
What's her hurry?

549
01:04:40,999 --> 01:04:44,211
No need to hurry. A boat will come tomorrow.

550
01:04:44,294 --> 01:04:48,298
No more buses to Seoul today.

551
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:49,216
Damn right!

552
01:04:49,299 --> 01:04:53,220
Bok-Nam must be sad.
Shouldn't you console her?

553
01:04:53,303 --> 01:04:56,014
Damn right. She could use a friend now.

554
01:05:46,064 --> 01:05:48,275
Tell Bok-Nam thanks.

555
01:06:52,714 --> 01:06:55,842
Seoul girls won't stand you messing
with them...

556
01:06:58,511 --> 01:07:02,766
Especially with a witness.

557
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,437
- Isn't it dirty?
- Nope!

558
01:09:29,162 --> 01:09:30,662
You're laughing?

559
01:09:49,266 --> 01:09:50,766
Let go!

560
01:09:52,394 --> 01:09:54,145
Man-jong! Get her!

561
01:09:56,189 --> 01:09:59,734
Stupid. Dumb bastards.

562
01:11:09,346 --> 01:11:10,846
Boat's in.

563
01:11:14,976 --> 01:11:19,606
Don't slack off and dig up potatoes
before it rains!

564
01:11:21,191 --> 01:11:23,902
Damn bitch. Building a grave in the yard.

565
01:11:23,985 --> 01:11:25,485
Scram!

566
01:11:26,988 --> 01:11:29,199
Or I'll bury you right next to that!

567
01:11:33,703 --> 01:11:36,039
Chul-jong! Let's go!

568
01:11:42,712 --> 01:11:46,049
Excited to go into town, Chul-jong?

569
01:11:46,716 --> 01:11:49,844
Move your scrawny ass.

570
01:11:49,886 --> 01:11:52,430
Come you all and have a drink...

571
01:11:52,514 --> 01:11:56,226
So damn heavy. Damn it.

572
01:11:56,309 --> 01:12:00,146
This is why we need a man around.

573
01:12:00,230 --> 01:12:02,732
They'll be back tomorrow.

574
01:12:03,441 --> 01:12:04,943
Stop trembling.

575
01:12:08,905 --> 01:12:13,159
Bok-Nam, take a break will you?

576
01:12:14,119 --> 01:12:15,619
Sis?

577
01:12:16,246 --> 01:12:18,456
Don't she look a bit crazy? Sis?

578
01:12:18,540 --> 01:12:20,458
Strange if she weren't
after losing her kid.

579
01:12:20,542 --> 01:12:22,460
Let her rest for a bit.

580
01:12:22,544 --> 01:12:26,673
She'd go crazy doing nothing!
Over it faster this way.

581
01:12:26,756 --> 01:12:28,256
I'm doing her good...

582
01:12:29,426 --> 01:12:32,888
- I'll go get some fish.
- Really, sis?

583
01:12:33,471 --> 01:12:36,975
- Don't. Get all excited...
- Okay, okay!

584
01:13:08,590 --> 01:13:11,301
Damn bitch isn't worth shit.

585
01:13:24,814 --> 01:13:26,314
How about a song?

586
01:13:27,108 --> 01:13:32,739
Oh time, do not come or go.

587
01:13:32,822 --> 01:13:37,827
My precious youth is gone I'm all old.

588
01:13:37,911 --> 01:13:43,250
Ari-Ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-Ga Nat-nae.

589
01:13:43,333 --> 01:13:48,755
Ari-rang Arari-Ga Nat-nae.

590
01:13:48,838 --> 01:13:59,474
Were you born a beauty?
I was born an ugly.

591
01:13:59,516 --> 01:14:04,896
Ari-Ari-rang, Ssuri-Ssurirang,
Arari-Ga Nat-nae.

592
01:14:04,938 --> 01:14:07,774
Ari-rang!

593
01:15:18,428 --> 01:15:22,641
I stared at the sun for long
and it spoke to me.

594
01:16:41,011 --> 01:16:43,013
Said, if I hold back, I'll get sick!

595
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:53,910
Say something!

596
01:19:54,287 --> 01:19:55,830
What's going on!

597
01:20:01,711 --> 01:20:04,923
She's... she's gone crazy!

598
01:20:05,006 --> 01:20:07,926
We need a man... at a time like this.

599
01:20:08,718 --> 01:20:12,931
The boat's coming soon. The men will be back.

600
01:20:13,014 --> 01:20:15,850
I just have to hang on till then.

601
01:20:35,954 --> 01:20:42,460
Auntie! Slow down! You're going to fall!

602
01:21:35,096 --> 01:21:37,933
Damn whore!

603
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:47,817
Damn you! Damn whore!

604
01:21:55,909 --> 01:22:00,539
Stop it, now! You've done enough!

605
01:22:12,133 --> 01:22:17,472
Damn bitch. You're dead now.
The men are back!

606
01:22:18,723 --> 01:22:23,270
I came to this island when I was 15.

607
01:22:23,353 --> 01:22:26,565
I swam for over 50 years!

608
01:22:27,440 --> 01:22:34,072
You! Stay right here.
I'm coming back with the men!

609
01:22:45,750 --> 01:22:49,504
- Did you hear something?
- Hear what?

610
01:22:51,381 --> 01:22:52,883
Nothing!

611
01:22:55,093 --> 01:22:58,305
Go check the hives.
See if they're okay from the rain.

612
01:22:58,388 --> 01:23:02,726
Damn stupid wife probably left them out
in the rain.

613
01:23:04,394 --> 01:23:08,315
- Want to stay for a drink?
- Sure!

614
01:23:09,900 --> 01:23:12,319
Damn it, Auntie...

615
01:23:14,404 --> 01:23:16,907
Should've worn glasses.

616
01:24:26,851 --> 01:24:30,480
Why were all these potatoes
left in the rain?

617
01:24:31,856 --> 01:24:34,109
Where the hell is everyone?

618
01:24:35,569 --> 01:24:38,613
Damn. What's that stench?

619
01:24:38,655 --> 01:24:40,991
Out of Service...

620
01:24:42,492 --> 01:24:44,703
Hey, gramps! Everything okay?

621
01:24:47,706 --> 01:24:49,206
Says everything's fine.

622
01:24:50,083 --> 01:24:52,544
That man's living long...

623
01:24:52,586 --> 01:24:55,213
Remember when all.
Remember when all the men died in the storm.

624
01:24:55,297 --> 01:24:56,798
Except him?

625
01:24:58,008 --> 01:25:00,719
All the women beat him.

626
01:25:00,802 --> 01:25:02,429
Saying he killed their husbands...

627
01:25:02,512 --> 01:25:05,849
Then they all took turns taking
him home and feeding him.

628
01:25:05,891 --> 01:25:08,643
All except my mama that is.

629
01:25:08,685 --> 01:25:12,439
Your mom took him up the hill
instead of your home.

630
01:25:13,732 --> 01:25:15,442
Where the fuck is everyone?

631
01:25:15,525 --> 01:25:17,736
- Watch your damn language.
- Sorry!

632
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:21,822
Dumbass!

633
01:25:34,836 --> 01:25:38,465
Respect your elder first. Stupid bastard.

634
01:25:44,054 --> 01:25:46,056
I said, give me some water!

635
01:26:00,737 --> 01:26:02,237
Watch out!

636
01:26:04,574 --> 01:26:06,074
What the hell?

637
01:26:19,256 --> 01:26:21,508
You crazy bitch!

638
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:31,518
You crazy bitch!

639
01:26:52,205 --> 01:26:54,666
Should tend to the funeral offerings...

640
01:26:56,209 --> 01:27:01,756
Why'd you kill them! Crazy bitch! Why! Why!

641
01:27:02,632 --> 01:27:05,760
Why didn't you just kill yourself!

642
01:27:06,720 --> 01:27:09,055
I didn't want to die.

643
01:27:10,307 --> 01:27:13,852
Then I should live it up.

644
01:27:16,021 --> 01:27:19,858
You never opened up to me.

645
01:27:19,941 --> 01:27:24,696
Treated me like trash.
Always cold like a rock to me!

646
01:27:25,447 --> 01:27:29,075
That's why my dick never got hard in
front of you.

647
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:32,871
Is that why you touched my kid? Huh?

648
01:27:32,954 --> 01:27:34,789
Shut your damn mouth!

649
01:27:36,958 --> 01:27:43,089
If the cops get me, I'll tell them
everything you did.

650
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:49,261
Fine.

651
01:27:50,055 --> 01:27:53,016
Killing you is self defense.

652
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:02,234
If you kill her, I'll call the cops.

653
01:28:04,486 --> 01:28:07,197
I'll kill you painlessly like a pig.

654
01:28:09,282 --> 01:28:11,117
What about her?

655
01:28:11,201 --> 01:28:13,828
Make it look like you killed her?

656
01:28:13,912 --> 01:28:16,915
Or take her as my new wife?

657
01:28:16,998 --> 01:28:18,498
What?

658
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:29,344
Why? Looks like the killer
is scared to die.

659
01:28:31,721 --> 01:28:34,349
What would I be scared of?

660
01:28:35,934 --> 01:28:44,359
- I'm just sorry for you, honey.
- Honey? Crazy bitch.

661
01:32:31,127 --> 01:32:32,671
Does it hurt?

662
01:32:38,343 --> 01:32:39,970
A lot?

663
01:32:48,186 --> 01:32:53,191
Hold on I'll put bean paste on it.

664
01:33:06,079 --> 01:33:12,210
Doesn't hurt now, does it! Doesn't hurt
now! You bastard!

665
01:33:12,294 --> 01:33:17,132
You damn son of a bitch! You son of a bitch!

666
01:33:24,097 --> 01:33:26,933
What the hell? Get up! Hurry!

667
01:33:43,116 --> 01:33:44,616
Let go!

668
01:33:53,335 --> 01:33:55,962
The fuck is wrong with this!

669
01:33:56,546 --> 01:33:59,466
Hurry! Hurry up you dumb bastard!

670
01:33:59,549 --> 01:34:02,677
What are you looking at?
Hurry up you dumb bastards!

671
01:34:03,762 --> 01:34:08,558
I'm the only one here. You crazy, too?

672
01:34:08,642 --> 01:34:14,397
Damn crazy bitch. Shit! Fuck!

673
01:34:16,566 --> 01:34:18,401
Shit!

674
01:34:54,813 --> 01:34:56,523
Hurry! Hurry!

675
01:34:57,315 --> 01:34:58,815
Quick!

676
01:36:03,757 --> 01:36:07,677
Moo-do Island? At least $100 to go.

677
01:36:08,678 --> 01:36:12,098
Right now? Be right there.

678
01:36:13,475 --> 01:36:16,603
Hey, Jang! Sail over after the game.

679
01:36:16,686 --> 01:36:21,524
What game? I got nothing I'll go.

680
01:36:23,193 --> 01:36:24,693
What took you so long?

681
01:36:35,413 --> 01:36:36,913
Where you headed?

682
01:36:44,714 --> 01:36:47,133
Thinking of going to see Seoul...

683
01:36:47,801 --> 01:36:49,761
How long since you been on land?

684
01:36:49,803 --> 01:36:51,930
Since I was born.

685
01:36:56,226 --> 01:36:58,228
So about 30 years...

686
01:36:58,311 --> 01:37:03,525
Damn, didn't you go crazy being stuck
there all your life?

687
01:37:05,610 --> 01:37:08,154
Do I look sane to you?

688
01:37:17,038 --> 01:37:22,878
Play me a song, why don't you?
Then I won't charge you.

689
01:38:07,505 --> 01:38:09,007
Aren't you getting off?

690
01:38:39,329 --> 01:38:43,041
There's a bus to Seoul on the main road.

691
01:38:44,334 --> 01:38:47,254
Have yourself a good trip.

692
01:38:49,714 --> 01:38:51,341
What's this for?

693
01:39:15,740 --> 01:39:18,577
There are kind people?

694
01:39:40,181 --> 01:39:41,681
Night Duty Room!

695
01:39:44,102 --> 01:39:45,602
Sergeant Seo?

696
01:39:45,770 --> 01:39:48,815
I'll notify headquarters and check out
Moo-do Island.

697
01:39:48,899 --> 01:39:51,318
Yes, sir. I'll call you from the Island.

698
01:39:51,401 --> 01:39:54,738
Let go of me!

699
01:39:56,489 --> 01:39:58,033
Go away!

700
01:41:06,977 --> 01:41:09,396
Hey! Help!

701
01:41:27,080 --> 01:41:28,580
Let go!

702
01:43:03,593 --> 01:43:05,929
- Play it.
- What?

703
01:43:06,805 --> 01:43:08,305
Like back then.

704
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:15,730
- What!
- The song you played before...

705
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:20,610
- Don't do this Bok-Nam.
- Do what?

706
01:43:21,611 --> 01:43:23,321
Why are you doing this to me?

707
01:43:25,198 --> 01:43:28,952
You're too unkind.

708
01:43:30,996 --> 01:43:34,958
Here. Go on.

709
01:44:52,994 --> 01:44:58,124
In the village... if someone would stop
working...

710
01:44:59,376 --> 01:45:01,127
Auntie used to say...

711
01:45:05,924 --> 01:45:07,424
'That's like Bok-Nam...

712
01:45:10,512 --> 01:45:12,430
not picking out the weeds'

713
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:24,943
I... can't stand that anymore.

714
01:48:07,606 --> 01:48:17,824
I wandered today to the hill, Maggie...

715
01:48:17,908 --> 01:48:28,627
To watch the scene below. The creek and
the rusty old mill.

716
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:57,089
Please have a seat.

717
01:50:05,098 --> 01:50:06,725
It was them.

718
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:09,352
You bitch!

719
01:50:10,687 --> 01:50:13,440
You want to die, bitch?

720
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:10,622
Dear Hae-won, I miss you so much.

721
01:51:16,878 --> 01:51:19,005
My dear Hae-won, I miss you so much.

722
01:51:19,089 --> 01:51:22,801
I need to ask you a favor. You're the
only one who can help me.

723
01:51:25,387 --> 01:51:27,514
My dear Hae-won I miss you so much...

724
01:51:27,597 --> 01:51:32,018
Your friend, Bok-Nam
