What?

326
00:24:40,496 --> 00:24:42,246
I said, let's do it.

327
00:24:42,246 --> 00:24:44,846
Let's officially start seeing each other.

328
00:24:46,496 --> 00:24:49,726
What do you mean by officially seeing each other?

329
00:24:49,726 --> 00:24:51,596
Let's date.

330
00:24:51,596 --> 00:24:55,866
Let's be an official boyfriend and girlfriend or something.

331
00:24:57,676 --> 00:25:00,336
Then will we have certain

332
00:25:00,336 --> 00:25:02,866
pet names...

333
00:25:03,426 --> 00:25:07,330
Right? That's going too far. That's too much.

334
00:25:07,876 --> 00:25:09,976
How's baby?

335
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:15,206
Baby?

336
00:25:15,206 --> 00:25:19,316
I mean, who else will call us baby at our age?

337
00:25:19,316 --> 00:25:21,456
My... baby?

338
00:25:21,456 --> 00:25:23,746
Yes! Baby's right here.

339
00:25:23,746 --> 00:25:26,036
Wah.

340
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,566
I'm right here.

341
00:25:29,566 --> 00:25:31,596
Drink up.
<i>[Youth has no age.]</i>

342
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:33,116
Baby's going to get drunk.

343
00:25:33,116 --> 00:25:35,976
<i>[Finals on all subjects]</i>

344
00:25:35,976 --> 00:25:37,786
Brother-in-law!

345
00:25:43,306 --> 00:25:46,806
You know... Her vulnerability...

346
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:49,306
Besides weakness, is there anything else?

347
00:25:50,276 --> 00:25:54,926
I'm just someone who lacks weaknesses.

348
00:25:54,926 --> 00:25:57,516
- Why do you like my sister?
- Huh?

349
00:25:57,516 --> 00:26:00,606
I can tell that you have nothing to lose and you look really popular.

350
00:26:00,606 --> 00:26:04,376
There's no need for you to be hung up on my sister.

351
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,516
I'm amazed.

352
00:26:14,516 --> 00:26:17,186
Sam Da lives really diligently.

353
00:26:17,186 --> 00:26:19,146
That amazes me.

354
00:26:21,326 --> 00:26:23,196
That's why I like her.

355
00:26:25,466 --> 00:26:29,556
I've never been that desperate in my life.

356
00:26:36,866 --> 00:26:39,166
I'm going. I need to go to the library.

357
00:26:39,166 --> 00:26:40,646
Are you not going to tell me another vulnerability?

358
00:26:40,646 --> 00:26:43,856
I don't know my sister that well either.

359
00:26:43,856 --> 00:26:47,216
But, rather than asking me,

360
00:26:47,216 --> 00:26:50,846
wouldn't it be better to ask her personally?

361
00:26:52,196 --> 00:26:53,796
You're right.

362
00:26:53,796 --> 00:26:55,386
Anyway,

363
00:26:55,386 --> 00:26:58,866
thank you for helping me settle the case.

364
00:27:03,136 --> 00:27:04,896
Oh, right. Hyung!

365
00:27:04,896 --> 00:27:06,296
Did you know?

366
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:09,916
That you're kind of a prick?

367
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:13,496
Is that why my sister doesn't like you?

368
00:27:20,716 --> 00:27:22,866
<i>[We're having a party. Join us.]</i>

369
00:27:55,796 --> 00:27:57,136
<i>What?</i>

370
00:27:57,136 --> 00:27:59,036
You got dumped in such a short time?

371
00:27:59,036 --> 00:28:02,836
I mean, technically speaking, I wasn't dumped.

372
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:05,006
You liked him in a blink and got dumped in a blink.

373
00:28:05,006 --> 00:28:09,296
You're quick to fall in love, but your progress speed is almost 5G.

374
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,336
No 7G.

375
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:13,506
- I wasn't dumped directly!
- Then what happened?

376
00:28:14,936 --> 00:28:17,046
I got dumped second handedly.

377
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,586
Good for you!

378
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:22,436
It's better to get dumped sooner than later.

379
00:28:22,436 --> 00:28:26,896
And do you think Captain would date you while breaking the rules?

380
00:28:26,896 --> 00:28:28,116
You think so?

381
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:29,356
Is it because CCs are prohibited?

382
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:32,396
But then again, if you look at Yoo Min,

383
00:28:32,396 --> 00:28:34,746
that doesn't seem to be the case, right?

384
00:28:35,916 --> 00:28:37,276
I guess.

385
00:28:37,276 --> 00:28:40,336
You're right. He just doesn't like me.

386
00:28:40,336 --> 00:28:45,226
It looks like your mood swing switch in an instant.

387
00:28:45,226 --> 00:28:46,776
Whatever!

388
00:28:46,776 --> 00:28:48,996
I don't like someone who doesn't like me, either.

389
00:28:48,996 --> 00:28:50,256
Just wait and see.

390
00:28:50,256 --> 00:28:53,436
I'll treat him nonchalantly as if nothing happened.

391
00:29:04,966 --> 00:29:07,626
- You were here, Captain!
- Theia.

392
00:29:07,626 --> 00:29:09,236
Yeah, why?

393
00:29:09,236 --> 00:29:10,846
Huh? Nothing!

394
00:29:10,846 --> 00:29:14,296
Just thankful. You're sitting here?

395
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:17,076
You were sitting here.

396
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:22,446
Please go on.

397
00:29:31,276 --> 00:29:32,966
<i>[Don't beg for love.]</i>

398
00:29:32,966 --> 00:29:35,616
<i>Don't beg for love.</i>

399
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,180
<i>- I am okay.</i>

400
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:38,260
I am okay.

<i>Our existence alone</i>

- Overflowing.

403
00:29:45,236 --> 00:29:47,946
<i>- I am okay.</i>
- I am okay.

404
00:29:47,946 --> 00:29:51,896
She's my daughter, but there's not a second I'm bored. She's a handful.

405
00:29:51,896 --> 00:29:53,576
It's fun just watching her.

406
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:56,716
<i>Cheer up. Hang in there.</i>

407
00:29:56,716 --> 00:29:59,086
Hey, Son, you're here? What about food?

408
00:29:59,086 --> 00:30:01,886
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

409
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:05,506
Give this to Seong Chul.

410
00:30:05,506 --> 00:30:06,976
Tell him to give it to his mom.

411
00:30:06,976 --> 00:30:10,246
She saved your life, so you should at least thank her.

412
00:30:10,246 --> 00:30:11,336
Forget it.

413
00:30:11,336 --> 00:30:12,866
Hey!

414
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:15,206
I bought this expensive cream with a big heart.

415
00:30:15,206 --> 00:30:18,556
I bought this cream that I'll never even get to use with shaking hands.

416
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:21,566
- Bring it with you!
- I said, forget it!

417
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:23,526
Hey!

418
00:30:30,516 --> 00:30:32,956
Hey, you almost broke it!

419
00:30:32,956 --> 00:30:34,306
Do you know how pricey this is?

420
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:35,566
Fine, forget it.

421
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:37,136
It's not like I don't know her. I'll just go.

422
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:39,856
Please just stop it now!

423
00:30:42,246 --> 00:30:43,786
Hey.

424
00:30:43,786 --> 00:30:46,056
Do you know what that bastard said?

425
00:30:46,056 --> 00:30:50,566
He said you'll just come back with your tail wagging if he gives you some money.

426
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,996
That bastard said that because you're always talking about money.

427
00:30:53,996 --> 00:30:57,076
It's because you always act so crudely that–

428
00:30:57,076 --> 00:30:59,136
Apologize!

429
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:00,666
Yeah?

430
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:03,796
Apologize to your sister this instant, you punk!

431
00:31:03,796 --> 00:31:05,016
Apologize.

432
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:07,206
I said, apologize.

433
00:31:14,346 --> 00:31:17,326
Hey, where are you going?

434
00:31:17,326 --> 00:31:20,016
He'll come back when he has nowhere to go.

435
00:31:21,206 --> 00:31:23,346
And you use that.

436
00:31:23,346 --> 00:31:25,996
That wench isn't the only one with a face.

437
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:30,126
You can use good products and do whatever you want!

438
00:31:30,126 --> 00:31:33,856
Stop living such a cheap life of embarrassment!

439
00:31:49,386 --> 00:31:51,036
<i>Start.</i>

440
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,200
One, two, three, four!

441
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,550
One, two, three, four!

442
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,930
One, two, three, four!

00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,160
One, two, three, four!

444
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:03,176
- One, two, three, four!
- Again.

445
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:05,530
One, two, three, four!

446
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:07,910
One, two, three, four!

447
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:11,026
- One, two, three–
- Do Hae Yi.

448
00:32:11,026 --> 00:32:13,446
Get it together.

449
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:15,686
I'm sorry.

450
00:32:15,686 --> 00:32:19,606
We'll take five, so get it together in the meantime.

451
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,226
Okay.

452
00:32:32,276 --> 00:32:34,836
What's up? You even made a mistake.

453
00:32:35,356 --> 00:32:38,036
I'm not in a good mood.

454
00:32:39,346 --> 00:32:41,546
<i>Rather than ask me,</i>

455
00:32:41,546 --> 00:32:45,286
<i>wouldn't it be better to ask my sister personally?</i>

456
00:32:45,286 --> 00:32:49,346
Sam Da, what do you like?

457
00:32:50,166 --> 00:32:52,906
Why are you suddenly asking?

458
00:32:52,906 --> 00:32:54,486
Right.

459
00:32:54,486 --> 00:32:57,846
It was a sudden and inappropriate question, huh?

460
00:33:02,726 --> 00:33:05,536
- About me...
- Huh? What about you?

461
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,156
Do I look that bad to you, too?

462
00:33:08,886 --> 00:33:11,126
Am I that materialistic

463
00:33:12,546 --> 00:33:14,846
and shallow?

464
00:33:14,846 --> 00:33:17,576
What are you saying now?

465
00:33:17,576 --> 00:33:20,416
I do run around a lot.

466
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:23,596
Yeah, you do run around a bit.

467
00:33:24,236 --> 00:33:26,346
Right? That's right.

468
00:33:27,466 --> 00:33:29,416
Well, you know...

469
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,576
I'm not saying you are,

470
00:33:35,056 --> 00:33:38,176
but I think you're incredible.

471
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:40,786
Are you being sarcastic?

472
00:33:40,786 --> 00:33:42,766
You remember what you said to me?

473
00:33:42,766 --> 00:33:45,936
<i>The thing is, I'm f***ing poor.</i>

474
00:33:45,936 --> 00:33:48,566
It's something that could be embarrassing.

475
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:52,266
But I was amazed you could say it so frankly.

476
00:33:53,336 --> 00:33:55,896
I don't think I could.

477
00:33:56,476 --> 00:33:59,656
I just said I'm poor since I'm poor. What else can I say?

478
00:34:00,436 --> 00:34:02,086
Well, you know,

479
00:34:02,086 --> 00:34:05,166
I can't say anything embarrassing.

480
00:34:05,716 --> 00:34:07,666
Because it could disappoint.

481
00:34:10,076 --> 00:34:12,026
But you just say it,

482
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:14,786
and also live diligently.

483
00:34:14,786 --> 00:34:17,826
I really think you're incredible.

484
00:34:19,086 --> 00:34:22,126
That honestly takes a lot of courage.

485
00:34:24,246 --> 00:34:27,106
You would do the same in my shoes.

486
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,976
No,

487
00:34:30,506 --> 00:34:33,356
I don't think I could.

488
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:41,396
All right!

489
00:34:41,396 --> 00:34:43,676
