Hae Yi, are you okay?

9
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,119
You're really drunk, huh?

10
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:46,399
The wind smells like the ocean.

11
00:01:48,690 --> 00:01:51,879
It's not fair if you do this now.

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,769
It makes me want to kiss you.

But...

24
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,609
why did Captain say something like that at a time like this?

00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,289
Whoa, look at all the stars.

00:04:54,809 --> 00:04:57,259
- Where did he go?
- Over there.

30
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:00,829
What were you doing over there?

Well, I mean...

00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,499
I'll get going. Go back inside.

33
00:05:05,499 --> 00:05:08,809
All right. Don't skip any meals.

34
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:10,369
All right.

35
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:15,499
Am I seeing things, or does yours look bigger?

36
00:05:15,499 --> 00:05:18,599
Aigoo, the driver's waiting. Hurry and go.

37
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:20,969

38
00:05:20,969 --> 00:05:23,459

Did you have fun?

42
00:06:18,299 --> 00:06:19,819
Yes.

43
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:25,390
You've had enough fun, so stop participating in the Cheer Squad now.

44
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:29,579
- What?
- You need to focus on something more productive now.

45
00:06:29,579 --> 00:06:33,579
Can't I continue? I can have fun during my pre-med years.

46
00:06:33,579 --> 00:06:35,739
Seon Ho,

47
00:06:35,739 --> 00:06:41,259
you're pursuing a different path from ordinary kids, okay?

48
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:45,079
Do you think it's okay for you to play around like everyone else?

49
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,609
No, I can't quit right now.

50
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,889
Jin Seon Ho, why are you acting differently these days?

51
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,459
Is it because of Chun Yang's daughter?

52
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:06,689
If so, then all the more reason why you can't.

53
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,739
I'm going to do it.

54
00:07:09,739 --> 00:07:14,679
I'm an adult now. I can make my own decisions regarding things like this.

55
00:07:14,679 --> 00:07:16,759
I want to do it.

56
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:18,189
Fine.

57
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:24,089
You're an adult now, so you should take responsibility for your own decisions.

58
00:07:24,089 --> 00:07:27,029
If you continue with the Cheer Squad,

59

00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,239
Fine.

61
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,199
Oh, my, Jin Seon Ho! I'm really going to cancel your card! I'm really canceling it!

62
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,189
Oh my, he... He's... Hold on, is he really my son, Seon Ho?

63
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:53,529
I mean, what... What in the world made him change like that?

64
00:07:53,529 --> 00:07:55,709
Is it you?

65
00:07:57,859 --> 00:08:02,979
Captain confessed, but you kissed Jin Seon Ho!

66
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:05,809
Wow, how could I miss out on all that entertainment?

67
00:08:05,809 --> 00:08:10,639
I told myself I'm not Do Hae Yi if I drink again! Hi, I'm Do Ra Hee.
<i>(T/N: Made her name sound like "nutcase.")</i>

68
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
Do you really think it's because of the alcohol?

69
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,679
Not because you were shaken by Seon Ho's open confession?

70
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,589
Oh, my! Oh, what's this?

71
00:08:20,589 --> 00:08:24,729
Do Hae Yi, you... You were a woman with two hearts?

72
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:27,339
Is it Captain or Seon Ho?

73
00:08:27,339 --> 00:08:30,119
Is it Seon Ho or Captain?

74
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,979
Forget it! I don't need love. I'm going to continue on my own path.

75
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:38,459
Yeah, of course, you are. Goodbye.

<i>Is this you?</i>

78
00:08:43,619 --> 00:08:45,489
The person who sent this.

79
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,869
Why do you think it's me?

80
00:08:49,869 --> 00:08:51,009
I saw you.

81
00:08:51,009 --> 00:08:54,979
<i>You checked your phone when I sent the message.</i>

82
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,229
Fine, it's me.

83
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,959
Why on earth would you do–

84
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:07,129
I don't like the way Park Jung Woo runs things. I didn't know things would get so out of hand.

85
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:11,579
Honestly, it's not a crime to send some messages. The Broadcast Department just blew things out of proportion.

86
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:13,159
Then...

87
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,999
that light fixture...

88
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,039
Was it really an accident? You didn't do that?

89
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:24,699
Hey, that wasn't me.

90
00:09:24,699 --> 00:09:27,259
Do you think I'm reckless enough to do something like that?

91
00:09:27,259 --> 00:09:31,099
I just sent a few messages as a joke. I didn't do anything else.

92
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:32,729
I guess we'll see once we investigate.

93
00:09:32,729 --> 00:09:34,919
You can't.

94
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:37,949
There might as well be a red line on my record with the current police investigation.

95
00:09:37,949 --> 00:09:42,049
If anything else gets added, I won't be able to get a job, and my life will be ruined.

96
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:44,439
Would it help if I got on my knees and begged?

97
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:46,199
Forget it.

98
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,649
This is your last chance.

99
00:09:50,649 --> 00:09:53,009
If something like this happens again,

100
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:57,119
I'm going to expose the past incidents and discern right from wrong.

101
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:03,719
Something like this will never happen again. I'm serious.

102
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,579
You'd better make sure it doesn't.

103
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:13,699
Gosh, Kim Jin Il, that f***ing loser!

104

106
00:10:21,219 --> 00:10:24,159
<i>Send me the money after you're done calculating the ticket fees.</i>

107
00:10:24,159 --> 00:10:28,039
<i>That's right. I didn't spend that money. Hey, where'd you get that? Hey, I was too drunk, so I don't even remember–</i>

108
00:10:28,039 --> 00:10:30,709
<i>I'm the only one who knows about this transaction history.</i>

109
00:10:30,709 --> 00:10:32,389
<i>That means...</i>

110
00:10:32,389 --> 00:10:35,909
<i>I'm also the only one who can prove your innocence.</i>

111
00:10:35,909 --> 00:10:38,949
<i>A deposit into your account is such clear evidence.</i>

112
00:10:38,949 --> 00:10:41,549
<i>Without summoning a witness, it'd be tough to get a not-guilty verdict.</i>

113
00:10:41,549 --> 00:10:43,729
<i>It sounds like you're threatening me.</i>

114
00:10:43,729 --> 00:10:46,089
<i>You're meeting Yoo Min?</i>

115
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,629
<i>That's good.</i>

116
00:10:50,129 --> 00:10:52,169
<i>Let's say you're the culprit.</i>

117
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:55,209
<i>- What?
- This isn't a crime.</i>

118
00:10:56,009 --> 00:10:59,059
<i>Isn't this better than becoming a criminal?</i>

119
00:10:59,059 --> 00:11:01,309
Not a crime?

120
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:10,119
The festival marks the end of the first semester's official schedule.

121
00:11:10,119 --> 00:11:12,309
Focus on your studies from now on,

122
00:11:12,309 --> 00:11:14,989
and as soon as summer break starts, we begin our summer training!

123
00:11:14,989 --> 00:11:16,099
Oh, yes!

124
00:11:16,099 --> 00:11:18,329
Aren't you too excited?

125
00:11:28,049 --> 00:11:30,489
- Hello.
- Hello.

126
00:11:34,669 --> 00:11:35,839
Oh, guys.

127
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,019
We need to discuss something.

128
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:38,449
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

129
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,789
- Good job.
- Good job!

130
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:45,509
Sunbae, I just remembered I need to do something urgently. I have to go right now!

131
00:11:45,509 --> 00:11:48,699
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

132
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:52,329
What the? Is she avoiding me?

133
00:11:52,329 --> 00:11:54,049
Wait, why do I have to...

134
00:11:54,049 --> 00:11:56,339
Gosh, you...

135
00:11:58,769 --> 00:12:01,299
- Gosh, I'm so tired.
- Do Hae Yi.

136
00:12:02,219 --> 00:12:05,469
Seon Ja! Hurry up!

137
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:11,459
Is she avoiding me?

138
00:12:14,759 --> 00:12:16,479
Are you happy now?

139
00:12:28,369 --> 00:12:31,999
Hey, will avoiding them solve anything? That's even weirder.

140
00:12:31,999 --> 00:12:35,039
Why? What? I was really natural.

141
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:37,249
They can hear everything!

142
00:12:37,249 --> 00:12:39,799
Why? I was being totally natural!

143
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:41,669
Oh, my gosh.

144
00:12:43,069 --> 00:12:46,109
For this term's final assignment, you are required to write a report

145
00:12:46,109 --> 00:12:49,999
on a day with your partner that costs 5,000 won per person, 10,000 won total.

146
00:12:49,999 --> 00:12:53,769
I chose your partners at random.

147
00:12:57,189 --> 00:12:59,719
- Do Hae Yi.
- Yes.

148
00:12:59,719 --> 00:13:02,009
Your partner is...

149
00:13:03,179 --> 00:13:05,179
Park Jung Woo.

150
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:18,969
Since we have more male students,

151
00:13:18,969 --> 00:13:21,229
those without a partner will

152
00:13:21,229 --> 00:13:25,079
be given a special chance to choose your own dating partner.

153
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:27,489
I'll choose Do Hae Yi.

154
00:13:39,289 --> 00:13:42,779
What an interesting development.

155
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:55,669
Hey, hey.

156
00:13:55,669 --> 00:13:59,849
It's hard to eat if it's round. Cut it into a triangle.

157
00:13:59,849 --> 00:14:02,319
Gosh, I can't believe you're my daughter.

158
00:14:02,319 --> 00:14:04,289
I don't like triangles.

159
00:14:04,289 --> 00:14:06,509
Triangles are totally lame.

160
00:14:07,209 --> 00:14:09,639
Is there a need to live in this world so sharply?

161
00:14:09,639 --> 00:14:12,889
How great would it be if we could all live roundly and get along?

162
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:15,239
What nonsense are you spewing?

163
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:18,709
Why? Are you entangled in a love triangle?

164
00:14:18,709 --> 00:14:19,749
How did you know?

165
00:14:19,749 --> 00:14:22,119
Hey, you make it pretty obvious.

166
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:24,549
When you count your eggs before they hatch, you don't eat eggs.

167
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:27,899
When you get entangled in a love triangle, you don't eat triangle kimbap.

168
00:14:28,739 --> 00:14:30,909
One of them is probably Hwang Jin Hee's son.

169
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,089
Who's the other guy?

170
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:35,699
Hey, is it that young man with the dialect?

171
00:14:35,699 --> 00:14:37,209
Hey, he's cute. I like him–

172
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,579
It's not!

173
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:41,299
Wait, you know that young man who's the captain?

174
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:42,839
He was trying so hard to look cool.

175
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,779
I feel like he'd be strict with his girlfriend.

176
00:14:46,779 --> 00:14:49,229
That's because there was an event that day.

177
00:14:49,229 --> 00:14:53,119
He doesn't try to look cool or anything.

178
00:14:53,119 --> 00:14:55,059
It's him.

179
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:58,939
- No.
- Hey. You're too obvious.

180
00:14:58,939 --> 00:15:01,449
It's pointless for me to be curious.

181
00:15:02,789 --> 00:15:04,339
Well, all right.

182
00:15:04,339 --> 00:15:08,469
He's better than Hwang Jin Hee's son. Yes.

183
00:15:08,469 --> 00:15:11,549
They have nothing to do with your taste.

184
00:15:11,549 --> 00:15:14,049
Then, what's your taste?

185
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:17,310
I don't know.

186
00:15:18,479 --> 00:15:20,169
Wow, my daughter...

187
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,379
You're really experiencing all sorts of things in college, huh?

188
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:25,469
Yeah, go ahead and try out everything you want.

189
00:15:25,469 --> 00:15:27,549
You can kiss,

190
00:15:27,549 --> 00:15:30,229
and do blah, blah, blah...

191
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:33,149
Mom, did you do home shopping?

192
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:35,919
I'm not sure if I'm nearing menopause,

193
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:39,219
but I feel sharp pains in my heart...

194
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:40,939
You should've bought it in moderation.

195
00:15:40,939 --> 00:15:43,699
Even a man could become a woman with all this!

196
00:15:43,699 --> 00:15:45,509
A small amount like that won't cut it.

197
00:15:45,509 --> 00:15:49,459
They said you need to fix the main problem, not a temporary fix.

198
00:15:49,459 --> 00:15:54,099
Are we in the financial state to store and eat a boxful of pomegranate extract?

199
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:58,379
Why bring up our financial state over some pomegranate extract?

200
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:01,299
I'm saying this because you didn't just buy one!

201
00:16:01,299 --> 00:16:03,469
You're being so petty and cheap.

202
00:16:03,469 --> 00:16:04,479
I'll return it!

203
00:16:04,479 --> 00:16:07,579
I can just return it!

204
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:12,539
I was being too wasteful, spending money on unnecessary healthy extract at my age.

205
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:13,859
Fine, I'll return it.

206
00:16:13,859 --> 00:16:17,779
The way I see it, you're going through puberty, not menopause.

207
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,009
When are you going to grow up?

208
00:16:20,009 --> 00:16:22,119
Stop lying around all day and go outside and walk!

209
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:23,779
That's how you can actually maintain your health.

210
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:28,499
You know the way you speak really makes me lose all affection for you sometimes.

211
00:16:28,499 --> 00:16:32,049
It's because you make me do it.

212
00:16:32,049 --> 00:16:34,639
Fine, that's enough. I understand.

213
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,899
I'll take care of it.

214
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,119
Finish what you have first!

215
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:44,369
Aigoo, aigoo. My life...

216
00:16:44,369 --> 00:16:47,899
How dare I think to buy this in my situation?

217
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,349
Ji Young!

218
00:16:54,349 --> 00:16:56,099
- Oh, my gosh.
- Hey, Shin Ji Young!

219
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:57,109
Hold on, hold on!

220
00:16:57,109 --> 00:16:59,189
One minute, just one minute.

221
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:01,369
What are you doing here?

222
00:17:01,369 --> 00:17:03,469
I came because I missed you.

223
00:17:03,469 --> 00:17:04,319
You nutcase.

224
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,089
Hey, go whine to your girlfriend on Lovestagram.

225
00:17:08,089 --> 00:17:10,359
How dare you harass your ex-wife like this, huh?

226
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,709
We're over! We're really over.

227
00:17:12,709 --> 00:17:15,209
She said she didn't like me because I smelled like an old man.

228
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:17,379
I don't smell like an old man. I'm not that bad, am I?

229
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:20,259
- You kind of are.
- I'm sorry! I'm sorry.

230
00:17:20,259 --> 00:17:23,489
I must've been out of my mind to leave a girl like you.

231
00:17:23,489 --> 00:17:25,219
- I only have you.
- Don't touch me!

232
00:17:25,219 --> 00:17:27,449
Stop!

233
00:17:29,299 --> 00:17:31,729
Who the hell are you?

234
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:33,179
Who do you think?

235
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:35,339
I'm her boyfriend.

236
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:42,179
She only has me.

237
00:17:46,579 --> 00:17:48,609
Oh, I-I'm sorry.

238
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:50,699
Hey, I'm s-sorry.

239
00:17:50,699 --> 00:17:52,739
I'm sorry!

240
00:18:03,069 --> 00:18:05,359
"She only has me!"

241
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,479
His expression was...

242
00:18:10,209 --> 00:18:14,409
I mean it didn't feel too bad.

243
00:18:16,479 --> 00:18:20,119
You think I'm pathetic, right?

244
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:25,799
Wandering around like a bum.

245
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,869
I probably seem aimless or without ambitions in life, too.

246
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,869
I definitely went through those times.

247
00:18:35,869 --> 00:18:41,229
A period when all I had was aim and ambitions.

248
00:18:41,229 --> 00:18:43,539
<i>- CEO, I'm going to go home.</i>
<i>- I didn't eat</i>

249
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,999
<i>or sleep, and I only worked myself to death.</i>

250
00:18:46,999 --> 00:18:51,559
<i>Then fortunately, one day, I attained the result I wanted.</i>

251
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,399
And then a terrible incident happened.

252
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:08,259
As you can see, I'm fine now.

253
00:19:09,369 --> 00:19:14,079
Lying on my sick bed, a thought ran through my mind.

254
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:20,679
Why am I living like this for?

255
00:19:20,679 --> 00:19:23,649
So I wanted to get rid of some things

256
00:19:23,649 --> 00:19:27,979
and thought I should live just doing what I wanted.

257
00:19:27,979 --> 00:19:30,269
But...

258
00:19:33,629 --> 00:19:36,769
I didn't know what to do.

259
00:19:39,529 --> 00:19:41,759
Someone like me...

260
00:19:42,969 --> 00:19:45,389
didn't have anything

261
00:19:45,389 --> 00:19:50,859
I could chase, aside from money.

262
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:56,009
That's the kind of man I was.

263
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:00,029
That's why...

264
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,429
That's why I came here.

265
00:20:02,429 --> 00:20:06,729
This was where

266
00:20:06,729 --> 00:20:12,559
my best days and memories existed.

267
00:20:18,109 --> 00:20:21,289
You really lived with all your might.

268
00:20:23,009 --> 00:20:27,369
I mean, everyone probably does, but...

269
00:20:28,099 --> 00:20:30,129
I'm sorry.

270
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:32,660
I spoke too hastily.

271
00:20:43,929 --> 00:20:45,199
What is this?

272
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:48,740
You understand me, right?

273
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:58,350
You're not expecting anyone here tonight, right?

274
00:21:02,389 --> 00:21:04,229
There's no one.

275
00:21:11,629 --> 00:21:13,839
Gosh, I'm hungry.

276
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,649
Should we go to the cafeteria?

277
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:17,609
I want to eat pizza bread.

278
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,629
Should we order some pizza? My treat.

279
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:20,819
Really?

280
00:21:20,819 --> 00:21:23,400
I actually want school food–

281
00:21:24,499 --> 00:21:26,609
Eat the pizza.

282
00:21:26,609 --> 00:21:28,310
Okay.

283
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,540
Is this one pizza per person?

284
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,039

You have your daughter under control, right?

300

She's not someone I can control in the first place.

301

She thinks she's all that.

302
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,629
Tell your son to be careful. She's heaven and earth and everything in between,

Tell your daughter to be careful.

323
00:24:18,209 --> 00:24:19,689
<i>I want to avoid this.</i>

324
00:24:19,689 --> 00:24:23,649
This isn't something you can solve by avoiding it.

325
00:24:23,649 --> 00:24:25,360
What about you?

326
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,199
How are you feeling?

327
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:29,309
I don't know.

328
00:24:29,309 --> 00:24:32,779
I don't know my own feelings, either!

329
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,659
Since things are already like this,

330
00:24:34,659 --> 00:24:38,289
do the date assignment and make up your mind.

331
00:24:38,289 --> 00:24:41,009
If it's Captain or Seon Ho.

332
00:24:41,009 --> 00:24:43,910
Or if it's neither of them.

333
00:24:45,159 --> 00:24:46,239
Make up my mind?

334
00:24:46,239 --> 00:24:50,869
At any rate, you'll have to make a choice in the end.

335
00:24:50,869 --> 00:24:55,690
That's right. Of course, I do. I should.

336
00:25:02,119 --> 00:25:04,999
I just got home, too.

337
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:08,249
<i>Call me before you go to bed, okay? I love you!</i>

338
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:10,240
I love you, too.

339
00:25:19,949 --> 00:25:24,279
You scared me. What are you doing with the lights off?

340
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:28,899
"I love you?" "Muah?"

341
00:25:28,899 --> 00:25:32,549
You're living the life. Dating when you're in 12th grade.

342
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:35,990
What? You dated in 12th grade, too.

343
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:44,099
Am... Am I... the same as you?

344
00:25:44,099 --> 00:25:46,529
Aren't... Aren't you going to med school?

345
00:25:46,529 --> 00:25:48,739
Studying every second isn't enough.

346
00:25:48,739 --> 00:25:50,359
You're slacking.

347
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:53,959
I'll take care of my own business, so you should take care of your own.

348
00:25:53,959 --> 00:25:57,249
You're the one sitting here in the dark like a psycho.

349
00:25:57,249 --> 00:25:59,049
Do you even know what love is?

350
00:25:59,049 --> 00:26:01,660
You're still wet behind the ears.

351
00:26:05,509 --> 00:26:07,400
Hey, Lover Boy!

352
00:26:08,019 --> 00:26:10,039
Get out.

353
00:26:10,039 --> 00:26:12,789
How did you know? That you're in love?

354
00:26:12,789 --> 00:26:14,860
I said, get out.

355
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,929
This is about Joo Seon.

356
00:26:18,929 --> 00:26:21,919
Recently, someone she had a crush on confessed to her.

357
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:26,279
But right before that, she kissed someone else.

358
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:31,119
But now, after everything has happened, she can't really tell who she likes.

359
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,210
Then what should Joo Seon do?

360
00:26:35,009 --> 00:26:38,529
What do you think? She can just meet whomever she likes.

361
00:26:38,529 --> 00:26:41,509
That's what I don't know!

362
00:26:41,509 --> 00:26:42,680
Joo Seon says.

363
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,170
You'll learn soon.

364
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,910
You'll just...

365
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:52,750
naturally realize it at some point.

366
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:02,829
Oppa, you're popular, aren't you?

367
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,889
Oh, me?

368
00:27:03,889 --> 00:27:06,019
You're in the Cheer Squad and you have a good personality.

369
00:27:06,019 --> 00:27:09,279
And looking at you thoroughly, you're a cutie.

370
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,299
Judging by the day of the festival, you seem really popular.

371
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:15,140
Of course! Of course, I am.

372
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:20,649
Did you... like me because I seemed popular?

373
00:27:20,649 --> 00:27:23,229
I never said I liked you.

374
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:26,099
Oh, right. Sorry.

375
00:27:26,099 --> 00:27:27,639
It's nice if you're popular.

376
00:27:27,639 --> 00:27:30,930
It means everyone also thinks you're a good person.

377
00:27:32,439 --> 00:27:37,329
I'm also quite popular. Born to be a star.

378
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:40,240
If the two of us date, would we be a celeb couple, then?

379
00:27:41,499 --> 00:27:44,600
Sure, celebs are great.

380
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:58,849
Oppa. Are you going to the cheer room?

381
00:27:58,849 --> 00:28:00,400
Yeah.

382
00:28:03,079 --> 00:28:06,369
I heard you met Ji Yoon yesterday. You must've been happy.

383
00:28:06,369 --> 00:28:08,840
Yeah, sure.

384
00:28:10,109 --> 00:28:13,160
Are you bothered by what happened during the festival?

385
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:19,430
You just seem a little down since that day.

386
00:28:32,929 --> 00:28:34,859
I'm just embarrassed.

387
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:39,299
Why are you embarrassed? Those people are the ones at fault.

388
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:42,879
Because what they said is true.

389
00:28:42,879 --> 00:28:45,499
I lied.

390
00:28:45,499 --> 00:28:48,159
That my father is Samjeon's CEO.

391
00:28:49,869 --> 00:28:52,209
I didn't mean to lie in the beginning.

392
00:28:52,209 --> 00:28:55,889
I said my dad was Samjin Jokbal's boss at the freshman welcoming party,

393
00:28:56,679 --> 00:29:00,229
but incorrect rumors spread that he was Samjeon's CEO.

394
00:29:00,229 --> 00:29:03,460
But the kids all floated my boat, saying I was all that,

395
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:06,740
so I pretended to be the son of a corporate CEO.

396
00:29:07,429 --> 00:29:09,289
So...

397
00:29:10,029 --> 00:29:12,670
it's not entirely their fault.

398
00:29:17,969 --> 00:29:21,279
- I'm actually a huge attention seeker.
- What?

399
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,049
I actually really wanted attention,

400
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:28,040
but no one paid attention to me, so I joined the Cheer Squad.

401
00:29:29,079 --> 00:29:33,310
Although I still have zero presence here.

402
00:29:35,059 --> 00:29:39,990
So... I know what that feels like.

403
00:29:41,979 --> 00:29:46,149
So you don't need to feel embarrassed. Since I'm like that, too.

404
00:29:51,349 --> 00:29:56,180
You know, I still haven't given up.

405
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,019
I believe

406
00:30:00,019 --> 00:30:04,400
that the day I shine will come one day.

407
00:30:06,189 --> 00:30:07,949
It'll be like that for you, too.

408
00:30:07,949 --> 00:30:13,189
♫ <i>It'll be a memory that will never wear out</i> ♫

409
00:30:13,189 --> 00:30:16,939
My lecture starts soon, so I'll go ahead.

410
00:30:16,939 --> 00:30:20,119
♫ <i>Even if it's the only use</i> ♫

411
00:30:20,119 --> 00:30:25,079
♫ <i>Even if someone laughs at it</i> ♫

412
00:30:25,079 --> 00:30:29,689
♫ <i>I love you</i> ♫

413
00:30:36,310 --> 00:30:38,140
<i>[Kopiko]</i>

414
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:51,819
Eating this is helping me wake up a little. Who wants some?

415
00:30:51,819 --> 00:30:55,309
Is today finally the day? The decisive day for your love.

416
00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:57,779
"The decisive day for your love?" What's that?

417
00:30:57,779 --> 00:31:01,589
Have you heard of this? A love triangle.

418
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:03,409
"A love triangle?"

419
00:31:03,409 --> 00:31:06,819
You see, Hae Yi is a woman with two hearts.

420
00:31:06,819 --> 00:31:09,149
She has two hearts?

421
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,699
One is for...

422
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:14,049
- the tall–
- J-Jae Yi has a girlfriend!

423
00:31:14,049 --> 00:31:15,599
- What?
- What the?

424
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,419
Why does Jae Yi... Since when?

425
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:20,599
I don't know. He said he loves her.

426
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,469
Zero confession and one rejection.

427
00:31:23,469 --> 00:31:26,869
That can't be. That can't be!

428
00:31:26,869 --> 00:31:29,429
See? What did I tell you?

429
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:36,249
So what? You also have an ex-girlfriend, Oppa.

430
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,209
No. It's not something I should care about.

431
00:31:50,209 --> 00:31:51,279
Two hearts doesn't make sense.

432
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,819
I mean it makes sense for this girl.

433
00:31:53,819 --> 00:31:55,419
Theia.

434
00:31:57,190 --> 00:31:59,529
I'll see you later then.

435
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:00,949
Okay.

436
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:06,329
Excuse me, please. Going through.

437
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:07,409
What's going on later?

438
00:32:07,409 --> 00:32:08,870
Hey, I said it's the decisive day for her love–

439
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:12,780
I told you to be quiet! I told you to be quiet, didn't I?

440
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:14,609
Hello.

441
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:18,049
I heard someone needed notes for History of Modern Cinema. Who is it?

442
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,599
It's me.

443
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,629
You know this is a super rare thing, right?

444
00:32:26,629 --> 00:32:30,000
- Thank you.
- It's you, isn't it?

445
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,899
The high school student from three years ago.

446
00:32:32,899 --> 00:32:34,839
Three years ago?

447
00:32:40,790 --> 00:32:42,919
Do I look okay?

448
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,519
Hi.

449
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,099
Hi.

450
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:51,999
Yes, hello?

451
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,109
Hey, Cho Hee. How do I look today?

452
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:03,559
You look mediocre, as usual.

453
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,759
Do I look bad?

454
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,709
Noona. Do I look weird today?

455
00:33:18,709 --> 00:33:20,350
What?

456
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:22,889
Is the shirt's color bad?

457
00:33:22,889 --> 00:33:25,279
Not sure. You look fine to me.

458
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:29,049
Right? Tae Cho Hee always says it's bad.

459
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:31,269
Do you have something important planned?

460
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:37,159
No, I just... have an important assignment.

461
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,949
Jung Woo, I have something to tell you.

462
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,219
You're going to study abroad?

463
00:33:44,219 --> 00:33:49,669
Yes. It's something I had planned already. And, that's why I came back before I left.

464
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:51,849
I felt I needed to wrap things up before I go.

465
00:33:51,849 --> 00:33:55,359
Then, are you not resuming your studies here?

466
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,289
I'm going to start over in a new place.

467
00:34:00,289 --> 00:34:04,039
- But then–
- Soo Il oppa won't do anything anymore.

468
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:06,609
He'll get hurt if he does.

469
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:13,619
I think... it was a good decision to come back.

470
00:34:16,270 --> 00:34:20,849
For the last two years, this place... was what I feared

471
00:34:20,849 --> 00:34:23,429
and didn't want to remember.

472
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:28,129
But now that I'm here, that's not the case.

473
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:35,959
After all, I also had... a lot of good and precious memories.

474
00:34:46,490 --> 00:34:48,299
I'm glad.

475
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:51,979
If I only avoided it out of fear,

476
00:34:53,090 --> 00:34:57,999
even those good times would've been erased as well.

477
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:04,979
I knew it. You're still the same, Noona.

478
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,739
No avoiding and fighting head-on. That's your original style.

479
00:35:21,070 --> 00:35:25,439
Four hours with me and four hours with the Captain from 6 o'clock?

480
00:35:25,439 --> 00:35:28,719
Well, I only had time today because of my part-time job.

481
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:31,539
I planned today's dating course. You're okay with that, right?

Look here. It's the Seven Northern Stars.
<i>(T/N: The Big Dipper or the Plough)</i>

610
00:46:02,970 --> 00:46:06,719
If you connect the seven bright stars, it forms a ladle.

611
00:46:06,719 --> 00:46:11,019
Whoa, I can see it. I see it! This is awesome.

612
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:15,959
So this is the Seven Northern Stars I've only heard about.

613
00:46:15,959 --> 00:46:18,209
But why is it named the Seven Northern Stars?

614
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:22,709
It was derived from a myth about how septuplets became stars in the sky.

615
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:32,939
Would it be true that people become stars when they die?

616
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,109
It's a fact.

617
00:46:36,109 --> 00:46:37,219
Really?

618
00:46:37,219 --> 00:46:39,489
Humans are formed of the same elements that make up stars.

619
00:46:39,489 --> 00:46:44,149
So when we die, we become parts of new stars in the form of atoms.

620
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:47,039
Do you think that's why I was asking?

621
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:49,979
It wasn't?

622
00:46:56,930 --> 00:46:59,209
It's just that...

623
00:47:00,090 --> 00:47:05,199

624
00:47:18,910 --> 00:47:22,969
Then I'd be seeing him up close for the first time in a long time.

625
00:47:31,170 --> 00:47:32,809
He'd be there...

626
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:37,989
saying, "You grew up well."

627
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,829

00:49:26,270 --> 00:49:28,459
<i>I'll be careful from now on.</i>

639
00:49:28,459 --> 00:49:31,669
I was about to confess, and you told me not to.

640
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,329
<i>I think...</i>

641
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:36,509
<i>it'd be better for you not to do it.</i>

642
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:38,149
I did.

643
00:49:38,149 --> 00:49:40,589
But why now, at this point?

644
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:44,449
Didn't it come out of the left field?

645
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:47,049
As if you are playing me.

646
00:49:47,049 --> 00:49:50,099
It can feel like that... in your position.

647
00:49:50,099 --> 00:49:53,159
I'm guessing there's something else in your position.

648
00:49:54,590 --> 00:49:57,139
I was scared.

649
00:49:58,930 --> 00:50:04,079
At first, I was scared because my feelings for you kept growing.

650
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:09,219
After that, I was scared that my feelings for you would make things hard for you.

651
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:14,049
Is this a horror movie? What the heck are you scared about?

652
00:50:14,049 --> 00:50:17,019
You're boxing your own shadow.

653
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:21,019
But what I was scared of the most was...

654
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:28,869
that I might lose you in the end... without being able to say anything to you.

655
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,689
That was most frightening.

656
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:37,089
That I might lose you, who may be

657
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:43,319
the fortune... that may never enter my life again.

658
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:50,849
I'm sorry for causing you confusion. I'm sorry for coming to that conclusion late.

659
00:50:53,610 --> 00:50:58,079
But could you still give me a chance?

660
00:51:04,090 --> 00:51:06,099
It's too late.

661
00:51:29,090 --> 00:51:38,090
♫ <i>It's quite a beautiful thing</i> ♫

662

♫ <i>That you and I met</i> ♫

663
00:51:49,290 --> 00:51:51,229
Let's go. I'll pay for this.

664
00:51:51,229 --> 00:51:53,759
No, it's okay. I'll pay.

665
00:51:57,490 --> 00:52:06,420
Gosh...

666
00:52:08,470 --> 00:52:12,899
What the heck? Who keeps shells in something like that?

667
00:52:12,899 --> 00:52:14,829
Man...

668
00:52:14,829 --> 00:52:18,759
Is it... something important?

669
00:52:19,930 --> 00:52:22,619
I was going to give it to you

670
00:52:23,270 --> 00:52:26,049
for you to leave them where your dad is.

671
00:52:27,389 --> 00:52:32,329
I thought perhaps he would be able to... hear the ocean sounds, at least.

672
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:39,149
<i>Dad was too busy to make a living, so he never got to see the ocean.</i>

673
00:52:39,149 --> 00:52:43,479
<i>I was just not sure if I should be seeing</i>

674
00:52:43,989 --> 00:52:45,749
<i>this good thing alone.</i>

675
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,339
This is what you picked up at the beach that time?

676
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:59,209
But it won't work because it's broken.

677
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:02,459
Give it to me.

678
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,559
No, they're broken, so–

679
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,359
Even so, I'm going to give it to him.

680
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:28,039
It's pretty.

Hey, what are you doing?

So annoying.

<i>You'll just... naturally realize it at some point.</i>

I think it's you.

What is?

704
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:48,219
