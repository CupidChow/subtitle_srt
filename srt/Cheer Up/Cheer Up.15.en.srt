<i>What you all have been waiting for. A trip to Jeju has finally arrived.</i>
<i>[A price you won't believe!]</i>

3
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>Three nights at a hotel and a round-trip flight. A 14 course pass to Jeju's tourist attractions.</i>

<i>- And Chinese cuisine–</i>
- Stop!

5
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:50,608
Wait, hey. Wait, h-hey–

6
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:53,348
I can't keep my eyes off of you for a moment.

7
00:00:53,348 --> 00:00:56,358
It's a special sale. If we don't snatch this deal, we can't go for this price,

8
00:00:56,358 --> 00:00:58,638
so give it back before the broadcast ends.

9
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:01,128
Are we in a situation to go on vacation right now?

10
00:01:01,128 --> 00:01:04,128
Jae Yi's in 12th grade and there are tons of things we need to spend on!

11
00:01:04,128 --> 00:01:09,898
We can go on these when we have the means later.

12
00:01:09,898 --> 00:01:11,598
When?

13
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,478
Life is short.

14
00:01:15,478 --> 00:01:18,338
Waiting for a time when we have the means,

15
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:22,368
and dying before we get to do anything. That's life.

16
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:29,138
I mean...

17
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:34,688
Now it really isn't a good time.

18
00:01:34,688 --> 00:01:38,378
Let's go after Jae Yi's exams are over.

19
00:01:38,378 --> 00:01:41,928
All right. You must be tired. Go wash up.

20
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,508
I'm going to leave this here.

21
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,868
What do I need that for?

22
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:00,568

<i>Why aren't you picking up Auntie's call?</i>

25
00:02:04,878 --> 00:02:06,920
Auntie said she called?

26
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:09,540
I must've not heard the phone while arguing with Mom.

27
00:02:09,548 --> 00:02:14,008
Why is your mom so immature? Aigoo.

28
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,548
<i>Noona, don't be too shocked.</i>

29
00:02:16,548 --> 00:02:19,888
Why? What is it?

30
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:23,058
Did you get into trouble again?

31
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:25,148
<i>Mom...</i>

What?

34
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:41,838
Adjust the training schedule?

35
00:02:41,838 --> 00:02:46,158
But we made this with your schedule in mind. Did your schedule change?

36
00:02:46,158 --> 00:02:50,828
Well, I'm planning on increasing my part-time hours.

37
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,858
Is it possible to make some adjustments?

38
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:59,168
The Yeon-Ho competition is at its last stage, so I can't adjust your schedule only.

39
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:04,668
There's no choice, then. I understand.

40
00:03:04,668 --> 00:03:06,058
Okay.

41
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:19,028
Do Hae Yi,

42
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:22,418
get your head in the game!

43
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:24,498
I'm sorry.

44
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:27,678
Let's take a ten minute break.

45
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,680
- Sam Da.
- Huh?

46
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,650
Is something going on?

47
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,488
- Yeah.
- What is it? What's going on?

48
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,608
Well...

49
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,238
I'll tell you later.

50
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,368
It's nothing serious, right?

51
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,228
Ahjussi, you know how you said
<i>[Cheers]</i>

52
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:22,598
you took time off school to earn money for your father's hospital fees?

53
00:04:22,598 --> 00:04:23,768
I did.

54
00:04:23,768 --> 00:04:25,808
Did it cost that much money?

55
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:30,198
The cost of surgery, chemotherapy, and living expenses during his treatment.

56
00:04:30,198 --> 00:04:35,488
It was quite costly. And at the time, I was the only one who could earn money.

57
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:38,508
And the only jobs you could get at that age

58
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:43,688
were the ones you had to put your time into.

59
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,988
Why do you suddenly ask about that?

60
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:51,238
Nothing! Just.

61
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,108
Welc–

62
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,638
I still have a long way to go before I get off work.

63
00:05:00,638 --> 00:05:01,618
Well...

64
00:05:01,618 --> 00:05:04,668
Surprise!

65
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:11,298
Today's the 100th-day since we started dating, so I asked Young Woong sunbae for permission in advance.

66
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:18,478
Thank you.

Your 100th day gift.

69
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,018
I couldn't prepare anything.

70
00:05:48,018 --> 00:05:52,068
It's okay. I just wanted to do this for you.

71
00:05:52,590 --> 00:05:55,648
I know you don't like celebrating anniversaries,

72
00:05:55,648 --> 00:06:00,128
but I wanted to make this day a good memory for you.

73
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,098
Thank you.

74
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,478
Then I'll buy the meal.

75
00:06:07,478 --> 00:06:10,818
No, I did it because I wanted to. Then I–

76
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:15,688
Why do you do everything by yourself? Let me do something for you, too.

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,118
Let me buy the meal. That will make me feel more comfortable.

78
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:26,748
Gosh...

79
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,068
Thank you for the food.

80
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:43,538
It's delicious!

81
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,028
Eat up.

82
00:06:55,190 --> 00:06:56,340
It's so delicious.

83
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,190
I like it, too.

84
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,008
I'm going to the restroom.

85
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,858
Keep eating.

86
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,278
I'll pay in advance.

87
00:07:20,278 --> 00:07:24,258

90

What about dinner?

91
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,550
I ate.

92
00:07:44,288 --> 00:07:46,208
Good.

93
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:56,228
It's okay.

94
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,278
It's going to be okay.

95
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:04,718
We can just get rid of the disease.

96
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,068
Gosh,

97
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,618
you're right.

98
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:20,188
We can just treat it.

99
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:23,598
Don't worry, okay?

100
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:44,228
Hey, you.

101
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,098
It's okay.

102
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:00,008
Geez.

103

114
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,668
And then I suddenly realized.

115
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,178
Right...

116
00:09:53,178 --> 00:09:57,398
Mom is this sick, and I'm sitting here worried about money.

117
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,928
When Mom is sick.

118
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,168
I didn't like myself for feeling that way.

119
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,858
To be honest, I didn't like Mom for putting me in this situation, either.

120
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:23,338
It must've been hard on you.

121
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,978
I didn't even know that.

122
00:10:26,978 --> 00:10:29,598
Anniversaries and all that...

123
00:10:31,118 --> 00:10:33,168
Like you said,

124
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:36,198
they're supposed to be happy, right?

125
00:10:38,008 --> 00:10:41,538
But you were walking on eggshells the entire day that day.

126
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:44,020
No, it wasn't like that. I was...

127
00:10:45,118 --> 00:10:47,338
just worried because you didn't look too good.

128
00:10:47,338 --> 00:10:50,688
Holding back things you want to do,

129
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:53,780
and continuing to be wary of me.

130
00:10:55,808 --> 00:10:58,838
It'll only get worse from here.

131
00:10:58,838 --> 00:11:01,448
And we'll only get sorrier...

132
00:11:02,718 --> 00:11:05,598
and more unmanageable and difficult.

133
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,190
I never thought that.

134
00:11:08,788 --> 00:11:09,850
If it's because of that–

135
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:11,900
It's difficult for me.

136
00:11:22,768 --> 00:11:25,550
Surgery costs and living expenses...

137
00:11:26,308 --> 00:11:29,578
I need to earn an additional 2 million won per month.

138
00:11:30,438 --> 00:11:33,168
Then I'll have less time.

139
00:11:33,168 --> 00:11:35,198
Even now, we can only briefly see each other at night

140
00:11:35,198 --> 00:11:38,230

I don't like myself who can't do anything for you,

Why? Did Hae Yi dump you because you have no money?

The girl really does like money.

00:13:38,508 --> 00:13:40,558
Oh, my gosh.

167
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:44,530
What am I doing with a drunk kid?

168
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:53,860
She's quitting?

169
00:13:54,818 --> 00:13:57,008
Why would Hae Yi quit all of a sudden?

170
00:13:57,008 --> 00:14:00,900
It's a personal matter. It just ended up like this.

171
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:03,608
What's the personal matter?

172
00:14:04,288 --> 00:14:06,220
Well...

173
00:14:08,508 --> 00:14:11,270
Hae Yi's mom is a bit sick.

174
00:14:22,898 --> 00:14:25,728
I heard Hae Yi's mom is sick.

175
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:27,910
That's right.

176
00:14:28,748 --> 00:14:31,488
God is so cruel, huh?

177
00:14:31,488 --> 00:14:36,208
Raising two kids on her own must've been a meager life.

178
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:38,928
How could he add this to her plate?

179
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:43,760
Speaking of, can't we help them?

180
00:14:48,328 --> 00:14:50,220
Seon Ho,

181
00:14:51,138 --> 00:14:54,318
money matters aren't so...

182
00:14:54,318 --> 00:14:59,070
simply emotional as kids think they are.

183
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:04,478
So the discussion itself could be overstepping boundaries.

184
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,340
Is that so?

185
00:15:09,788 --> 00:15:13,918
What are we going to do about my baby's

186
00:15:13,918 --> 00:15:17,590
soft-heartedness?

187
00:15:20,691 --> 00:15:30,350
♫ <i>We might be quite clumsy when we feel the rhythm</i> ♫

188
00:15:32,678 --> 00:15:36,960
♫ <i>It will be our first and last love</i> ♫

189
00:15:39,788 --> 00:15:43,670
<i>Is kissing a good thing? Do you want to try it?</i>

190
00:15:48,858 --> 00:15:51,148
What is it?

191
00:15:51,148 --> 00:15:55,250
Well, this suddenly started playing.

192
00:16:14,418 --> 00:16:15,768
What is this?

193
00:16:15,768 --> 00:16:17,238
There's somewhere we need to go.

194
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:18,568
Where?

195
00:16:18,568 --> 00:16:23,030
Our final trip.

196
00:16:27,518 --> 00:16:29,070
Let's go.

197
00:16:49,468 --> 00:16:52,078
I've thought about it.

198
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:54,380
How you asked to break up.

199
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,338
I don't think it's right to just break up like this,

200
00:16:58,338 --> 00:17:00,968
but then again, to hold onto you

201
00:17:00,968 --> 00:17:03,820
will make it more difficult for you.

202
00:17:07,668 --> 00:17:10,380
I didn't know what I should do.

203
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,598
So how about...

204
00:17:14,598 --> 00:17:17,828
we observe the situation while taking a break?

205
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,500
- Huh?
- So...

206
00:17:21,388 --> 00:17:24,980
it's like taking a resting period.

207
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,468
- A resting period?
- Yeah.

208
00:17:28,468 --> 00:17:30,218
What do you...

209
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:32,398
Just like taking a leave from school,

210
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:35,720
we'd just be taking a break from dating. Not ending it.

211
00:17:37,148 --> 00:17:42,080
I think... that sounds a bit weird.

212
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,958
You never know.

213
00:17:48,848 --> 00:17:51,960
Instead of making it more difficult for you by staying by your side,

214
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,290
there might come a day when it'd be helpful.

215
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:00,768
Let's take a brief break and see how things go.

216
00:18:00,768 --> 00:18:03,140
And if you still feel the same,

217
00:18:07,738 --> 00:18:10,070
then I'll stop, too.

218
00:18:32,438 --> 00:18:36,328
I had a lot of fun meeting you.

219
00:18:36,328 --> 00:18:37,558
You did?

220
00:18:37,558 --> 00:18:41,430
Thanks. I was happy thanks to you.

221
00:18:42,488 --> 00:18:44,808
But why do you speak in the past tense?

222
00:18:44,808 --> 00:18:49,218
We have a bright future waiting ahead of us.

223
00:18:49,218 --> 00:18:52,008
I mean, you said it was our final trip.

224
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:56,660
Our final trip... as lovers.

225
00:19:07,648 --> 00:19:09,608
Ji Young,

226
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:13,590
will you marry me?

227
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:20,120
Meeting you has made me very happy.

228
00:19:21,148 --> 00:19:24,598
I feel joyful and sad.

229
00:19:24,598 --> 00:19:27,538
I'm overflowing with all sorts of emotions.

230
00:19:27,538 --> 00:19:29,840
I feel alive.

231
00:19:33,248 --> 00:19:35,340
That's why...

232
00:19:35,938 --> 00:19:39,378
I never want to let you go.

233
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:42,298
I feel the same way,

234
00:19:42,298 --> 00:19:45,450
but how can I accept this?

235
00:19:49,898 --> 00:19:53,208
I'm not saying we need to marry immediately.

236
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:58,388
I just ask... you to accept this as a grounds...

237
00:19:58,388 --> 00:20:04,138
for us to trust each other and do our best.

238
00:20:04,138 --> 00:20:07,928
And when the right time comes,

239
00:20:07,928 --> 00:20:11,048
this ring will play its essential role.

240
00:20:11,048 --> 00:20:12,458
But...

241
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:16,148
We took a long and roundabout path.

242
00:20:16,148 --> 00:20:19,418
Let's not give up on this love

243
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,110
we went through a great ordeal for.

244
00:20:32,488 --> 00:20:34,320
It fits perfectly.

245
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,120
I can't take it off now.

246
00:20:39,268 --> 00:20:43,100
Thank you for saying you'll do your best with me.

247
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:52,288
We broke up.

248
00:20:52,288 --> 00:20:53,648
Why did you break up?

249
00:20:53,648 --> 00:20:56,538
It just ended up like that.

250
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:01,458
- Because of me?
- Why would we break up because of you?

251
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:05,358
You're not someone with that much influence.

252
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:13,688
If I take a leave of absence, it'll be hard to see him so I asked him to break up.

253
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:18,418
Hey, why would you take a leave of absence?

254
00:21:18,418 --> 00:21:23,638
Even if we somehow attain the money for surgery, you have to receive chemotherapy, too.

255
00:21:23,638 --> 00:21:25,718
Someone needs to earn living expenses.

256
00:21:25,718 --> 00:21:29,768
I decided to work full-time instead of part-time. Don't worry.

257
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:33,318
You worked so hard to get into this college. Why would you take a leave of absence for this?

258
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:38,058
Did I say I'm going to quit school? I'm just taking a brief break. Don't worry.

259
00:21:38,058 --> 00:21:42,048
Stop the nonsense and continue going to school. I'll do whatever it takes to earn a living–

260
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:44,040
Forget it!

261
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:47,278
You just think about getting better.

262
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:48,868
I'll take care of things.

263
00:21:48,868 --> 00:21:51,208
You're now only 20 years old.

264
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:54,368
Why should you take care of these things? Huh?

265
00:21:54,368 --> 00:21:58,558
Why must you carry the weight of all this? Why?

266
00:21:58,558 --> 00:22:02,628
What else can we do? There's no other way.

267
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,930
I'll find a way. Okay?

268
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,738
I won't become baggage to you two.

269
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:16,198
All right?

270
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:20,238
Go back to school. Okay?

Jin Il sunbae did?

291
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:11,438
I can't believe Jin Il did that.

292
00:25:11,438 --> 00:25:12,958
Has he been arrested by the police?

293
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:16,358
Not yet. He's still on the run.

294
00:25:16,358 --> 00:25:19,838
The last sighting of him was at an Express Bus Terminal.

295
00:25:19,838 --> 00:25:22,838
They think he's headed to the countryside somewhere.

296
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:28,178
But just in case, if you come across Jin Il, report him to the police right away.

297
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,598
Shouldn't we let Hae Yi know? Since Jin Il sunbae kept targeting Hae Yi–

298
00:25:35,598 --> 00:25:38,840
Sunbae, my ass. That crazy psychopath bastard.

299
00:25:39,698 --> 00:25:43,168
It's difficult enough for Hae Yi. Why is he making things harder?

300
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,958
I'll talk to Hae Yi.

301
00:25:46,958 --> 00:25:52,418
The police said they'll keep watch to see if Jin Il appears near Hae Yi,

302
00:25:52,418 --> 00:25:54,688
so don't worry too much.

303
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,198
You must be really shocked.

304
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:09,278
But...

305
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:14,218
why would Jin Il sunbae do that to me?

306
00:26:14,218 --> 00:26:18,688
Regardless of what his reason was, his actions are unforgivable.

307
00:26:18,688 --> 00:26:24,088
From now on, until Jin Il is arrested, the kids will take turns picking you up after work.

308
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:27,918
- What?
- Everyone must be worried about you.

309
00:26:28,530 --> 00:26:30,988
That goes for me, too.

310
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,318
I'm okay, though.

311
00:26:33,318 --> 00:26:36,948
It's just for now. So let's just do that.

312
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,708
Okay.

313
00:26:39,708 --> 00:26:41,738
Oh, and...

314
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,398
this.

315
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:50,318
What is this?

316
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:53,518
Did you make this yourself?

317
00:26:54,490 --> 00:26:56,008
Yeah.

318
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,498
Can't I do this much as a captain?

319
00:27:00,498 --> 00:27:03,568
You made me kimbap as the captain?

320
00:27:03,568 --> 00:27:07,538
Yeah, yeah. Well, it's reasonable for me to take care of the members' snacks.

321
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:11,678
I can't discriminate against an ex-member, can I?

322
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,458
Thanks.

323
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,168
- Well, then, I guess it's okay.
- Let's go together. Good, good.

324
00:27:24,168 --> 00:27:25,268
It's like a double date.

325
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:27,468
- What are you saying?
- Not bad.

326
00:27:27,468 --> 00:27:29,198
Totally.

327
00:27:30,230 --> 00:27:31,938

It's the happiest dream and...

486
00:38:23,088 --> 00:38:24,838
<i>Youth or fighting?</i>

487
00:38:24,838 --> 00:38:28,298
The best challenge I ever took which I don't regret at all.

488
00:38:28,298 --> 00:38:31,218
<i>A goal during my college life?</i>

489
00:38:31,218 --> 00:38:35,078
<i>It's family. Something hot coming up from a corner of your heart.</i>

490
00:38:35,078 --> 00:38:39,728
You know, like a dragon burp? It doesn't sound right, does it?

491
00:38:39,728 --> 00:38:42,408
Work that I want to wrap up nicely this year.

492
00:38:42,408 --> 00:38:46,118
A lucky fortune that I unintentionally happened to earn.

493
00:38:46,118 --> 00:38:48,898
<i>Who is Do Hae Yi to me?</i>

494
00:38:48,898 --> 00:38:51,188
A brave and cute friend.

495
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:56,158
She's very cheerful, laughs a lot and is brave. That's why...

496
00:38:56,158 --> 00:38:57,328
I want to be like her.

497
00:38:57,328 --> 00:38:59,138
A friend who feels like a grown-up.

498
00:38:59,138 --> 00:39:03,148
<i>I'm thankful to Hae Yi for some things and sorry for some other things as well.</i>

499
00:39:03,148 --> 00:39:07,648
It's really cool to see how she works hard

500
00:39:07,648 --> 00:39:11,188
and with a positive outlook.

501
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:16,468
The first woman I have a crush on.

502
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:22,428
Even if she doesn't say anything fancy, I get comforted greatly just by being next to her.

503
00:39:22,428 --> 00:39:24,508
A strong person.

504
00:39:24,508 --> 00:39:27,398
<i>What do you want to tell Hae Yi?</i>

505
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:30,608
Hae Yi! You're cool.

506
00:39:30,608 --> 00:39:34,078
Enjoy the youth in your 20s, – energetically. Fighting!

507
00:39:34,078 --> 00:39:36,518
I'm sure being in the Cheer Squad is tough work,

508
00:39:36,518 --> 00:39:41,718
but let's persevere and blast away all the stages next year with me.

509
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,798
<i>I also wrote this on the rolling paper, but</i>

510
00:39:46,798 --> 00:39:50,228
they say flowers bloom even after a typhoon.

511
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:55,528
I hope you'll bloom beautifully regardless of all the ordeals as well, Hae Yi.

512
00:39:55,528 --> 00:39:58,988
<i>Hae Yi, regardless of the path you choose to walk,</i>

513
00:39:58,988 --> 00:40:01,928
I'll be next to you without changing.

514
00:40:01,928 --> 00:40:06,598
So I hope you'll tell me when you're having a hard time, whatever it is.

515
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:10,018
<i>I'll be next to you every day. I love you.</i>

516
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:15,808
I just wish you would keep smiling, Hae Yi.

517
00:40:15,808 --> 00:40:18,978
<i>Because even just a single creamed bread made you happy.</i>

518
00:40:20,610 --> 00:40:26,508
Laughing over the smallest things, like always. I hope that's how you'll live.

519
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:32,028
Hae Yi, you'll be happy going forward.

520
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:36,618
<i>Hey, Sam Da! Look here.</i>

521
00:40:36,618 --> 00:40:39,158
<i>Our long-awaited 20s.</i>

522
00:40:39,158 --> 00:40:42,800
<i>How do you feel about starting your 20s?</i>

523
00:40:43,688 --> 00:40:48,398
<i>I can clearly see the fun, wild days ahead and</i>

524
00:40:48,398 --> 00:40:51,128
<i>you're a really great kid for having experienced all that.</i>

525
00:40:51,128 --> 00:40:54,968
<i>What's this? Is it a letter you're sending to the future?</i>

526
00:40:54,968 --> 00:40:58,528
<i>I feel like it'll be so much fun, but how are you?</i>

527
00:40:58,528 --> 00:41:01,200
<i>Aren't you crying by any chance?</i>

528
00:41:12,698 --> 00:41:14,808
<i>Do Hae Yi, cheer up!</i>

529
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:18,990
<i>We'll always be with you!</i>

530
00:41:38,398 --> 00:41:40,318
Hae Yi, cheer up.

549
00:43:37,798 --> 00:43:39,608
When did you prepare this?

550
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,250
Come here.

551
00:43:44,418 --> 00:43:46,688
Surprise!

552
00:44:11,738 --> 00:44:13,600
Come on.

553
00:44:32,198 --> 00:44:35,668
It's the profit from today's one-day pub.

554
00:44:35,668 --> 00:44:38,818
Everyone wanted to help out

555
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:42,488
a little bit with your mom's hospital fee.

556
00:44:42,488 --> 00:44:45,868
So I put a little more in there with what they earned.

557
00:44:45,868 --> 00:44:47,898
No, no. It's okay.

558
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:51,580
Take it. You should accept these things.

559
00:44:52,488 --> 00:44:55,988
If someone wants to help you, you accept.

560
00:44:55,988 --> 00:44:58,660
Then you repay them later.

561
00:44:59,638 --> 00:45:04,078
You can just live like that. It's okay to do that. We all

562
00:45:04,078 --> 00:45:06,128
live our lives like that.

563
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,728
Still, only to be taking this...

564
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:11,250
This is what I learned from life.

565
00:45:13,298 --> 00:45:15,038
If you were given this much,

566
00:45:15,038 --> 00:45:16,878
then you want to pay back this much. Just like that

567
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:18,818
life doesn't let you live so that

568
00:45:18,818 --> 00:45:22,720
the calculations are always even like that.

569
00:45:24,748 --> 00:45:28,150
It's okay even if you only receive, Hae Yi.

570
00:45:29,748 --> 00:45:32,648
Just say thank you and accept.

571
00:45:32,648 --> 00:45:36,528
Then later, when you... are able to give back,

572
00:45:36,528 --> 00:45:40,240
give a lot to other people.

573
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,020
You do that.

574
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:06,180
Thank you.

575
00:46:09,308 --> 00:46:12,338
Gosh, I'm too much of a grownup today.

576
00:46:12,338 --> 00:46:17,848
You must've been shocked by my maturity again, weren't you?

577
00:46:17,848 --> 00:46:20,520
It wasn't that much.

578
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:23,268
It wasn't that much?

579
00:46:23,268 --> 00:46:24,840
Yes.

580
00:46:45,058 --> 00:46:47,820
I was going to figure things out alone,

581
00:46:48,478 --> 00:46:51,158
but I get help like this.

582
00:46:51,158 --> 00:46:53,908
I'm glad it was at least

583
00:46:54,528 --> 00:46:56,400
a bit of help.

584
00:46:57,788 --> 00:47:00,948
Don't you even resent me, Oppa?

585
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:04,218
I asked to break up because of my circumstances.

586
00:47:04,218 --> 00:47:07,930
You had asked me at Busan back then...

587
00:47:08,638 --> 00:47:11,558
if I wasn't lonely by myself.

588
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:13,630
<i>Were you lonely?</i>

589
00:47:15,278 --> 00:47:18,498
<i>I was less lonely because I had Jae Yi,</i>

590
00:47:18,498 --> 00:47:21,638
<i>but you were all alone.</i>

591
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,690
<i>So I thought you might've been lonely.</i>

592
00:47:31,288 --> 00:47:33,480
<i>It was okay.</i>

593
00:47:34,148 --> 00:47:37,460
I really thought it was okay back then.

594
00:47:38,638 --> 00:47:41,680
Because I didn't know what it felt like to be with someone.

595
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,240
But...

596
00:47:44,508 --> 00:47:46,950
after meeting you, Hae Yi,

597
00:47:48,338 --> 00:47:51,218
and knowing what it feels

598
00:47:51,218 --> 00:47:54,690
like to be with someone, I had this thought.

599
00:47:57,568 --> 00:47:59,810
The person I am now...

600
00:48:00,528 --> 00:48:04,260
might have found those times lonely.

601
00:48:05,938 --> 00:48:07,768
So then...

602
00:48:09,858 --> 00:48:12,310
Hae Yi must be the same, too.

603
00:48:12,948 --> 00:48:15,638
That's why I wanted to be by your side.

604
00:48:15,638 --> 00:48:18,640
So you can lean on me if you need a place to lean on.

605
00:48:19,658 --> 00:48:21,560
So you won't be lonely.

606
00:48:30,378 --> 00:48:32,450
Please let me be with you.

607
00:48:34,018 --> 00:48:37,180
Wouldn't it be better if two people went through it together?

Why do you worry specifically about just me?

00:50:50,098 --> 00:50:51,868
Because...

642
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:55,188

647
00:51:11,838 --> 00:51:15,418
You've actually dated before, haven't you? You're such a player.

648
00:51:15,418 --> 00:51:16,678
What?

649
00:51:16,678 --> 00:51:21,828
I really won't like it if you go somewhere and flirt like that, you hear?

650
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:28,838
Only flirt with me from now on. You understand?

651
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:33,248
O-Okay.

652
00:51:33,248 --> 00:51:34,598
Let's go.

We're dating. Totally.

658
00:51:53,188 --> 00:51:55,838
Do you want to eat ramen at my house later?

659
00:51:55,838 --> 00:52:01,458
Gosh! If Mrs. Lee Soon Ja wants to treat her son-in-law, she needs to catch a brood hen, doesn't she?

660
00:52:01,458 --> 00:52:03,828
Did we have hen at my house?

661
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:08,188
What?

662
00:52:08,188 --> 00:52:11,008
Oh, nothing. Let's go.

663
00:52:22,780 --> 00:52:23,788
Where's Hae Yi?

664
00:52:23,788 --> 00:52:26,098
Hae Yi said she was going to the restroom.

665
00:52:29,650 --> 00:52:30,738
Why?

666
00:52:30,738 --> 00:52:35,178
Well, it's just that I saw a suspicious-looking person outside.

667
00:52:35,178 --> 00:52:37,178
It couldn't be Jin Il sunbae, could it?

668
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:40,718
Hae Yi wasn't in the restroom, though.

669
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,868
Everyone out!

670
00:52:50,610 --> 00:52:52,098
- Call me right away if you find her!
- Yes, okay!

671
00:52:52,098 --> 00:52:54,258
- Go!
- Geez!

672
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,508
- Do Hae Yi!
- Hae Yi!

673
00:52:59,508 --> 00:53:01,808
Do Hae Yi!

674
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:04,648
We'll go that way.

675
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:05,968
Okay.

676
00:53:05,968 --> 00:53:08,318
<i>[Melona]</i>

677
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:30,938
Yes, Mom. I'll be late tonight. Go to sleep first.

678
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,618
Do Hae Yi...

679
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:52,228
Hae Yi!

680
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:54,898
Do Hae Yi!

681
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:58,828
Sam Da! Did something happen to her?

682
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:00,198
- Hae Yi!
- Sam Da!

683
00:54:00,198 --> 00:54:02,228
Do Hae Yi!

684
00:54:05,530 --> 00:54:07,668
She's not on this side.

685
00:54:08,660 --> 00:54:09,680
Let's look around more.

686
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,180
Okay!

687
00:54:18,260 --> 00:54:20,018
Please...

688
00:54:43,260 --> 00:54:44,998
What the heck?

689
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:08,058
Why are you doing this?

690
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,178
This is all because of you.

691
00:55:10,178 --> 00:55:12,488
What the heck did I do so wrong?

692
00:55:12,488 --> 00:55:15,198
It ended up like this because you did wrong.

693
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,178
Things came this far because you did wrong.

694

<i>If we can recruit just Do Hae Yi,</i>

699

<i>Sunbae, my ass. That crazy psychopath bastard.</i>

704

<i>Let's help her forget what the psychotic bastard did to her.</i>

705
00:56:17,178 --> 00:56:19,518
This is all because of you.

706
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:32,478
You're scared, aren't you, Sunbae?

707
00:56:34,370 --> 00:56:37,798
You didn't know things would get this far, either.

708
00:56:38,510 --> 00:56:41,788
So now... put that knife down and–

709
00:56:41,788 --> 00:56:44,578
Shut up! Shut up!

710
00:56:55,470 --> 00:56:56,948
You...

711
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:03,408
need to die for it to end.

712
00:57:28,860 --> 00:57:30,798
Hae Yi, are you okay?

713
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,988
Hae Yi, run away.

714
00:58:09,710 --> 00:58:11,758
Oppa, are you okay?

715
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:18,728
No... No.

No, no, no, no!

No! No...

718
00:58:24,638 --> 00:58:27,028
No...

719
00:58:27,028 --> 00:58:29,098
No, Oppa, stay with me here.
