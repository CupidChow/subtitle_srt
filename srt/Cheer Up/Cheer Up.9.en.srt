I'll hang it back up before I die. How is it? I look cool, right? It was hanging over there.

All right, I'll take it off.

00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,380
Jin Seon Ho?

328
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:35,430
Yesterday, I saw it on 'Big Forest' before it got deleted. A photo of them hugging!

329
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:39,400
Really? No wonder! It seemed like there was something between them.

330
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,930
Right? They were hugging.

331
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:42,620
Oh, my gosh.

332
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:44,320
Whoa. Gosh, it scared me.

333
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,780
Who's Do Hae Yi?

334
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:52,670
Hey, Ki Woon Chan!

335
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,830
You must be busy.

336
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:00,580
Why don't you tell your father, the CEO of Samjeon, for someone to lend a hand?

337
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,300
Oh, he's not the CEO of Samjeon,

338
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,880
he's the boss at Samjin Jokbal restaurant.
<i>(T/N: Pig's feet)</i>

339
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,030
Do you go around lying to the Cheer Squad that your dad's the CEO of Samjeon, too?

340
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:16,400
Captain's looking for you.

341
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:17,930
Okay.

342
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:22,060
Hang in there.

343
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,010
Get your mythomania treated.

344
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,920
I... you see...

345
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:34,280
You don't need to explain.

346
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:39,890
Don't get worked up by the words of someone who goes out of their way to hurt you.

347
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,450
<i>[3:43 p.m.]</i>

348
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:55,510
Sunbae, I have to go somewhere.

349
00:24:55,510 --> 00:24:57,200
Okay, sure.

350
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:06,820
<i>It's probably a Cheer member.</i>

351
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:11,010
<i>Someone who leaves at 4: p.m.</i>

352
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,060
<i>Please keep an eye out.</i>

353

355
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:57,610
<i>[4:00 p.m.]</i>

356
00:26:08,890 --> 00:26:10,710
I told you not to come!

357
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:15,080
That's ridiculous! How can I let you come here alone?

358
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,110
Nothing happened, right?

359
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:30,620
I was told to give this to you.

360
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,900
<i>[Observatory, requesting delivery to Yoo Min]</i>

361
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,960
- From who?
- It was with the checklist.

<i>[What is Do Hae Yi doing right now?]</i>

363

<i>[What is Do Hae Yi doing right now?]</i>

364
00:26:56,590 --> 00:27:00,800
- Where's Hae Yi?
- Hae Yi? Is she in the waiting room?

365
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,280
Hae Yi isn't picking up.

366
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:05,550
I'll go to the waiting room, can you search the Cheer room?

367
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,680
Yeah.

368
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,500
If anyone sees Hae Yi, tell them to contact me.

369
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,230
O-Okay.

370
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,900
One, two, three!

371
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:19,270
Gosh. It changed to four beats, so you can't do it like that.

372
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,440
Do you think this will work?

373
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,100
You need to make it work!

374
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,840
One, two, three!

375
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,670
Not this. Both hands on three.

376
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:32,800
All right?

377
00:27:39,750 --> 00:27:41,760
Do Hae Yi... She's not here?

378
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,030
What? Yes.

379
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,720
You don't know where Hae Yi is?

380
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,870
Hae Yi?

381
00:27:58,210 --> 00:28:00,570
Should I try again?

382
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,400
Okay. One.

383
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,980
<i>[Captain]</i>

00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:07,730
<i>[Missed calls]</i>

385
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,810
Drum... Oh, drums.

386
00:28:14,810 --> 00:28:17,090
When will it be done?

387
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:22,970
This is my first time. So it's going to take some time. Stop rushing me! You're making me nervous, too.

388
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:24,580
Okay!

389
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,330
E, C...

390
00:28:26,330 --> 00:28:28,830
So when will it be done?

391
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:32,550
Stop.

392
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:42,230
The person you like... P-Park Jung Woo. It's him, isn't it?

393
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,920
No! It's not.

394
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:48,370
Is that so?

395
00:28:49,630 --> 00:28:51,770
- That's a relief.
- Why?

396
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:53,280
What's a relief?

397
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,930
I don't think you two will work out.

398
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:56,620
Why?

399
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:06,460
I mean, I'm not... interested in Captain, but...

400
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:10,630
why don't you think it will... work out with Captain?

401
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:13,450
That's what I'm curious about.

402
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:18,920
Just because. It seems like he holds the key, but I don't think he'll make a move.

403
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,040
What are you guys doing?

404
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,750
Senior.

405
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,570
As expected, you're better. Much better!

406
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:41,980
By the way, didn't you two break up?

407
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:44,940
Kids these days are different from us back in the day.

408
00:29:44,940 --> 00:29:47,620
It's all over anyway.

409
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:53,350
I'm not so sure. I think one side still has lingering feelings.

410
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:57,050
Whatever.

411
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,740
Okay, there. All done.

412
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,790
Thank you.

413
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:03,990
- I wish you good luck.
- Okay!

414
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,940
Do Hae Yi!

415
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,620
Are you okay? Did anything happen to you?

416
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,590
What would happen? Is there something wrong?

417
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:23,080
I couldn't reach you. Where were you?

418
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,430
Oh, well...

419
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:29,180
I'm sorry.

420
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,000
I stepped out... and didn't realize the time.

421
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,030
I told you, you shouldn't disappear without a word during the festival.

422
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm sorry.

423
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,560
At least pick up your phone! If you get into an accident...

424
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,300
Everyone could've been inconvenienced by you in this situation.

425
00:30:47,050 --> 00:30:49,670
Do you lack even that much sense?

426
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:53,720
I'm disappointed.

427
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,900
Jung Woo!

428
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,300
It's a relief that nothing happened.

429
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,000
Noona, stop doing such dangerous things like that.

430
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,320
I'll catch them.

431
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:22,780
- But–
- That bastard played with us!

432
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:30,810
It seems he wants a game, so I'll give him a game.

433
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:48,570
They even arranged the new song with the second song.

434
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,410
They're trying very hard.

435
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,440
But it'll be hard to put them onstage, right?

436
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,540
Captain!

437
00:32:00,540 --> 00:32:02,760
What should we do?

438
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,380
One of the performers didn't show up.

439
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:12,210
Hey, hey, Jae Yi! Jae Yi, look at that. Look at that.

440
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:14,140
They have all sorts of things.

441
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,400
Oh, my gosh. What in the world.

442
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,690
They're throwing a festival for kids in the festive ages.

443
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:21,040
Good times, right?

444
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,340
Hey, Jae Yi.

445
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:25,290
Why aren't you acting your age?

446
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,090
For me, coming here at my age,

447
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:30,530
my heart's fluttering, and I love it.

448
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,060
It's because of your age.

449
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,660
What's wrong with my age?

450
00:32:35,710 --> 00:32:39,820
Tell Noona that you're sorry today.

451
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:44,920
If she offers a hand first, just let it slide and reconcile, okay?

452
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,670
Okay? Okay?

453
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,760
Hey, are you a clam like your noona said?
<i>(T/N: Refers to keeping his mouth shut.)</i>

454
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:56,850
A no-show today doesn't make sense.

455
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:58,810
Their earlier schedule got delayed.

456
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,630
And it's a broadcast, so they can't just leave.

457
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,300
Let's pull up the later sequences and increase the number of Cheer songs.

458
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:05,190
Due to our new song being canceled,

459
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:07,840
we're barely keeping up with the last-minute songs as it is.

460
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,480
God, I'm going nuts.

461
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,740
They made such a fuss last year over how lame we were,

462
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,970
but if something goes wrong this year, too, we're really...

463
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:23,480
Let's put the newbies onstage.

464
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,480
Are you kidding?

465
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,230
How can we put a song the newbies made today onstage?

466
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:30,300
Yeah, that's too much.

467
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,540
They incorporated the forms and lyrics from our new song,

468
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,070
so there's not much difference.

469
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:40,500
But can the newbies properly handle the sudden change in song?

470
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,260
It's difficult.

471
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,370
<i>I'm disappointed.</i>

472
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,030
Sam Da.

473
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:03,970
I'm sorry. You got in trouble all by yourself.

474
00:34:03,970 --> 00:34:05,500
No, no.

475
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,400
It's fine.

476
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:12,920
But we went through all this trouble and still failed.

477
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,950
I know...

478
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:19,770
Gosh, was it too much, as Kim Min Jae said?

479
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:37,310
Today's your first event and the first Cheer festival.

480
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:41,020
And today might be the day of all your hard work

481
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:45,780
is compensated as promised during our first meeting as a squad.

482
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,020
Why did you bring these out?

483
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:05,440
Today's new song performance will be showcased by you.

484
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,540
<i>What?</i>

485
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:10,930
<i>It's difficult.</i>

486
00:35:10,930 --> 00:35:15,510
I know it's difficult, but can't you trust us just this once?

487
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:18,480

00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:16,280
is a little scary, shall I say it?

643

♫ <i>I'll be on your side</i> ♫

644

Allowing girls to come to me and go as they please is my life's motto.

645
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,110
However,

646
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:34,130

00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:44,030
for the first time in my life,

650
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:47,800
I'm going to try having a crush.

653

Okay, we have the final song left.

654
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:30,400
I'd like to take this opportunity to say something personal, although I know it's rude.

655
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:35,620
As you all know, there's a person who sent strange messages to the Cheer Squad.

656
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:40,650
If the person who sent those trashy messages is here, I'd like to say this.

657
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:46,060
If you have something to say, come say it to my face instead of hiding like a coward.

658
00:49:46,060 --> 00:49:49,160
If you have any complaints, please come to me.

659
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:54,630
Don't go to anyone else, but be sure to... come find me.

660
00:49:56,820 --> 00:50:01,450
That's enough chatting. Let's gather the rest of our energy and start the last song.

661
00:50:01,450 --> 00:50:05,690
Strongest cheer song on Earth... No, the strongest in the universe...

662

By the way, your uniform earlier, Captain...

701
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:27,370
Exactly! How can your uniform give like that? Did you gain some weight, Captain?

702
00:53:27,370 --> 00:53:30,180
So he tore his uniform and tore up the stage, too.
