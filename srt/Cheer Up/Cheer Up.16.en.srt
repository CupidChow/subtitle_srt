00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,494
you didn't even pick up!

170
00:13:20,494 --> 00:13:22,460
Aigoo, gosh.

171
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:28,584
Hey, it's nothing to cry this much about.

172
00:13:28,584 --> 00:13:30,794
Mom, you...

173
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:33,804
Aigoo, you're such a baby, my baby.

174
00:13:33,804 --> 00:13:37,794
In case you were having those weird thoughts,

175
00:13:37,794 --> 00:13:40,294
just like when Dad died, I...

176
00:13:40,294 --> 00:13:44,204
Do you– Do you know how worried I was?

177
00:13:44,204 --> 00:13:47,030
I know everything!

178
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:48,180
What?

179
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:51,774
I do remember everything!

180
00:13:51,774 --> 00:13:57,354
Mom, I remember how you left...

181
00:13:57,354 --> 00:14:01,214
leaving behind Jae Yi and me.

182
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:33,830
<i>[I'm sorry.]</i>

183
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:41,584
<i>[I'm sorry. Please take care of Hae Yi and Jae Yi.]</i>

184
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,820
<i>Mom, I want to eat tteokbokki.</i>

185
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,490
<i>Tteokbokki? Okay.</i>

186
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:49,424
<i>Okay.</i>

187
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:10,924
<i>Mom!</i>

188
00:15:10,924 --> 00:15:14,284
<i>Mom, Mom!</i>

189
00:15:14,284 --> 00:15:16,114
<i>- Mom...
- Hae Yi!</i>

190
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:21,824
<i>Where did you go?</i>

191
00:15:21,824 --> 00:15:24,374
<i>Mom!</i>

192
00:15:24,374 --> 00:15:26,064
<i>Mom...</i>

193
00:15:26,064 --> 00:15:27,984
<i>- It's okay. It's okay.
- Mom, where did you go?</i>

194
00:15:27,984 --> 00:15:32,124
<i>Aigoo. It's okay.</i>

195
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,674
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

196
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,534
<i>Mom is so sorry.</i>

197
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,804
Mom is so sorry.

198
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:56,194
I'm really sorry, Hae Yi.

199
00:15:56,194 --> 00:16:01,254
Don't leave me behind. Don't leave us behind!

200
00:16:01,254 --> 00:16:04,074
Okay, okay.

201
00:16:04,074 --> 00:16:07,704
Mom absolutely won't go anywhere. Don't you worry. I won't go.

202
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:11,874
I won't go. Where can I go without you two?

203
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,804
Hae Yi, okay? Don't cry.

204
00:16:16,804 --> 00:16:19,384
Back then...

205
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:23,404
I must've really lost my mind

206
00:16:23,404 --> 00:16:26,614
after your dad passed away.

207
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,124
But it's also you two who made me wake up. You know?

208
00:16:37,124 --> 00:16:41,764
After that time, I've never had even a similar thought again.

209
00:16:41,764 --> 00:16:44,104
Gosh.

210
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:52,464
Don't worry about it. I really won't die.

211
00:16:52,464 --> 00:16:58,194
I'm going to see you two age and become grandma and grandpa before I go.

212
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:03,584
Of course, you should.

213
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:07,334
Yes. Just trust me.

214
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,234
But where have you been?

215
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,784
What?

216
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,654
Oh, Tongyeong.

217
00:17:20,654 --> 00:17:21,844
Tongyeong?

218
00:17:21,844 --> 00:17:24,424
I went to your oldest uncle's house.

219
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:29,104
Why there? You had cut off your ties with Uncle.

220
00:17:29,104 --> 00:17:31,184
To get money.

221
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:35,534
<i>Gosh, give it to me!</i>

222
00:17:35,534 --> 00:17:40,364
<i>Does it make sense for you to ask for your share of the inheritance now?</i>

223
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:44,044
<i>Gosh, I came in person to save some time.</i>

224
00:17:44,044 --> 00:17:47,744
<i>They said I can receive at least half if I go to court with this.</i>

225
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:51,064
<i>It'll take some time, but let's take it to court, then.</i>

226
00:17:51,064 --> 00:17:56,494
<i>As you can see, I screwed up my business and this apartment which is completely on loan is all I have left.</i>

227
00:17:56,494 --> 00:17:58,764
<i>- I mean–
- Even if you shake me upside down, there is nothing.</i>

228
00:17:58,764 --> 00:18:00,764
<i>J-Just to live like...</i>

229
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:06,004
<i>If you lived with so much greed, you should at least be well-off. Gosh, seriously.</i>

230
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:11,304
<i>Did you take all the money for yourself to live alone like this? I'm going to sue you.</i>

231
00:18:11,304 --> 00:18:16,174
<i>I'm going to get that money somehow, no matter what. Just wait and see.</i>

232
00:18:16,174 --> 00:18:20,214
<i>It'll be enough for the surgery, at least. Take it.</i>

233
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:25,784
<i>Live. Make sure you live.</i>

234
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:38,204
I think this money can more or less cover the surgery.

235
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,644
So you return to school, okay?

236
00:18:43,644 --> 00:18:46,984
I can use the money I was saving for the surgery for living expenses.

237
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:49,434
That's also on loan, though.

238
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:52,824
Instead of taking your future out on a loan,

239
00:18:52,824 --> 00:18:55,984
it's way better to take some money on loan.

240
00:18:55,984 --> 00:18:59,224
How are you going to handle it later?

241
00:18:59,224 --> 00:19:01,204
You see...

242
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:04,544
I was really happy back then.

243
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,284
Back when?

244
00:19:06,284 --> 00:19:08,634
The day of your school festival.

245
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,734
You were like...

246
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,204
jumping around...

247
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:23,284
so happily on the stage and

248
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:25,584
I was really happy.

249
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:27,884
"Right...

250
00:19:27,884 --> 00:19:32,344
Hae Yi used to like this stuff a lot.

251
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:36,794
She gets to do these things now," is what I thought.

252
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:47,954
Do you know when my heart breaks the most?

253
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,654
It's when you try to

254
00:19:54,654 --> 00:19:57,984
shoulder this and that all by yourself.

255
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:02,444
A child should've grown up like a child.

256
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,434
But I feel like I raised you too much like an adult.

257
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,224
Hae Yi...

258
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:16,424
Let Mom do a parent's job.

259
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,694
That's how you and I can live on.

260
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,440
But still...

261
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,090
It's okay. Hey, don't worry.

262
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,844
I'm able to do that. Okay?

263
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:35,704
Here.

264
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,994
Thank you.

265
00:20:49,994 --> 00:20:52,274
I should be thanking you.

266
00:20:52,274 --> 00:20:56,040
You worked so hard, Hae Yi.

267
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:01,084
I'm sorry. I mean it. Don't cry, Hae Yi.

268
00:21:01,084 --> 00:21:06,474
Don't cry. Stop now. Don't cry, okay?

269
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,274
I can't.

270
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:17,804
My Hae Yi is such a crybaby.

271
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,804
Don't cry.

272
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:26,464
Now, you all rested a lot while I was gone, right?

273
00:21:26,464 --> 00:21:30,264
Starting today, we're going to resume training hard, so prepare yourselves.

274
00:21:30,264 --> 00:21:34,134
Captain, I think it'd be better for you to rest a little longer. Your body always comes first.

275
00:21:34,134 --> 00:21:38,814
Statistically, it takes about a week for your stitch to heal–

276
00:21:38,814 --> 00:21:44,294
Now, Captain has returned and let's go on the last spurt until the Yeon Ho competition.

277
00:21:44,294 --> 00:21:46,414
<i>Okay!</i>

278
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:49,314
Hey, it's snack time!

279
00:21:49,314 --> 00:21:51,354
- What's this now?
- Let's eat, let's eat.

280
00:21:51,354 --> 00:21:53,734
We're going to train right after, so hurry up and eat, all right?

281
00:21:53,734 --> 00:21:55,404
Okay.

282
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:00,114
This is Sam Da's favorite.

283
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,684
We'd be complete only if Hae Yi was here.

284
00:22:03,684 --> 00:22:05,474
That's true.

285
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,054
You're all slacking off!

286
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,464
Sam Da!

287
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,750
What's this?

288
00:22:16,324 --> 00:22:18,184
Is it okay for you to lack a fighting spirit?

289
00:22:18,184 --> 00:22:19,634
What's this? How did this happen?

290
00:22:19,634 --> 00:22:21,434
What's going on?

291
00:22:22,270 --> 00:22:24,364
I've come back again.

292
00:22:24,364 --> 00:22:28,954
Come on! Why didn't you tell me?

293
00:22:28,954 --> 00:22:31,754
- Gosh, did you decide to do it again?
- Yes.

294
00:22:31,754 --> 00:22:32,790
I'm glad you came.

295
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:35,260
<i>I'm glad you came.</i>

296
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:38,194
Gosh! Unni, I'm stuck here!

297
00:22:38,194 --> 00:22:40,734
We're all here.

298
00:22:41,584 --> 00:22:45,104
The whole group is finally here. Let's all go to the Yeon Ho competition!

299
00:22:45,104 --> 00:22:47,274
<i>Let's go!</i>

300
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,914
We need to do the Yeon Ho competition.

301
00:22:49,914 --> 00:22:52,714
- There, there.
- How do you do it?

302
00:22:52,714 --> 00:22:55,754
♫ <i>And cry</i> ♫

303
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:58,174
Gosh, that's funny.

304
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:05,044
Hey, people would say you came for a luxury vacation here.

305
00:23:07,634 --> 00:23:09,874
Aigoo, I came to the hospital and

306
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:13,534
stopped by because I heard you were hospitalized.

307
00:23:13,534 --> 00:23:17,424
- I see.
- How is your daughter doing?

308
00:23:17,424 --> 00:23:21,124
- Hae Yi?
- I heard she was almost stabbed.

309
00:23:21,124 --> 00:23:24,754
Luckily, she wasn't hurt anywhere. She's okay.

310
00:23:27,244 --> 00:23:31,804
Seon Ho wants to keep doing the Cheer Squad, where that crazy guy roams around.

311
00:23:31,804 --> 00:23:34,254
Hey, even Hae Yi is doing it. So what?

312
00:23:34,254 --> 00:23:38,854
What? Hey, you let her do it? When Hae Yi was hurt because of it?

313
00:23:38,854 --> 00:23:41,304
I mean, well...

314
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,454
I think she gained more things by doing it.

315
00:23:44,454 --> 00:23:48,964
How could she possibly have gained something besides getting hurt?

316
00:23:48,964 --> 00:23:55,980
Hey, Hae Yi has always talked about money ever since she was young.

317
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,574
It's probably because she was raised by lacking parents, but

318
00:23:59,574 --> 00:24:02,204
I was worried because she'd never stop talking about money.

319
00:24:02,204 --> 00:24:05,264
Afraid she might live a life of only wanting money.

320
00:24:05,264 --> 00:24:09,374
However, she changed a lot after doing the Cheer Squad.

321
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:12,874
You know, those things like romantic ideals and stuff.

322
00:24:12,874 --> 00:24:18,294
She began to learn about those things. I was so happy that Hae Yi could experience that in life.

323
00:24:18,294 --> 00:24:21,404
When I look at you like this...

324
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:25,324
you have a naïve side to you.

325
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,234
Does romantic ideals keep your stomach full?

326
00:24:28,234 --> 00:24:30,374
Hey, because I'm naïve,

327
00:24:30,374 --> 00:24:34,360
I'm still alive like this even after those harsh years.

328
00:24:34,924 --> 00:24:38,134
How can a person only live on food?

329

Stuff like that also has their time, don't you think?

You also saw how the kids were so happy at the festival.

336
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:34,144
You did well cleaning up shit this year although you could've done better.

337
00:25:34,144 --> 00:25:37,204
I'll clean up the rest next year myself.

For what, out of nowhere?

340
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:48,784
You joined the Cheer Squad this year to help me. You were great.

341
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:50,084
You do know, huh?

342
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:52,374
Of course, I do.

343
00:25:52,374 --> 00:25:56,694
Still, I think joining the Cheer Squad this year was a great decision.

344

346
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:10,464
Not sure. I'll need to think about that.

347
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:17,054
Hey, I can't help but be curious. Why did you say you were going to do this?

348
00:26:17,054 --> 00:26:19,504
You don't like group activities and stuff, do you?

349
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,954
Because it's cool?

350
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,354

By the way, I didn't think you'd stay until the end like this.

358
00:26:54,524 --> 00:26:57,824
I thought you'd leave right after getting rejected by Hae Yi.

359
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,474
I also didn't know that I had this much backbone.

360
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,654
Something like a new discovery about myself, I'd say?

361
00:27:04,654 --> 00:27:08,404
Could it be... because of me?

362
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:14,584
Everyone's like that. They can't free themselves after falling for my charms.

363
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:19,104
I guess Cho Hee didn't fall for those charms, though. In my opinion, you're too–

364
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:22,814
That's enough. You and I are more or less the same. What advice can you possibly give me?

365
00:27:22,814 --> 00:27:24,564
Hey, you and I are quite different.

366
00:27:24,564 --> 00:27:28,424
We're both in the same boat, aren't we?

367
00:27:28,424 --> 00:27:30,434
Our heights are also similar.

368
00:27:30,434 --> 00:27:32,074
We're not similar at all.

369
00:27:32,074 --> 00:27:33,914

<i>[2019 Yeon Ho

373
00:27:50,444 --> 00:27:52,614
a thought crossed my mind.

374
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,754
"You never know what could happen in a person's life, when and how."

375
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,380
That's true.

376
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,440
Honestly...

377
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,794
I had something I wanted to do after finishing the Yeon Ho competition stage in a sweep.

378
00:28:06,794 --> 00:28:10,764
But, I'm going to do it now instead of putting it off.

379
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,524
What is it?

380
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:16,024
I...

381
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,904
I like you.

382
00:28:26,650 --> 00:28:29,354
You said to me that...

383
00:28:29,354 --> 00:28:33,024
you believe that I'll shine someday.

384
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,774
I think it was from then that I started to look at you right.

385
00:28:37,774 --> 00:28:40,604
And starting at some point,

386
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:45,654
I have already started to see you shine.

387
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:51,334
It might feel sudden to you, but

388
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,254
So Yoon,

389
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,044

- I can't have this. I should watch it.

Okay.

401

403

404
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,574
Honestly...

405
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:16,134
I didn't understand why people joined the Cheer Squad, which is useless for making a living.

406

You know, I think I now know why people do this Cheer Squad thing.

407
00:30:25,744 --> 00:30:29,664
You wonder why you're going through all that hardship,

408
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:32,024
but there comes a moment that makes you forget all that.

409

Aigoo, it's nice.

What's nice?

412
00:30:41,514 --> 00:30:44,634
The fact that we both felt the same thing.

Honestly, I wasn't going to say it because it sounds like bragging.

Well, that was nonsense. Everyone's alive and well.

<i>[Only one of them dies.]</i>

Dying of loneliness means?

730
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,504
It means that a person remains single alone,

731

in a hell of couples.

732

That's also incorrect, though.

Those one, two, and three are single. Not just one.

Hey, why do you need to say it like that?

735

- Nothing.

802
00:54:12,314 --> 00:54:14,374
I was thinking of the past.
