That must be her car.

Hey, why are you walking around like an idiot?

00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:10,640
What is that touch?

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,310
- What?
- Are they dating?

8
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,770
Wow! How did you know just by looking at that?

9
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:19,600
Wow, daebak! I just guessed.

Huh?

16

If there's a CC in the Cheer Squad, do they really need to leave?

We're talking about human emotions.

18
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,420
I just wondered if forbidding it would make a difference.

19
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,740
Well...

20
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:07,190
Why? Do you have an issue with that?

21
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:09,640
No, I was just curious.

22
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:13,170
There must've been at least one CC until now.

23
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,230
We'll need to talk about this matter in more detail–

24
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,650
According to the workload and systematic nature of the Cheer Squad,

25
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,190
we prohibit dating within the squad since it'll only create problems.

26
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:23,780
Then I guess...

27
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:26,180
You wouldn't date someone within the squad.

28
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,860
Yeah.

29
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,320

- What should we do after?
- Does this mean you aren't leaving the squad?

40
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,700
Yeah, I'm going to try a bit longer.

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,930
Good thinking!

42

I can't believe Hokyung's captain and our captain are dating.

This was the most shocking news recently.

46

I commend myself for being at the amphitheater at that time.

Why are you so down now?

52

Are you bipolar?

53

I think I have a condition.

- Narcissism.

Oh, that?

64
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,690
- Did you ask because of me–
- I just asked because I was curious.

65
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:44,000
You already rejected me.

66
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,370
Right? Exactly! I was just making sure it wasn't because of me.

Don't worry. I won't leave because of you.

Yeah, of course. Why would you?

69

- There's kimchi soup today!
- Pass, I don't like kimchi soup.

But Ha Jin noona won by a landslide.

To be honest, there weren't many female captains in the past.

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,060
- Cho Hee noona became so determined to become–

Thank you for your hard work.

163
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:44,960
What a refreshing possession.

164
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,580
I'll hold it open for you.

165
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,800
Thank you.

166
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,800
Take care.

167
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:03,970
- Oh, no.
- Excuse me.

168
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,830
- Why? Why? Why?
- Here, here.

169
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,480
Why– Oh, my!

170
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,620
Why would you put that in my–

171
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:11,220
Son, you're home? You're early.

172
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,180
Are you going somewhere, Mom?

173
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,000
No, I'm also on my way back from somewhere.

174
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,040
Get on.

175
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,920
- Madam, you can't just–
- Ahjumma, you're not getting off?

176
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,000
I thought you were getting off.

177
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,120
Oh, I see.

178
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,890
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

179
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,080
He must be your son.

180
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,360
Gosh, he looks like his dad.

181
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,990
Goodbye.

182
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:48,490
What kind of situation is this?

183
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:51,730
Gosh, it's heavy.

184
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:53,920
<i>[Total: 1,900 won]</i>

185
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,240
Okay, your payment is complete.

186
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,110
- Thank you.
- Sure, thank you.

187
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:58,420
Goodbye.

188
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,490
Okay!

189
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:02,450
Welcome–

190
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:06,320
What are you doing here?

191
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,760
I'm filling in for a part-timer.

192
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:19,340
Do you need a bag?

193
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,680
Yeah, give me a bag.

194
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,960
It's 7,750 won.

195
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:30,630
I'm totally open to blind dates.

196
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:33,300
There's no need for you to meddle.

197
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,000
The rich are stingier.

198
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,240
What?

199
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,380
Your payment is complete.

200
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,220
Did I make a mistake yesterday when I was drunk?

201
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:47,090
No, of course not.

202
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:48,630
You don't make mistakes.

203
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:50,490
You're certain about everything, Captain.

204
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,820
Take care.

205
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,260
What the hell, punk?

206
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:06,910
You're on my way!

207
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,490
Another drink!

208
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,800
M... callan?

209
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,050
<i>[1,150,000 won]</i>

210
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,400
What?

211
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:26,660
Why is a bottle of alcohol so expensive?

212
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:28,870
Gosh.

213
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:36,250
All right.

214
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,790
Hi, my daughter.

215
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,280
Why? Why? What? Why?

216
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,170
Aigoo!

217
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,550
For the 101st time, would you like to hear me

218
00:13:57,550 --> 00:13:59,610
repeat myself about how the cost of cigarettes and

219
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:02,870
the treatment of health conditions induced by smoking affect our household?

220
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:07,220
I quit! I quit, but... today was just so... so...

221
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,210
Something really annoying happened today.

222
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,630
Sure, hand it over.

223
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:14,070
I didn't even get to light it.

224
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:15,800
Gosh...

225
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:23,170
Here.

226
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,790
That'll do, right?

227
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:29,840
What the?

228
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,090
Don't you know the penalty fee is 50,000 won?

229
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,340
I emptied it. Everything, everything.

230
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,280
I emptied everything. Give me a discount.

231
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:38,940
Okay. It's supposed to be 19,300 won, including this,

232
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,640
but you can send me 19,200 won.

233
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,530
Hey, can't you just let it slide? Hey!

234
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:46,240
Gosh! She's really...

235
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,010
God, she must take after me. Why is she so smart?

236
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,820
Hey, wait for me!

237
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:55,000
I said, wait for me!

238
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,960
Were you rejected again?

239
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,440
Why would I?

240
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,580
Why would I get rejected?

241
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,980
You look like you were rejected.

242
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:14,900
You count your grains of rice every time you get rejected.

243
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,580
Gosh, when did I ever?

244
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:19,470
You know, when you were in the first grade...

245
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:22,700
<i>Hae Yi, you're here? Let's eat this.</i>

246
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:26,130
<i>Hey, the sweet potatoes that you like.</i>

247
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:27,990
<i>I won't eat it.</i>

248
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,370
<i>Why? Eat it!</i>

249
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:34,950
<i>How can love change?</i>

250
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,140
<i>Eat it!</i>

251
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,930
<i>You were rejected by Young Chil or Ddaeng Chil or whatever.</i>

252
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,990
<i>You'd cry for days and wouldn't even eat.</i>

253
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,520
<i>And in your first year of middle school,</i>

254
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:53,180
<i>you followed a Buddhist oppa into a Buddhist club</i>

255
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,080
<i>Eat!</i>

256
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,570
<i>and when he said he'd become a monk, you declared you'll become one, too.</i>

257
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,350
<i>And you only ate grass for the next few days.</i>

258
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:01,640
<i>You're really not going to eat this, right?</i>

259
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:10,430
<i>How can I win against Buddha?</i>

260
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:16,070
<i>Eat it, eat it, eat it. It's good, right?</i>

261
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:17,990
<i>It's good.</i>

262
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,220
<i>It's fine. It's fine.</i>

263
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,530
<i>The moment you lost your appetite,</i>

264
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:25,670
<i>it meant you've been rejected by someone.</i>

265
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:30,280
Hey, your sister is diligent in various aspects.

266
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:34,800
She'd make time from her busy schedule and diligently go around getting rejected.

267
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,740
I wasn't rejected.

268
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,120
Hey!

269
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,810
Didn't you get rejected recently, too, and come home crying?

270
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,600
The period between rejections was a bit short this time!

271
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,210
I said I wasn't rejected!

272
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,390
All right. What a temper.

273
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,880
Jae Yi, you!

274
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,460
Are you being diligent with your homework?

275
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,280
Do you know how hard I worked to earn your academy–

276
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,000
<i>I can pay for you?</i>

277
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,410
<i>[Total, 360,000 won]</i>

278
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,900
Any... way...

279
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,500
If your May mock exam grade doesn't improve,

280
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,540
you better be prepared to pay me back double.

281
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,100
Where are you going?

282
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,700
To raise my mock exam grade.

283
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:14,700
Who told you to do that now? Eat first.

284
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:19,000
Hey, can you stop talking about money during meals?

285
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,330
Hey, don't bother him.

286
00:17:28,330 --> 00:17:30,450
He must be going through a midlife crisis.

287
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:33,770
He skipped the rebellious phase in middle school. Why is he going through it now?

288
00:17:33,770 --> 00:17:36,480
I get it, so just finish eating first. Eat.

289
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,130
Did you send me the money?

290
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,740
Hey, I have something to say.

291
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,810
Can't you just return 10,000 won to me?

292
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:46,050
- I need to get to work tomorrow–
- No.

293
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:47,640
Hey, you're being so stingy–

294
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,670
You're so stingy and dirty–

295
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,550
No! You just said I was rejected!

296
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,800
Aigoo, I'd reject you, too.

297
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,040
- No!
- Hey.

298
00:17:59,910 --> 00:18:04,090
<i>Thank you for lending me the academy fee.</i>
<i>[I'm paying you back]</i>

299
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:06,440
<i>Servile, servile.</i>

300
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,820
<i>[Do Hae Yi]</i>

301
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:17,750
<i>[Jin Seon Ho]</i>

302
00:18:20,530 --> 00:18:22,370
Hey, hello?

303
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,440
I didn't lend it to you.

304
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,470
No, I used it gratefully!

305
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,820
Are you paying me back because you rejected me?

306
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,610
No... that's not...

307
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,960
Then isn't it weird to pay me back?

308
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,470
Paying me back if you dump me, and keeping it when you didn't...

309
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:38,910
It seems like there's a string attached.

310
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,780
That's not it! At the time...

311
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:45,040
I wondered if there was a need to decline when you're rich.

312
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,960
You're right. That's exactly it.

313
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,240
But it's only right that I pay you back in this situation.

314
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,450
Then buy me a meal.

315
00:18:54,450 --> 00:18:55,660
Huh?

316
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,160
An expensive meal.

317
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,630
- Well–
- When I want to eat it.

318
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:02,490
That'll do, right?

319
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,840
Sure. Why not.

320
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,100
Then I'm not taking this money.

321
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:11,240
It's my money, so I can do what I want with it, right?

322
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,500
Sure, why not...

323
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,640
<i>Then, I'll see you tomorrow.</i>
<i>[Jin Seon Ho]</i>

That won't do. Hae Yi has a boyfriend.

481
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:16,260
Me.

482
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,460
Really?

483
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:23,040
Yeah, really.

484
00:31:25,010 --> 00:31:27,880
So don't bother me about this ever again.

485
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,280
Let's go.

486
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:46,430
Why don't you let go now?

487
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,880
I could've handled it on my own.

488
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,510
I know.

489
00:31:52,510 --> 00:31:56,310
But from experience, this is the fastest, clear-cut method.

490
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:01,200
The planning team will join us later.

491
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,730
Hey, don't stop me.

492
00:32:08,570 --> 00:32:11,050
What are you doing right now?

493
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,630
I said, come here.

494
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:21,170
Your habit of using your fists is the same.

495
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,100
You infuriating bastard!

496
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:26,070
Hey! S***!

497
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,100
Hey. I heard you're the one who suggested I be investigated by the police.

498
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,740
I said it's only right you be investigated if need be.

499
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,490
You a**hole, are you trying to make me a criminal?

500
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:40,670
If you have something to say, say it. I won't hold myself back the second time.

501
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:44,090
What? Hey, how dare you! Get over here!

502
00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:46,370
Use words. I won't let you off easy anymore.

503
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:49,580
There's a difference of 3 million won in the budget and expenses from last year.

504
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:51,950
I guess something was left out, or there was an error in the record.

505
00:32:51,950 --> 00:32:54,380
You know this, Hyung. People hike their appearance fee at the last minute and stuff.

506
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:56,290
The truth will be revealed once we investigate.

507
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:57,590
You a**hole!

508
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,970
Calm down!

509
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:00,140
Get over here!

510
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:02,370
You really don't know why 3 million won is missing?

511
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:04,050
I don't!

512
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:07,790
Actually, some expense could've been left out if it's 3 million won.

513
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:12,130
But if we make this public, the public opinion that's pretty bad already will get worse.

514
00:33:12,130 --> 00:33:15,230
The suspicion will only grow if we leave it alone.

515
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:20,970
I think we should cut out the infected area in order to stop the spread of the infection.

516
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,700
I'll discuss it with other seniors for now.

517
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:32,150
Both of you, don't speak and behave recklessly. I ask that of you.

518
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:37,560
Hey.

519
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:41,130
- Are you holding something against me?
- No.

520
00:33:41,130 --> 00:33:45,020
By chance, are you doing this to me because of Yoo Min? Do you think that happened to Yoo Min because–

521
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:49,030
No, I don't. I'm only trying to do what I need to do.

522
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,640
Geez, s***!

523
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,550
<i>By chance, are you doing this to me because of Yoo Min?</i>

524

<i>Your arm tends to drop when you're making this motion.</i>

525
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:11,710
<i>You should watch for that. Your left arm.</i>

526
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:17,040
<i>Shin Gyu Jin. Are you really dating Yoo Min?</i>

527
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,390
<i>What the heck? Is that how you got selected as a rep?</i>

528
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:26,950
<i>Senior, did you know about this, too? That Yoo Min and Gyu Jin are dating?</i>

529
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:29,640
<i>No.</i>

530
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:32,020
<i>What in the world?</i>

531
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,480
<i>What's everyone doing, not practicing?</i>

532
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,840
<i>Why? What's going on?</i>

533
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:44,110
<i>Gyu Jin.</i>

534
00:35:18,670 --> 00:35:22,610
<i>I heard you told everyone that Yoo Min picked Gyu Jin as a freshman rep since they were dating.</i>

535
00:35:22,610 --> 00:35:25,440
<i>Yeah. It's not like I made it up.</i>

536
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,100
<i>You know full well that Yoo Min would never do that. The fact that Gyu Jin got selected–</i>

537
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,570
<i>Others would think that you're Yoo Min's boyfriend.</i>

538
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:38,280
<i>Do you want to be the captain that much?</i>

539
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,070
<i>If you hurt Yoo Min in some way, do you think you could become captain? Is that why you did that?</i>

540
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:44,640
<i>You punk, I was being nice, letting you off easy. Hey.</i>

541
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:48,410
<i>Hey! You have no sense of seniority?</i>

542
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:52,450
<i>If you want to be treated as a senior, behave like one. Don't act down and get dirty like this.</i>

Hey.

00:36:17,790 --> 00:36:20,890
Shall we begin the rehearsal?

549
00:36:20,890 --> 00:36:25,110
Yeah, we should. Let's go.

550
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,950
When?

551
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:33,410
Now, now! Let's show them starting with the rehearsal! Who the winner is on this stage!

552
00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:34,510
Fighting!

Organize the formation and stand in your positions.

<i>Yes, ma'am!</i>

Let's move! Hurry up!

557
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:47,590
Hey, Park Jung Woo. Are you okay?

558
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,240
I'm okay.

00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,700
What in the world?

560
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:53,050
It's nothing serious.

561
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,560
You're even worried about your opposing team. Aren't you a little too relaxed?

562
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,200
Get ready.

563
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,840
Let's take a break.

564
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,560
You were good.

565
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:47,890
I saw you earlier in the rehearsal. You were good.

566
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,440
You were totally fantastic. Like this.

567
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:56,660
"Pow!" when you did this... Gosh, I almost cheered for Hokyung University.

568
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:58,880
Gosh, you're hilarious.

569
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,010
Instead of exchanging you as a hostage, I should've held onto you.

570
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:09,120
<i>- Are they dating?</i>
<i>- How did you know just by looking at that?</i>

571
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,090
Captain...

572
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:16,450
Well... so I was wondering...

573
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:22,630
The old is worth cherishing.

574
00:38:22,630 --> 00:38:24,040
What?

575
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:28,930
The old is worth cherishing.

Park Jung Woo.

577
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,580
Hey.

578
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,750
I have a boyfriend.

579
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:22,500
- Congrats.
- It's only been three months since we broke up.

580
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,960
Why don't you act like you're sad?

581
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,550
You know what?

582
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:36,730
When you found out I was seeing another man,

583
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:40,630
I wanted you to get angry and cuss me out.

584
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,130
But you were the nicest guy in the world even then.

585
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:50,100
Since your heart wasn't in it, I guess it didn't hurt, either.

586
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:55,610
I'm the one who cheated on you, but I guess I'm the one who got hurt.

587
00:39:55,610 --> 00:39:58,580
You struggled throughout our time together.

588
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:03,850
You said you were more lonely when you were with me.

589
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,180
And if I had said I'm okay with that?

590
00:40:09,610 --> 00:40:11,240
You won't be.

591
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,820
By chance, are you interested in someone?

Gosh, feels so good!

596
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:12,840

Did you have to say something like that to her?
