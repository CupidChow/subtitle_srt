Thank God.

3
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:47,173
Were you really worried?

4
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:49,223
Please...

5
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:52,773
Please don't make me worry.

6
00:01:23,353 --> 00:01:25,143
Do Hae Yi!

7
00:01:29,553 --> 00:01:30,823
You were here.

8
00:01:30,823 --> 00:01:32,043
I was looking all over for you.

9
00:01:32,043 --> 00:01:34,433
When did you get here?

10
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,203
Captain, Vice-captain is looking for you.

11
00:01:37,203 --> 00:01:38,623
Okay.

12
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,203
Let's go back.

13
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:44,013
Something urgent came up at home, so I need to go.

14
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:45,313
I just need to get my phone.

15
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:46,563
Your phone was off.

16
00:01:46,563 --> 00:01:48,443
Really?

17
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:50,493
Why now?

18
00:01:50,493 --> 00:01:53,973
- Let's go over there, first and then–
- I'll go with you.

19
00:01:53,973 --> 00:01:55,693
Just use my phone.

20
00:01:56,303 --> 00:01:57,993
You should go back.

21
00:01:57,993 --> 00:01:59,953
I'll go with her.

22
00:02:03,933 --> 00:02:05,903
I'll take care of your things.

23
00:02:05,903 --> 00:02:07,333
Okay.

24
00:02:07,333 --> 00:02:10,093
Oh, o-okay!

25
00:02:10,093 --> 00:02:11,373
Call me if anything happens.

26
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,303
It's okay, don't worry.

27
00:02:13,303 --> 00:02:16,873
If something happens, I'll take care of it.

28
00:02:19,663 --> 00:02:21,553
I'll see you at school tomorrow.

29
00:02:21,553 --> 00:02:22,463
Okay.

30
00:02:22,463 --> 00:02:24,463
Oh, okay!

31
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:49,783
Just wait a bit. I'll be there soon.

32
00:02:49,783 --> 00:02:51,983
I'm almost there.

33
00:02:55,883 --> 00:02:57,783
Thank you. It was urgent.

34
00:02:57,783 --> 00:03:00,553
Sure, no big deal.

35
00:03:01,543 --> 00:03:03,373
Are you upset about something?

36
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:05,343
Why are you so sad?

37
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:09,553
I don't know.

38
00:03:09,553 --> 00:03:12,883
There's nothing wrong, but I'm not in a good mood.

39
00:03:12,883 --> 00:03:14,483
Ahjussi, please let me off here!

40
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:16,773
This isn't near your house, though.

41
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:20,083
I need to go to the police station.

42
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,713
What?

43
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,930
Oh my!

44
00:03:39,973 --> 00:03:41,073
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:43,763
It's my fault for not teaching him any better.

46
00:03:43,763 --> 00:03:45,973
Please let him off this once. I beg you.

47
00:03:45,973 --> 00:03:47,953
I mean...

48
00:03:48,713 --> 00:03:50,573
It's not like we're strangers.

49
00:03:50,573 --> 00:03:53,613
I wasn't going to bring this to the police either.

50
00:03:53,613 --> 00:03:55,443
But...

51
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:57,673
He did all this to my son, gosh!

52
00:03:57,673 --> 00:03:59,533
I'm so sorry, Ma'am.

53
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:01,403
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

54
00:04:01,403 --> 00:04:03,323
I'm sorry.

55
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,673
Hey, hey!

56
00:04:04,673 --> 00:04:06,383
Hey.

57
00:04:06,383 --> 00:04:08,153
Get up.

58
00:04:09,763 --> 00:04:12,153
Apologize to him this instant.

59
00:04:13,353 --> 00:04:15,013
I did nothing wrong.

60
00:04:15,013 --> 00:04:16,383
Get up right now.

61
00:04:16,383 --> 00:04:18,973
Look at him. Just look.

62
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,813
I'll take responsibility and apologize on his behalf.

63
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:24,093
He's still young and doesn't know right from wrong.

64
00:04:24,093 --> 00:04:26,833
He's only a year younger than you. What do you mean by young?

65
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:29,453
He should be able to discern right from wrong.

66
00:04:30,493 --> 00:04:32,813
Fine, let's resolve this according to the law.

67
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:34,733
- Oh, my. Ma'am...
- Get up.

68
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:37,793
Wait, Ma'am. Please calm down, Ma'am!

69
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:40,603
- Come here.
- Sir, please...

70
00:04:40,603 --> 00:04:42,583
- Sir, we're very sorry.
- You're being too loud.

71
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,933
We're very sorry–

72
00:04:43,933 --> 00:04:46,053
That's enough.

73
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:47,973
What do you mean, "That's enough?"

74
00:04:47,973 --> 00:04:49,503
You need to apologize this instant.

75
00:04:49,503 --> 00:04:52,713
- I said, that's enough!
- What's enough?

76
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,203
Even a few penalty points on your school record will be unfavorable for you.

77
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:58,153
Do you want a red line in your life?
(T/N: Someone who goes to prison.)

78
00:04:58,153 --> 00:05:00,763
- Were you that intent on screwing up your life?
- Yes!

79
00:05:00,763 --> 00:05:02,653
Exactly.

80
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,093
It's my life.

81
00:05:04,093 --> 00:05:08,293
It's my life to screw up, so don't butt in.

82
00:05:08,293 --> 00:05:10,813
- You little–
- Go ahead!

83
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:14,243
I'll get hit as much as you want, but...

84
00:05:15,143 --> 00:05:18,353
don't you dare kneel in front of that bastard's mom.

85
00:05:36,013 --> 00:05:37,783
Crazy bastard.

86
00:05:37,783 --> 00:05:39,553
His life is about to be turned upside down.

87
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,963
And this is what's important to him?

88
00:05:41,963 --> 00:05:44,503
God, I'm going nuts.

89
00:05:44,503 --> 00:05:48,393
You sound like his mom when you're his sister.

90
00:05:50,653 --> 00:05:52,733
Thank you.

91
00:05:52,733 --> 00:05:55,583
You can go now.

92
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,653
They're finishing up their report now.

93
00:05:57,653 --> 00:06:00,213
I'm just embarrassed. Go home.

94
00:06:00,213 --> 00:06:03,143
So you do have pride.

95
00:06:03,763 --> 00:06:06,823
I'm not in the mood to joke around with you.

96
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:09,473
Your brother probably has one, too.

97
00:06:09,473 --> 00:06:12,133
Something he can't hold back when provoked.

98
00:06:16,413 --> 00:06:19,483
Give me your bag. Give it to me.

99
00:06:19,483 --> 00:06:21,743
It's heavy.

100
00:06:26,183 --> 00:06:29,323
Oh, gosh, I'm so embarrassed.

101
00:06:29,323 --> 00:06:31,953
Let's meet again somewhere bright and cheery next time.

102
00:06:31,953 --> 00:06:33,023
We'll be off now.

103
00:06:33,023 --> 00:06:34,833
Hey, hey, kids!

104
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,333
Must you two fight as well?

105
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,363
Yeah, is Hae Yi okay?

106
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,703
Yes, she left.

107
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:43,793
And everything has been resolved?

108
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:44,773
Yes.

109
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,773
What was going on?

110
00:06:46,773 --> 00:06:49,953
It's a private matter, so I can't tell you.

111
00:06:49,953 --> 00:06:52,023
Right.

112
00:06:52,023 --> 00:06:54,393
I'm glad it's been resolved.

113
00:06:54,393 --> 00:06:55,913
Get home safely.

114

115
00:07:00,203 --> 00:07:02,733

You're right.

Anyway, do you know your sister's real phone number?

but if I approach you as a man, I have a different charisma.

What a relief that I don't need to see it.

136
00:08:16,303 --> 00:08:18,703
I'll ask her.

137
00:08:18,703 --> 00:08:19,573
Really?

138
00:08:19,573 --> 00:08:21,583
You promise? Okay?

139
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,073
I see you've caused another incident.

140
00:08:24,073 --> 00:08:26,053
I just did what needed to be done.

141
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:30,193
There's no need to be that serious.

142
00:08:30,193 --> 00:08:35,523
All right, as for the festival let's just continue as we did.

143
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:36,503
What?

144
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:39,063
They already have the budget,

145
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,573
and there's no justification for switching anything.

149
00:08:47,163 --> 00:08:49,543
Then what about the school competition in the second semester?

150
00:08:49,543 --> 00:08:51,333
School competition?

151
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,343
There's still some time left, so

152
00:08:55,343 --> 00:08:58,023
isn't there enough time for you to decide after looking at the festival?

153
00:08:58,023 --> 00:08:59,453
That's right.

00:09:52,653 --> 00:09:54,723
I think we were really busy until now.

167
00:09:54,723 --> 00:09:57,443
Nope! If everything until now was just coffee,

168
00:09:57,443 --> 00:09:59,003
from now on, it'll be TOP.

169
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,443
- What the?
- Gag.

170
00:10:00,443 --> 00:10:01,693
Concept planning, sponsorships,

171
00:10:01,693 --> 00:10:02,953
ticket stamping, hanging banners,

172
00:10:02,953 --> 00:10:04,753
ticket distribution, and other jobs.

173
00:10:04,753 --> 00:10:07,053
And training on top of all that.

174
00:10:08,243 --> 00:10:08,973
What?

175
00:10:08,973 --> 00:10:10,523
But we still have some good news

176
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:14,293
slash big news waiting for you all.

177
00:10:17,453 --> 00:10:21,213
This year's new song performance will be done by the newbies!

178
00:10:21,213 --> 00:10:23,273
- Really?
- Yup.

179
00:10:23,273 --> 00:10:24,513
Yay!

180
00:10:24,513 --> 00:10:28,153
Do you know what a special treat it is for newbies to perform for the festival?

181
00:10:28,153 --> 00:10:29,933
You should all have some pride.

182
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:33,553
However, it won't be everyone.

183
00:10:33,553 --> 00:10:34,683
What the...

184
00:10:34,683 --> 00:10:36,993
This is a competition.

185
00:10:39,903 --> 00:10:42,330
- Hello.
- Hello.

186
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:44,170
Hi.

187
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,023
This is the Captain's group.

188
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:52,853
This is the Vice Captain's group.

189
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,223
One of these two groups will be performing. Now soldiers, fighting!

190
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,123
<i>Fighting!</i>

191
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,013
We always lack manpower during the festival, so the seniors usually help out.

192
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:11,913
This year's general manager of the planning team will be Yoo Min noona.

193
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:16,793
I'm in the 47th class of Theia, Lee Yoo Min.

194
00:11:16,793 --> 00:11:21,233
It's been a while since I've come to school and done this, so I'm not sure if I'll be of any help,

195
00:11:21,233 --> 00:11:23,223
but I look forward to it.

196
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:27,823
Is this the return of the first love?

197
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:39,753
Guys, do you know what I hate most?

198
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:43,083
It's losing.

199
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:47,413
Let's do our best.

200
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,303
<i>Yes!</i>

201
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:56,103
Theia!

202
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:57,633
I told you not to do that.

203
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:01,743
Captain, what's our victory strategy? I really want to perform this time.

204
00:12:01,743 --> 00:12:06,113
I don't have a victory strategy. It's what you need to create.

205
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:09,303
By what standards were the groups divided?

206
00:12:09,303 --> 00:12:13,223
We weren't even given the right to choose and it just seemed very one-sided.

207
00:12:13,223 --> 00:12:16,523
Why? Are you not happy that I'm in charge of your group?

208
00:12:16,523 --> 00:12:20,613
I thought it would be more problematic if we gave you a choice, so we decided randomly.

209
00:12:20,613 --> 00:12:24,783
If you really want to change groups, after discussing it with your teammates, I'll allow you to change.

210
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:28,473
It's fine. I should do as I'm told.

211
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,793
Good job!

212
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:36,343
- Good job.
- Do Hae Yi?

213
00:12:36,343 --> 00:12:37,953
Yes.

214
00:12:37,953 --> 00:12:40,043
This is yours, right?

215
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,733
Oh, where did you–

216
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:48,393
It was found near Cheers. I charged it, and messages for Do Hae Yi kept coming in.

217
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,603
- Thank you.
- Sure.

218
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,583
Excuse me.

219
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,673
Do we know each other?

220
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,103
No.

221
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:07,633
<i>[How much for settlement money...]
[Hospital bill...]</i>

222
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,153
Did something serious happen yesterday?

223
00:13:31,153 --> 00:13:34,120
I thought I heard Seon Ja talk about an attorney.

224
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:38,003
Oh, that was Joo Sun overreacting.

225
00:13:38,003 --> 00:13:40,153
That's a relief.

226
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,943
Was it Yoo Min? I see her around pretty often.

227
00:13:46,943 --> 00:13:49,293
You must be happy, Captain.

228
00:13:49,293 --> 00:13:50,973
Yeah.

229
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,893
<i>Look at him.</i>

230
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,113
- Why did you suddenly hug me yesterday?
- Huh?

231
00:14:01,113 --> 00:14:05,353
I was... Huh? Oh, so...

232
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,453
Because I was r-relieved?

233
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,503
You hugged me out of relief?

234
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,573
Yes.

235
00:14:14,573 --> 00:14:18,293
All right. Let's clear it up as that, then.

236
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:23,133
Extreme... camaraderie.

237
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,523
Clear it up?

238
00:14:25,523 --> 00:14:27,263
We need to clear things up for sure!

239
00:14:27,263 --> 00:14:30,823
If you go and hug someone and leave things ambiguously,

240
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,123
it's perfect for a misunderstanding.

241
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:38,863
Such as, you're having feelings for me.

242
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,783
What? Hugs are simply greetings abroad. I can do it again now.

243
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:49,633
Goodbye.

244
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,013
Coward.

245
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,103

00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,413
Yes?

247
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,733
You said we have a meeting, but didn't come out.

248
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,733
Oh. The m-meeting?

249
00:15:21,733 --> 00:15:24,573
Right. I'm going.

250
00:15:24,573 --> 00:15:27,153
Your bag! Your bag.

251
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,163
My bag. Thank you.

252
00:15:29,163 --> 00:15:31,193
Yeah, bye, bye!

253
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:33,513
Meeting.

254
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:41,543
Darn it! I was going to leave first.

255
00:15:41,543 --> 00:15:44,763
Is he a humanitarian? Gosh!

256
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,523
I checked the schedules of the recommended seniors and they said they're free that week,

257
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:56,823
so we can film the interview then. Hey.

258
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,473
Hey!

259
00:16:00,473 --> 00:16:03,633
Yeah. Yes.

260
00:16:03,633 --> 00:16:05,993
I'll arrange the schedule.

261
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:10,373
Is it because you two were hugging earlier?

262
00:16:10,373 --> 00:16:13,033
- What?
- Are you two, by any chance–

263
00:16:13,033 --> 00:16:16,983
No, no. Not a chance. CCs are prohibited.

264
00:16:16,983 --> 00:16:20,173
But there really must be something between you.

265
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:23,790
- Since last time.
- What? Nope.

266
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,403
There is.

Did you know?

00:17:19,633 --> 00:17:22,513
I was actually interested in you back then.

284
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:27,373
But I thought you just considered me a close friend.

285
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:32,243
I found out that you liked me later on, but our timing didn't match.

286

It's a good thing our timing didn't match.

287

I often think about it.

If I hadn't dated that professor, how would things have turned out?

If I had just held back my feelings,

I wonder if things would've been different.

00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:12,853
Daebak! Isn't it daebak?

292

You can't even memorize your own name, but you told me...

Oh, man. The world is

294
00:18:25,103 --> 00:18:30,593

How come you're drinking with me instead of your rich friends?

My rich friends don't drink during the day.

298
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:46,013
Or who knows? They might be discreetly drinking at home.

299
00:18:46,013 --> 00:18:51,123
The world of the rich madams must be complicated, too. Right?

300
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:56,153
The more you possess, the more complicated your life becomes.

301
00:18:56,153 --> 00:19:02,023
Hey, you wench! Discard the stereotype that people who don't have much are simple.

302
00:19:02,023 --> 00:19:06,233
Even if we don't have much, our lives are still complicated.

303

What would a rich person know?

North, South, East, West, everything is complicated.

Okay.

311
00:19:33,643 --> 00:19:39,823
It'll only be more tiresome if we learn about each other's personal lives.

312
00:19:39,823 --> 00:19:45,073
Isn't it being drinking buddies like this better?

313
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,643
No mixed emotions.

00:21:21,673 --> 00:21:24,043
I haven't been living in this neighborhood for one or two days.

329
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:25,273
You crazy...

330
00:21:25,273 --> 00:21:29,483
How? How do I look like someone who goes around wearing fake things?

331
00:21:29,483 --> 00:21:35,343
This bag isn't something you can buy just because you want to!

332
00:21:35,343 --> 00:21:37,033
God, what...

333
00:21:37,033 --> 00:21:41,513
I guess you were never exposed to bags like this, so you wouldn't know.

334
00:21:41,513 --> 00:21:43,273
What will you do about this?

335
00:21:43,273 --> 00:21:46,563
What are you going to do about this?

336
00:21:46,563 --> 00:21:49,843
Why are you asking me?

337
00:21:49,843 --> 00:21:52,823
You're the one who threw up. Did I throw up?

338
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:56,973
You have a point, but...

339
00:21:56,973 --> 00:22:01,523
I was going to throw up on this wall.

340
00:22:01,523 --> 00:22:03,033
Exactly.

341
00:22:03,033 --> 00:22:07,043
You were going to throw up in front of our house, so I guided you to throw up in your bag.

342
00:22:07,043 --> 00:22:09,713
Isn't it only right for you to throw up in your own belonging?

343
00:22:09,713 --> 00:22:11,983
Not on someone else's wall or plant.

344
00:22:11,983 --> 00:22:14,113
But, this is...

345
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,713
Isn't...

346
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:19,083
Even so, this isn't right.

347
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:24,833
Instead of throwing up in this bag, I'd rather reconstruct this wall!

348
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:29,183
God.

349
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:31,883
- Yeah.
<i>- Where are you?</i>

350
00:22:31,883 --> 00:22:33,843
I'm in front of the house.

351
00:22:34,673 --> 00:22:36,303
Mom, there's a drunk here.

352
00:22:36,303 --> 00:22:37,943
Drunk?

353
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,383
Her sense of hearing is so sharp.

354
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:41,443
I'm going up. Okay.

355
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:44,253
Young lady, I've been patient with you–

356
00:22:44,253 --> 00:22:46,333
All right.

357
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,423
All right, ahjumma.

358
00:22:53,293 --> 00:22:55,513
Here's the laundry fee.

359
00:22:55,513 --> 00:22:58,733
But if we're to assign responsibility,

360
00:22:58,733 --> 00:23:02,663
I don't need to give you this since I was just protecting my property,

361
00:23:02,663 --> 00:23:05,283
but I'm giving it to you out of kindness.

362
00:23:05,283 --> 00:23:07,103
Happy now?

363
00:23:10,083 --> 00:23:11,213
One...

364
00:23:11,213 --> 00:23:13,203
Come on!

365
00:23:13,203 --> 00:23:18,373
Hey! This won't even cover the repairs.

366
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,983
How could she say it's a laundry fee?

367
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,583
Darn it!

368
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:25,593
Are there two? Gosh!

369
00:23:26,803 --> 00:23:29,723
Hey! Where were you?

370
00:23:33,003 --> 00:23:35,623
It's probably not real, right?

371
00:23:39,253 --> 00:23:41,193
Mom, why?

372
00:23:41,773 --> 00:23:44,003
- Aigoo, aigoo!
- You're here?

373
00:23:44,003 --> 00:23:46,543
Are you so happy that your son's life is screwed up that you're throwing a party?

374
00:23:46,543 --> 00:23:48,763
It's because I'm frustrated! I'm really frustrated.

375
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,543
I want to at least try something.

376
00:23:50,543 --> 00:23:53,673
Do you think talking about money in sobriety is easy?

377
00:23:53,673 --> 00:23:56,983
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know!

378
00:23:56,983 --> 00:24:00,203
- What about Jae Yi?
- He's going straight to the academy.

379
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,823
Did he ask for forgiveness?

380
00:24:02,823 --> 00:24:05,523
- As if.
- God! What is that punk thinking?

381
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:08,593
- This won't do. I'm going and–
- Hey, hey! Relax.

382
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:11,043
He said he'll drop out of school if you go to their house and beg.

383
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,323
- What?
- You know Jae Yi's personality, right?

384
00:24:13,323 --> 00:24:16,813
He's docile on most days, but once he throws one of his fits...

385
00:24:16,813 --> 00:24:20,433
He'll do more than just drop out.

386
00:24:20,433 --> 00:24:23,103
That crazy bastard's intent on ruining his life.

387
00:24:23,103 --> 00:24:25,053
Gosh, I don't know what to do either.

388
00:24:25,053 --> 00:24:28,173
We need to do whatever we can to gather the settlement money.

389
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:34,103
How is my life so full of problems at every corner?

390
00:24:42,093 --> 00:24:43,823
Brother-in-law!

391
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:50,503
Here.

392
00:24:50,503 --> 00:24:52,633
This tastes better than tofu.
<i>(T/N: Tofu symbolizes a clean start.)</i>

393
00:24:52,633 --> 00:24:55,593
You went to the police station, so you need to eat tofu.

394
00:24:57,563 --> 00:25:00,203
How did you know I was here?

395
00:25:00,203 --> 00:25:01,653
Wait...

396
00:25:01,653 --> 00:25:03,783
Did my sister tell you?

397
00:25:03,783 --> 00:25:05,443
No.

398
00:25:05,443 --> 00:25:08,343
I have a share in that academy.

399
00:25:10,803 --> 00:25:12,853
You know,

400
00:25:12,853 --> 00:25:16,873
I think I can prevent a red mark on your life.

401
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,793
Then what could you do for me?

402
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:27,343
Then let's set the schedule like this.

403
00:25:27,343 --> 00:25:28,883
<i>All right.</i>

404
00:25:29,853 --> 00:25:32,993
<i>A hug is like a greeting. I can do it again now.</i>

405
00:25:32,993 --> 00:25:34,603
<i>Goodbye.</i>

406
00:25:38,213 --> 00:25:40,403
<i>Coward.</i>

407
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:42,733
What?

408
00:25:42,733 --> 00:25:43,953
Hey!

409
00:25:43,953 --> 00:25:44,853
Yeah?

410
00:25:44,853 --> 00:25:46,753
What are you doing?

411
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:49,133
No, it's nothing.

412
00:25:58,103 --> 00:26:00,123
Guys!

413
00:26:04,223 --> 00:26:08,383
Today, why don't we greet each other American style?

414
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,163
American?

415
00:26:10,163 --> 00:26:11,833
Goodbye.

416
00:26:26,463 --> 00:26:28,763
What the? Crazy bastard.

417
00:26:30,183 --> 00:26:32,183
The Captain is okay, right?

418
00:26:32,183 --> 00:26:34,053
Did he go nuts with exhaustion?

419
00:26:34,053 --> 00:26:35,973
I know.

420
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:44,023
Why does it feel different?

421
00:26:54,453 --> 00:26:56,213
It's different.

422
00:27:14,843 --> 00:27:17,083
If it's this much intense labor,

423
00:27:17,083 --> 00:27:20,063
shouldn't I switch my job and get paid?

424
00:27:26,253 --> 00:27:27,533
What the?

425
00:27:27,533 --> 00:27:30,023
Did he just avoid me?

426
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:39,553
What the hell, Park Jung Woo?

427
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,053
- Again.
<i>- What?</i>

428
00:27:50,053 --> 00:27:52,783
Who told you to copy last year's?

429
00:27:56,003 --> 00:27:58,123
- Again.
<i>- Okay.</i>

430
00:27:58,123 --> 00:27:59,593
If you do this again,

431
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:01,963
both of you should be prepared to spend your nights with me.

432
00:28:01,963 --> 00:28:03,813
<i>Okay.</i>

433
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,083
God! Why did we have to get the witch?

434
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:14,263
I'm not in the right mind to do this right now!

435
00:28:14,263 --> 00:28:17,023
I thought he looked really cool.

436
00:28:17,023 --> 00:28:19,663
- Who?
- Me.

437
00:28:20,533 --> 00:28:23,073
I'm so stressed.

438
00:28:26,443 --> 00:28:28,713
What?

439
00:28:31,933 --> 00:28:34,993
We have more numbers, so you know it would be humiliating if we lose, right?

440
00:28:34,993 --> 00:28:37,013
Show me what you worked on.

441
00:28:38,973 --> 00:28:42,673
No way.

442
00:28:42,673 --> 00:28:45,873
You didn't come here with just your bodies, did you?

443
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:48,633
135246, 246231.

444
00:28:48,633 --> 00:28:50,553
Huh?

445
00:28:50,553 --> 00:28:52,013
<i>[New song form content]</i>

446
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:53,363
Six basic forms.

447
00:28:53,363 --> 00:28:57,283
If we arrange this according to the beat of the new song, 135246, 246231.

448
00:28:57,283 --> 00:28:59,703
You memorized all this?

449
00:28:59,703 --> 00:29:02,313
- I have a pretty good memory.
- Hey,

450
00:29:02,313 --> 00:29:04,483
I like you.

451
00:29:06,533 --> 00:29:09,413
- Where are you going?
- I have somewhere to be.

452
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,413
What the? Is he the only busy one?

453
00:29:12,413 --> 00:29:13,893
He didn't do anything

454
00:29:13,893 --> 00:29:16,933
Is he trying to get a free ride, or what?

455
00:29:19,363 --> 00:29:21,383
The lawsuit against Jae Yi has been canceled!

456
00:29:21,383 --> 00:29:23,643
- What?
- Lawsuit?

457
00:29:23,643 --> 00:29:25,283
<i>Yay!</i>

458
00:29:25,283 --> 00:29:27,793
So our Jae Yi doesn't have to go to jail?

459
00:29:27,793 --> 00:29:29,413
<i>Yay!</i>

460
00:29:29,413 --> 00:29:32,373
It's such a relief that Jae Yi's beautiful face could be protected.

461
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:34,093
But how?

462
00:29:34,093 --> 00:29:35,373
I thought his parents were very firm.

463
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,543
- "Our Jae Yi?"
- I don't know.

464
00:29:36,543 --> 00:29:39,123
He said he'd take care of it. Did he go and beg?

465
00:29:39,123 --> 00:29:42,733
I don't know. It's been resolved, so who cares!

466
00:29:44,143 --> 00:29:45,903
<i>Yay!</i>

467
00:29:45,903 --> 00:29:48,263
- Good for you!
- Thank you.

468
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:51,183
It's such a relief!

469
00:29:51,893 --> 00:29:53,203
The model on the magazine cover,

470
00:29:53,203 --> 00:29:55,173
is Yoo Min, she was involved in the light fixture incident.

471
00:29:55,173 --> 00:29:59,493
And someone put that in Do Hae Yi's locker.

472
00:29:59,493 --> 00:30:01,603
Ignore it.

473
00:30:01,603 --> 00:30:04,733
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

474
00:30:04,733 --> 00:30:06,703
I told you to kill this story!

475
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:10,603
What if all this isn't from last year?

476
00:30:10,603 --> 00:30:12,623
What if someone dies as indicated in the prophecy?

477
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:14,203
Aren't you too absorbed by this?

478
00:30:14,203 --> 00:30:16,783
This is just something we made up to create an issue.

479
00:30:16,783 --> 00:30:20,873
Forget it and just go make a proposal for the festival.

480
00:30:32,303 --> 00:30:36,123
Then I'll contact the agencies from the list we created today.

481
00:30:36,123 --> 00:30:37,123
Sounds good.

482
00:30:37,123 --> 00:30:39,373
And the seniors' video from the previous festival–

483
00:30:39,373 --> 00:30:40,863
Whoa, Jung Woo!

484
00:30:40,863 --> 00:30:42,943
You have a nosebleed!

485
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:49,313
I-I'll do it.

486
00:30:50,633 --> 00:30:52,663
Are you even getting sleep?

487
00:30:52,663 --> 00:30:53,583
I am.

488
00:30:53,583 --> 00:30:55,883
What? Like two or three hours?

489
00:30:56,933 --> 00:30:59,393
Pace yourself, or you'll break down.

490
00:30:59,393 --> 00:31:02,413
It's always like this when preparing for the festival.

491
00:31:02,413 --> 00:31:04,953
There's no need to go that far.

492
00:31:05,783 --> 00:31:08,383
In the end, it's not a big deal.

493
00:31:14,343 --> 00:31:16,853
I'll bring you more tissues.

Are you okay, Noona? Huh?

499

Breathe, breathe slowly.

00:32:51,673 --> 00:32:53,293
Are you okay?

501
00:32:54,553 --> 00:32:56,273
It's so nice.

503
00:33:05,073 --> 00:33:07,533

Of course, it is.

He only had his brain to rely on.

509

If he can't go to college because of something like that...

510
00:34:06,413 --> 00:34:08,553
God, I don't even want to think about it.

511
00:34:08,553 --> 00:34:09,593
Look at you.

512
00:34:09,593 --> 00:34:11,723
You're his sister, but you're like his mom.

Weakness...

544
00:35:51,303 --> 00:35:52,873
That's difficult.

we should officially...

00:36:33,623 --> 00:36:35,813
An enjoyable relationship?

557
00:36:35,813 --> 00:36:38,283
- An enjoyable relationship?
- Yeah.

558
00:36:38,283 --> 00:36:41,533
You enjoy it, and I enjoy it.

559
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:43,773

00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:46,513
- Enjoy?
- Why?

561
00:36:46,513 --> 00:36:47,773
You don't like that?

562
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,543
N-No, that's not it.

563
00:36:50,543 --> 00:36:51,643
Right?

564

Hey, who knew our sex compatibility would be this great?

566
00:36:57,323 --> 00:37:01,533
I thought that a drunken night would remain an embarrassing memory,

567
00:37:01,533 --> 00:37:04,623
but there was a plot twist.

568

Not lovers who sleep together.

573
00:37:22,803 --> 00:37:27,103
Was there a miscommunication about our relationship?

574
00:37:29,573 --> 00:37:32,673
Let's just end the enjoyment today.

575

Geez, it was a dream.

580
00:39:33,333 --> 00:39:34,963
You always...

581
00:39:34,963 --> 00:39:38,463
sleep in random places. Can't you do something about that?

582
00:39:40,763 --> 00:39:42,863
I can't believe you're talking to me.

583
00:39:42,863 --> 00:39:44,933
I thought you decided to avoid me.

584
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,173
I never avoided you.

585
00:39:46,173 --> 00:39:49,183
Something urgent came up then. Come on.

586
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:52,213
Looks like you feel guilty about something.

587
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:56,113
Try not to make yourself vulnerable by sleeping anywhere.

588
00:39:56,113 --> 00:39:57,053
It's none of your business.

589
00:39:57,053 --> 00:39:59,913

00:40:02,753 --> 00:40:04,553
Yes, Noona.

591

594
00:40:15,673 --> 00:40:17,563
You're so sweet to her.

595
00:40:17,563 --> 00:40:20,473
You must be really happy that you have a lot of things to do with her.

596
00:40:20,473 --> 00:40:22,783
- What?
- Ah! Sorry.

597
00:40:22,783 --> 00:40:24,733
It's about your private life. I crossed the line.

598

Sorry, sorry.

599
00:40:26,443 --> 00:40:28,773
By the way, you know the rule regarding not allowing campus couples?

600
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,893
I totally agree with that.

601
00:40:30,893 --> 00:40:34,083
I hate it when they only care about each other.

602
00:40:35,973 --> 00:40:39,623
The rules exist for a reason.

603
00:40:39,623 --> 00:40:41,633
It's all in the past.

604
00:40:43,613 --> 00:40:45,213

605
00:40:45,873 --> 00:40:47,543
It's all in the past.

606
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:54,223
Well, um...

607
00:41:04,743 --> 00:41:07,383
But thinking about it,

608
00:41:07,383 --> 00:41:11,233
maybe it's fun to break the rules.

Well...

626
00:42:31,353 --> 00:42:34,183
How about something like this?

I think I lived too carefully in my 20s.

631
00:42:48,173 --> 00:42:51,263
I was careful with my heart

632
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:54,583
and I was too afraid to get hurt.

633

But I really regret it thinking back now.

634

Min Jae, that jerk is such a freeloader.

00:45:44,263 --> 00:45:46,413
You should be able to manage that much yourselves.

662
00:45:46,413 --> 00:45:49,543
He didn't come up with anything. He's telling us to do it ourselves.

663
00:45:49,543 --> 00:45:51,233
Can't you talk to him as the captain?

664

I'll text it to you.

Is it personal?

672
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,563
Is it something we need to talk about in private?

673
00:46:19,563 --> 00:46:20,603
Yes.

674
00:46:20,603 --> 00:46:22,563
I'll get in touch with you.

Why the long face then?

No matter how I look at it,

679
00:46:35,633 --> 00:46:38,823
it's obviously that kind of talk.

680
00:46:40,773 --> 00:46:42,953
Is he nervous?

681
00:46:42,953 --> 00:46:44,773
Or is it going to be a surprise?

682
00:46:44,773 --> 00:46:46,283
What surprise?

683
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:48,393
Come on! You scared me.

I might deliver the surprising news to you today.

I'm not curious at all! What is it? What is it?

- Oh.

Well...

- No, I'm not.

- Do you want doraji?
- I'm not hungry at all.

Bye!

00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:39,543
I thought you meant everything you said at the interview.

705
00:47:39,543 --> 00:47:41,823
I saw how you worked hard ever since.

706
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,773
Being in a cheer team is

707
00:47:43,773 --> 00:47:47,273
all about the memories we shared together.

708
00:47:47,273 --> 00:47:49,963
Try to get along with your classmates.

709
00:47:52,073 --> 00:47:53,813

By chance...

784
00:55:54,003 --> 00:55:58,060
It's not because that rule about not having campus romance, right?

785
00:55:58,713 --> 00:56:01,683
You're not even a current member. It doesn't matter.

786
00:56:01,683 --> 00:56:03,953
You should secure her now before it's too late.

787
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:07,963
I think I asked you to stop.

Aren't you the one who's ruining the spirit because of personal feelings?

797
00:56:40,903 --> 00:56:44,863
You're causing misunderstanding because you keep

things mysterious without being clear.
