As you've seen today, the Cheer Squad has more rules than you thought.

This is the weight of the title I hold.

There's a rumor about someone dying and there are so many rules.

196

Even a study room wouldn't have that many rules.

Hey, be quiet! You made me miss a part!

198

Usually, when daughters talk to their moms about their lives,

199
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,570
they go, "Oh, so that's what happened."

Isn't that the right thing to do?

Sure, just throw in the towel. Why remain in a strange group like that?

202
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,240
Of course, there's no way something I get paid for would be so easy.

Oh, gosh. What's up with that guy?

00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,400
Yeah.

483
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:10,160
Nice to meet you, my friend!

484
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,080
I could treat you better if you go out with me.

485
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:18,110
Was it this? The source of your confidence?

486
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:21,650
Well, I suppose it makes sense.

487
00:31:21,650 --> 00:31:27,260
Having a bit of everything was the source of your confidence. Makes sense.

488
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,990
So, okay?

489
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,610
One million won per month.

490
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:33,370
No dating allowed within the squad.

491
00:31:33,370 --> 00:31:38,050
But there's no dating allowed. I guess it won't work.

492
00:31:38,050 --> 00:31:40,340
You're more sensitive about the rules than I thought.

493
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:43,610
Yeah. I'm someone who submits to the system.

494
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:46,400
If we get caught, we could just stop.

495
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:53,310
Well, if you don't change your mind after a month, let's talk again then.

496
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:55,400
I'll really consider it then.

497
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,440
- A month?
- Yeah.

498
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,760
- Okay.
- Okay!

499
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:12,320
Son, I left out your supplements in the kitchen. Make sure you take them, okay?

500
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:29,940
<i>I'll pay you back the academy fees in due time. Thank you.</i>

501
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:40,030
We decided to have a meal with Director Park on Sunday so don't make any plans for that day, okay?

502
00:32:40,030 --> 00:32:42,370
Just because you're in a prep school doesn't mean you can just relax and play.

503
00:32:42,370 --> 00:32:45,650
It's important that you prepare in advance so you can be ahead of everyone else.

504
00:32:45,650 --> 00:32:47,480
- Yes.
- Ohhh.

505
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,230
Who's a good boy!

506
00:32:51,230 --> 00:32:55,490
Oh, by the way, did you sign up for an academy, son?

507
00:32:55,490 --> 00:32:59,010
There was a record of a payment to an academy on the credit card bill.

508
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:00,960
Oh, that?

509
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:03,250
I used it for a good place!

510
00:33:03,250 --> 00:33:07,580
A good place? Is it a good academy?

511
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:11,870
Ohh. Okay, I got it.

512
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:41,530
Wouldn't it be better to not have any trouble?

513
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:12,010
He seems to be studying hard.

514
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:20,990
- You weren't able to find someone to take your place?
- Yeah.

515
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:22,600
Nobody was available.

516
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,310
Even if I tell them they'll get paid double, there are no applicants.

517
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:29,110
Oh, my God!

518
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,070
That replacement... Can I do it?

519
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,790
Really?

520
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:39,020
- Sure.
- All right! Thank you.

521
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:48,190
Whoa! The training! What should I do?

522
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:58,900
<i>[Do Hae Yi]</i>

Okay.

00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:02,830
- Thank you.
- It's so hot.

533
00:36:02,830 --> 00:36:05,490
I was in first before.

534
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,600
What?

535
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:21,600
It's Butler Choi!

536
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:26,420
What the...

537
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:28,260
Do you know each other?

538
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,270
Yeah. She's a high school friend.

539
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:33,710
Mom, I'll just throw this out myself.

540
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:38,070
Why? You said you didn't want to because it was dirty. That's why we hired someone.

541
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:41,340
Do you feel uncomfortable because she's a friend? Should I call someone else?

542
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:46,550
Oh, no. I'm fine. Sir, just give that to me.

543
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:52,020
Now that I think about it, haven't I seen you before in front of our house? With my Jae Hyeok.

544
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,900
That's not true!

545
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,990
- It's not?
- No, it's not.

546
00:36:56,990 --> 00:37:00,190
Mom, I'll just take this outside with her.

547
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,970
Okay, go ahead.

548
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,010
Let's carry it together.

549
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,610
Forget it. I'm getting paid for this.

550
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:20,730
Come on. Let's do it together.

551
00:37:20,730 --> 00:37:22,970
I told you, I'll do it!

552
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,830
I told you we should do it together!

553
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:33,910
Don't touch it!

554
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,760
Earlier...

555
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,250
It's okay.

556
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,120
Well... It's not that.

557
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,060
You kept it a secret from your mom when we were dating. Why are you acting like this now?

558
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:54,330
It would become complicated if my mom found out.

559
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:59,730
You find me so embarrassing and want to keep me hidden.

560
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:02,560
So why do you want to get back together?

561
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,700
You're not doing this because you like me, but because your pride was hurt when you got dumped.

562
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,560
It's not that!

563
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:15,370
Lee Jae Hyeok. I won't ever get back with you again.

564
00:38:15,370 --> 00:38:19,450
So continue being tortured by the thought of me with another guy.

565
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:21,990
Because that's what I want.

566
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:45,260
They're here.

567
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:52,020
- Hello.
- Hello.

568
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,310
Is it really her?

569
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,730
Come over here.

570
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:10,280
Let's go.

571
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:13,200
Do Hae Yi.

572
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,180
Do Hae Yi?

573
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:17,420
Oh, yes.

574
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:21,480
About yesterday, I believe you need to explain yourself.

575
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,500
Oh, that...

576
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,410
My work schedule as a replacement coincided with the training time.

577
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,640
I'm sorry.

578
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,770
A stroke of luck in training can lead to accidents.

579
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:47,090
Would you be okay if someone else gets hurt because of you?

580
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:52,980
Lying and not attending training is an act of cheating others, and will not be tolerated.

581
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:56,020
If your priorities are elsewhere, then it would be better for you to quit.

582
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,840
So we don't waste each other's time.

583
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,310
I'm sorry.

584
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:06,820
I didn't say this to hear you give us an irresponsible apology.

585
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,650
I am asking if you are able to be a part of the cheerleading squad.

586
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,210
I will make sure that this never happens again.

587
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:19,730
I think you should say that to your teammates who were affected.

588
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,130
I'm sorry.

589
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:37,640
I'll make sure that this never happens again.

590
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,900
We'll start training in ten minutes.

591
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,140
Are you okay?

592
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:59,670
Will he bleed blue if we pierce him? Why is he being so strict?

593
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,490
- I'll be back after a drink of water.
- Should I go with you?

594
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,470
No, it's okay.

595
00:41:18,470 --> 00:41:20,810
As if we were doing something so great.

596
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:23,700
Forget the money. I'll quit at this rate.

597
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,930
Do Hae Yi!

598
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,480
Let's talk.

599
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:36,090
About what?

600
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,990
I don't think there's anything more to discuss between us.

601
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,660
I just need a moment.

602
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:45,880
Well, I don't have anything to say.

603
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,670
- I do.
- Well, I don't!

604
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:50,100
I told you that I do! What did you mean by what you said yesterday?

605
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:52,360
- Let go.
- No, I refuse.

606
00:41:52,990 --> 00:41:54,300
She says she doesn't have anything to say.

607
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,000
This is between us.

608
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,670
I don't think this concerns you.

609
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:03,320
It is when there's unwanted physical contact.

610
00:42:13,630 --> 00:42:16,910
I tried to talk to you quietly in private.

611
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,530
But okay, I guess I'll just tell you here.

612
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,250
You.

613
00:42:21,250 --> 00:42:23,240
You told me

614
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:27,610
to feel tortured thinking about you being with another guy?

615
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:30,000
Me? Why should I?

616
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:33,410
Your family has nothing, and your mom is a single parent.

617
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,310
With such conditions, you think I would be

618
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:37,070
going out with you, dreaming of a future together?

619
00:42:37,070 --> 00:42:39,710
Obviously, I think we should go out just to have fun.

620
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,790
- Hey, Lee Jae Hyeok.
- Hey.

621
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:46,880
You. You think you're all that, but don't fool yourself.

622
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,910
A girl like you who gets concerned about spending 100 won;

623
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:51,280
honestly, others would find it difficult to date you.

624
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,290
You have no future, but even less in the present.

625
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:38,410
<i>[Fall Risk Area]</i>

626
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:08,590
What is this?

627
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,640
I thought you might need it.

628
00:44:11,410 --> 00:44:15,120
I'll be there right away. Could you please go away? It's humiliating.

629
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,780
When I was in 5th grade,

630
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:34,310
I had a soccer exam.

631
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:39,920
Everybody had a dad who would teach them,

632
00:44:40,790 --> 00:44:43,080
but I didn't have a dad.

633
00:44:43,930 --> 00:44:46,900
"I guess you won't be able to do well since you don't have a dad!"

634
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,020
That's how the kids made fun of me.

635
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:53,300
And I absolutely failed the soccer test.

636
00:44:54,670 --> 00:44:56,700
"That was all because I don't have a dad."

637
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,110
That's how I thought.

638
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:02,830
And ever since, when things didn't work out,

639
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:05,600
I would blame my dad.

640
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:09,130
That it was because my dad wasn't here.

641
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:14,230
Then, I went to junior high school and took a basketball test.

642
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,310
But on the basketball test, I got a perfect score.

643

Even though I still didn't have my dad,

644
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:28,040
I was good at basketball.

645
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:31,670
That's when I realized it.

646
00:45:34,360 --> 00:45:37,820
It wasn't because my dad wasn't here that I wasn't good at soccer.

647
00:45:38,730 --> 00:45:42,540
I just didn't have any talent for soccer.

648

It's not because...

649

I didn't have a dad.

650
00:45:49,930 --> 00:45:54,270
Well, others kept looking at me with pity,

651
00:45:55,630 --> 00:45:57,280
but I was still okay.

652
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:00,030
Because I didn't look at myself that way.

653
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:08,910
Regardless of what others say, you shouldn't think of yourself that way.

Go ahead, then.

801
00:58:45,670 --> 00:58:47,050
Oh?

802
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,090
Are you okay?

803
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:57,130
What?

804
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,020
Oh, yes.

805
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:11,550
Were you the man in front of the club?

806
00:59:11,550 --> 00:59:14,160
<i>I'm sorry! One sec.</i>

807
00:59:22,980 --> 00:59:24,570
I think you remember.

808
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:27,170
Why didn't you say anything?

809
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:31,540
It's not that great of a memory.

810
00:59:33,480 --> 00:59:36,150
You're kinder than I thought.

811
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:41,400
Gosh, I got dumped for being poor

812
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,000
and you caught me at the most embarrassing moment.

813
00:59:45,230 --> 00:59:48,870
Taking care of yourself by working part-time jobs. How is that embarrassing?

814
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,670
Shouldn't you feel the other way?

815
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,710
Give it.

816
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,310
It's locked.

817
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:31,340
Hey!

818
01:00:31,340 --> 01:00:33,450
Hello!

819
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,670
Hello!

820
01:00:43,850 --> 01:00:45,720
Hello!

821
01:01:05,570 --> 01:01:08,650
We're locked in the storage room. The door's locked.

822
01:01:22,990 --> 01:01:24,480
Open...

823
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,550
Open the door.

824
01:01:43,170 --> 01:01:44,730
What's the matter, Do Hae Yi?

825
01:01:44,730 --> 01:01:47,540
Do Hae Yi... Are you okay, Do Hae Yi?

826
01:01:47,540 --> 01:01:48,950
Do Hae Yi!

827
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:52,430
Hae Yi, pull yourself together! Come on!

828
01:01:52,430 --> 01:01:54,290
Do Hae Yi!

829
01:01:56,430 --> 01:01:58,440
Do Hae Yi!

830
01:01:58,440 --> 01:01:59,930
Pull yourself together!

831
01:01:59,930 --> 01:02:02,120
Come on!

832
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:03,600
Breathe.

833
01:02:03,600 --> 01:02:05,580
Do Hae Yi!

834
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:12,430
[Cheer Up]

835
01:02:27,450 --> 01:02:30,830
♫ <i>At times I call out to you with sincerity</i> ♫

836
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:33,740
<i>But isn't this pretty similar to what happened that day?</i>

837
01:02:33,740 --> 01:02:35,250
<i>You guys got a pretty unique new member this year.</i>

838
01:02:35,250 --> 01:02:36,270
<i>Is it Do Hae Yi?</i>

839
01:02:36,270 --> 01:02:37,600
<i>She reminds me of Yoo Min.</i>

840
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:38,900
<i>Come on, work hard.</i>

841
01:02:38,900 --> 01:02:40,660
<i>It's no fun when we're struggling so much.</i>

842
01:02:40,660 --> 01:02:41,760
<i>Here is the extra practice schedule.</i>

843
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:43,890
<i>The pep rally is right around the corner. We need at least this much to pull it off.</i>

844
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:45,200
<i>It's not like this is the only thing we do.</i>

845
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:46,720
<i>I can't make it to all these practices. It's too much.</i>

846
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,020
<i>There's a way to shorten your practice time.</i>

847
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:51,010
<i>Only the brave will earn the reward.</i>

848
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,710
<i>You're quite persistent in coming onto me.</i>

849
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:55,180
<i>I wouldn't make you cry. Why not just come to me?</i>

850
01:02:55,180 --> 01:02:57,970
<i>What type of woman do you like then, Captain?</i>

851
01:02:57,970 --> 01:03:04,550
<i>You.</i>
♫ <i>I want to know your thoughts</i> ♫
