<i>Why are you nervous? Just dance how you want.</i>

<i>You're going to break up?</i>

<i>Why?</i>

<i>I'm sorry, give me a second.</i>

233

<i>We never meet since she's always busy working.</i>

00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,410
people kept staring at you sleeping here.

264
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:40,160
And I thought covering your face would protect your privacy.

265
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:46,530
Oh, this outfit? This outfit is our–

266

00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:10,850
I met a nutcase! A nutcase!

273
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:12,320
- What?
- He's a total nutcase.

274
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,480
He covered my body with a newspaper and even my face.

275
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,680
He thinks he's Prince Charming,

276
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,230
wearing some weird, tacky getup you wouldn't wear even if someone paid you

277
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:20,430
- and he came toward me–
- Excuse me.

Oh, my God!

279

- Look at him!

00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,340
Are you always like that?

281
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,200
What? What do you mean?

00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,520

This outfit is our cheer uniform, a legacy.

286
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:43,000
I wore this for our Cheer OT, not because I'm nuts.

287
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,960
Huh?

288
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,550
People kept staring at you earlier,

Including the incident at the stairs...

291

- Haven't you thought your lack of social etiquette could be the problem?
- What?

292
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,000
Yet you have the audacity to call me a nutcase?

293
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:04,050
Then since you were sleeping in a bench, would you call yourself a crazy–

294
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:05,910
Crazy, what?

295
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,420

Excuse me.

299
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,150
Immature?

300
00:22:18,150 --> 00:22:20,510
You've got to be kidding me. Why should I even consider

301
00:22:20,510 --> 00:22:23,240
- what he just–
- You can just go.

302
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,450
Oh, did I leave this behind? Thank you.

303
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,050
But you...

304
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:29,560
- I mean, so I...
- Goodbye.

305
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,670
Am I the weird one here?

306
00:22:31,670 --> 00:22:34,200
This is so wrong and frustrating.

307
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,610
Go on.

308
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,030
- Go and tell him.
- You won't stop me?

309
00:22:37,030 --> 00:22:38,840
I won't stop you.

310
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:47,980
What's wrong?

311
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,130
Hey,

let's say a stranger covered you with this while you were sleeping.

313
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:53,590
How would you feel?

314
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:58,680
I did something unnecessary.

315
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,010
This uniform isn't tacky, right?

316
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,080
What is he talking about?

317
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,250
Hey,

318
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:12,230
you don't actually think this uniform is cool, do you?

319
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,250
What?

320
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,660
Go on a blind date wearing that then, why don't you?

321
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,690
Captain... huh?

322
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:40,830
What, social etiquette?

323
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,220
Does he think he's the student president?

324
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:44,390
He's not even aware of what he did.

325
00:23:44,390 --> 00:23:46,460
He's not exactly wrong.

326
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:49,140
You're unnecessarily objective at times like this.

327
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,530
I also often feel the urge to cover your face when you sleep.

328
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:57,030
Well, I mean... Am I that ugly?

329
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:01,100
I'm so pretty.

330
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:05,630
You're so annoying.

331
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:08,650
But hey, that seemed like the Cheer Squad uniform.

332
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:09,810
Cheer Squad?

333
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:11,660

We're both freshmen. I can speak casually, right?

395
00:29:36,290 --> 00:29:38,150
I'm not sure. We just met.

396

No, we didn't.

00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,270
- Yeah.
- Yeah!

405
00:30:00,270 --> 00:30:01,810
I'm not interested in you.

406
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:04,440
You could become interested later.

407
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:08,490
As you can see, I'm quite the beauty.

408

You're not the first guy to approach me.

409
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:13,950
And guys like you don't understand unless I spell it out,

410
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:15,760
so I'll tell you clearly.

411
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,990
I'm not interested in you.

412

I'm not now, nor will I ever be in the future.

All right then.

414
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,680
What kind of guy am I?

415
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,990
Someone who thinks they can make any girl fall for him.

416
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:28,930
I see, so I'm that kind of guy.

We just met, but you seem to know me well.

418

The thing is I'm f***ing poor.

419
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:40,930
I'm poor, so do you know what I have to do to attend a school that costs 5 million won in tuition?

420
00:30:40,930 --> 00:30:43,020
I have to work my butt off.

421
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,170
What do you think that means?

422
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:47,650
I won't have time to play with you, right?

423

You should talk to me about these things.

449
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,910
Talking to one of the members will just end in a fight.

458
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,450
What with last year's three prophecies and all of the experienced members left, too.

459
00:32:41,450 --> 00:32:43,370
You'll need to find new members.

Is this your personal budget? It's provided for the Cheer Squad.

I won't be able to participate in school clubs once I start the main classes,
