Was it really an accident? This isn't the first time.

00:26:30,259 --> 00:26:31,660
Well...

324
00:26:34,439 --> 00:26:37,470
Why are you bringing up old history?

325
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:43,769
I'll wrap things up nicely so no problems occur. Don't worry.

326
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:45,899
Look at this punk's drive.

327
00:26:45,899 --> 00:26:48,739
If a couple is formed within the Cheer Squad, problems will arise.

328
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:50,879
That's why there are rules.

329
00:26:50,879 --> 00:26:53,060
Just like with Yoo Min too.

330
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,449
Well, the prohibition of CCs is a regressive rule, to begin with.

331
00:27:01,449 --> 00:27:03,729
We clump them together and make them train all the time.

332
00:27:03,729 --> 00:27:05,699
Of course, it's natural for sparks to fly.

333
00:27:05,699 --> 00:27:07,169
Let's take this chance to get rid of that rule.

334
00:27:07,169 --> 00:27:11,000
Yeah, there's no one to replace Jung Woo, anyway.

335
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,749
But he still broke the rule, though.

336
00:27:17,749 --> 00:27:19,149
If we just let it slide,

337
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:22,899
won't the others think there's no need to keep the rules?

338
00:27:22,899 --> 00:27:26,979
Don't be so uptight. A person needs to be flexible at times.

339
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,480
What if you end up becoming a CC, too?

340
00:27:38,209 --> 00:27:41,410
- Good job.
- Good job!

341
00:27:42,709 --> 00:27:44,519
Should we go for a drink later?

342
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:48,230
I'm not sure. I need to check my schedule.

343
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:56,950
Why did that bastard need to mention CCs?

344
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,040
<i>[The University of Southern Chicago: Admission Decision from The Universi...]</i>

345
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:10,729
<i>[Dear Shin Ji Young]</i>

346
00:28:10,729 --> 00:28:12,660
<i>[Admission Decision from The University of Chicago Political Science Department]</i>

347
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,439
Should I quit the Cheer Squad?

348
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:23,449
- Why?
- What if another accident occurs?

349
00:28:23,449 --> 00:28:27,029
Why do these things keep happening to you?

350
00:28:27,029 --> 00:28:29,629
Do you really think there might be something going on

351
00:28:29,629 --> 00:28:31,179
like in the Media Department's video?

352
00:28:31,179 --> 00:28:35,079
Right? I'm honestly weirded out, too.

353
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:38,979
I wonder if it's intentional but then I ask myself,

354
00:28:38,979 --> 00:28:41,820
why me?

355
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,109
Theia.

356
00:28:48,109 --> 00:28:51,659
Captain, you turned out to be an absolute romantic.

357
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:55,019
Will you die if you don't see her every single day?

358
00:28:55,019 --> 00:28:56,470
Well...

359
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:01,659
This third wheel will disappear from your sight.

360
00:29:01,659 --> 00:29:06,179
You must drink every drop of the dongchimi, okay?

361
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,609
- I'm off.
- Thanks.

362
00:29:08,609 --> 00:29:09,729
Don't keep her out too late.

363
00:29:09,729 --> 00:29:11,600
Okay. Yeah, not too late.

364
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,929
Is it really like that?

365
00:29:21,929 --> 00:29:26,040
Will you really die if you don't see me every single day?

366
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,209
Quit?

367
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,619
Not quit per se, but safety is most important.

368
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,319
So I'm asking for your opinion.

369
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:45,029
You think it wasn't an accident?

370
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:47,370
Is there something that stands out to you?

371
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:50,760
You just never know.

372
00:29:54,979 --> 00:29:57,949
You should've said so before Summer Training Camp.

373
00:29:57,949 --> 00:30:00,889
We went through hell and won't participate in the Yeon Ho Competition?

374
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:05,160
That's too unfair. We trained so hard for months.

375
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,729
Let's wait and see. To see if it was an accident or intentional.

376
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:19,630
And we need to clean s***, not avoid it.

377
00:30:21,509 --> 00:30:22,980
All right.

378
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:27,899
You really don't know anything?

379
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,590
Go and lay it on me, so we can take care of this s*** together.

380
00:30:35,019 --> 00:30:37,159
It's nothing like that.

381
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,649
Really?

382
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:49,109
I'll go now. Go inside.

383
00:30:49,799 --> 00:30:51,899
Hurry inside and rest.

384
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:59,029
- Thank you for coming today.
- Sure.

385
00:31:18,069 --> 00:31:21,239
- Hi.
- Hi.

386
00:31:21,239 --> 00:31:23,129
- Hae Yi...
- Hae Yi! Are you okay?

387
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:24,889
- Are you okay?
- Are you really okay?

388
00:31:24,889 --> 00:31:26,059
Are you really fine?

389
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,739
- Y-Yes, I'm fine.
- Really?

390
00:31:27,739 --> 00:31:30,359
Yes, I'm totally fine.

391
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:34,669
I'm fine.

392
00:31:35,469 --> 00:31:37,359
- Hae Yi, are you okay?
- Hae Yi, are you okay?

393
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:40,259
Yes. I'm okay.

394
00:31:43,709 --> 00:31:47,949
Now, I know all of you were shocked and worried because of the terrible accident.

395
00:31:47,949 --> 00:31:50,059
To prevent another such incident from happening again,

396
00:31:50,059 --> 00:31:54,339
we'll be paying extra care and attention to our members' safety.

397
00:31:55,459 --> 00:31:57,029
By the way...

398
00:31:57,029 --> 00:32:01,349
you and Hae Yi are going out, right?

399
00:32:07,709 --> 00:32:09,289
Well, that's...

400
00:32:09,289 --> 00:32:13,179
To avoid any problems or unfair situations due to that matter,

401
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:16,339
the Vice-captain will be solely in charge

402
00:32:16,339 --> 00:32:19,059
of picking and choosing the song for the Yeon Ho Competition.

403
00:32:19,059 --> 00:32:22,809
We'll do our best to avoid any unnecessary damages because of this,

404
00:32:22,809 --> 00:32:24,759
so you can rest assured.

405
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,039
Now, now, now, and finally...

406
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:33,089
we have the long-awaited Yeon Ho Competition poster.

407
00:32:33,089 --> 00:32:36,409
Your job is to put them up on bulletin boards.

408
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:41,899
Also, divide them up among yourselves and post them all around the school.

409
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:48,079
- Let's go.
- How many are there?

410
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:56,259
Hae Yi, you're dating Captain, right?

411
00:32:56,259 --> 00:33:00,199
Can't you ask Captain to lessen our training?

412
00:33:00,199 --> 00:33:02,919
I think he'll listen if you ask him.

413
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:07,889
He won't listen to her because he's a cold-hearted human being.

414
00:33:07,889 --> 00:33:10,619
You saw it at the Training Camp

415
00:33:10,619 --> 00:33:14,019
- how he called me.
<i>- Is this your best?</i>

416
00:33:17,109 --> 00:33:18,379
I did.

417
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:20,229
- That's true.
- Wait up.

418
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:23,899
Were there more new couples while we were gone?

419
00:33:23,899 --> 00:33:26,339
You better fess up before it's too late.

420
00:33:26,339 --> 00:33:29,219
I might not look like it, but I'm quite keen–

421
00:33:31,169 --> 00:33:34,039
Wait a minute. Seon Ja, you...

422
00:33:38,439 --> 00:33:41,689
- and Yong Il–
- What?

423
00:33:41,689 --> 00:33:44,679
You've got such bad instincts. Totally sucks.

424
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:47,009
I'll tell you honestly,

425
00:33:47,009 --> 00:33:49,839
I won't take him even if he's handed to me.

426
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:53,629
Hey, many posts were on the school community forum saying how cute I am.

427
00:33:53,629 --> 00:33:56,089
Let me see, then. Where exactly?

428
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,689
Where? Where exactly?

429
00:33:57,689 --> 00:34:00,919
"I thought only popular people got into the Cheer Squad,

430
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,199
but when I saw it during the festival

431
00:34:02,199 --> 00:34:05,179
it was surprising to see a nerd-looking guy."

432
00:34:05,179 --> 00:34:06,639
They called you a nerd.

433
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:10,569
"Isn't he the one who looks quiet and gloomy?"

434
00:34:10,569 --> 00:34:14,649
"He usually wears glasses and–

435
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:16,729
That's not me, though.

436
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,199
Hey, who are they to judge the looks?

437
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,529
Don't get hurt by those baseless words.

438
00:34:23,529 --> 00:34:25,129
It doesn't say it's about Min Jae, though.

439
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:26,899
Hey, hey. Eyeglasses.

440
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:29,579
Glasses? I don't have glasses.

441
00:34:29,579 --> 00:34:31,219
Just be quiet, please.

442
00:34:31,219 --> 00:34:33,719
H-Hey, l-let's get to work.

443
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,009
- Okay?
- I'm telling you I saw it, though.

444
00:34:36,009 --> 00:34:38,509
Come on, put it back in.

445
00:34:43,439 --> 00:34:46,139
- Want me to help?
- Sure.

446
00:34:49,249 --> 00:34:50,209
How do you do this?

447
00:34:50,209 --> 00:34:54,889
Roll up five posters and secure them with a rubber band twice.

448
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,569
Are you completely recovered now?

449
00:34:57,569 --> 00:35:00,039
Yeah. I'm fine.

450
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:02,879
Are you sure you're okay?

451
00:35:02,879 --> 00:35:06,189
Look at this. My muscles are no joke, right?

452
00:35:10,099 --> 00:35:13,349
<i>We decided that the kiss in Busan never happened, either.</i>

453
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:16,419
<i>We'll just say you never rejected me, either.</i>

454
00:35:19,799 --> 00:35:22,189
Hey, you need to step up your game.

455
00:35:26,869 --> 00:35:29,109
I mean serious business, too.

456
00:35:31,069 --> 00:35:32,319
Right?

457
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:33,869
- It's no joke, right?
- Not bad.

458
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:34,969
No joke, right?

459
00:35:34,969 --> 00:35:36,839
Right, right?

460
00:35:39,789 --> 00:35:41,629
What are you doing?

461
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:43,509
I was on my way out.

462
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,429
But, why?

463
00:35:46,939 --> 00:35:49,839
I remembered leaving something in the Captain's Room.

464
00:35:58,729 --> 00:36:00,859
He touched her arm?

465
00:36:02,419 --> 00:36:05,509
Gosh, I'm d***ed.

466
00:36:06,419 --> 00:36:08,119
Way too d***ed.

467
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:13,269
Seriously, what did I see wrong to misunderstand that person as you?

468
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:15,169
Do I need an eye exam or something?

469
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:18,789
It's true I'm not a good fit for the Cheer Squad.

470
00:36:18,789 --> 00:36:20,319
I know it, too.

471
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:22,099
It's okay.

472
00:36:23,169 --> 00:36:25,439
Do you want to trust me just once?

473
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:26,979
What?

474
00:36:36,229 --> 00:36:38,469
<i>Just accept it, too, Mom...</i>

475
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,139
<i>that you can't control other people.</i>

476
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:52,419
Honey!

477
00:36:54,419 --> 00:36:56,779
Aigoo, how

478
00:36:56,779 --> 00:37:00,489
did you get home so early without even calling?

479
00:37:06,789 --> 00:37:09,789
I have something to tell you.

480
00:37:13,659 --> 00:37:15,939
Great work, everyone.

481
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:22,879
Gosh, I'm hungry.

482
00:37:26,509 --> 00:37:29,169
Sunbae, c-could I have one, too?

483
00:37:29,169 --> 00:37:32,059
- Have it all.
- Thank you so much.

484
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,509
Let me have one, too.

485
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:40,319
<i>I don't have to go to work today.</i>

486
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:42,649
<i>Do you want to go watch a movie?</i>

487
00:37:55,339 --> 00:37:59,009
A lot of things have happened lately so just for a change of mood.

488
00:37:59,009 --> 00:38:00,839
T-This is an expensive one, though.

489
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:02,789
I couldn't get a good seat.

490
00:38:02,789 --> 00:38:03,769
Sorry.

491
00:38:03,769 --> 00:38:05,309
It's a good seat.

492
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:07,729
It's the best one.

493
00:38:11,479 --> 00:38:13,359
Thank you.

494
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,929
I told you not to do that movement like that!

495
00:38:19,929 --> 00:38:21,479
You're so lost, seriously!

496
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:22,779
Y-Yes!

497
00:38:22,779 --> 00:38:25,049
I-I shouldn't do it like this.

498
00:38:25,049 --> 00:38:28,009
Right? One, two, three...

499
00:38:28,009 --> 00:38:29,409
It's fine.

500
00:38:29,409 --> 00:38:32,529
You're overreacting as if you're having an affair.

501
00:38:32,529 --> 00:38:35,459
Hope you two have a good time, then.

502
00:38:37,279 --> 00:38:38,809
You can't just do that out of nowhere.

503
00:38:38,809 --> 00:38:40,569
I was nervous.

504
00:38:40,569 --> 00:38:43,179
Never mind. You did well.

505
00:38:43,179 --> 00:38:45,089
I know how you feel.

506
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:47,479
I'm totally fine.

507
00:38:49,479 --> 00:38:51,399
Don't be like that.

508
00:38:54,129 --> 00:38:56,750
I said not to do that!

509
00:38:57,709 --> 00:38:59,759
Gosh, I shouldn't have patted your head.

510
00:38:59,759 --> 00:39:00,869
Why?

511
00:39:00,869 --> 00:39:03,299
I like it when you pat my head.

512
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:06,039
- Is that so?
- Do it again.

513
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:14,319
There, there.

514
00:39:17,159 --> 00:39:19,289
- Are you happy?
- Yes.

515
00:39:41,559 --> 00:39:44,459
It feels a little awkward.

516
00:39:46,649 --> 00:39:50,849
Couldn't you keep being awkward, please?

517
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:54,539
Someone awkward is totally my type.

518
00:39:57,369 --> 00:40:00,339
What did I tell you? I told you to have faith in this noona.

519
00:40:00,339 --> 00:40:02,379
Technically, I'm older than you, though.

520
00:40:02,379 --> 00:40:04,709
Buy me some food if you're thankful.

521
00:40:04,709 --> 00:40:07,099
Okay, I will.

522
00:40:07,779 --> 00:40:11,379
However, why did you do this for me?

523
00:40:11,379 --> 00:40:13,649
You gave me my first birthday present.

524
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,559
Also I want you to have more confidence.

525
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:22,149
I think you underestimate yourself.

526
00:40:22,149 --> 00:40:26,660
This change of look could be your change of pace, you know?

527
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:29,009
Honestly,

528
00:40:29,009 --> 00:40:32,199
you wanted to join the Cheer Squad longer than anyone else

529
00:40:32,199 --> 00:40:35,099
and you do work harder than anyone else.

530
00:40:36,489 --> 00:40:38,489
You're the most fitting one out of all of us.

531
00:40:38,489 --> 00:40:40,659
Who else would do it if you didn't?

532
00:40:42,399 --> 00:40:44,169
Thank you.

533
00:40:46,349 --> 00:40:48,149
I'm going to eat something expensive.

534
00:40:48,149 --> 00:40:50,339
Where was the beef place again?

535
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:53,269
I kind of spent a lot of money today, so...

536
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,669
I started liking someone.

537
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,529
That's what I came to tell you.

538
00:41:01,529 --> 00:41:03,859
I'm sorry.

539
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:05,629
If you were going to say that, you could've just texted.

540
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,159
Why bother to meet? It's a waste of time.

541
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:08,399
I mean...

542
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:10,069
I thought...

543
00:41:10,069 --> 00:41:11,769
that would be too rude.

544
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,639
This is even ruder.

545
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:16,869
It's not like we dated. It was just a little flirting.

546
00:41:16,869 --> 00:41:20,219
I also came out with a light heart today as if I was going to a store.

547
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:23,289
People would think I really like you a lot or something.

548
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,639
That's true.

549
00:41:24,639 --> 00:41:26,249
You're right.

550
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,509
I overreacted.

551
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:29,799
You're done talking, right?

552
00:41:29,799 --> 00:41:31,219
I can leave now, right?

553
00:41:31,219 --> 00:41:33,029
Yeah.

554
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,229
What kind of a girl is she?

555
00:41:41,229 --> 00:41:43,419

Didn't you go out to see Woon Chan?

559

What about Woon Chan?

561
00:42:05,569 --> 00:42:08,179
Ki Woon Chan confessed to me.

562
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:11,909
But I rejected him

563
00:42:11,909 --> 00:42:14,249
because he was so-so on a second look.

564
00:42:21,759 --> 00:42:23,559
Is he okay?

565
00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:28,209

<i>I did see a person whom I thought might be him once.</i>

Gosh, I know...

- Aigoo.

649
00:46:55,499 --> 00:46:59,259
I better stay since you know nothing about tending to a sick person.

650
00:46:59,259 --> 00:47:02,429
I'll call you when she wakes up, so go home.

651
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:05,379
It's because I don't want to go home.

652
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:10,229
Then you can go to our house.

653
00:47:10,229 --> 00:47:14,889
Make sure you feed him breakfast tomorrow.

654
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:17,049
Yes. Why?

655
00:47:18,889 --> 00:47:20,859
Hurry and go home.

656
00:47:21,749 --> 00:47:23,189
Okay.

657
00:47:23,189 --> 00:47:24,869
Seon Ho, get up.

658
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:27,509
Okay? Go home.

659
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:28,399
Let's go.

660
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,119
Mom will call us when your mother wakes up.

661
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,419
I'll call you, so go. Hurry and get up.

662
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:37,089
Come on now. I'll really call you.

663
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:54,329
Mom's been hospitalized.

664
00:47:54,329 --> 00:47:55,769
<i>What about now?</i>

665
00:47:55,769 --> 00:47:57,189
<i>Is she okay?</i>

666
00:47:57,189 --> 00:48:00,589
She wouldn't be hospitalized if she was okay!

667
00:48:07,079 --> 00:48:09,119
It's the Gwanghye Hospital.

668
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:30,499
I'll...

669
00:48:31,149 --> 00:48:33,669
actually just go home.

670
00:48:37,329 --> 00:48:39,499
Well...

671
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,709
Gosh, this senseless punk.

672
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:58,489
Should I eat some ramen before I go?

673
00:48:58,489 --> 00:49:00,319
Let's do that.

674
00:49:01,749 --> 00:49:03,829
What ramen do you want?

675
00:49:03,829 --> 00:49:06,009
Any kind is okay.

676
00:49:19,949 --> 00:49:21,589
I'm home.

677
00:49:21,589 --> 00:49:23,949
You're home.

678
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:29,539
Do you board at our house?

679
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:32,479
Eat some if you're hungry, too, Brother-in-law.

680
00:49:32,479 --> 00:49:34,329
No, thank you.

681
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:37,649
Please lay some bedding on the floor for me.

682
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,039
I'll be in your care tonight.

683
00:49:41,039 --> 00:49:43,809
- Aren't you two–
- Yes, yes.

684
00:49:43,809 --> 00:49:46,139
I'll make some bedding for you.

685
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:50,539
- Hae Yi...
- Yes?

686
00:49:50,539 --> 00:49:52,219
Do you have rice?

687
00:49:52,829 --> 00:49:54,749
Of course.

688
00:49:59,489 --> 00:50:01,469
Brother-in-law, are you sleeping?

689
00:50:02,019 --> 00:50:04,319
Let's sleep.

690
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:06,999
- You're not sleeping, huh?
- I'm in 12th grade.

691
00:50:06,999 --> 00:50:10,419
I have to go study again first thing in the morning.

692
00:50:10,419 --> 00:50:12,089
Brother-in-law,

693
00:50:12,569 --> 00:50:14,909
I like your house.

694
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:19,379
If I stay here, my heart is at peace.

695
00:50:19,379 --> 00:50:21,509
That's because you're in

696
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:23,209
someone else's home.

697
00:50:23,209 --> 00:50:25,679
You're not connected to anything.

698
00:50:25,679 --> 00:50:28,029
I see.

699
00:50:28,029 --> 00:50:30,309
That's why I felt that way.

700
00:50:32,179 --> 00:50:34,259
Since when were you so smart, Brother-in-law?

701
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:36,499
Since birth.

702
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:42,609
- Brother-in-law!
- Gosh, let's go to sleep now, please!

703
00:50:45,769 --> 00:50:48,869
Okay. I won't bother you anymore.

704
00:50:52,599 --> 00:50:55,399
When you want to rest your heart,

705
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:58,509
come over and hang out.

706
00:50:59,879 --> 00:51:02,259
I'll let you sleep over.

707
00:51:04,499 --> 00:51:08,029
Don't come over too often, though.

708
00:51:10,929 --> 00:51:13,309
Thank you, Brother-in-law.

709
00:51:16,389 --> 00:51:17,609
Goodnight.

710
00:51:17,609 --> 00:51:21,079
- Dream of me.
- Geez, it's up to me.

711
00:51:21,629 --> 00:51:24,079
I'm kidding.

712
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:26,669
Goodnight for real now.

713
00:51:39,469 --> 00:51:41,339
You don't have to be so careful.

714
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,639
I'm okay.

715
00:51:42,639 --> 00:51:44,609
No, the thing is...

716
00:51:44,609 --> 00:51:46,469
Okay.

717
00:51:46,469 --> 00:51:48,219
Thank you.

718
00:51:49,159 --> 00:51:50,629
What?

719
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:54,859
It was bearable yesterday, thanks to your family.

720
00:52:02,649 --> 00:52:05,129
Hello.

721
00:52:05,129 --> 00:52:06,459
We see you often, Ace.

722
00:52:06,459 --> 00:52:08,369
I guess so.

723
00:52:08,369 --> 00:52:10,579
What brings you here?

724
00:52:10,579 --> 00:52:12,719
I came to seduce Park Jung Woo.

725
00:52:12,719 --> 00:52:14,949
Hey, what the heck?

726
00:52:17,899 --> 00:52:19,689
So, you two

727
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,299
came together, huh?

728
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:24,019
Yes.

729
00:52:24,019 --> 00:52:25,959
It just happened that way.

730
00:52:25,959 --> 00:52:29,089
You two seem close since way back when...

731
00:52:29,089 --> 00:52:31,149
Couldn't they be dating without us knowing?

732
00:52:31,149 --> 00:52:32,429
No!

733
00:52:32,429 --> 00:52:36,339
No, no, no. T-That's really not true.

734
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:37,799
We'll be off.

735
00:52:37,799 --> 00:52:40,209
- Take care.
- Let's go.

736
00:52:40,209 --> 00:52:41,969
Go.

737
00:52:51,979 --> 00:52:53,719
Let us go, too.

738
00:52:56,599 --> 00:52:58,509
Jung Woo!

739
00:53:00,209 --> 00:53:02,439
Let's talk for a moment.

740
00:53:05,509 --> 00:53:07,779
Why? What happened?

741
00:53:08,869 --> 00:53:12,099
Soo Il oppa was found not guilty.

742
00:53:12,909 --> 00:53:17,219
The case closed, concluding the firework cost 3 million won, for the festival was omitted.

743
00:53:21,319 --> 00:53:22,759
You heard the news?

744
00:53:22,759 --> 00:53:24,649
Hyung, let's meet.

745
00:53:24,649 --> 00:53:26,319
Let's meet and talk.

746
00:53:26,319 --> 00:53:27,659
Why the f*** would I meet you?

747
00:53:27,659 --> 00:53:31,019
I don't want to see your face ever again.

748
00:53:31,019 --> 00:53:32,399
I want to ask you something.

749
00:53:32,399 --> 00:53:34,069
Whatever that may be, I have no intention of talking to you.

750
00:53:34,069 --> 00:53:36,259
So stop annoying me and hang up.

751
00:53:36,259 --> 00:53:38,179
<i>It's not you, is it?</i>

752
00:53:39,709 --> 00:53:41,919
The one who sent that message.

753
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,589
Why?

754
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:46,549
Hyung, you know, don't you?

755
00:53:46,549 --> 00:53:48,909
Who the real culprit is.

756
00:53:52,259 --> 00:53:54,089
Hang up now, punk.

757
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:02,729
I was found not guilty.

758
00:54:02,729 --> 00:54:03,579
So what?

759
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:06,469
Your judgment of the situation is terrible.

760
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:09,929
It means your threats no longer work.

761
00:54:10,769 --> 00:54:14,219
Perhaps, are you the one responsible

762
00:54:14,219 --> 00:54:17,079
for the fire during the camp this time?

763
00:54:18,709 --> 00:54:20,039
You're the one, huh?

764
00:54:20,039 --> 00:54:22,789
Whoa, this a**hole is really gutsy.

765
00:54:22,789 --> 00:54:24,059
You know, that's a crime.

766
00:54:24,059 --> 00:54:26,289
It wasn't me.

767
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:27,789
Don't corner a person so easily like that.

768
00:54:27,789 --> 00:54:30,639
So you even made it look like you rescued her after setting the fire?

769
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,819
What in the hell is your goal?

770
00:54:32,819 --> 00:54:34,969
Do you want to get people's attention that badly?

771
00:54:34,969 --> 00:54:37,359
I said it's nothing like that, s***.

772
00:54:37,939 --> 00:54:40,579
You really shouldn't be let loose like this.

773
00:54:41,239 --> 00:54:44,319
Prepare yourself for a police investigation.

774
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,989
I didn't want to see Park Jung Woo's face, but...

775
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:53,839
I guess I have no choice but to see him.

776
00:54:54,849 --> 00:54:56,469
Right?

777
00:55:00,139 --> 00:55:02,479
I just protected it!

778
00:55:04,429 --> 00:55:06,019
Hey, after you set the fire?

779
00:55:06,019 --> 00:55:07,589
What the heck did you even protect?

780
00:55:07,589 --> 00:55:09,899
You need to be punished if you break the rules.

781
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:11,869
Lee Yoo Min and Do Hae Yi

782
00:55:11,869 --> 00:55:13,099
are both being punished.

783
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:14,809
Who are you to be the judge?

784
00:55:14,809 --> 00:55:18,729
You guys ruined it, and I'm the one who defended it.

785
00:55:18,729 --> 00:55:21,159
I defended it all.

786
00:55:21,159 --> 00:55:23,569
This punk is a total nutcase.

787
00:55:23,569 --> 00:55:25,139
Huh?

788
00:55:25,139 --> 00:55:27,309
Crazy bastard!

789
00:55:29,219 --> 00:55:30,489
- Let go!
- You better not!

790
00:55:30,489 --> 00:55:32,659
Let me go, you punk.

791
00:55:38,029 --> 00:55:39,739
Hey, you crazy bastard!

792
00:55:39,739 --> 00:55:43,289
Hey, I'll get you locked up. Just wait.

793
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:44,819
S***!

794
00:55:44,819 --> 00:55:46,439
What the f***–

795
00:55:48,439 --> 00:55:50,169
- Hey!
- S***!

796
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,089
F***ing idiot. What?

797
00:55:54,089 --> 00:55:55,959
Are you going to stab me? Huh?

798
00:55:55,959 --> 00:55:58,519
This motherf***er–

799
00:56:00,119 --> 00:56:01,739
Hey, you crazy motherf***er!

800
00:56:01,739 --> 00:56:03,329
- Hey!
- I'll eventually set things right.

801
00:56:03,329 --> 00:56:04,689
What the f*** are you saying?

802
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:06,399
Huh?

803
00:56:17,889 --> 00:56:21,529
You crazy attention-seeking motherf***er!

804
00:56:34,509 --> 00:56:37,089
<i>[Hyung, let's talk in person]</i>

805

<i>[47th Class, Jung Soo Il sunbae]</i>

807
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:10,879

<i>[If you break the rules, you will be punished.]</i>

811

You're being punished since you broke the rules.

812

It's all your fault.
