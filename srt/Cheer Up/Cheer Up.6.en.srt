It's a relief that no one was hurt,

00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,070
You need to choose what's more important.

167
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:33,630
What's most important to you?

168
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,580
Me? Money.

169
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:38,860
Gosh, you're my daughter, but you're so materialistic.

170
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,820
Man, oh, man. I'm so proud of you.

171
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:45,640
Of course. What's more important than money to us?

172
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,800
Decision made. Choose money!

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
Right?

174
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,810
Of course.

175
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,360
Right.

176
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:00,550
Right?

177
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,600
Right.

178
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:05,710
Right?

179
00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,700
<i>[Cheer Squad, horror story uploaded!]</i>

180
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,610
<i>[It's a relief I left the squad.]
[Were the 3 prophecies true?]</i>

181
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,630
Hey.

182
00:10:12,630 --> 00:10:14,520
Why did you upload that without permission?

183
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,350
Do you know the panic you've caused?

184
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,100
Sorry.

185
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,280
Forget it.

186
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,570
Kill the series here.

187
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:26,900
I don't want to.

188
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,730
What do you mean you don't want to?

189
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,700
Th-There's still something I need to figure out.

190
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,710
I think you're really misunderstanding something here,

191
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:40,420
but we also have a decision-making system.

192
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,260
If you're just going on your own and doing what you want,

193
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,350
then just leave and start a personal broadcast.

194
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:47,780
- But–
- Forget about it!

195
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,140
I clearly told you to kill it.

196
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,210
I'll finish up next week and quit then.

197
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:04,590
There's something I said I'll do, so I need to complete the period.

198
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:08,120
As you said, I joined the squad for money.

199
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,210
I need that money.

200
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:14,140
Then I'll keep in mind that you're quitting next week.

201
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,900
But...

202
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:24,110
If I also leave,

203
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:27,150
there will be fewer people.

204
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,470
Would it be okay?

205
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:35,470
The reason I applied to this school in the first place

206
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:37,580
was because of the Cheer Squad.

207
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,000
Getting into the Cheer Squad was my goal and motivation!

208
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,650
But...

209
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,840
joining because of money and prancing around with a bit of talent

210
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,750
is not right.

211
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,670
I don't expect everyone to have the same mindset as I do.

212
00:11:54,850 --> 00:11:57,800
But at least the reason shouldn't be because of money.

213
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:03,280
Or its meaning will also become worthless for me.

214
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:17,100
All right, hello!

215
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:25,880
What are you doing?

216
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,500
Do you have a death wish?

217
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,430
And the product?

218
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:49,200
Gosh...

219
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,040
What the heck?

220
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:55,390
People compensate for returned lost belongings.

221
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:56,530
Are you going to skip showing your gratitude?

222
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,900
That's why I requested a delivery service.

223
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:04,990
Isn't this a bit too much to drink alone?

224
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:11,480
I mean, how could even the judges give up

225
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:15,500
the top award to Sung Chun Yang in Hwang Jin Hee competition?
<i>(T/N: Two historical women who represent Korean beauty.)</i>

226
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:18,190
They said the name Hwang Jin Hee was a waste.

227
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:22,060
Then they should've just named me themselves.

228
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:27,600
Why would they play around with someone's name?

229
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,960
You haven't changed.

230
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,790
You're still delicate and girlish.

231
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:36,100
What are you saying?

232
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:38,930
I did change.

233
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,050
So much time has passed.

234
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:45,980
I've really changed, right?

235
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,190
Your thick skin has improved.

236
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,350
You always used to hide behind me

237
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,670
and couldn't speak properly.

238
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:58,410
As I lived life, there was no one to hide behind,

239
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:01,940
so I had no choice but to stand in front.

240
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:04,080
And that's how I became

241
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,220
like this.

242
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,770
Oh, my.

243
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,330
Oh, my! Is it already this late?

244
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:17,770
Oh, my gosh. I'm going to be late for work.

245
00:14:17,770 --> 00:14:19,770
Wait, weren't you done?

246
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:21,990
I have another part-time job.

247
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:24,250
But... But you drank alcohol.

248
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,030
I'll sober up on the way.

249
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:28,860
If you have more good-quality alcohol,

250
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,900
let's have a drink. Okay?

251
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,740
Come on.

252
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,400
See you next time.

253
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,700
I'm leaving. Bye.

254
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:50,550
Joo Seon, by any chance,

255
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,370
- if one more person leaves–
- That definitely can't happen!

256
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:55,810
Are we supposed to prance around like the Three Musketeers?

257
00:14:55,810 --> 00:14:58,880
Why? Is Im Yong Il leaving? Because Seon Ho left?

258
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,340
- No, that's not it.
- I see.

259
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:03,950
Gosh, but how unexpected of Kim Min Jae, that punk.

260
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,210
I thought he'd take flight.

261
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:08,390
He's not as skilled as the other members,

262
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:11,260
but he's better than nothing, right?

263
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:15,480
By the way, you haven't received any more messages?

264
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:17,040
Huh?

265
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,680
I told you it was a prank.

266
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,080
The Media Department was probably just fabricating things to make an issue.

267
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,420
Did they back off because it blew up bigger than they expected?

268
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
What's this?
<i>[The Yonhee Blue]</i>

269
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,840
What is it?

270
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:37,780
This looks like an old school magazine.

271
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,730
Why is this inside your locker?

272
00:15:40,730 --> 00:15:42,730
Shouldn't you tell the seniors?

273
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,420
Someone must've placed it in the wrong locker.

274
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,450
<i>[Shin Ji Yeong]</i>

275
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:17,860
<i>8:00 p.m.</i>

276
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:21,360
<i>I want tteokbokki and soondae with a lot of guts.</i>

277
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:40,860
- Hello, hello.
- Hello.

278
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,430
We're newbies from the Cheer Squad.

279
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:46,250
We need the band's help with composing a new song.

280
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,480
Oh, he's in charge of that.

281
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,120
Hey!

282
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:52,220
- Hel–
- Yes.

283
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,600
What the?

284
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,290
What?

285
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,810
I'm going to the restroom.

286
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,750
That video from the Media Department,

287
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,140
the one who received that strange message is you, isn't it?

288
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,040
You should quit the Cheer Squad.

289
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,270
There's no reason for you to continue while being harassed like that.

290
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:11,580
Wow, I almost misunderstood that you're worried about me.

291
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:14,200
Whether I quit or not, that's my business.

292
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,400
Don't be so twisted.

293
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,840
I'm saying this because I'm truly worried about you.

294
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:19,670
It's not like we're strangers.

295
00:17:19,670 --> 00:17:22,620
That's right, we're worse than strangers.

296
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:25,900
Jin Seon Ho has another girlfriend.

297
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,240
Yeah.

298
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,320
What did I tell you?

299
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,900
I told you to be wary of him, right?

300
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,970
Yeah, don't worry. We didn't end on a bad note like I did with you.

301
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:35,610
More like there was zero impact because your feelings weren't real.

302
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:37,410
And we ended on a bad note because

303
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:40,180
what we had was sincere.

304
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,660
The things he says...

305
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,700
Are you sure you won't regret it?

306
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:49,120
It's not easy to meet someone like me.

307
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:50,510
Exactly.

308
00:17:50,510 --> 00:17:54,210
It's going to be very hard to find someone like you.

309
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:56,580
You're not going to follow me inside, are you?

310
00:18:03,530 --> 00:18:05,690
Should we watch a movie?

311
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,520
Do you want to?

312
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,660
Or should we go to karaoke?

313
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,000
That sounds good, too.

314
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,440
- Isn't there something you want to do?
- Me?

315
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,830
What you want to do.

316
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:19,230
I want to do something you want to do.

317
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:21,120
Then you want to go watch a movie?

318
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,250
Which movies are out?

319
00:18:28,810 --> 00:18:31,560
<i>Hey, I sent you some side dishes.</i>

320
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:32,750
All right.

321
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,620
How about your studies? Is it going well?

322
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,400
It's just going.

323
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,630
Oh, well then... Is there anything you need?

324
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,560
No.

325
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,430
If there's something you need, let me know right away.

326
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,870
I have a lot of money.

327
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:51,020
Okay. I'm sorry.

328
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,970
For what?

329
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,260
Mom, you work so hard.

330
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,680
I don't want to hear it!

331
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,300
We talked too much nonsense.

332
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,300
Take care.

333
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,670
What are you doing?

334
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,730
Hey, what on earth are you doing here at this time?

335
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,790
I was in the library studying for my exam tomorrow

336
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,640
and got hungry.

337
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:47,730
Eating too much is going to make me sleepy.

338
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,920
I think you already ate a lot.

339
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,540
I couldn't eat much today.

340
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:57,960
Kimchi. I should've bought the kimchi.

341
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,280
Do you at least want altari?
<i>(T/N: A type of radish.)</i>

342
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,490
- Do you have some?
- Yeah?

343
00:20:02,490 --> 00:20:04,230
Altari.

344
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,350
Altari.

345
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,890
Captain, don't tell these jokes anywhere else.

346
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,450
Wait, all the kids laughed.

347
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:15,810
They just surrendered to authority.

348
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:18,630
They were probably all cursing you out internally.

349
00:20:18,630 --> 00:20:20,380
I'm the only one who can tell you this.

350
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,830
Be grateful.

351
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,430
Was it that lame?

352
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,010
If I think about it once in a while,

353
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,840
I might snicker a bit

354
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,110
because of how speechless it makes me.

355
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:34,790
There's nothing going on these days, right?

356
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,170
Like what?

357
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:38,330
If there isn't, then it's good.

358
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,430
<i>Then I'll keep in mind that you're quitting next week.</i>

359
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,260
I...

360
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,980
do have something to say.

361
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:50,660
You do?

362
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:56,250
Well...

363
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,940
What?

364
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,690
Well–

365
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,790
Happy birthday.

366
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:15,500
Why are they doing that at this time?

367
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,700
It's not like the world's going to end if they don't do it this instant.

368
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:21,120
Maybe he just wants to congratulate her that badly.

369
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:24,360
There are so many useless anniversaries in this world.

370
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:27,950
Valentine's day, White day, Christmas, each birthday,

371
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:30,390
and if you also count the 100th day and 200th day,

372
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:32,770
then all 12 months are anniversaries.

373
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:34,810
You're right.

374
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:37,180
How wonderful to have so many anniversaries.

375
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,140
Anniversaries are supposed to be special days,

376
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,870
but aren't there too many special days?

377
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,540
How much will it cost to celebrate each one?

378
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:50,710
In modern times, you need money to be in a relationship.

379
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:54,410
- Is that so?
- If you think about it,

380
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,750
your sense of reality is somewhat innocent.

381
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:00,870
Well, I guess that's why you spend the night in the club room

382
00:22:00,870 --> 00:22:03,980
while other people stack specs for their future.

383
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:06,540
I guess so.

384
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:12,200
I lack a sense of reality.

385
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,100
What's wrong with you?

386
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,760
This is where you say, "What do you know?" and make a comeback.

387
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,510
Why are you agreeing? I don't know how I should react now.

388
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:24,670
Because it rings true.

389
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:35,150
There are people who sit here like me while others stack specs.

390
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,700
There ought to be someone who dates without money.

391
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:46,260
That could become troublesome to their partner.

392
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,470
That's the problem.

393
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:50,730
It probably won't be troublesome.

394
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,850
How would you know?

395
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,590
Just.

396
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:00,460
If it were me, I wouldn't think so.

397
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:09,160
You said you have something to say. What is it?

398
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,690
Huh?

399
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,850
Oh, that...

400
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:22,300
I forgot. I'll tell you if I remember next time.

401
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,490
It's tasty.

402
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,460
It's nice.

403
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,550
What?

404
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,430
The breeze is nice.

405
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:57,480
Is there a breeze?

406
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:11,180
<i>[Sung Kyu Jin: Can I see you tomorrow?]
[Sung: Okay, let's meet.]</i>

407
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,410
Do you keep in touch with Yoo Min noona?

408
00:24:26,410 --> 00:24:28,060
No.

409
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,990
We broke up, so it's more difficult for me than you to contact her.

410
00:24:34,230 --> 00:24:36,100
It's not me.

411
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:40,010
I also watched the video from the Media Department.

412
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,400
That wasn't me.

413
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:44,120
Didn't you ask to meet to ask me that question?

414
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,290
No, not that...

415
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,670
By any chance...

416
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:53,880
Did Yoo Min ever receive weird messages like that?

417
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,050
When we dated,

418
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,970
some bastard anonymously sent a message telling us to break up.

419
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:05,610
I made a big deal, so Noona never mentioned it again.

420
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,390
I'm not sure if there was anything else.

421
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,710
So Noona also received them.

422
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,300
But it was a little weird at the time.

423
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,230
<i>[Yonhee]</i>
<i>[Theia]</i>

424
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:24,140
Guys,

425
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,120
- should we play a game for coffee?
- One!

426
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,900
- Two!
- Three.

427
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,070
S***!

428
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,580
We don't take s***.

429
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,590
Four.

430
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,200
No, that's not the problem.

431
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,240
Five.

432
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:36,910
What?

433
00:25:41,550 --> 00:25:44,690
<i>Hereafter, Theia will sincerely participate in a police investigation.</i>

434
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:46,390
<i>If a problem arises during the investigation,</i>

435
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:49,030
<i>they will take legal responsibility.</i>

436
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:52,010
What if we really get terminated this year?

437
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:54,220
He probably has a good reason for this,

438
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,390
so no need to get riled up.

439
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,520
Hello.

440
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,400
What's with the atmosphere?

441
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,940
You made this mess with certainty that you could handle this, right?

442
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,240
It'll work out somehow.

443
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:17,700
Thanks for giving me a chance to prove my innocence

444
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:20,960
with the nature of the police investigation.

445
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:27,670
<i>We were dating in secret, so...</i>

446
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:30,780
<i>there weren't many people who knew about us.</i>

447
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,470
<i>Well, Soo Il found out somehow and spread the rumors,</i>

448
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:37,360
<i>so I guess Soo Il knew.</i>

449
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,010
Hey, what are you guys going to do?

450
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,720
Your seniors are quite mad with this ordeal,

451
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,210
so it'll be hard to find people backstage for the festival.

452
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,110
You're lacking members as it is.

453
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:48,990
That's too bad, that your captain's leadership sucks.

454
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,590
What?

455
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,140
Don't worry.

456
00:27:23,910 --> 00:27:26,920
I'll help you out, –backstage.

457
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:31,480
Hey, Yoo Min. H-How...

458
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:34,860
What's wrong Soo Il oppa? Did you see a ghost?

459
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:38,740
Captain's first love?

460
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,440
Captain Park Jung Woo.

461
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,410
What happened?

462
00:27:53,410 --> 00:27:56,100
I told you.

463
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,160
I'd come to visit if you ever became captain.

464
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,890
- To see you suffer.
- What on earth were you doing for the past two years?

465
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:04,140
You suddenly disappeared and went off the grid.

466
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:06,820
I just... lived.

467
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,210
Were you worried?

468
00:28:09,210 --> 00:28:12,060
Of course, I was worried!

469
00:28:12,060 --> 00:28:14,450
It's nice to see you after all this time.

470
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,600
You're back, right? Are you resuming school?

471
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:23,050
Yeah. I should come back now.

472
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,690
There are also things I must do.

473
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:33,440
Captain, it's time to gather.

474
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,090
Yeah.

475
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,770
It's all right. Go ahead.

476
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,440
I won't disappear again.

477
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,080
Of course, you won't.

478
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:07,800
♫ <i>I hear your voice, from a distance</i> ♫

480
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,760
Aren't you being too insincere?

481
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,660
I know there's a lot going on in your mind, but

482
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,350
you should differentiate between personal and professional matters.

483
00:29:21,110 --> 00:29:22,740
Captain.

484
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:34,290
Hi!

485
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:00,490
Seon Ho, you know... Do you...

486
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,240
not have any intentions of rejoining the Cheer Squad?

487
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,760
Yeah, why?

488
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:09,860
Just. I just want you to.

489
00:30:11,230 --> 00:30:15,700
It's so simple now that you've left.

490
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:18,440
And after I saw you practice for the pep rally,

491
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,840
I thought you liked it.

492
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,540
You wouldn't have practiced so diligently if you didn't like it.

493
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:26,370
Isn't that why you were watching earlier, too?

494
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:34,540
Don't quit.

495
00:30:35,950 --> 00:30:38,920
You like this.

496
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,480
You can do this.

497
00:30:47,230 --> 00:30:49,280
You're currently doing it.

498
00:30:50,710 --> 00:30:53,220
Why do you speak as if you can't?

499
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:59,230
I just watched as I passed by.

500
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,480
It's not like I went out of my way to watch.

501
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,870
I joined because I thought it would be fun,

502
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:06,590
but it wasn't really that fun.

503
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,460
I'm fine.

who's busy working all the time.

507
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:17,670
Why are you going this far?

508
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:21,910
Well... I just...

Seeing as how you're making the time for it.

515
00:31:40,830 --> 00:31:42,850
I have a class.

516
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:55,200
Hey, Tae Cho Hee!

517
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,360
What?

518
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,210
<i>- What's he doing?</i>
- What the hell are you doing?

519
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,500
Stay out of it!

520
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,570
Did you just push me?

521
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,310
How dare you block me?

522
00:32:07,310 --> 00:32:09,870
You definitely hit me first.

523
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,560
What?

524
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:15,120
You little...

525
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,570
Film it.

526
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:18,570
What?

527
00:32:18,570 --> 00:32:20,300
- I said take a video.
- Yes.

528
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:22,110
Seriously!

529
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:39,750
You don't want people to know that you got beaten by a woman, right?

530
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:41,640
Don't ever come to me again.

531
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,120
Hey! Hey!

532
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:48,560
Just wait and see! I won't just let this slide! Seriously!

533
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,940
- Is he following me?
- Pardon?

534
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,220
No.

535
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,330
- Walk fast.
- Yes.

536
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:56,320
Before he starts following us.

537
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,200
I can't believe that you're eating ramen.

538
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,750
Just because.

539
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:13,310
I was craving it today.

540
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:23,010
Just a glass would be perfect.

<i>[Extra Virgin Olive Oil]</i>

542
00:33:30,210 --> 00:33:33,750
<i>[Cooking Oil]</i>

543
00:33:39,950 --> 00:33:42,500
You probably didn't know this.

544
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:45,260
Mom.

545
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:47,090
Yes, what? What is it?

546
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,580
What are you doing?

547
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,220
I'm thinking of making a...

548
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,560
fried egg, but...

549
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,430
Son.

550
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:58,380
Are you still on the Cheer Squad?

551
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,920
That old thing?

552
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:02,320
- I quit.
- Right?

553
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:04,240
Yes, you made the right decision.

554
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,010
It takes up too much time and it's useless, you know?

555
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,070
What's the point of washing that? Just throw it out.

556
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,790
You're home.

557
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:22,380
Did you eat?

558
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:24,430
Yes, I did.

559
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:28,510
Did you have ramen?

560
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,840
I did.

561
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:33,980
It's not good for you. Don't eat too much.

562
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,470
Ask Ahjumma to make you something if you get hungry.

563
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:45,170
<i>I'm home!</i>

564
00:34:47,630 --> 00:34:49,360
Your knees won't last.

565
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,570
Is it geotjeori?

566
00:34:50,570 --> 00:34:53,810
I want it! I want it! I want it!

567
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:55,770
Wash your hands first.

568
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,820
I did. I did.

569
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,110
Seriously...

570
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:01,460
Aigoo, look at how greedy...

571
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,690
Hey, it's hard to remove kimchi stains.

572
00:35:03,690 --> 00:35:05,280
Take it off and wash it now!

573
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,860
It's okay.

574
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:09,080
I'll be done wearing it this week.

575
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:10,270
This week?

576
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,740
I'm thinking of quitting next week.

577
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:15,300
Why? I thought you were excited about it.

578
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,020
I wasn't excited about it.

579
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,260
I need to make money.

580
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,370
I can't just do nothing all the time.

581
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,970
You sound like you make millions.

582
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:24,990
I'll make millions, okay?

583
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:27,040
I'll change and help you.

584
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,340
You know what?

585
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:31,610
Someone apparently said that giving up is

586
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:34,330
only for counting the heads of cabbage for kimchi.

587
00:35:34,330 --> 00:35:36,260
What's that cheesy line?

588
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,640
Don't give up while you're young.

589
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,170
It might become a habit!

590
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,350
<i>You're quitting next week, then.</i>

591
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:53,900
<i>But joining because of money and prancing around with a bit of talent is not right.</i>

592
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:56,160
<i>You must like it a lot.</i>

593
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,840
<i>Since you're making the time which you don't have.</i>

594
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:07,820
Have you eaten?

595
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,720
I have.

596
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:15,060
He's going through a terrible puberty phase.

597
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,870
Hey, hush. Be quiet.

598
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:19,840
He thinks he's a prince. A prince!

599
00:36:51,570 --> 00:36:54,240
Hello.

600
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:05,400
Aren't you scared?

601
00:37:06,430 --> 00:37:07,760
Of what?

602
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,430
That video.

603
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:11,590
I saw it, too.

604
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:14,460
I'm not scared of stuff like that.

605
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,150
It's scarier to make a living.

606
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,520
Still, be careful.

607
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,720
You never know.

608
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,120
Pardon?

609
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:38,290
- Captain.
- Jung Woo.

610
00:37:41,580 --> 00:37:43,790
You're early today.

611
00:37:43,790 --> 00:37:46,560
I arrived early because I gave myself a lot of time.

612
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,590
Right.

613
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:50,160
Hae Yi, how about you?

614
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,640
Nothing.

615
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,500
Looks like you need to talk.

616
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,610
I'll talk to you later.

617
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,330
Bye, bye.

618
00:38:17,090 --> 00:38:20,950
It's been a while since we ate together like this.

619
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,040
I know.

620
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:24,670
Maybe I should've stepped out for you guys earlier.

621
00:38:24,670 --> 00:38:26,370
We've been having an issue lately.

622
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:28,310
I was wondering if there was something going on.

623
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,760
Looks like you guys are pretty close.

624
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:34,180
Well, I can't lose more new members. So...

625
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,680
Noona.

626
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,420
You know, two years ago...

627
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,450
Well, I...

628
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:46,400
I'd prefer it if you don't bring that up.

629
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,740
I'm sorry, Noona. I was thoughtless.

630
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,010
Here's the food.

631
00:38:56,010 --> 00:38:57,710
Geez, I'm hungry.

632
00:38:57,710 --> 00:38:59,830
What should we eat?

633
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:01,370
Joo Seon...

634
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:05,390
The phrase "out of sight, out of mind" must work both ways, right?

635
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:06,790
What are you talking about?

636
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:09,700
But if someone hangs out in front of his eyes,

637
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,280
he'll get tempted by her, right?

638
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,490
What are you talking about?

639
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:13,730
You should explain things in order.

640
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:16,630
Why are you going in the opposite order?

641
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,490
- Hi.
- Hi.

642
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,260
You want me to pretend to be your girlfriend?

643
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:35,990
Are you crazy by chance?

644
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:38,790
I made a mistake.

645
00:39:38,790 --> 00:39:39,900
Hey.

646
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,540
I heard you're a soy sauce dish.

647
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,850
You got dumped at the beginning of the semester already.

648
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:46,200
I didn't get dumped.

649
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,180
I'm sorry.

650
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:50,790
You didn't get dumped, but you got rejected.

651
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,420
My girlfriend was upset for a moment then.

652
00:39:55,420 --> 00:39:57,230
So you didn't break up?

653
00:39:57,230 --> 00:39:58,750
No.

654
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:02,830
Are you coming to Medical Students' Night with your girlfriend later then?

655
00:40:02,830 --> 00:40:05,150
- What?
- Why not? You're supposed to bring a plus-one.

656
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:06,240
Bring her with you.

657
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,290
Let's see what she looks like.

658
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,710
That Sunbae is

659
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:12,590
known to bully someone for a whole year once he chooses someone.

660
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,460
So I couldn't help myself.

661
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm sorry. I know it's really hard.

662
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,550
But I'll only ask this one time.

663
00:40:19,550 --> 00:40:23,820
Well... Why don't you think of this as a part-time job?

664
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,220
I'll make sure to pay you for it.

665
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:27,170
Are you kidding me?

666
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:28,450
What nonsense...

667
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,440
Hey, hey!

668
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,340
Let go!

669
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,730
This is too funny.

670
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,590
I beg you!

671
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:39,530
I really... don't want to have beef with the class president in the first year.

672
00:40:39,530 --> 00:40:43,960
To be honest, you're somewhat responsible for this too.

673
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:46,110
Well, I'm sorry.

674
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,860
Just think of saving a person's life.

675
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,830
Hae Yi!

676
00:40:53,830 --> 00:40:55,000
Don't take a video!

680
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,970
Hello, Sunbae.

681
00:41:22,470 --> 00:41:24,220
Where's your girlfriend?

682
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:28,100
She's not feeling so well.

683
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:33,490
So, she was feeling fine around lunchtime,

684
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,540
but she's suddenly feeling ill around dinnertime.

685
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,170
Right?

686
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:51,950
She'll pass away after midnight, then.

687
00:41:51,950 --> 00:41:54,400
It's not like that. She's really feeling sick-

688
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,720
I know! I know!

689
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:18,850
Hae Yi!

690
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:49,010
Have a seat here.

691
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:50,810
Hello, hello.

692
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,240
Hello.

693
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:54,860
She's my girlfriend. Do Hae Yi.

694
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,050
I thought you weren't feeling well.

695
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,920
Yes, I came because I felt better.

696
00:43:01,610 --> 00:43:03,920
- You're okay, right?
- Yeah.

697
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:09,340
My girlfriend studies really hard.

698
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:14,090
- She studied really hard for the entrance exam.
- It will be fun, coming here together, right?

699
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,410
Huh? What?

700
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,070
What? Is there something over there?

701
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,540
No, it's nothing.

702
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,290
What is it?

703
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,300
This place.

704
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:27,060
It's the place Min Jae mentioned earlier. Isn't it so pretty?

705
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:34,380
Thank you.

706
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:43,080
I heard you've been a campus couple with Jae Hyeok since high school.

707
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,680
You must've been very popular.

708
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:45,820
Why Jae Hyeok...

709
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,120
Jae Hyeok is cool.

710
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:52,630
That doesn't make too much sense.

711
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,340
He was cool.

712
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:57,160
He was so devoted to his studies

713
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,190
and his interests too.

714
00:44:00,730 --> 00:44:02,690
He's sincere.

715
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:06,160
That's why I liked him.

716
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:11,480
Wow, but seriously...

717
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:13,100
The world is so unfair.

718
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,000
Your family must be well-off since you live in Dongrang-gu.

719
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:17,260
You have it all.

720
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,860
- Well, my family is...
- I need to be good to her.

721
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,140
You startled me.

722
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,980
Yes, be good to her. You bastard.

723
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:38,600
Hi!

724
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:39,720
What happened?

725
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,240
I guess I'm... untangling the knot I created.

726
00:44:44,530 --> 00:44:46,140
I'm in a hurry. Bye.

727
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:57,230
Thanks for tonight.

728
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:04,360
This is to show my gratitude.

729
00:45:04,890 --> 00:45:06,390
It's fine.

730
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:10,180
Let's say you paid me back for being nice to me all these years.

731
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,790
To be honest...

732
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:18,040
I was kind of touched tonight.

733
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:19,770
Back then...

734
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:23,040
Honestly, I thought I was really pathetic.

735
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,400
But... you said I was cool tonight.

736
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,100
Because I really thought so back then.

737
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:33,180
I'm sorry.

738
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,050
I got angry and said mean things to you.

739
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,960
Well, can I...

740
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,780
Can I pay you back as we date?

741
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:46,320
Hae Yi, I'll be really good to you.

742
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
Jae Hyeok.

743
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:50,180
We can't be together.

744
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,670
You'd continue to be ashamed of me for being poor.

745
00:45:54,670 --> 00:45:57,680
And I'll be ashamed of myself for that eventually.

746
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,670
I don't want to live feeling ashamed.

747
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:05,550
Hae Yi. You're really mistaken.

748
00:46:05,550 --> 00:46:09,080
- I...
- There was someone I thought might be good.

749
00:46:12,390 --> 00:46:14,830
Someone who'd tell me

750
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:18,350
I'm okay the way I am now.

751
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,080
There was someone like that.

752
00:46:24,110 --> 00:46:26,610
Something so little like that comforted me.

753
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:33,820
I was relieved that there was someone like that.

754
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:40,640
I like this person.

755
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:44,190
That's why I think this is it for us.

756
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,880
Let's say I paid you back tonight

757
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,160
for what I owed you from back then.

758
00:46:53,430 --> 00:46:55,290
I'll get going.

759
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,040
She's really demanding my attention.

760
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:18,600
I have to tell the Captain and Joo Seon.

761
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,900
<i>You're quitting next week, then.</i>

762
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,170
<i>You must like it a lot.</i>

763
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,830
<i>Since you're making the time which you don't have.</i>

764
00:47:43,830 --> 00:47:46,210
<i>Don't give up while you're young.</i>

765
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:48,640
<i>It might become a habit!</i>

766
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,020
You're blowing the ground away.

767
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,790
You scared me!

768
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:57,580
Where did you come from all of a sudden?

769
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:00,450
What were you thinking about? You didn't even notice I was here.

770
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,640
We have a meeting soon.

771
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,380
I know.

772
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:08,550
What? Why aren't you going then?

773
00:48:08,550 --> 00:48:10,500
You know, I...

774
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:14,440
don't enjoy a game when it's impossible to win.

775
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:15,630
Game?

776
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:18,710
But this is driving me nuts.

777
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,850
Leaving a game sounds less fun than

778
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,340
losing a game, I think?

779
00:48:26,190 --> 00:48:29,440
So I'll try to waste time instead.

780
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:31,970
Because I don't want to regret it.
