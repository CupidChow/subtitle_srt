Yes, we are.

4
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:07,569
You can go now.

5
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,139
By the way...

6
00:01:18,139 --> 00:01:19,479
Yes. What?

7
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:22,979
I guess we should keep our relationship a secret, right?

8
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:24,949
If you're uncomfortable, we can tell them–

9
00:01:24,949 --> 00:01:29,179
No, let's keep it a secret for now.

10
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:31,249
I'll tell Seon Ja, though...

11
00:01:31,249 --> 00:01:34,079
because I always tell her everything.

12
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,159
Okay.

13
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,469
But... shall we... skip the honorifics now?

14
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:46,609
Shall we?

15
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,599
Take care...
<i>(T/N: Said with honorifics)</i>

16
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,769
I mean, take care.

17
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,629
I-I'll go now.

18
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:32,049
Yes, yes!

19
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:34,049
It was quite the scene there.

20
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:35,819
Goodness.

21
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,909
How long were you watching, Mom?

22
00:02:39,909 --> 00:02:42,449
How long were you watching?

23
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:46,359
I'm so tired. Why are my lips sticking out?

24
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,469
I have never seen that kind of display.

25
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,799
Hey, he was running away with his red face...

26
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:54,829
while his arms and legs were in sync.

27
00:02:56,679 --> 00:02:59,789
- Did you see it?
- Why were you hiding and watching like a pervert?

28
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:01,129
Hey, was I hiding and watching?

29
00:03:01,129 --> 00:03:04,499
You two were shamelessly and plainly all over

30
00:03:06,899 --> 00:03:07,969
each other on the street.

31
00:03:07,969 --> 00:03:11,209
When did we ever... do that?

32
00:03:11,209 --> 00:03:13,289
We just gave each other a peck on the lips.

33
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:16,069
Listen to yourself and keep saying, "We."

34
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,869
I guess your love triangle has been worked out.

35
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:22,769
Gosh, a romance is the best when it's all

36
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,229
twisted and turned like this.

37
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,389
It's such a shame, seriously.

38
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,009
Mom,

39
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:30,369
you were all upset and not talking to me.

40
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:33,059
I guess your feelings were all worked out?

41
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,579
Hey, like...

42
00:03:35,579 --> 00:03:37,799
I mean, you know... Hey, this is

43
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:41,029
me letting you go with the generosity of an adult.

44
00:03:41,029 --> 00:03:44,299
Anyhow, we only kissed once on the lips!

45
00:03:44,299 --> 00:03:45,849
I also wanted more than that!

46
00:03:45,849 --> 00:03:49,729
That girl never stops talking back.

47
00:03:49,729 --> 00:03:51,179
Ms. Kissy Lips?

48
00:03:51,179 --> 00:03:53,289
<i>- Be quiet!</i>
- Hello?

49
00:03:55,489 --> 00:03:57,089
What?

50
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:59,659
You decided to date the Captain?

51
00:04:00,569 --> 00:04:02,269
That's crazy. That's really crazy.

52
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:03,959
That quickly?

53
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,539
Wait, what did you do yesterday?

54
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,779
What did you really do yesterday?

55
00:04:11,019 --> 00:04:12,749
Whoa....

56
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:18,649
It's surprising for the Captain to agree to be a campus couple, though.

57
00:04:18,649 --> 00:04:20,309
Right?

58
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:23,509
Wouldn't it be something like...

59
00:04:23,509 --> 00:04:25,249
love?

60
00:04:26,459 --> 00:04:29,299
- Gosh, it's so sweet.
- Seriously.

61
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:32,099
So annoying.

62
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,629
I can't lose to you.

63
00:04:33,629 --> 00:04:36,339
I'm also going to date.

64
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:42,309
Hyung, when did you get here?

65
00:04:46,799 --> 00:04:48,579
Hi.

66
00:04:52,189 --> 00:04:54,539

Everyone, congrats on your summer break, and

00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:19,729
- I'm announcing the start of summer training! Yay
-Yay!

71

After Yoo Min left,

72
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:33,509
Jin Il became the general manager of the Planning Team.

73
00:05:33,509 --> 00:05:37,649
Since he specially agreed to help us because we're short on staff,

74
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:40,119
please cooperate with him, everyone.

75
00:05:41,719 --> 00:05:44,179
My name is Kim Jin Il, 49th Class of Theia.

- I look forward to working with you.
- Applaud!

Now, this is the schedule for training you'll receive

78

Wait, we have training from morning to afternoon.

81
00:06:00,579 --> 00:06:04,189
Then we study the rules of Yeon Ho Competition and even make a new song?

82
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,299
What's this?

83
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,510
Are we on the national team?

84
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:10,869
Gosh, are you telling us to train all summer and drop dead?

85
00:06:10,869 --> 00:06:13,689
Okay, everyone, dismissed!

86
00:06:20,959 --> 00:06:22,969
Thank you for helping.

87
00:06:22,969 --> 00:06:26,650
Weren't you following Su Il around?

88
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,219
I see. He planted you to interfere with us.

89
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,249
Why did you hit me?

90
00:06:31,249 --> 00:06:33,249
It's not like that.

91
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:36,619
I just wanted to help the Cheer Squad.

92
00:06:36,619 --> 00:06:41,029
We're short on members this year, so we need the Planning Team's backup more than ever.

93
00:06:41,029 --> 00:06:43,829
- I'll be counting on you.
- Okay.

94
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,699
Why did you bring up Su Il there?

95
00:06:49,699 --> 00:06:53,889
It's weird for him to suddenly volunteer to help.

96
00:06:54,979 --> 00:06:57,479
We'll need to wait and see...

97
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,259
whether he's a friend or a foe.

98
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:28,139
So...

99
00:07:28,779 --> 00:07:31,129
what's your response?

100
00:07:38,219 --> 00:07:40,569
I'm sorry, Seon Ho.

101
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,309
No...

102
00:07:42,309 --> 00:07:44,139
don't be sorry.

103
00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:46,589
Just don't do something you'd be sorry about.

104
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,339
I'm sorry...

105
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:52,499
- But I'm–
- We even kissed before.

106
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:56,169
Was it only because you were drunk?

107
00:07:57,669 --> 00:08:00,729
You really didn't have any feelings?

108
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:04,069
I was... confused back, then.

109
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:06,159
Exactly!

110
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,409
Your confusion means you had feelings for me.

111
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:17,289
I like the captain.

112
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,729
When you confessed to me on the day of the festival,

113
00:08:23,729 --> 00:08:25,929
I was honestly...

114
00:08:25,929 --> 00:08:27,949
excited.

115
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,239
It's true that I was shaken by you.

116
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,829
However...

117
00:08:37,489 --> 00:08:40,219
I just knew at that moment...

118
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:43,769
that the one I like in the end...

119
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:46,029
is him.

120
00:08:49,889 --> 00:08:52,319
That might also be a confusion, though.

121
00:08:53,249 --> 00:08:55,189
You said you were confused about me as well.

122
00:08:55,189 --> 00:08:57,379
I'm not anymore.

123
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:03,299
I know you're angry and hurt...

124
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:06,429
because of what I did.

125
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:08,899
I have nothing to say even if you curse me out

126
00:09:09,719 --> 00:09:13,619
and I'd understand if you ignored me from now on.

127
00:09:15,499 --> 00:09:17,269
I don't want to.

128
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:21,029
I'll continue to confuse you

129
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,899
and then...

130
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:27,789
I'll make you affirm that I'm the one.

131
00:09:27,789 --> 00:09:29,579
Don't do that.

132
00:09:30,579 --> 00:09:33,489
Then I'll keep rejecting you.

137
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,599
Aigoo, you have to keep seeing him, though.

138
00:10:22,599 --> 00:10:24,589
- It's quite uncomfortable.
- Exactly.

00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:30,269
Why?

142
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,139
Do you have a date?

143
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:36,619
Geotjeori can't be left out too long, so I'll take them over.

144
00:10:36,619 --> 00:10:37,629
Joo Seon Ja, I love you.

145
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:38,969
Geez, get lost now.

146
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:41,939
Okay, I'll get "lost" to my job now.

147
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:44,549
I'm really grateful. Thank you!

148
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:52,509
- Get home safe.
- Thank you for the work.

149
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,839
This vacation will also be quite hectic, it seems.

150
00:11:05,449 --> 00:11:07,589
You don't...

151
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,379
correct pronunciations these days.

152
00:11:10,989 --> 00:11:15,389
Sorry? Well, you didn't seem to like it.

153
00:11:15,389 --> 00:11:18,229
I mean, I do like the attention.

154
00:11:18,229 --> 00:11:21,569
No reaction makes me sad, you know.

155
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,439
Vacation.

156
00:11:24,439 --> 00:11:26,239
It's not a "B."

157
00:11:26,239 --> 00:11:27,969
It's a "V."

158

159
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:36,499

Okay, sure. Let's go together.

165

How's the Cheer Squad life?

166
00:12:08,619 --> 00:12:10,089
The Cheer Squad?

167
00:12:10,089 --> 00:12:12,239
I like it. It's fun.

168
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:15,009
Isn't it hard since there are too many rules?

169
00:12:15,009 --> 00:12:16,159
No campus couples...

170
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,989
No, not at all. I'm the type

171
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,329
who works well within the system.

172
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,299
Well the rules...

173
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:23,769
they need to be followed.

174
00:12:23,769 --> 00:12:26,379
Rules are important. Yes.

175
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,839
That's how it is.

176
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,789
What?

177
00:12:29,789 --> 00:12:32,189
People say you and Yoo Min are alike.

178
00:12:32,189 --> 00:12:34,389
People do say that a lot,

179
00:12:34,389 --> 00:12:37,629
but what exactly... are they saying is similar?

180
00:12:37,629 --> 00:12:39,959
Yoo Min was also like you.

181
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:42,189
She kept standing out from the rest.

182
00:12:43,299 --> 00:12:45,259
You're like that as well.

183
00:12:46,099 --> 00:12:47,579
You kept standing out.

184
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,179
I think Yoo Min and I are completely different, though.

185
00:12:51,179 --> 00:12:53,519
Our personalities and everything.

186
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,099
That's true.

187
00:12:55,099 --> 00:12:57,009
You're different.

188
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,669
What?

189
00:13:01,399 --> 00:13:05,719
- N-No. I-I'm saying you're different.
- I see.

190
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:07,299
That's true.

191
00:13:07,869 --> 00:13:09,849
Oh, green light. I'll be going first. Sorry!

192
00:13:09,849 --> 00:13:12,559
I'll be– Gosh, sorry!

193
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:18,879
You're much worse.

194
00:13:23,709 --> 00:13:25,449
I heard it was you, Hyung.

195
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:28,949
I'm sorry.

196
00:13:28,949 --> 00:13:31,169
Why did you do such a thing?

197
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,399
Because you were angry about getting kicked out of the Cheer Squad?

198
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,169
Or because you were angry with me?

199
00:13:35,169 --> 00:13:36,769
I'm sorry.

200
00:13:36,769 --> 00:13:38,409
It's all in the past so let's forget it.

201
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:41,619
I must've been possessed by something.

202
00:13:41,619 --> 00:13:43,569
Let's forget about it.

203
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,989
But why was it Hae Yi?

204
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:48,739
What?

205
00:13:48,739 --> 00:13:51,909
Then you could've targeted me, but you went after Hae Yi?

206
00:13:51,909 --> 00:13:53,629
That's...

207
00:13:56,219 --> 00:13:58,449
just how things happened to be.

208
00:13:58,449 --> 00:14:00,439
I'm the sinner. I am.

209
00:14:00,439 --> 00:14:02,759
I'll be watching you

210
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:04,649

211
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,259
Okay.

212
00:14:07,569 --> 00:14:10,339
I don't know if watching me will do it, though.

- I mean it.
- A glass of whiskey.

I mean, I was getting off work and leaving...

I-I mean, while I was working...

259
00:16:49,889 --> 00:16:52,689
I saw a couple, and they were so silly...

260
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:56,209
I couldn't believe how hard this ahjussi was trying at his age.

261

Captain!

264

You violated the labor laws.

Why?

266
00:17:08,749 --> 00:17:12,829
Because your good looks work 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

267

Oh, things like this? Okay, okay.

Come on, you do one, too.

269
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:27,729
In my opinion,

270
00:17:27,729 --> 00:17:30,549
I think you're made up of copper and tellurium.

271

Because you're cute.

272
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:33,869
What?

273
00:17:33,869 --> 00:17:35,939
Because copper is Cu and tellurium is Te,

274
00:17:35,939 --> 00:17:39,009
it becomes c-u-t-e when you combine them.

275
00:17:39,009 --> 00:17:40,839
Cute.

334
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,280
<i>[Kopiko]</i>

335
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,239
Better than coffee.

336
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:19,319
Nice!

337
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:23,269
Now, now. Also, it's the long-awaited Training Camp starting tomorrow.

338
00:21:23,269 --> 00:21:25,529
Meet at the front gate by 9:00 a.m.

339
00:21:25,529 --> 00:21:29,909
Will you really keep the destination a secret until the day of departure?

340
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:32,919
Yup. Look forward to it. Coming soon.

341
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:38,579
Since they made us train like dogs, they'll surprise us by saying, "Enjoy!"

342
00:21:38,579 --> 00:21:41,179
to a resort or something, right?

343
00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:44,589
At the lobby where we can see the beach...

344
00:21:44,589 --> 00:21:46,509
I'll have some piña colada.

345
00:21:46,509 --> 00:21:47,829
What's piña colada?

346
00:21:47,829 --> 00:21:49,749
It's a cocktail.

347
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,319
- Are you leaving right after today, too?
- Yes.

348
00:22:12,319 --> 00:22:15,839
Sam Da... Lately, our relationship kind of feels like...

349
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:21,139
an old married couple who lives together, but doesn't talk to each other.

350
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:27,419
Wait for me, Honey. Let's spend a passionate night tomorrow at the pension.

351
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:31,779
Darling, I'm not that easy of a woman.

352
00:22:31,779 --> 00:22:35,839
See you tomorrow, Honey. I'll be going.

353
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,089
You were rejected?

354
00:22:48,089 --> 00:22:53,119
Gosh, my Seon Ho got rejected. Aigoo!

355
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:58,089
Poor Seon Ho, what do we do. Getting rejected like that.

356
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,629
Geez, quiet down a little.

357
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:04,499
It's okay. I was also rejected.

358
00:23:04,499 --> 00:23:06,319
You, too?

359
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,159
Hey, nice to meet you, my friend.

360
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:09,959
Nice to meet you.

361
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,669
Let me pour you a shot.

362
00:23:13,669 --> 00:23:14,869
I'm stuffed.

363
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:17,569
I think I drank the most in my life today.

364
00:23:17,569 --> 00:23:21,069
Okay. Be careful going home.

365
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:24,859
- Hey, see you tomorrow. Get home safe.
- Okay.

366
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:27,279
- I can go home.
- Okay.

367
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,109
Take care.

368
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,899
Hey, so is Tae Cho Hee coming or not?

369
00:23:32,899 --> 00:23:34,789
- So, is she coming?
- Yes.

370
00:23:36,359 --> 00:23:40,999
I finally get to meet the famous Tae Cho Hee.

371
00:23:40,999 --> 00:23:43,979
Is Tae Cho Hee really that awesome?

372
00:23:43,979 --> 00:23:45,509
Come on...

373
00:23:45,509 --> 00:23:47,079
<i>Who is it?</i>

374
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:48,709
<i>My boyfriend.</i>

375
00:23:48,709 --> 00:23:50,579
No, that's not it.

376
00:23:50,579 --> 00:23:55,139
She dated those guys on our athletic teams. Honestly, you must feel a little pressure, no?

377
00:23:55,139 --> 00:23:59,749
Hey, I also have eyes and ears. I'm dating her, knowing all that.

378
00:23:59,749 --> 00:24:02,309
Just have your fun and end it in a jiffy.

379
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:06,989
I have to take into account what I invested. I need to date her at least until the end of the month.

380
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,539
What investment, man?

381
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,949
- Just do as you wish–
- Hey!

382
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,529
- What's this?
- Who is this punk?

383
00:24:13,529 --> 00:24:15,789
Yes! Break up!

384
00:24:15,789 --> 00:24:19,679
Cho Hee is too good to be dating an a**hole like you.

385
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,779
Hey, hey. Come on!

386
00:24:21,779 --> 00:24:22,979
- You!
- Hey, hold them off!

387
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:24,729
- Hey!
- Come here, you little...

388
00:24:24,729 --> 00:24:26,229
- Who is this kid?
- Hey, hey!

389
00:24:26,229 --> 00:24:28,379
What the hell are you doing!

390
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:35,859
Hey, Tae Cho Hee! What the hell are you doing for a punk like this to show up?

391
00:24:35,859 --> 00:24:39,829
- Hey! S***!
- What the hell are you going around doing?

392
00:24:39,829 --> 00:24:45,409
Your so-called friends who talk trash like that in front of you and you, who go along with them.

393
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,439
I played with you since you were being so desperate.

394
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:55,049
Don't ever call me again.

395
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:01,599
You crossed the line.

396
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,969
Wow, our Hae Yi must be in for a good treat. Where are you going?

397
00:25:20,969 --> 00:25:25,809
I don't know. But I feel like we'll be going to a resort with an ocean view.

398
00:25:25,809 --> 00:25:28,469
Whoa, the ocean? Wow, it sounds so nice!

399
00:25:28,469 --> 00:25:29,509
Right?

400
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:31,379
Don't tell me you–

401
00:25:31,379 --> 00:25:33,459
<i>Hae Yi...</i>

402
00:25:33,459 --> 00:25:35,459
What's that noise?

403
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:39,639
<i>I'm here. Please open up the door.</i>

404
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:40,969
Did you call someone over?

405
00:25:40,969 --> 00:25:43,239
<i>Hae Yi... Do Hae Yi?</i>

406
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:49,049
Me?

407
00:25:49,049 --> 00:25:50,439
- I didn't.
- <i>Do Hae Yi.</i>

408
00:25:50,439 --> 00:25:52,069
Try opening it just a little bit.

409
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,149
Please open the door–

410
00:25:54,149 --> 00:25:55,699
What?

411
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,189
Isn't he Hwang Jin Hee's son?

412
00:25:58,189 --> 00:25:59,669
Yes.

413
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,509
Why is he–

414
00:26:01,509 --> 00:26:03,399
O-Open it.

415
00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:05,419
W-Whoa, Hyung...

416
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:08,489
Jae Yi, I missed you so much!

417
00:26:08,489 --> 00:26:10,859
Have you been well? What's happening here?

418
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,139
Hey– Aigoo...

419
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:20,789
I'm sorry for coming this late.

420
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:24,989
Exactly. Why at this late hour were you banging on our door?

421
00:26:24,989 --> 00:26:26,759
Mother...

422
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:32,049
my... heart was...

423
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:34,629
- My heart was hurting too much.
- H-Hurting?

424
00:26:34,629 --> 00:26:38,079
I came because my heart was hurting too much.

425
00:26:40,039 --> 00:26:42,729
I thought I might feel better if I saw Hae Yi.

426
00:26:42,729 --> 00:26:44,739
H-Her?

427
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,989
I wanted to call you my mother-in-law...

428
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,799
H-Hyung...

429
00:26:57,799 --> 00:26:59,169
Come on and get up.

430
00:26:59,169 --> 00:27:01,889
- Stop crying.
- Jae Yi...

431
00:27:01,889 --> 00:27:06,549
What Seon Ja said must've been right.

432
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:11,289
I guess she doesn't like me because I'm so annoying.

433
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,839
What are you saying, Hyung? Get up for now.

434
00:27:13,839 --> 00:27:15,669
Yes, stand up.

435
00:27:15,669 --> 00:27:16,969
Now, now.

436
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,339
- Wait, Brother-in-law...
- Yes?

437
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:21,689
Can I keep calling you brother-in-law?

438
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:26,509
I don't think he is in his right mind, so I'll put him to sleep in my room for now.

439
00:27:26,509 --> 00:27:28,819
Hurry in and go to sleep.

440
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:30,989
Sleep.

441
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:35,019
Brother-in-law, where's Hae Yi?

442
00:27:35,019 --> 00:27:37,059
Did she go out?

443
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:41,159
Hey, what did you do that he's in that state?

444
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,849
Exactly, what did I even do?

445
00:27:44,849 --> 00:27:46,329
Hey!

446
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:50,699
Spill it already. How far did you go with him?

447
00:27:50,699 --> 00:27:52,939
- Huh? You can't say?
- Yes.

448
00:27:52,939 --> 00:27:58,239
Even to me? You! Have you gone mad?

449
00:28:01,939 --> 00:28:04,099
<i>[Soy Sauce Marinated Blue Crab]</i>

450
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,099
Kids, come and eat.

451
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:27,649
It's good. It's so sweet.

452
00:28:27,649 --> 00:28:32,609
How can the marinated crab be so sweet and tasty?

453
00:28:32,609 --> 00:28:34,759
I'm sorry.

454
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:43,299
Is your heart feeling better now?

455
00:28:43,299 --> 00:28:45,669
You said it hurt so much.

456
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:48,419
It even made my heart

457
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:54,279
hurt so much. Aigoo...

458
00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,959
Mom!

459
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,879
Honestly, that's how life is for everyone.

460
00:29:05,879 --> 00:29:08,469
Others' feelings aren't the same as mine.

461
00:29:08,469 --> 00:29:13,199
So stop trying to fight it and just accept it since it won't work anyway.

462
00:29:13,199 --> 00:29:15,899
That's how you waste less energy.

463
00:29:15,899 --> 00:29:19,679
Just think of her as having stepped on poop. Then time will...

464
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,679
Time will cure everything. Don't worry about it at all.

465
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,209
Still, how could you call your daughter poop?

466
00:29:24,209 --> 00:29:28,319
Hey, behave yourself out there, you brat.

467
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:36,589
We have to gather for the Training Camp soon. Have you packed your stuff?

468
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,069
Are you going to stop by home?

469
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,359
You're just going without packing?

470
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:47,279
Eat. You can keep eating. Just keep eating.

471
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,319
Mom, you ordered–

472
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,199
No, it's not, you brat! Yes. You're here?

473
00:29:51,199 --> 00:29:53,469
Come. Come inside. Aigoo!

474
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:55,999
Hey, is he leaving the country or something?

475
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:58,329
Go, go inside.

476
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:00,289
Aigoo.

477
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,839
Mom, why did you come here?

478
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:08,209
This is your stuff.

479
00:30:08,209 --> 00:30:12,569
Use this chance and run away from home. Here.

480
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:17,549
Leave home and have a proper experience in how

481
00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:20,409
harsh the outside world is.

482
00:30:20,409 --> 00:30:24,309
Because you're an adult now.

483
00:30:24,309 --> 00:30:27,699
I thought she'd be awake and unable to sleep, so I called her.

484
00:30:27,699 --> 00:30:30,210
Now perhaps I shouldn't have, but...

485
00:30:30,219 --> 00:30:33,109
I told her to bring your stuff on the way.

486
00:30:33,109 --> 00:30:35,009
Why throw that down?

487
00:30:35,009 --> 00:30:37,659
You can go to the camp with this, right?

488
00:30:37,659 --> 00:30:38,559
Everything worked out fine.

489
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,719
What? A c-camp?

490
00:30:40,719 --> 00:30:43,329
They said they're going to a camp. You didn't know?

491
00:30:43,329 --> 00:30:45,749
Hey, Jin Seon Ho, you–

492
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:48,439
- You!
- I'll be back.

493
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:50,109
- You!
- Aigoo!

494
00:30:50,109 --> 00:30:51,979
Calm down.

495
00:30:51,979 --> 00:30:54,059
Hey, hey. Let him be.

496
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:57,669
- My goodness.
- He said his heart hurts right now.

497
00:30:57,669 --> 00:30:59,319
What's wrong with his heart?

498
00:30:59,319 --> 00:31:03,240
His heart is like you know...

499
00:31:04,699 --> 00:31:07,559
- because of my daughter.
- What? S***!

500

There's this thing called the law of conservation of bulls***.

00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:16,559
Thanks for yesterday, Brother-in-law.

503
00:31:18,729 --> 00:31:20,609
I can't call you brother-in-law anymore.

504
00:31:20,609 --> 00:31:22,699
It doesn't matter to me.

505
00:31:22,699 --> 00:31:25,079
I don't care if you call me brother-in-law.

506
00:31:25,079 --> 00:31:27,179
At the end of the day,

507
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:32,829
my sister's husband won't be decided until she walks down the aisle.

508
00:31:38,489 --> 00:31:41,169
But you have more backbone than I thought, Hyung.

509
00:31:46,729 --> 00:31:48,699
Brother-in-law...

510
00:31:55,149 --> 00:31:57,199
What are we going to do?

511
00:31:57,199 --> 00:31:58,389
Us?

512
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:00,379
- The bus.
- The bus?

513
00:32:00,379 --> 00:32:02,069
Yes.

514
00:32:07,189 --> 00:32:09,419
Hey, get in.

515
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:13,559
Go, get in.

516
00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:24,989
Jin Seon Ho this is enough rebelling, isn't it?

517
00:32:24,989 --> 00:32:29,379
How long are you going to disappoint me?

518
00:32:29,379 --> 00:32:31,169
This isn't rebelling.

519
00:32:31,169 --> 00:32:33,359
I'm doing it because I want to.

520
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:36,509
Is this really because of that Chun Yang's daughter–

521
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:45,399
Is it because of C-Chun Yang's daughter? Is that why?

522
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:48,229
The Cheer Squad is tough but fun.

523
00:32:48,229 --> 00:32:50,259
I also like my friends.

524
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:54,499
This was the first time I really wanted to do something.

525
00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:57,479
That's why I just want to stay in it.

526
00:32:57,479 --> 00:33:01,409
Wait, Seon Ho. Seon Ho, right now is the

527
00:33:01,409 --> 00:33:03,109
most important time in life for you.

528
00:33:03,109 --> 00:33:04,909
With anything, the first step is the most–

529
00:33:04,909 --> 00:33:07,279
You just accept it, too, Mom.

530
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:10,719
That you can't control other people.

531
00:33:13,289 --> 00:33:15,609
Okay, o-okay.

532
00:33:15,609 --> 00:33:17,559
I-I understand.

533
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,699
I understand, so go to the camp today.

534
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:25,029
Let's talk again after you come back.

535
00:33:25,029 --> 00:33:28,559
For now, go on for today.

- Here you go.
- Seriously...

539
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:51,589
Thank you.

540
00:33:51,589 --> 00:33:53,329
Sure.

541
00:33:53,329 --> 00:33:55,749
Okay.

542

What's this? How did you two come together?

543
00:34:09,739 --> 00:34:11,509
- I'll tell you later.
- What?

544
00:34:11,509 --> 00:34:12,449
I said I'll tell you later.

545
00:34:12,449 --> 00:34:14,839
- What did you say?
- I'll tell you later!

546
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:16,239
Why did you bring so many bags?

547
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,639
We made a bet for holding the bags.

548

554
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:57,479
- I'll give you exactly 15 minutes.
- What?

555
00:34:57,479 --> 00:34:58,929
What?

556
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:02,259
Why is there no answer?

<i>Yes!</i>

Every minute you're late, your training increases by 10 minutes.

560
00:35:11,559 --> 00:35:14,459
Wait, where's the lodging?

561
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:19,779
Move that way.

Safe!

565
00:35:40,169 --> 00:35:42,429
Late by one minute and 22 seconds.

566
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:45,159
Training time is extended by 20 minutes.

What happened to my piña colada?

Don't talk. I need to save my energy.

579

After your 10-minute break, we'll commence the main practice.

I rolled on the ground so much that I tasted dirt in my mouth.

582

Isn't there something like a girlfriend chance?

Have you seen my boyfriend?

Whatever. Birthdays aren't such a big deal.

But still...

766
00:47:36,389 --> 00:47:38,769
Do I always have to be the one to match your pace?

767

If you come to me after you do everything you want to,

768
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,919
do I have to play along?

769

Am I your minion?

Of course, you didn't.

00:51:46,729 --> 00:51:49,499
So, I was thinking...

817
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:53,459
I just won't change

818
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,949
and follow my heart.

819
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:01,729
If it's easier for you to treat me as a friend, go ahead.

820
00:52:01,729 --> 00:52:03,319
But...

821
00:52:03,999 --> 00:52:07,339
you're not a friend to me.

822
00:52:10,909 --> 00:52:12,929
You follow your heart

823
00:52:12,929 --> 00:52:15,559
and I'll follow my heart.

824
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:17,369
Let's just do that.

825
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:20,009
Why don't you just curse me out?

826
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,559
I don't want to.

827
00:52:25,479 --> 00:52:26,959
I'll look over here.

828
00:52:26,959 --> 00:52:29,539
I want to find Captain and get the prize.
