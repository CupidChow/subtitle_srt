I was four years old.

I confessed to her during snack time, and we started dating,

00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:29,530

I just stick to the basics.

57

But what if she still doesn't like you?

63
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,340
Then you need to decide whether you want to keep going or stop.

Yeah. The three-strikes rule.

Go for it up to three times. If it still doesn't work out, then stop.

Three strikes... Go-Stop?

68

Is this a game?

69
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:08,190
It won't be beneficial to either party to bet on a losing game.

They're definitely chestnuts.

Captain, you turned out to be a terrible person.

You can tell what someone is like by looking at what they eat,

00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,000
Hey!

165
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,670
Senior, hello!

166
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,440
<i>Ready!</i>

167
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,700
- Start.
<i>- Start!</i>

168
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:39,140
<i>One, two, three, one!</i>

169
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:41,390
<i>One, two, three, two!</i>

170
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,060
<i>One, two, three–</i>

171
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,730
Stop!

172
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,230
Jin Seon Ho, one more time on your own.

173
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,930
- One.
- One!

174
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,200
Fix your left foot.

175
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:58,890
- One.
- One!

176
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,380
Straighten your back.

177
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,990
Again.

178
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,910
- One.
- One!

179
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,270
Again.

180
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,080
- One.
- One!

181
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,970
Again.

182
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,230
- One.
- One!

183
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,270
Your posture doesn't look right because your left foot isn't fixed.

184
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,820
Again.

185
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,780
One.

186
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,960
- One!
- Left foot!

187
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,050
I did!

188
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:39,180
All right. 10 minute break.

189
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,860
<i>10 minute break!</i>

190
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,870
A 10 minute break is here.

191
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,770
Rehydrate yourself and use the restroom.

192
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:50,770
All right! Why are we like this?

193
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,880
Hey, be careful. There's no medicine for water indigestion.

194
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:06,420
What's wrong with you? You've had low energy all day.

195
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,590
It's no fun.

196
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,510
What? Hey, I'm totally fun!

197
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:21,230
Yong Il!

198
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,140
A moment.

199
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,840
Yes!

200
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,640
Should we try again?

201
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,910
Training, restart!

202
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:01,610
10 minutes are up. Move quickly!

203
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:03,680
He didn't say much?

204
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:05,200
Yes.

205
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,110
Vice Captain! I'll do better.

206
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:11,360
Do what better?

207
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,910
Well, you see...

208
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:16,050
I'll take better care of the squad.

209
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:17,640
Sure.

210
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,620
If the kids have trouble, let me know.

211
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,830
Especially Seon Ho.

212
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:24,350
Okay!

213
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,550
Yonhee! Stand... up!

214
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:41,820
Nice!

215
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,730
You can't just mimic it.

216
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,800
It's all in the feet.

217
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,440
Feet.

218
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,380
Feet.

219
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,970
- Feet!
- Fit.

220
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,660
Fit.

221
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,460
Whoa, feet!

222
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,730
Are they the 51st class?

223
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:06,610
Why aren't they greeting us? Hey, have some snacks first.

224
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,370
You're trying to keep it for yourself. Give it to me.

225
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,290
Have some snacks.

226
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,800
There are only four.

227
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,730
What do we do?

228
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,570
What do you think?

229
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,990
We just need to eat quickly and kick them out.

230
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:33,230
Hey. Wolf it down. Faster.

231
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,520
Which class are you in?

232
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,990
Oh, you don't know yet? I'm from the 47th class.

233
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:45,290
And they're from the 49th class. You guys are from the same class, right?

234
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:46,540
- Yes.
- Right.

235
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,900
We're all on the planning team now.

236
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,140
You guys must be dying because of the joint pep rally.
<i>[Planning team: Current students, but inactive squad members who help out with events.]</i>

237
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,830
Yes, we're totally dying!

238
00:13:58,890 --> 00:14:01,860
There's a way to reduce your hardships.

239
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,610
How?

240
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,240
Do Hae Yi, Jin Seon Ho.

241
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,590
Yes!

242
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,470
This is your extra training schedule.

243
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:19,540
What? I'm... I'm working these days.

244
00:14:20,310 --> 00:14:21,810
When are you available?

245
00:14:21,810 --> 00:14:26,030
But Captain. This won't do for me.

246
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:29,470
It takes up my free period and afternoon times.

247
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:30,860
I can't give up any more than that.

248
00:14:30,860 --> 00:14:33,070
The joint pep rally is around the corner, and you need this to keep up.

249
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,020
This isn't the only thing we do.

250
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:38,060
We need to take classes, exams, and work.

251
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,830
We have regular training and extra training.

252
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,660
I'm putting aside as much time as I can.

253
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:44,320
Asking me to put aside more time is over the top.

254
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,060
We can't match this over-the-top schedule.

255
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:57,290
<i>[Joint Pep Rally D-Day]</i>

256
00:14:57,290 --> 00:14:59,320
Sam Da, you're good with words.
<i>[Amphitheater]</i>

257
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,030
Yeah, the captain went overboard.

258
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:04,950
It's like he's putting his life on the line.

259
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,060
Sam Da!

260
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,440
Yeah, well...

00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:18,120
<i>[Emergency rendezvous requested].</i>

262
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,090

00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,040
<i>[Cheers]</i>

264
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,690
Back in my days, their training was just a game.

265
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:26,820
They don't know how good they have it. Kids these days have no grit.

266
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,290
You didn't exactly have that much grit, either.

267
00:15:29,290 --> 00:15:31,330
- Noona!
- "Noona!"

268
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,770
Well...

269
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:36,040
We can't really say anything since she's not wrong.

270
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:40,150
We can't ask them to unreasonably take time off work for this.

271
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:46,040
Hey! You guys are all here? Meeting?

272
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,780
Yes.

273
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,680
Woon Chan, you won't greet us now that you're all grown up?

274
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,640
I'm kidding, just kidding.

275
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,750
Hey, you guys have quite the member this time.

276
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:59,690
Was it... Do Hae Yi?

277
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:04,640
She reminds me of Yoo Min.

278
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,760
Yoo Min was just like that.

279
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,950
Yoo Min?

280
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,440
Hyung.

281
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,580
Please don't show up like this anymore.

282
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,570
You were even expelled for what happened last year.

283
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:22,640
Showing up as a senior when you're not even a member goes against the rules.

284
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:24,730
Hey, how tough, Park Jung Woo.

285
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:27,300
After all these years together.

286
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,170
Okay, okay, okay. Shall we have a drink?

287
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,100
I heard you're digging into last year's spending.

288
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:44,370
Hey, let's not make this a big deal.

289
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:46,370
What's good for us is good for you.

290
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:49,210
What's good for you isn't good for us.

291
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:51,540
What's right is good for us.

292
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,230
Fine.

293
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:59,200
Do your best, then. Although, you won't find anything.

294
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,520
Okay. We'll see once we smooth out the wrinkles.

295
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,280
Let's go.

296
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,210
Come closer.

297
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,600
About what Soon Il sunbae said earlier...

298
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,930
Don't you think it's worth a shot?

299
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:25,730
All we need is to get our hands on a menu.

300
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:27,170
A menu?

301
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:28,980
The list of songs for the joint pep rally.

302
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,700
<i>If you have that, you don't have to prepare for all the songs,</i>
<i>[2019 Cheer Song Set List]</i>

303
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,140
<i>and only for the songs on that list.</i>

304
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,410
<i>Your hardships will be reduced.</i>

305
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:37,390
<i>How would we get our hands on that?</i>

306
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,420
<i>You can get a friend from Hokyung University to tell it all by getting them drunk.</i>

307
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:43,800
<i>Or it's usually in the Cheer Squad clubroom, so you can sneak in to take a picture.</i>

308
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,190
<i>Are we allowed to?</i>

309
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:49,840
<i>Hey, only the courageous can get a taste of the fruit.</i>

310
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,930
- You want to sneak into Hokyung?
- Yeah.

311
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:53,580
Let's give it a shot.

312
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,110
- How about it?
- And, if we get caught?

313
00:17:55,110 --> 00:17:56,360
Hey.

314
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,520
"Only the courageous can get a taste of the fruit."

315
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,730
That's right. Let's do it!

316
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:03,760
We should do anything we can to save time.

317
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,220
Let's go.

318
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:09,370
Then we need to decide who will take the lead. Who's it going to be?

319
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:11,850
Who's going to tie the bell around the cat's neck?

320
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:12,920
The weather's so nice today.

321
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,230
- The cherry blossoms have bloomed.
- You're right.

322
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:18,300
I won't do it. I definitely opposed this, okay?

323
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,440
Min Jae... Kim Min Jae!

324
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,350
Gosh, that jerk.

325
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,660
What if he tells on us?

326
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,990
