I just think you might feel upset.

83
00:08:38,847 --> 00:08:43,497
It would be a lie to say I feel fine.

84
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:47,900
But there must be a reason why you say that.

85

I'll trust you.

86

00:08:56,317 --> 00:08:59,040

91

But...

92
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:12,210
it's not that I'm not upset.

93
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:18,450
Aren't you too weak? I didn't push you that hard.

94
00:09:25,407 --> 00:09:26,747
You pushed me, too.

95
00:09:26,747 --> 00:09:30,237

No, it's okay.

119
00:10:46,927 --> 00:10:49,087
Why are you asking the Captain about my happiness?

120
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,417
I'll find my happiness on my own, so don't ask those questions.

121

I just wanted to try it!

122

On TV, they ask those things to their daughter's boyfriends who come over.

That's when they're getting married.

So, why do you call him that?

Oh, because I called him that from the beginning, so it's a habit.

130
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:25,297
Even so, isn't that a bit odd?

131

It doesn't really matter to me.

133
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,047

134

00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,287
You take care, too.

141
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:41,377
You two have to go separate ways, so hurry along.

00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,727
Sure.

144
00:12:47,727 --> 00:12:50,417
This is what I think.

145
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:55,387
Whoever wins, I'm on your side! Whoever wins–

146
00:12:55,387 --> 00:12:56,477
Mom!

147
00:12:56,477 --> 00:13:01,907
Hey, she only had crushes until now. Thank you for liking my daughter. Is she coming? Is–

148
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:05,697
I told you not to do this!

149
00:13:05,697 --> 00:13:07,587
Bye!

150
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,857
Do you want another drink?

151
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,497
Sure.

152
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,497
- Hey–
- I'll go first.

153
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:28,017
Sure.

154
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:29,567
I liked Hae Yi.

155
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:30,667
Liked?

156
00:13:30,667 --> 00:13:33,327
Honestly, I was going to steal her from you.

157
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,487
- I had the confidence, too.
- But?

158
00:13:36,487 --> 00:13:39,697
I think it's right to stop here.

159
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:44,297
If I go any further, Hae Yi will be uncomfortable, too.

160
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:50,747
For now, Hae Yi looks happy to be with you, so I decided to give up.

161
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,477
For now.

162
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,537
Sure.

163
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,947
The words "for now" bothers me a bit.

164
00:13:59,947 --> 00:14:02,807
Are you saying things might be different later on?

165
00:14:02,807 --> 00:14:07,160
Hae Yi and your relationship might become so-so.

166
00:14:07,797 --> 00:14:10,007
Yeah, that won't be happening.

167
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,207
Let's not be too certain about the future.

168
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,607
Hae Yi and I are friends. You should be understanding that much.

169
00:14:19,607 --> 00:14:22,107
I'm aware of that much.

170
00:14:22,107 --> 00:14:26,977
Honestly, I don't really like it, but what can I do? I'll just have to be understanding.

171
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,197
Just don't cross the line.

172
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:39,537
Oh, right. I can't give up Brother-in-law.

173
00:14:39,537 --> 00:14:42,297
Geez, so gross.

174
00:14:42,297 --> 00:14:44,437
You act the same as your girlfriend.

175
00:14:44,437 --> 00:14:48,157
Hey, what do you mean you can't give up Brother-in-law?

176
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,337
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail–</i>

177
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,997
Soo Il oppa isn't picking up my calls, either.

178
00:14:54,997 --> 00:14:58,747
Let's wait a few days to talk to him.

179
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,667
Hey, you're here?

180
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,477
A broadcast?
<i>[2019 Ho Yon University Culture Documentary Proposal]</i>

181
00:15:09,477 --> 00:15:15,127
SBC suggested doing a Ho Yon college life program as part of the upcoming Ho Yon Competition.

182
00:15:15,127 --> 00:15:19,047
I told them we'd do it. I'm down to participate if you guys agree.

183
00:15:19,047 --> 00:15:21,307
If we do, they'll even sponsor us during the Ho Yon competition.

184
00:15:21,307 --> 00:15:23,267
Really?

185
00:15:23,267 --> 00:15:24,947
But...

186
00:15:24,947 --> 00:15:29,387
I don't know about us, but why would Hokyung University agree to this?

187
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:35,637
I think it'll be fun. It's nice. It could be meaningful to leave such a record as well.

188
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,317
Is it not to advertise?

189
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:40,037
Advertise?

190
00:15:40,037 --> 00:15:42,817
The fourth generation of a conglomerate family member who leads an active college life.

191
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:44,997
It paints a nice picture.

192
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,497
And it'll be helpful for your company's image.

193
00:15:48,497 --> 00:15:51,877
Your mind works quickly when it comes to things like that.

194
00:15:51,877 --> 00:15:55,387
It's true that all of that isn't a bad thing.

195
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,167
She's on another level.

196
00:15:57,167 --> 00:16:02,497
So this broadcast is... for Hokyung University with you at the center.

197
00:16:02,497 --> 00:16:04,447
And, you want us to be your backup?

198
00:16:04,447 --> 00:16:05,607
That's a leap.

199
00:16:05,607 --> 00:16:08,077
It's either falling on our faces or our backs.

200
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:16,217
Then give us all the support funds.

201
00:16:16,217 --> 00:16:18,947
Hokyung University has an abundant budget anyway.

202
00:16:18,947 --> 00:16:22,877
And your tickets sell well, so you don't even need support funds.

203
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:28,057
Sure.

204
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,117
Really?

205
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:36,537
The thing about the Ho Yon competition is that it's only fun if both sides are on the same playing field.

206
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:39,927
If your side falls behind too much, don't you think the viewers will be bored?

207
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:43,397
If it means it can boost our morale, then it's our gain.

208
00:16:43,397 --> 00:16:45,167
A budget isn't all there just for strategy.

209
00:16:45,167 --> 00:16:47,517
It is a major component, though.

210
00:16:47,517 --> 00:16:50,487
It would be better to beg than to accept that kind of offer.

211
00:16:50,487 --> 00:16:53,957
Don't make it difficult for your newbies with your useless bravado.

212
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,507
Fine, we'll think about it.

213
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,367
Okay, give me a call after you've thought about it.

214
00:17:13,690 --> 00:17:18,127
This is a total humiliation! We'll never accept this, right?

215
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,597
- Let's do it.
- What?

216
00:17:21,597 --> 00:17:25,377
With the reparations for the fire and extra spending on the festival,

217
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:27,457
we do lack a lot of funds for the Yon Ho competition.

218
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:32,707
At this rate, we might have to make up for the lack of funds by charging the newbies.

219
00:17:32,707 --> 00:17:35,767
We can't make the kids suffer while trying to save our faces.

220
00:17:35,767 --> 00:17:37,787
That's true.

221
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:40,990
We'll just be the side characters once.

222
00:17:41,567 --> 00:17:45,097
With that money, we can focus on doing our stuff better.

223
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:51,157
Anyway, our faces will be shown on TV so we should ask everyone's opinions.

224
00:17:51,157 --> 00:17:52,617
When is Joo Seon Ja coming?

225
00:17:52,617 --> 00:17:54,657
She's almost here.

226
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,517
Hi.

227
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:20,607
Who's this? He seems really familiar.

228
00:18:20,607 --> 00:18:21,700
Min Jae.

229
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,160
Min Jae? What's up with you?

230
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,367
That's Min Jae?

231
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,187
Hey! What the heck?

232
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:39,727
Broadcasting?

233
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:41,257
Do I need to take care of myself starting today?

234
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:46,667
Anyhow, we'll be getting outside exposure. I'm asking because your opinions are also important.

235
00:18:46,667 --> 00:18:50,057
I'm down. Appearing on TV will be an honor for my family.

236
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:53,537
I don't like it. It's because you don't know the life of a famous person.

237
00:18:53,537 --> 00:18:55,897
Once your face is well known, it's very tiring.

238
00:18:55,897 --> 00:18:57,677
Let's do it.

239
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:03,307
You said they'll support our lack of funding, too. Woon Chan said so.

240
00:19:03,307 --> 00:19:05,057
Geez.

241
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:08,977
It's better to do it all together if we need it.

242
00:19:08,977 --> 00:19:10,657
Okay. Let's do it.

243
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:12,297
Yes, let's give it a shot!

244
00:19:12,297 --> 00:19:14,637
- I'm down.
- Down as well.

245
00:19:14,637 --> 00:19:16,967
I'm also down.

246
00:19:16,967 --> 00:19:19,527
Gosh, we're going to be given casting offers.

247
00:19:19,527 --> 00:19:22,887
<i>Thank you for your time.</i>

248
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,527
It won't take long.

249
00:19:37,527 --> 00:19:39,877
It'll be even faster if we do it together.

250
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:48,127
Is it because of Ji Yoon, by any chance? Why you keep helping me out.

251
00:19:50,850 --> 00:19:53,527
It's not like that.

252
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,417
Do you want to go for a drink today?

253
00:19:58,417 --> 00:20:00,207
What?

254
00:20:00,207 --> 00:20:03,227
Hurry up.

255
00:20:03,227 --> 00:20:05,497
I'm done now.

256
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,227
Drink it.

257
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,717
Thank you.

258
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,110
What was that?

259
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:19,397
It's what you think it is.

260
00:20:19,397 --> 00:20:21,547
Oh, you borrowed money from Min Jae?

261
00:20:21,547 --> 00:20:26,607
What the heck do you mean? Can't you tell? It's a flirt.

262
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,267
Kim Min Jae and you?

263
00:20:29,267 --> 00:20:33,427
I can't help but think Min Jae likes me.

264
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:34,427
Why?

265
00:20:34,427 --> 00:20:36,987
There's no "why" in love.

266
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,687
Then what about you?

267
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:43,207
I'm also considering him.

268
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:46,987
Is the season of love also finally coming to me?

269
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,157
Gosh, he's all grown up.

270
00:20:51,157 --> 00:20:53,437
Grown up, my foot.

271
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,227
Do you think he's saying it because he's really okay? He's just... saying it to put my heart at ease.

272
00:20:59,227 --> 00:21:03,917
Exactly, that's why he's all grown up. Saying things like that to put his mom's heart at ease.

273
00:21:03,917 --> 00:21:08,357
That's true. When did he grow up so much?

274
00:21:08,357 --> 00:21:10,807
So what are you going to do?

275
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,307
I don't know.

276
00:21:15,307 --> 00:21:20,227
When am I going to grow up? I don't even know my own feelings at this age.

277
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,637
Hey,

278
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:29,177
my grandmother passed away at 100 years old.

279
00:21:29,177 --> 00:21:31,527
There's something she said as she passed away.

280
00:21:31,527 --> 00:21:35,807
"I thought all I ever wanted in my life was

281
00:21:35,807 --> 00:21:39,667
for my children to have the best lives.

282
00:21:39,667 --> 00:21:42,347
But I can tell now that my death is near.

283
00:21:42,347 --> 00:21:46,137
What I really wanted was to live

284
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:50,797
without children or a husband. Freely and lightly."

285
00:21:50,797 --> 00:21:55,657
She said that and on the day the hospital staff told us to be prepared because she'll pass away soon.

286
00:21:55,657 --> 00:21:58,907
Because the fourth eldest aunt from Jeju arrived the day after due to her canceled flight,

287
00:21:58,907 --> 00:22:04,577
she waited and lasted until that aunt came.

288
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:07,967
Eventually, she closed her eyes after all her children were there.

289
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:09,907
That's...

290
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,227
when I realized.

291
00:22:13,227 --> 00:22:15,497
Even if you live 100 years,

292
00:22:15,497 --> 00:22:20,267
a human won't know what they truly want even until death.

293
00:22:20,267 --> 00:22:25,377
Hey, living 100 years wouldn't do it. How are we supposed to know that when we've lived only half of that?

294
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,650
Would that ever work, seriously? Could we?

295
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:30,370
- Could we? It's fine–
- Mrs. Sung Chun Yang.

296
00:22:30,370 --> 00:22:33,947
- Yes, yes!
- You'll see the doctor first and enter the exam room.

297
00:22:33,947 --> 00:22:35,827
Oh, okay.

298
00:22:35,827 --> 00:22:40,967
Hey. Why do I need to get this exam when I'm perfectly fine?

299
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:43,807
Hey, be quiet.

300
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:49,067
This is an expensive exam. I'm flexing since I'm thankful for you taking care of me.

301
00:22:49,067 --> 00:22:51,517
So stop complaining and take it.

302
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:55,047
Okay, sure.

303
00:22:55,047 --> 00:22:57,627
Let me also try and flex with a medical exam,

304
00:22:57,627 --> 00:23:02,137
thanks to my wealthy madam friend.

305
00:23:02,137 --> 00:23:04,417
I'm going.

306
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:07,237
Hey, thank you.

307
00:23:19,770 --> 00:23:22,807
What's all this?

308
00:23:22,807 --> 00:23:24,710
<i>[Young Woong loves Ji Young]</i>

309
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,417
Beautiful and sacred...

310
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,997
fruits of love.

311
00:23:31,997 --> 00:23:34,867
Today is our 100th day.

312
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,177
Then are we closed today?

313
00:23:37,177 --> 00:23:41,427
We're not doing business, but you have work to do!

314
00:23:41,427 --> 00:23:44,837
Why bother with the 100th day at your age?

315
00:23:44,837 --> 00:23:48,707
Others don't even bother with existing anniversaries at your age, right?

316
00:23:48,707 --> 00:23:51,727
It's even more precious because of our ages.

317
00:23:51,727 --> 00:23:56,167
At this age, it's not easy to be together for 100 days.

318
00:23:56,167 --> 00:24:01,087
They say the late bloomers are scarier. This is outrageously fussy.

319
00:24:01,087 --> 00:24:04,907
The flavor you already know is actually scarier.

320
00:24:04,907 --> 00:24:05,947
Sorry?

321
00:24:05,947 --> 00:24:11,217
When you become single after being in a relationship, you're lonelier when others celebrate their special days.

322
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,797
Because of the memories of being together.

323
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:19,407
That's why I'm making an even bigger deal to celebrate.

324
00:24:19,407 --> 00:24:21,547
Since we got over the tough times,

325
00:24:21,547 --> 00:24:25,907
she should cover up all the bad memories with even better memories.

326
00:24:26,610 --> 00:24:30,287
Ahjussi, you're more thoughtful than I thought.

327
00:24:31,130 --> 00:24:32,337
What?

328
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:34,777
You surprise me here and there.

329
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,557
That's it.

330
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:47,657
Great. Why am I nervous– She'll like it, right?

331
00:24:47,657 --> 00:24:52,520
But is this what Deputy Chief likes?

332
00:24:53,797 --> 00:24:55,787
What? I'm not sure.

333
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:04,367
It's okay. There are a lot of men who were rejected by Ji Yoon.

334
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:09,017
I mean, it's okay to be as boring as s*** or a little bit of a loser.

335
00:25:09,017 --> 00:25:13,407
She's just being too picky with people, so don't put yourself down too much.

336
00:25:13,407 --> 00:25:16,427
I'm being consoled, right?

337
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:24,737
- I'm fine. I don't think she was a good fit for me anyway.
- What?

338
00:25:24,737 --> 00:25:29,160
From now on, I'm going to like someone who finds me okay without being fake.

339
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,907
Okay.

340
00:25:33,610 --> 00:25:37,350
Drink. Let's drink. Drink and shake it off.

341
00:25:38,087 --> 00:25:39,957
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

342
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,517
They're at it again.

343
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,597
Whoa! They keep doing it.

344
00:26:00,220 --> 00:26:05,227
Why do people keep kissing in front of me?

345
00:26:05,227 --> 00:26:06,657
What?

346
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:09,987
Is kissing a good thing?

347
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,187
Haven't you done it?

348
00:26:12,187 --> 00:26:14,387
Oppa, have you done it?

349
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:16,837
I haven't done it, either.

350
00:26:16,837 --> 00:26:18,167
Do you want to try it?

351
00:26:18,167 --> 00:26:19,637
What?

352
00:26:26,570 --> 00:26:31,557
Okay, stop and stand right here. Now, open your eyes!

355

What's all this?

356
00:26:41,287 --> 00:26:44,017
It's to celebrate our 100th day.

357
00:26:44,017 --> 00:26:47,187
Surprise!

358
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,937
I-I see. The 100th day. I didn't even think about it.

359
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,437
You see, I recently haven't had any expectations.

360
00:27:03,437 --> 00:27:07,477
I just lived because I was alive.

361
00:27:07,477 --> 00:27:12,487
But after meeting you, I start

362
00:27:12,487 --> 00:27:17,547
having expectations about where my life will go.

363
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:23,067
That felt really nice.

364
00:27:25,690 --> 00:27:29,987
The fact that happened in my life.

365
00:27:29,987 --> 00:27:34,527
That's why, I wanted to commemorate

366
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,957
those precious times.

367
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:43,107
Is this perhaps not to your liking?

368
00:27:43,107 --> 00:27:46,117
No, no. It's not like that, but...

369
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:47,717
You had me scared there.

370
00:27:47,717 --> 00:27:51,927
Young Woong, I think I'm going abroad to study.

371
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:56,297
Study abroad? Overseas?

372
00:27:56,297 --> 00:28:00,877
Yeah, I've been preparing for it before I started seeing you.

373
00:28:00,877 --> 00:28:05,317
I was contacted by an institution that I applied to saying I was accepted.

374
00:28:05,317 --> 00:28:08,467
That's how it is, huh.

375
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:12,837
Hey, it's something to congratulate, right? Yes?

376
00:28:12,837 --> 00:28:15,147
Y-Yes. Right.

377
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:20,167
Well...

378
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:44,827
Hey, Jung Woo. What are you doing here?

379
00:28:44,827 --> 00:28:49,647
Well, the thing is... Did Soo Il hyung not come to class today?

380
00:28:49,647 --> 00:28:52,187
Oh, Soo Il? He hasn't been coming to class these days.

381
00:28:52,187 --> 00:28:55,720
Even if I call him, he just leaves a text saying he'll contact me later.

382
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,827
- I see.
- Hyung.

383
00:28:57,827 --> 00:29:01,960
Hey, Jin Il. Have you seen Soo Il lately? You two are close.

384
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:07,037
Oh, Soo Il hyung went on a trip. He said he wanted to clear his mind.

385
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:12,077
Soo Il hyung seems

386
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:15,227
to be uncomfortable about meeting you, Captain.

387
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:18,017
He said he didn't want to see you for a while.

388
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:25,647
Okay. Tell Soo Il hyung to call me when he feels better

389
00:29:25,647 --> 00:29:30,177
because I have something I must tell him in person.

390
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,647
Okay. I'm off.

391
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,187
- Bye.
- O-Okay.

392
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,637
Is this 911?

393
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,297

397
00:30:25,750 --> 00:30:29,527
The unidentified patient who came in yesterday, I requested the police to identify him.

398
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,807
Since his wallet and phone were taken, it looks like a robbery.

399
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:35,797
- You transferred him to the general ward, right?
- Yes.

400
00:30:35,797 --> 00:30:37,107
He hasn't gained consciousness yet?

401
00:30:37,107 --> 00:30:39,977
His prognosis is bad, so he might not wake up at all.

402
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:52,997
Ten minutes passed.

403

Hokyung University's captain isn't here yet, right?

Yes, she'll be here soon.

00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,267
Yo...

411
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,267

00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,977
Oh, no! How could I make a mistake like this?

418
00:32:30,977 --> 00:32:33,987
I usually carry it out perfectly.

419
00:32:35,050 --> 00:32:37,197
Should I go again?

420
00:32:37,197 --> 00:32:38,187
No?

421
00:32:38,187 --> 00:32:40,687
Captain, please warm up as well.

422
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,907
Hokyung University's tempo is a bit faster.

423

427
00:33:03,277 --> 00:33:09,177
Okay, great. This time, please put your arms around each other's shoulders like a good-faith competition.

428
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,697

What? Well, you took the bus. Yes.

446

Oh, yes. A blackout.

Right, blackout. I think that's it.

Yes. Okay. A blackout. Right.

Okay. Sure.

will partake in training as Yonhee University Cheer Squad member.

Whoa, there.

00:35:58,027 --> 00:36:02,307
Don't go there. There's nothing as foolish as fighting a lost battle.

00:36:02,307 --> 00:36:03,847
Why? I'm really good at it, too.

Yes, every person has a unique strength.

Thank you.

481
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:28,147
I just got some interviews with the newbies.

482
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:40,197
I want to discuss something with you.

483
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:43,837
Since Hokyung University's Cheer Squad came to train, why don't we do something like this?

484
00:36:43,837 --> 00:36:48,107
Like competitive training between two people? I think it'd be fun.

485
00:36:48,107 --> 00:36:49,677
Sure, I think it'll be fun.

486
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:52,980
All right. Okay, then. Let's have Hokyung's captain and...

487
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,200
Who should we choose? Yes.

488
00:36:55,207 --> 00:36:58,577
Why don't you do it as the newbies' rep?

489
00:36:58,577 --> 00:37:02,647
N-No, not you. The student who's lying down.

490
00:37:02,647 --> 00:37:04,400
Me?

491
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,157
Yes.

492
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:07,677

497
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,907

Excuse me. Could we get an interview with you?

506
00:38:38,867 --> 00:38:41,727
- Me?
- Everyone else also did it once.

507
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,207
Sure.

508
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,537
How's the Cheer Squad life?

509
00:38:53,537 --> 00:38:54,797
It's fun.

510
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:57,180
When do you enjoy it the most?

511
00:38:58,027 --> 00:39:00,180
Well, when we're not training and resting.

512
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:04,607
I heard you and the Captain are a couple within the squad.

513
00:39:04,607 --> 00:39:09,117
Weren't there any uncomfortable situations because you two are a campus couple?

514
00:39:09,117 --> 00:39:13,027
Well, I'm not sure.

515
00:39:13,027 --> 00:39:17,347
You do know your boyfriend and Hokyung's captain used to date, don't you?

516
00:39:17,347 --> 00:39:20,657
Other squad members said it's a well-known story.

517
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:22,927
Oh, yes.

518
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:27,727
I think it'd feel weird that your boyfriend's ex-girlfriend just

519
00:39:27,727 --> 00:39:31,637
had to be the captain of Hokyung University. Isn't it?

520
00:39:31,637 --> 00:39:33,897
- Well–
- I think I'd be a little bothered.

521
00:39:33,897 --> 00:39:38,547
If his ex is from a wealthy family and the captain of your rival school, then isn't it a bit bothersome?

522
00:39:38,547 --> 00:39:40,287
Exactly.

523
00:39:46,230 --> 00:39:48,437
Well, that's...

524
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:50,387
That's enough.

525
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,047
Besides preparation for the Yon Ho competition, I never agreed to expose the members' personal lives.

526
00:40:00,047 --> 00:40:01,370
No, that's not it.

527
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,310
It's okay.

528
00:40:04,490 --> 00:40:06,397
You're right.

529
00:40:06,397 --> 00:40:11,887
Ha Jin unni is pretty and incredible. And I respect her.

530
00:40:11,887 --> 00:40:13,597
But...

531
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:18,487
I'm not going to concern myself with things like what his ex-girlfriend was like.

532
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:23,317
Honestly, in the past, I would've been envious.

533
00:40:23,317 --> 00:40:25,907
I would've felt as though I lacked a lot.

534
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,017
But, there are people who love me for who I am.

535
00:40:35,627 --> 00:40:37,937
Since I have people like that,

536
00:40:37,937 --> 00:40:41,317
I don't want to live being ashamed of myself.

537
00:40:43,377 --> 00:40:46,027
I'm actually a pretty decent person, too.

538
00:40:52,897 --> 00:40:56,007
F*** you! You probably can't use this now, right?

539

Aigoo, aigoo, he likes it.

638
00:47:50,937 --> 00:47:53,027
I shouldn't have done it for him.

639
00:47:53,697 --> 00:47:56,957
- Hey, let's go.
- You look so different without your glasses.

640
00:47:56,957 --> 00:47:58,397
Don't you think he looks like someone?

641
00:47:58,397 --> 00:48:01,117
Sorry, my stuff is here.

642
00:48:05,337 --> 00:48:06,907
- You did really well today.
- Okay, take care.

643
00:48:06,907 --> 00:48:08,657
See you tomorrow.

644
00:48:13,467 --> 00:48:16,207
Do you want to eat before you leave?

645
00:48:17,747 --> 00:48:19,447
Yes.

646
00:48:39,837 --> 00:48:44,887
You asked me why I only date those kinds of men like a s***ty– car collector.

647
00:48:45,687 --> 00:48:48,607
No, I didn't put it exactly like that.

648
00:48:48,607 --> 00:48:50,297
You're right.

649
00:48:51,147 --> 00:48:53,247
I was kind of like that.

650
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,807
That's not it. What I meant was...

651
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,877
You see...

652
00:48:59,467 --> 00:49:01,807
I don't like things becoming serious.

653
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:08,567
That's why I only date guys I can have fun with.

654
00:49:10,387 --> 00:49:12,937
That makes me feel better.

655
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:17,017
That's a fake relationship, though, isn't it?

656
00:49:17,017 --> 00:49:18,787
What's a real relationship?

657
00:49:18,787 --> 00:49:20,307
I mean,

658
00:49:20,307 --> 00:49:23,417
you love each other, understand each other

659
00:49:23,417 --> 00:49:26,297
and cover each other's faults. Something like that.

660
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:28,357
Exactly.

661
00:49:28,357 --> 00:49:31,277
Struggling to know better and trying to understand.

662
00:49:31,277 --> 00:49:33,327
Stuff like that.

663
00:49:33,327 --> 00:49:34,827
They're burdensome.

664
00:49:34,827 --> 00:49:36,807
Why is that?

665
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:40,247
I don't trust those things in the first place.

666
00:49:41,747 --> 00:49:48,277
I don't want to hurt anyone and I don't want to have expectations.

667
00:49:53,957 --> 00:49:56,487
I told you during the MT, didn't I?

668
00:49:56,487 --> 00:49:58,647
Not to like me.

669
00:49:58,647 --> 00:50:01,107
I meant what I said.

670
00:50:01,887 --> 00:50:04,487
Because you seem like a good guy.

671
00:50:06,707 --> 00:50:09,487
I'm not such a good girl.

672
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:16,757
There's this thing my mom says all the time like a habit.

673
00:50:18,177 --> 00:50:20,070
"There's nothing more foolish than not making soybean paste

674
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,560
because you're afraid of maggots.

675
00:50:23,567 --> 00:50:27,697
You can just get rid of maggots later."

676
00:50:30,230 --> 00:50:34,157
Are you going to head down a s***hole because you're afraid of the maggots?

677
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,607
You're so articulate.

678
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:49,397
At first, I liked you simply because you were cool.

679
00:50:49,397 --> 00:50:51,697
But not now.

680
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:56,307
I like you because you're warmhearted.

681
00:50:56,307 --> 00:51:01,637
You only speak harshly, but you care the most about the captain and us.

682
00:51:01,637 --> 00:51:04,847
How could a bad person care for others like that?

683
00:51:07,450 --> 00:51:10,227
You're an extremely good person.

684
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:14,527
But why do you think you're not a good person?

685
00:51:17,110 --> 00:51:19,787
You can't be doing that to yourself.

686
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,817
Okay.

687
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:31,467
I shouldn't be doing that... to myself.

688
00:51:33,810 --> 00:51:38,107
That's why, I intend to stop going down a s***hole.

689
00:51:50,140 --> 00:51:52,767
For a while, I won't date anyone.

690
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:55,907
Sorry?

691
00:51:55,907 --> 00:51:59,577
I'm going to take a break and spend some time alone.

692
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:03,897
I think I need that kind of time.

693
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,687
W-Why go that far now?

694
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:12,497
Thanks.

695
00:52:14,210 --> 00:52:18,347
I was able to come to this conclusion, thanks to you.

696
00:52:20,150 --> 00:52:23,447
I asked you to eat today, so I could thank you.

697
00:52:23,447 --> 00:52:26,737
- Well, that's–
- Let's eat. It's going to get cold.

698
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:32,617
How long... About one year?

699
00:52:32,617 --> 00:52:35,167
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

700
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,687
Two years?

701
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:47,200
It's hot.

702
00:52:47,200 --> 00:52:48,690
Yes.

703
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:56,577
My goodness.

704
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:01,697
It's not three years, is it?

705
00:53:06,990 --> 00:53:09,277
You worked hard today. Will this be enough?

706
00:53:09,277 --> 00:53:15,437
There's nothing more delicious than the ramen you eat out after exercise.

707
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,417
<i>It's the 100th day.</i>

708
00:53:25,790 --> 00:53:28,157
It must be an anniversary.

709
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:34,397
You're right.

710
00:53:34,397 --> 00:53:36,267
Shall we do it, too?

711
00:53:40,430 --> 00:53:43,237
You said you don't like anniversaries, right?

712
00:53:43,237 --> 00:53:46,647
I honestly feel like every day is an anniversary these days.

713
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:49,087
Because I'm so happy every day.

714
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:53,857
I like eating ramen with you like this,

715
00:53:53,857 --> 00:53:57,207
hanging out with the Cheer Squad,

716
00:53:57,207 --> 00:53:59,667
and I even like training.

717
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:06,177
I'm so happy every day,

718
00:54:06,177 --> 00:54:09,090
so it actually scares me a little.

719
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:11,187
Wondering if it's okay to be like this.

720
00:54:11,187 --> 00:54:15,077
From now on, you'll feel that way even more.

721
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:23,897
Because you have me. I'm yours... and you're mine.

722
00:54:23,897 --> 00:54:25,927
Just eat your ramen.
