He deleted the account.
<i>[This account no longer exists.]</i>

10
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,555
He never planned to show up in the first place.

11
00:02:11,555 --> 00:02:15,705
If he had the guts to show up, he wouldn't have sent those anonymous messages in the first place.

12
00:02:15,705 --> 00:02:17,685
Then why would he do this?

13
00:02:17,685 --> 00:02:22,735
All of this... is just a joke to him.

14
00:02:22,735 --> 00:02:25,595
So you shouldn't give him any attention.

15
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:31,225
That kind of bastard will naturally lose interest if you ignore him.

Seon Ho, this kid...

17
00:02:38,285 --> 00:02:42,725
He's not picking up. Where did he disappear to?

- Why did you come?
- Oh, well...

22
00:02:59,795 --> 00:03:03,665
The ticket was in your room.

23
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:08,525
My son, you were so cool. Is this Theia?

24
00:03:08,525 --> 00:03:11,365
Go home. Let's talk when I get home.

25
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:16,175
It's fine, it's fine. I came all the way here, so I might as well greet everyone.

26
00:03:16,175 --> 00:03:19,085
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

27
00:03:19,085 --> 00:03:20,505
I'm Seon Ho's mom.

- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

29
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:25,535
You all worked so hard today.

30
00:03:25,535 --> 00:03:29,185
Use this to pay for the Squad's dinner.

31
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,195
No, thank you. We'll just accept your kindness.

32
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:36,365

33
00:03:36,365 --> 00:03:38,795
You're the boss?

34
00:03:38,795 --> 00:03:42,305
Why only accept my kindness? You should accept my money, too. Here.

35
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:46,175
It's fine, so eat beef instead of pork, everyone.

36
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:48,235
- Wow!
- Whoa, thank you!

37
00:03:48,235 --> 00:03:49,345
Thank you!

38
00:03:49,345 --> 00:03:51,095
By the way, who's Do Hae Yi?

39
00:03:51,095 --> 00:03:52,935
Yes, it's me.

40
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,085
But, haven't we seen each other before?

41
00:03:59,085 --> 00:04:02,015
Right? I was thinking the same thing.

42
00:04:02,015 --> 00:04:03,995
Mom! You should go home now.

43
00:04:03,995 --> 00:04:06,505
Are you dating our Seon Ho?

44
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,515
- Sorry?
- Mom!

45
00:04:10,515 --> 00:04:15,225
Someone said so. That you two are dating. That you two were hugging.

46
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:16,300
Hug?

47
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:20,970
N-No... We're not dating...

48
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,385
You're not? Then why would you hug?

49
00:04:24,385 --> 00:04:27,185
It's a form of camaraderie.

50
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:28,895
I see.

51
00:04:28,895 --> 00:04:34,685
You must be chasing after our Seon Ho on your own. Yes, well, they all do that.

52
00:04:34,685 --> 00:04:37,145
No, it's not like that. It's...

53
00:04:37,145 --> 00:04:39,105
It's not like that.

54
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,925
My feelings for her are one-sided.

55
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,425
You are? One-sided?

56
00:04:49,425 --> 00:04:54,055
But it only makes sense for her to have a crush on you. Why would you?

57
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:56,735
Wait, but young lady, why don't you like our Seon Ho?

58
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:00,165
Anyone can tell our Seon Ho is a thousand fold too good for you.

59
00:05:00,165 --> 00:05:03,825
Anyone can tell my daughter is too good for him!

60
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:08,695
- Mom?
- Huh? Mom? Why? Who is?

61
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:14,625
Where did you come from out of the blue?

62
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,675
With good reason, okay?

63
00:05:16,675 --> 00:05:20,655
This kid is probably chasing around my child. He's not the first one.

64
00:05:20,655 --> 00:05:26,055
That popularity of hers is more than bothersome.

65
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:33,445
That's right, my daughter.

66
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:48,685
I guess they're not dating. Is that a good thing?

67
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,885
- Jae Yi, you're here?
- Yes.

68
00:05:53,885 --> 00:05:56,490
Did you see my performance?

69
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,020
Yes, I did.

70
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,180
How was it?

71
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:01,955
It was good.

72
00:06:01,955 --> 00:06:07,895
Really? Oh, I see. You really liked my performance, huh?

73

<i>(T/N: A famous Korean drama)</i>

Did you buy this for me?

75
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,145
Your daughter?

76
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,645
Your son?

77
00:06:20,645 --> 00:06:21,685
Let's go.

78
00:06:21,685 --> 00:06:22,935
- Let's go.
- Why?

79
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:25,615
Oh, my, girl. Did you put blush on your eyelids?

80
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,815
- Hey, why? Why? Why? Why?
- No, no, no.

81
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,405
Hey, it's night now. Take off your sunglasses.

82
00:06:30,405 --> 00:06:32,925
All you know how to do is babble.

83
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:37,575
Yeah, I'm so jealous. You can take everything. Okay. Okay?

84
00:06:37,575 --> 00:06:42,265
Mom, go home for the night. I'll talk to you when I go home tomorrow.

85
00:06:42,265 --> 00:06:46,275
Son, I'm so hurt.

86
00:06:46,275 --> 00:06:50,525
Mom, please! If you continue, I'm going to–

87
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,655
All right, son.

88
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:59,235
Fine.

89
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:07,645
She calls herself a "lady," but it's all just for show.

90
00:07:07,645 --> 00:07:10,615
Geez, Mom! You two know each other?

91
00:07:10,615 --> 00:07:13,035
Don't ever accept his feelings, got it?

92
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:16,185
If she becomes your mother-in-law, you're going to live with a headache.

93
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:19,545
You're overreacting! Who's going to be my mother-in-law?

94
00:07:19,545 --> 00:07:22,715
You never know, you wench.

95
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:29,505
So, why did you buy us beverages? We're a big group, so it probably cost a lot.

96
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:33,865
I can't buy beef, but I can do that much.

97
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,465
Thanks.

98
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:43,835
Why are you saying that and being all cringy, huh?

99
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,095
Huh? Anyway, I'm against him!

100
00:07:47,095 --> 00:07:49,565
Gosh, be quiet!

101
00:07:49,565 --> 00:07:52,325
Why? Can't I say that as your mom?

102
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,945
Stay put. Good job.

103
00:07:56,945 --> 00:07:58,685
You came?

104
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,885
- Yeah.
- Okay, leave.

105
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:04,655
You were cool.

106
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,535
You were a bit cool today.

107
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:13,305
Right? I tore that stage, right?

108
00:08:13,305 --> 00:08:16,885
Gosh, I can't hide my charm even if I try.

109
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,665
There you go again overreacting.

110
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,955
Thanks for coming.

111

Aigoo, cutie!

112

Here. I heard you're the one who resolved Jae Yi's incident.

127
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,095
I just happened to know the guy's family.

128
00:09:29,095 --> 00:09:32,975
Thank you. I keep becoming indebted to you.

129
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:37,285
I'll pay this one back double with interest.

130
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:43,155
You don't need to. I just did it because I wanted to. I didn't want to see you worry.

131
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:51,025
Wait, but was that a public confession or what?

132
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,475
I had no intention to, but it just happened.

<i>I'm going to try having a crush.</i>

135
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,845
Then, her response is?

136
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:18,135
Drum roll.

137
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,595
That's private.

138
00:10:23,595 --> 00:10:26,175
What is this compelling answer?

139
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:27,235
My heart's fluttering.

140
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:29,625
Why would your heart flutter?

141
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:33,505
What's Theia's Forbidden Act number 3, again?

142

No CCs...

And if you break it?

144
00:10:37,205 --> 00:10:38,455
Withdrawal.

145
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:42,405
So, do you think you could be so public about it or not?

146
00:10:42,405 --> 00:10:44,585
Of course not.

147
00:10:50,885 --> 00:10:51,840

Okay!

He's the one who started it.

151
00:11:01,645 --> 00:11:03,205
He's going to get scolded.

- What?

report it to me right away.

Okay. Just trust me.

157

I'm a pro at recognizing these things.

158

All right.

But I really didn't mean to do that.

192
00:13:00,005 --> 00:13:03,955
You disappeared... And supposedly, there was a bad guy.

193
00:13:03,955 --> 00:13:06,655
And I went to look for you,

Who do you think you're fooling?

199
00:13:25,765 --> 00:13:28,535
You think you can lead me on

00:13:28,535 --> 00:13:34,320

201
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:40,835
Oh, right. You rejected me.

202
00:13:40,835 --> 00:13:43,860
Do you think I'll fall for it again?

203
00:13:44,745 --> 00:13:48,455
Forget it! I don't need you.

207
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:02,440
Ouch...

208
00:14:04,495 --> 00:14:06,790
She must've struggled a lot.

209
00:14:08,195 --> 00:14:11,715
You think I'll fall for it again? Who do you think you are?

210
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:16,780
I'm very smart. Get lost right now.

211
00:14:21,255 --> 00:14:23,135
Why are you in the women's restroom?

212
00:14:23,135 --> 00:14:26,210
Th-This is the men's restroom.

213
00:14:28,085 --> 00:14:29,665
Oh, this is the men's restroom.

214
00:14:29,665 --> 00:14:33,555
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

215
00:14:33,555 --> 00:14:35,150
But...

216
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:38,245
did something happen between you and Captain?

217
00:14:38,245 --> 00:14:39,735
What?

218
00:14:39,735 --> 00:14:42,730
You just told Captain to get lost.

219
00:14:44,745 --> 00:14:47,755
As you already know, Captain is a bit, you know?

220
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:53,495
Authoritative, a fogey! And totally annoying.

221
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:56,210
I thought you two were really close.

222
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,620
Me?

223
00:14:59,385 --> 00:15:03,445
Not at all.

224
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,460
I see.

225
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,690
Yes. Please continue your business.

I'm r-really sorry. I'm very sorry. Fighting.

227
00:15:25,035 --> 00:15:28,490
- So cute.
- Don't look down on me!

228
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,415
I'm the Captain.

229
00:15:32,415 --> 00:15:34,540
You call yourself Captain–

230
00:15:40,835 --> 00:15:43,225
Are you okay? I think you drank a lot.

231
00:15:43,225 --> 00:15:46,290
Nope. I'm totally fine.

232

00:16:27,675 --> 00:16:29,340
What?

235
00:16:30,295 --> 00:16:34,395

I'm sorry.

260
00:18:33,785 --> 00:18:35,300
Just tell them to come in and eat.

How did we end up here?

269
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:22,400
So...

270
00:19:23,415 --> 00:19:28,025
Well, what happened was...

271
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:32,375

273
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:39,285
<i>You understand me. You understand how I feel, right?</i>

274
00:19:39,285 --> 00:19:41,335
<i>No. I don't.</i>

275
00:19:41,335 --> 00:19:43,980
<i>Why don't you know?</i>

276
00:19:45,065 --> 00:19:48,075
<i>Let's go!</i>

277
00:19:48,075 --> 00:19:51,205
<i>Let's go apologize to Jung Woo's mom.</i>

278
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:53,375

279
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:57,375

<i>Let's go!</i>

282
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:05,945
<i>Then Young Woo called a van service...</i>

283
00:20:05,945 --> 00:20:08,020
<i>This is exciting!</i>

284
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:10,625
<i>I can't, I can't. I'm scared.</i>

285
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:12,615
<i>- I'm sorry, Mom.
- Get on for now.</i>

286
00:20:12,615 --> 00:20:14,195
<i>I don't want to go.</i>

287
00:20:14,195 --> 00:20:16,625
<i>Let's go, prince!</i>

288
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,165
<i>Wait, Captain's house is in Busan...</i>

289
00:20:20,165 --> 00:20:23,165
<i>Hey, miss. Are you getting on or not?</i>

290
00:20:23,165 --> 00:20:25,415
<i>Get on! You only live once!</i>

291
00:20:25,415 --> 00:20:27,400
Get on!

292
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:35,575
<i>Let's go. When would we go to Busan like this?</i>

293
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,425
<i>Unni!</i>

294
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,165
<i>I'll get on.</i>

295
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,620
<i>Lets go!</i>

296
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:53,425
That's what happened.

297
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,815
An adult should've kept their head on straight.

298
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,375
Okay, hurry up, eat, and get up.

299
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:12,125
Okay, everyone. Hurry and eat, and go home.

300
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:16,565
You should... at least pay for the lodging and food.

301
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,405
Okay!

302
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:25,375
Yeah, okay.

303
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:29,305
It's fate that we came to Busan like this.

304
00:21:29,305 --> 00:21:32,305
How do you feel about going to Haeundae, and eating a bowl of fresh sashimi–

305
00:21:32,305 --> 00:21:34,245
Something came up. I have to go back to Seoul.

306
00:21:34,245 --> 00:21:37,145
But it's the weekend.

307
00:21:37,145 --> 00:21:41,055
I have a report due on Monday, but it looks like they're missing some information.

308
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:43,965
Can't you just ask someone else to do it?

309
00:21:43,965 --> 00:21:46,725
It's my report. How can I ask someone else?

310
00:21:46,725 --> 00:21:52,035
Oh, then. Can't you do it tomorrow? We came all the way to Busan.

311
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,875
I'd be too worried to enjoy myself anyway. Sorry.

312
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:59,005
Gosh, you live such an exhausting life.

313
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:05,605
I mean, I just thought you could do it tomorrow.

314
00:22:05,605 --> 00:22:08,615
That's right. I live an exhausting life.

315
00:22:08,615 --> 00:22:15,105
But most workers in Korea probably live an exhausting life like I do. You're the one who's too carefree.

316
00:22:15,105 --> 00:22:18,945
Did I upset you? I'm sorry.

317
00:22:18,945 --> 00:22:21,965
Well, I was going to talk to you about this anyway.

318
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:26,125
Will you continue to live like this? I heard the gist of it from the kids.

319
00:22:26,125 --> 00:22:28,655
That you made some money through your startup.

320
00:22:28,655 --> 00:22:31,835
I don't know how much you made, but money's not the problem.

321
00:22:31,835 --> 00:22:37,895
How old are you that you continue to hover around the Cheer Squad like a partier?

D*** it. You're really making me look lousy.

They barged in, so I let them sleep in my house and fed them. They should at least repay the favor.

It's the water from an elite university in Seoul!

Um... This rice cake...

480
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:05,205
Please buy some rice cakes.

481
00:33:05,205 --> 00:33:06,235
What are you saying?

482
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:11,745
Please buy some rice cakes. This rice cake just came out, so it's soft and delicious.

483
00:33:11,745 --> 00:33:16,735
The red bean is apparently very sweet, too.

484
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:22,145
My goodness! Is this some new sales method to jumpstart my curiosity?

485
00:33:22,145 --> 00:33:24,725
Please give me one rice cake. Sirutteok and injeolmi.
<i>(T/N: Steamed types of rice cakes)</i>

486
00:33:24,725 --> 00:33:27,855
Okay. It's 6,000 won.

487
00:33:27,855 --> 00:33:29,075
I hope you sell a lot.

488
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:31,745
Thank you.

489
00:33:31,745 --> 00:33:34,715
Hey! Good job!

490
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:39,045
- Ahjumma.
- Yes.

491
00:33:39,045 --> 00:33:41,015
We're making kimchi and we need rice flour.

492
00:33:41,015 --> 00:33:44,285
Oh, I have some prepared. Hold on.

493
00:33:44,285 --> 00:33:46,115
Aigoo! Hang in there.

494
00:33:46,115 --> 00:33:47,330
Thank you!

495
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,165
Goodbye! Yeah.

496
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:58,425
Why the sudden greeting?

497
00:33:58,425 --> 00:34:04,165
Okay, pick one, pick one! Two for 10,000 won. Buy four, get one free!

498
00:34:04,165 --> 00:34:09,885
Our melons are delicious, too! If you buy one basket, w-we'll give you three more for free!

499
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:12,835
- We have some new products!
- Young lady, young lady!

500
00:34:12,835 --> 00:34:17,495
- Let's move some melon boxes together. Okay?
- All right.

501
00:34:17,495 --> 00:34:20,175
Wait, there are quite a lot of boxes.

502
00:34:20,175 --> 00:34:25,295
Oh, young lady! Can you help me out for a bit?

503
00:34:25,295 --> 00:34:26,625
Sure.

504
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:28,035
Come here.

505
00:34:28,035 --> 00:34:30,315
Why did you make them so pretty?

506
00:34:30,315 --> 00:34:32,105
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

507
00:34:32,105 --> 00:34:33,585
Enjoy.

508
00:34:33,585 --> 00:34:34,610
Mom, thank you.

509
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,110
Sure. Honey?

510
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:42,335
Honey, honey.

511
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,285
You scared me!

512
00:34:47,285 --> 00:34:50,075
Let's leave the door open.

513
00:34:50,075 --> 00:34:52,345
- Enjoy yourselves.
- Bye.

514
00:34:52,345 --> 00:34:54,835
Oh, goodness.

515
00:34:54,835 --> 00:34:58,175
You're more friendly than I thought.

516
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:07,325
Man, I should be in Busan, too.

517
00:35:07,325 --> 00:35:11,060
Why did I have to go to the restroom at that time?

518
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:15,690
<i>[Family]</i>

519
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:19,315
You must've been close with Do Hae Yi since you were young.

520
00:35:19,315 --> 00:35:21,295
Yeah, childhood friends.

521
00:35:21,295 --> 00:35:23,355
So that's why you're close with Hae Yi's younger brother, too.

522
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:24,335
Yeah.

523
00:35:24,335 --> 00:35:30,155
When Hae Yi's mother was busy, Jae Yi and Hae Yi would come over to eat.

524
00:35:30,155 --> 00:35:32,275
Do you like Do Hae Yi's brother?

525
00:35:32,275 --> 00:35:34,115
Why do you ask?

526
00:35:34,115 --> 00:35:36,685
You seem to be a bit clingy.

527
00:35:36,685 --> 00:35:38,075
Me?

528
00:35:38,075 --> 00:35:43,755
Hey, you must not know about Jae Yi, but he's just a bit shy.

529
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:46,575
Whatever floats your boat.

530
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,825
There's something I'm curious about.

531
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:52,925
Gosh, you're curious about so many things! I did like you before, you know.

532
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,255
What is the Captain and Do Hae Yi's relationship?

533
00:35:55,255 --> 00:35:57,575
What the? You knew about that?

534
00:35:57,575 --> 00:36:02,575
Wow, I thought you were clueless, but you catch on more quickly than I thought.

535
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,545
<i>Then who took those photos?</i>

536
00:36:30,220 --> 00:36:31,235
Father...

537
00:36:31,235 --> 00:36:33,195
Yeah, continue, continue.

538
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,665
Mom!

539
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:40,500
What is all this?

540
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,975
<i>Do Hae Yi!</i>

541
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:46,895
<i>Do Hae Yi.</i>

542
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,315
Yeah.

543
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:01,465
I... must have been too drunk.

544
00:37:01,465 --> 00:37:03,635
I don't remember anything.

545
00:37:03,635 --> 00:37:06,045
Yeah, you were really drunk last night.

546
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:11,235
I... didn't make...

547
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:14,865
a mistake or anything, right?

548
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:19,245
Why? Are you anxious?

549
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:22,105
Did you blacked out?

550
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,635
Why?

551
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:29,555
Did I... do something last night?

552
00:37:29,555 --> 00:37:32,305
No. You didn't do anything.

553
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:33,545
Yeah?

554
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,555
Captain,

555
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,885
I drank too much last night, and I blacked out.

556
00:37:47,885 --> 00:37:51,775
Did I... make a mistake or anything?

557
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:53,145
What mistake?

558
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,335
Well...

559
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,565
You know...

560
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:03,785
N-Nothing?

561
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,155
What the? Was it really a dream?

562
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,995
Am I that...

563
00:38:15,995 --> 00:38:19,765
For sure, I thought I kissed someone last night.

564
00:38:19,765 --> 00:38:23,535
All right, that's enough. You can just help me now.

565
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,015
Okay!

566
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,875
I'll go wash these in a flash.

567
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:37,185
- Thanks.
- Aigoo!

568
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:40,435
Why is she so all over the place?

569
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:48,155
She's not. She was just trying to hurry.

570
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,985
Are you good?

571
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:01,915
Yoo Min, watch out!

572
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,415
I'm okay.

573
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:18,285
D*** it. Hey, stop right there! Someone almost got hurt!

574
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:21,375
It's okay. Forget it.

575
00:39:21,375 --> 00:39:24,565
If it was a motorcycle, I would've reported the license plate.

576
00:39:26,350 --> 00:39:28,695
You're the same as always.

577
00:39:28,695 --> 00:39:30,555
What?

578
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:40,735
You're brave...

579
00:39:42,330 --> 00:39:44,085
as always.

580
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,885
Even when I was being bullied by the kids,

581
00:39:51,030 --> 00:39:53,245
you fought them for me.

582
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,670
<i>Alright, let's go.</i>

583
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:04,345
<i>You should just say it to her face.</i>

584
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:09,315
<i>Childishly leaving together when she comes in,</i>

585
00:40:09,315 --> 00:40:11,325
<i>do you really want to do that?</i>

586
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:15,985
<i>If something is bothering you, just spit it out.</i>

587
00:40:15,985 --> 00:40:17,545
<i>How are you so full of yourself?</i>

588
00:40:17,545 --> 00:40:19,815
<i>- Let's go.</i>
<i>- Snob.</i>

589
00:40:19,815 --> 00:40:22,755
<i>So annoying.</i>

590
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,575
Thank you.

591
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,400
I wasn't really trying to help you.

592
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,120
I just couldn't stand them doing that.

593
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:39,235
Back then and even now...

594
00:40:41,610 --> 00:40:43,275
thank you.

595
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:54,395
What should I do?

596
00:40:54,395 --> 00:40:56,370
What do you mean?

597
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,990
We can pay for these and eat them.

598
00:41:00,635 --> 00:41:02,100
Right?

599
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:04,580
I have too many problems, don't I?

600
00:41:19,930 --> 00:41:22,565
<i>I have something to tell you. Let's meet.</i>

601
00:41:22,565 --> 00:41:24,725
<i>[Lee Yoo Min: I have something to say. Let's meet.]</i>

602
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,475
So, what's so urgent?

603
00:41:32,475 --> 00:41:34,505
I had something to ask you.

604
00:41:34,505 --> 00:41:38,175
On the day of the festival, I actually saw it.

605
00:41:39,695 --> 00:41:42,205
<i>[Yoo Min: Is it Hae Yi this time?]</i>

606
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:47,345
<i>Oh, I thought it was mine.</i>

607
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:54,915
It's you, right? The one who sent that Broadcasting Club video message.

608
00:41:57,740 --> 00:42:00,125
Whoa! Kim Jin Il...

609
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:06,695
I didn't think so, but you're bolder than I thought. Hey, everyone in the Cheer Squad thinks it's me.

610
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,135
However, Yoo Min suddenly wants to see me.

611
00:42:12,135 --> 00:42:16,485
How would she react if she finds out you're the one? I'm curious.

612
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,595
Hey, you got it on your face.

613
00:42:28,595 --> 00:42:31,115
It stings! It stings!

614
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,025
Is it because of me?

615
00:42:39,025 --> 00:42:41,975
Gosh! My goodness!

616
00:42:41,975 --> 00:42:44,855
- Are you okay?
- No, my eye! It hurts!

617
00:42:44,855 --> 00:42:46,675
Hey, I have no choice. Hold on for a second.

618
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:48,315
It hurts!

619
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:52,215
Just endure for a second.

620
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:02,465
I thought I would lose my precious little eye.

621
00:43:02,465 --> 00:43:05,685
I'm sorry. I was trying to wipe it.

622
00:43:05,685 --> 00:43:10,115
You should've just stayed still. You're no help.

623
00:43:10,115 --> 00:43:14,135
Sorry. I just keep messing up.

624
00:43:17,030 --> 00:43:18,755
Here.

625
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:30,430
Are you okay?

626
00:43:30,430 --> 00:43:31,790
Yeah.

627
00:43:35,550 --> 00:43:37,915
What the heck? I called dibs on that first.

628
00:43:37,915 --> 00:43:40,825
Hae Yi hurt her eye.

629
00:43:40,825 --> 00:43:42,495
Use this.

630
00:43:42,495 --> 00:43:43,905
Okay.

631
00:43:45,580 --> 00:43:47,315
Okay, you use it.

632
00:43:47,315 --> 00:43:49,145
Thank you.

633
00:43:58,330 --> 00:43:59,745
Come visit again, okay?

634
00:43:59,745 --> 00:44:02,210
Please take care. I'll be going.

635
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,510
Go now.

636
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,600
Aigoo! He's so decent.

637
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,440
It'd be perfect to have him as my son-in-law.

638
00:44:11,445 --> 00:44:14,685
We need to keep a watch. Let's not be hasty with our judgments.

639
00:44:14,685 --> 00:44:17,145
There's no chance for me to be like that with him.

640
00:44:17,145 --> 00:44:20,895
Just how many sons-in-law have you had in your heart?

641
00:44:22,490 --> 00:44:24,325
Mother, this one.

642
00:44:24,325 --> 00:44:26,265
Aigoo, put it here.

643
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:50,135
Stars. Did the Captain put them here?

644
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:55,015
That's right. Jung Woo put them there when he was seven.

645
00:44:55,015 --> 00:44:59,285
I see. He must've liked them since he was young.

646
00:44:59,285 --> 00:45:03,255
He even chose his major for this. He's more romantic than I thought.

647
00:45:03,255 --> 00:45:08,465
Aigoo! Those wretched stars. I'm so sick of them.

648
00:45:10,150 --> 00:45:12,765
When I'd come late from work,

649
00:45:12,765 --> 00:45:16,685
he'd just be sitting in front of the door all day, waiting for me.

650
00:45:16,685 --> 00:45:20,215
Just staring at the sky.

651
00:45:20,215 --> 00:45:25,985
How lonely he must have felt, for him to have befriended stars?

652
00:45:28,660 --> 00:45:33,965
I was so against it even when he was going to college, but he kept on being so stubborn.

653
00:45:33,965 --> 00:45:36,665
That's why I've come to hate them even more.

654
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:44,815
My boy Jung Woo is... just like his father, so...

655
00:45:44,815 --> 00:45:49,505
there's no stopping him once his heart catches fire for something.

656
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:04,065
<i>Hyungnim! Are you home?</i>

657
00:46:04,065 --> 00:46:09,005
Hyungnim, it's an emergency! Come out right now and hear this. Seriously!

658
00:46:09,005 --> 00:46:12,485
Does it make sense for the Restaurant Alley Chief

659
00:46:12,485 --> 00:46:16,075
to be sweeping the show at the Marketplace Singing Competition?

660
00:46:16,075 --> 00:46:21,205
Has that woman gone mad? Why is she sticking her nose all the way here?

661
00:46:21,205 --> 00:46:25,435
What do we do? The tables are completely turned on us right now.

662
00:46:25,435 --> 00:46:28,585
The prize is such a good one this time, too!

663
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:33,595
Aigoo! How can we just sit and watch the Restaurant Alley take it?

664
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:35,375
Excuse me...

665
00:46:36,830 --> 00:46:41,605
I feel like there might be a way.

666
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:48,265
- What is it!
- Jesus Christ!

667
00:46:48,265 --> 00:46:50,935
Hurry up and tell us!

668
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:07,555
Three, four!

I feel so much better. Just look at this meat. It looks so delicious.

686
00:48:48,905 --> 00:48:51,675
- Awesome!
- Thank you!

687
00:48:51,675 --> 00:48:56,645
Hey, you all eat up today. You kids saved the Marketplace's reputation today!

688
00:48:56,645 --> 00:48:59,195
<i>- Thank you!</i>
<i>- Whoa!</i>

689
00:48:59,195 --> 00:49:00,805
Come on, have a glass.

690
00:49:00,805 --> 00:49:03,265
You're so considerate!

691
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:06,835
You're not drinking today.

692
00:49:06,835 --> 00:49:08,045
Gosh, you're ruining the mood.

693
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:11,855
Come on, let's have a drink. Eat till your heart's content. There's a lot of meat.

694
00:49:11,855 --> 00:49:14,795
- Drink up!
- You all did great.

695
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:18,085
I won't drink! For real.

696
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,855
We'll go back right after eating.

697
00:49:27,855 --> 00:49:31,215
I left side dishes at the security office. Pick it up and have some.

698
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:35,125
I also packed some for your friends, so don't forget to take them with you.

699
00:49:35,125 --> 00:49:36,795
Thank you.

700
00:49:41,290 --> 00:49:44,230
I was going to say that I'll quit

701
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,630
to ease your mind, but then again

702
00:49:47,630 --> 00:49:50,065
I think it'll become a lie.

703
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:57,095
Can't you let me do it just until this year ends? Only until this year ends.

704
00:49:57,095 --> 00:50:02,575
Starting next year, I'll study up for the Administrative Exam and pass for sure.

705
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:05,955
Mom, you know, right? I have a smart brain.

706
00:50:05,955 --> 00:50:09,275
Do you really like it that much?

707
00:50:09,275 --> 00:50:12,905
The situation is kind of difficult right now.

708
00:50:24,555 --> 00:50:27,265
You know...

709
00:50:27,265 --> 00:50:29,975
I used to love

710
00:50:29,975 --> 00:50:32,099
your dad's singing.

711
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,745
Back then, I was consumed in making a living,

712
00:50:36,745 --> 00:50:40,498
so I couldn't even properly listen to a song.

713
00:50:40,497 --> 00:50:42,235
But that man

714
00:50:42,235 --> 00:50:44,097
used to sing a song is a dream.

715
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:47,235
He'd sing a song

716
00:50:47,235 --> 00:50:50,585
looking so shiny and sparkly.

717
00:50:50,585 --> 00:50:53,125
He looked so cool.

718
00:50:53,865 --> 00:50:55,425
After we got married,

719
00:50:55,425 --> 00:51:00,785
I was sick of him living like a hippie, wandering everywhere.

720
00:51:00,785 --> 00:51:03,905
But I still liked your dad's

721
00:51:03,905 --> 00:51:05,285
singing.

722
00:51:05,335 --> 00:51:07,905
I'm different from Dad.

723
00:51:07,905 --> 00:51:10,185
I won't live like him.

724
00:51:12,455 --> 00:51:14,035
Of course.

725
00:51:14,035 --> 00:51:16,100
You're surely different.

726
00:51:18,665 --> 00:51:21,575
Do it if that's what you want.

727
00:51:26,235 --> 00:51:29,296
While looking at you yesterday and today,

728
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:32,795
you were so brilliant

729
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:35,345
and shiny. You looked great.

730
00:51:38,255 --> 00:51:41,215
When can a person shine like that?

731
00:51:44,475 --> 00:51:47,435
Okay. Just do as you wish.

732
00:51:47,435 --> 00:51:50,235
How can I ever stop you?

733
00:51:51,435 --> 00:51:53,225
Are you really okay with it?

734
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,825
Your father used to say

735
00:51:57,175 --> 00:52:02,475
in life... finding something you love like

736
00:52:02,475 --> 00:52:05,675
having a big fortune in life.

737
00:52:08,175 --> 00:52:12,505
There are too many people who never find that one thing.

738
00:52:19,135 --> 00:52:22,835
You must be a lucky boy.

739
00:52:24,445 --> 00:52:26,455
Thank you

740
00:52:28,925 --> 00:52:30,775
and I'm sorry.

741
00:52:36,095 --> 00:52:38,945
Children are really difficult.

Are you sad because you didn't get to drink the rice wine?

753

That's not it.

754
00:54:11,205 --> 00:54:14,355
I was just soaked in sentiment.

755
00:54:15,065 --> 00:54:17,865
- What sentiment?
- Well...

756
00:54:21,965 --> 00:54:23,895
You know...

757
00:54:23,895 --> 00:54:26,225
I was reminded of Dad.

758
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:30,265
My mom said that

759
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:34,525
Dad was too busy making a living so he never got to see the ocean.

760
00:54:34,525 --> 00:54:38,995
I was just not sure if I should be seeing this good thing alone.

761
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:41,365
Your dad must be proud

762
00:54:41,365 --> 00:54:43,445
since you thought of your dad

763
00:54:43,445 --> 00:54:45,955
after seeing something good.

764
00:54:47,865 --> 00:54:49,855
Are you feeling

765
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,035
okay yourself, Captain?

766
00:54:52,035 --> 00:54:54,025
You seemed down earlier.

767
00:54:54,025 --> 00:54:55,785
Not really.

768
00:54:56,485 --> 00:55:00,405
I feel great. Better than I ever did.

769
00:55:05,995 --> 00:55:07,875
Whoa! Alta-ri!

770
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,385
Sure.

771
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:11,825
Let's just say it's Alta-ri.

772
00:55:11,825 --> 00:55:13,725
I know what it is.

773
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:16,025
Altair.

774
00:55:16,615 --> 00:55:18,495
It was just easier to say it that way.

775
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,605
I'm really smart.

776
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:22,295
Alta-ri!

777
00:55:22,295 --> 00:55:24,985
Deneb and Vega!

778
00:55:33,725 --> 00:55:35,045
Is it here?

779
00:55:35,045 --> 00:55:36,265
What is?

780
00:55:36,265 --> 00:55:39,235
Where you watched the stars as a child?

781
00:55:41,565 --> 00:55:43,945
That's what your mom said.

782
00:55:46,615 --> 00:55:48,325
It's here.

783
00:55:50,345 --> 00:55:52,485
Were you lonely?

784
00:55:55,205 --> 00:55:56,835
I mean...

785
00:55:56,835 --> 00:55:59,985
I was less lonely because I had Jae Yi,

786
00:55:59,985 --> 00:56:03,055
but you were all alone.

787
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:06,275
So I thought you might've been lonely.

788
00:56:12,715 --> 00:56:14,945
It was okay.

789
00:56:15,545 --> 00:56:18,425
If I sat here like this,

790
00:56:20,205 --> 00:56:22,485
time flew by.

791
00:56:39,045 --> 00:56:44,525
<i>Finding something... you love like that...</i>

792
00:56:44,525 --> 00:56:47,645
<i>is also a big fortune in life.</i>

793
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:56,505
About yesterday...

794
00:56:58,185 --> 00:56:59,435
What about yesterday?

795
00:56:59,435 --> 00:57:02,095
You told me not to lead you on.

796
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:05,885
Ah!

797
00:57:05,885 --> 00:57:11,245
I think I do remember up to that point, but...

798
00:57:12,845 --> 00:57:14,925
You're right.

799
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,515
I did that.

800
00:57:18,155 --> 00:57:19,905
It's okay.

801
00:57:19,905 --> 00:57:22,895
Why bring it up now?

802
00:57:22,895 --> 00:57:25,625
That's why I won't do that anymore.

803
00:57:29,145 --> 00:57:31,725
I won't lead you on anymore,

804
00:57:33,135 --> 00:57:36,435
and properly act on my feelings.

805
00:57:43,855 --> 00:57:45,575
I like you.

806
00:57:47,185 --> 00:57:49,515
I like you, Do Hae Yi.

♫ <i>A soft song like the spring breeze</i> ♫

808
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:57,599
♫ <i>This place where</i> ♫

809
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:02,879
♫ <i>I hear the soft music</i> ♫

810
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:09,189
♫ <i>You and I are here together</i> ♫

811
00:58:09,189 --> 00:58:17,800
♫ <i>Many days I practiced my confession for love</i> ♫

812
00:58:18,845 --> 00:58:20,565
Do Hae Yi!

813
00:58:21,597 --> 00:58:23,265
Let's do this together.

814
00:58:28,085 --> 00:58:30,015
<i>Do Hae Yi!</i>

815
00:59:08,745 --> 00:59:11,905
<i>[Cheer Up]</i>

816
00:59:19,275 --> 00:59:24,235
♫ <i>I was also startled by the unfamiliar number ringing through the silence</i> ♫

817
00:59:24,235 --> 00:59:29,365
♫ <i>I was hesitant to answer the unfamiliar number ringing for a long time</i> ♫

818
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:30,935
♫ <i>When you open the door</i> ♫

819
00:59:30,935 --> 00:59:33,485
<i>Do Hae Yi, you were a woman with two hearts?</i>

820
00:59:33,485 --> 00:59:34,575
<i>You're crazy, Do Hae Yi!</i>

821
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:36,005
<i>- Do Hae Yi!
- I don't like love triangles.</i>

822
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:36,985
<i>I hate them.</i>

823
00:59:36,985 --> 00:59:38,605
<i>This final assignment</i>

824
00:59:38,605 --> 00:59:41,375
<i>is writing a report on the date with your partner.</i>

825
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:42,305
<i>I don't know.</i>

826
00:59:42,305 --> 00:59:44,825
<i>I don't know my own feelings!</i>

827
00:59:44,825 --> 00:59:46,305
<i>You'll learn soon.</i>

828
00:59:46,305 --> 00:59:48,165
<i>You'll learn at some point.</i>

829
00:59:48,165 --> 00:59:50,315
<i>Let's pretend it didn't happen and just relax today.</i>

830
00:59:50,315 --> 00:59:52,275
<i>That's how you'll realize what a great guy I am.</i>

831
00:59:52,275 --> 00:59:53,675
<i>Sorry for confusing you.</i>

832
00:59:53,675 --> 00:59:56,685
<i>But can't you give me a chance, too?</i>

833
00:59:56,685 --> 00:59:58,445
<i>It's too late.</i>

834
00:59:58,445 --> 01:00:01,599
♫ <i>Waiting for someone today...</i> ♫
