Why did an unlucky accident like this happen?

00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,240
Was it really...

10

an accident?

11
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:45,480

It was totally fine when I checked it this morning, though.

19

Is it because it was rusted?

It's not something that falls so easily.

M-Mother? Your mom?

She's overreacting because her grown-up daughter didn't answer once.

49

There's a certain method. I'll show you.

00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,640

95
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,520

96
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,730
Oh, Newbie! You almost got into an accident. Are you okay?
- Me?

97
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,220

Someone also almost died two years ago because of an accident.

101
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:58,400
Why? Yoo Min, the one you were head over heels for. Don't you remember?

102
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,530
It was just like today. Why do horrible things keep happening?

103
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:03,300
What if something seriously bad happens?

104
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,420
Stop being obnoxious and take your drunken talk elsewhere.

105
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,610
Hey, I don't mean to offend you... but was it you back then?

106
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:11,940
Like, you were rejected by Yoo Min, and in your anger...

107
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,950
Why? You want to hit me?

108
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:15,640
Just leave. I don't want to cause a scene.

109
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,330
- Why would I leave? You should–
- Is there a dog barking somewhere?

110
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:19,620
Wait, a real dog came in.

111
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,440
- Come see me for a second.
- I'll leave if you let go of me.

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,070
- Hey, hey.
- Whoa, this dog is quite heavy.

113
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,400
I can walk on my own.

114
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,730
You guys, be careful.

115
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:27,710
Yes, yes.

116
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:29,680
I'll walk out on my own!

117
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,740
- Get over here.
- Watch your head.

118
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,750
Bye.

119
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,110
Okay, now. Cheers, cheers, cheers!

By the way, who is Yoo Min?

124
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:58,070
Yoo Min...

125
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,240
Park Jung Woo's first love...

126
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:04,340
and his last love as well.

127
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,500
- At least up until now.
- Wow!

128
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,800
Park Jung Woo doesn't change easily.

129
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:15,090
He doesn't change his mind about anything once he likes it.

130
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,670
He's the type to take things all the way to the bitter end.

131
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:32,100
- He's so drunk.
- Someone hold him up.

132
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,250
Hurry up and hold him up.

133
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:44,490
Perhaps, I might be able to help you in the future.

134
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:47,880
Knowing your enemy and yourself is a win-win situation.

135
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,160
My cab is here.

136
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:08,670
That's my dad's phone number.

137
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,160
What?

138
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,900
Theia!

139
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,760
I'll be going home now.

140
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,130
Take care. You can get home safe, right?

141
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,660
Yes.

142
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,970
Bye, Unni.

143
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,520
I'm home.

144
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,910
That's not the place.

145
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:44,170
What? Yes, it is. This is my home.

146
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,310
This isn't your home.

147
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:50,380
Yes, it is. My legs are so tired, Mom.

148
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:52,850
My arms also hurt and everywhere else, too.

149
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:53,870
Hey, Sun Ja!

150
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:56,600
Here! I'm Joo Sun Ja of Theia!

151
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,830
Did you call me, senior?

152
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,520
Let me go for a second.

153
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:04,620
I'll text you her address, so you make sure to get her home.

154
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:07,080
Love your teammate; love your country.

155
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,650
I'll do that. It'll be hard because she's not in a good condition.

156
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,040
Oh, my!

157
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,280
I'll take her home. Love your teammate; love your country.

158
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,270
Then let's go together.

159
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:19,870
Let's do that, then.

160
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:24,580
They're all mine.

161
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,640
Yes, they're yours. No one's taking them.

162
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,030
They're all mine!

163
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:32,590
Her drinking habits are refreshing. I could've taken her home by myself.

164

That jerk is harassing her.

But there's still some time left.

One of the life lessons I learned

is that there's no free money in this world.

You must've at least had a silver spoon to have been able to become self-made.

(T/N: Their belongings were in lien.)

Being in debt is also a skill.

We have no belongings to adhere stickers to in our house.

368
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:58,530
On top of red stickers, my father was diagnosed with stomach cancer.

I don't have a dad.

372
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:10,060
I took a leave of absence for two years to pay for my father's hospital bills,

373
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,410
and worked part-time.

00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:58,520
They're going to eat everything. Run!

485
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,250
I'm bleeding. Gosh.

486
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,020
Are you okay?

487
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,390
I told you not to run.

488
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,620
Sit tight. I'll rub some ointment on it.

489
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,550
- Don't touch it.
- It hurts!

490
00:33:17,550 --> 00:33:20,730
That's why I told you not to touch it! It'll hurt.

491
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,640
Let me see.

492
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,070
Let me see.

493
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:35,050
Gosh, just let me! We need to–

494
00:33:35,050 --> 00:33:39,210
It stings. It stings. It stings. It stings! It stings!

495
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,070
Don't move. We need to do this.

496
00:33:41,070 --> 00:33:44,940
It stings! It stings! It stings!

497
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:47,140
Oh, gosh.

498
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,610
Why do you carry that around?

499
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,840
There's always one person who gets drunk and

500
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:58,160
falls on his face each year.

501
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:01,270
It's my first time seeing someone trip while sober.

502
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:05,310
It... stings.

503
00:34:06,530 --> 00:34:11,240
Be more careful. I'm afraid you'll injure yourself more.

504
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,820
You see? You're such a flirt.

505
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,090
Do Hae Yi!

506
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,220
Come in!

507
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:56,100
It's so cold!

508
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:03,960
Thanks. I avoided the rain thanks to you.

509
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,970
Three's a bit crowded.

510
00:35:05,970 --> 00:35:08,180
It's crowded for two, too.

511
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,950
Your younger brother is studying for pre med, right?

512
00:35:10,950 --> 00:35:13,030
You can tell him to ask me anything.

513
00:35:13,030 --> 00:35:15,670
Really? Nice!

514
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:17,670
You have a younger brother?

515
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,330
Do you have younger siblings?

516
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,810
No, I'm the only child.

517
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:23,890
I thought so.

518
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:25,920
I don't think that was a compliment.

519
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:29,140
Haven't you ever wanted a younger sibling, hyung or noona?

520
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:31,380
You would've adored a younger sister like me.

521
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,840
It would've been so bothersome.

522
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:35,180
You would've gone crazy over how cute I am!

523
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:36,430
How can you say that about yourself?

524
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,640
Who else will?

525
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,670
It's not a fact!

526
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,730
It so is!

527
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,290
Use it all the way back.

528
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:47,810
Hey, it's raining!

529
00:35:47,810 --> 00:35:49,860
What's with him all of a sudden?

530
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,250
Let's go.

531
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:55,980
You're getting wet!
- No, I'm not!

532
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:58,360
You keep pushing it to my side.

533
00:35:58,360 --> 00:36:00,060
I'm fine!

539
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,670
That's how I became known as "The Eagle."

540
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,210
- Yong Il, hey.
- Yes.

541
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:28,730

544

Oh, you're here?

Hey, have this.

550
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,960
I called him here.

Hey, who'd answer that if you asked them this directly?

598

What are you talking about by special treatment?

606
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,950
She got out of training by lying.

607
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,560
Also, became the representative of the pep rally when she got in trouble for trespassing

Aren't these all special treatments in the end?

610
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,390
That's definitely the management team's fault.

611
00:40:56,390 --> 00:40:57,690
They shouldn't be doing that.

612
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:59,600
The seniors were wrong in doing that.

613
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,450
You have to be careful with those things.

614
00:41:01,450 --> 00:41:02,690
Of course, you need to be careful.

615
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,140
- Gosh, stay quiet, please.
- Now, now.

616
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,840
Just make sure not to have these things happen again.

00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,770
Yes, that's it. Drink now.

621
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,350
Aigoo, who do we have here?

622
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,190

00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,170
Hey, where did Ho Min go?

627
00:41:34,170 --> 00:41:37,020
He insisted that we needed to come to where the cheer squad was going.

628
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:39,560
He's been missing for a while now.

629
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,350
I'll go bring some more marshmallows.

630
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,630
Okay.

631
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:53,460
<i>Just leave it hanging for a while.</i>

632
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:57,690

633
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,790

Hey, Park Jung Woo!

I...

636
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,610
did cross the line the other day.

637
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,820
But you also did cross the line, honestly.

638
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:20,130
Right? So let's just get over it now.

639
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,020
Accidents keep happening, so

640
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,930
it's also better for the Cheer Squad

641
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:26,850
not to have even more rumors spread.

642
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:29,350
Besides the lighting accident,

643
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:32,030
were there any other accidents?

644
00:42:32,670 --> 00:42:36,170
No. You guys just have a lot going on these days.

645
00:42:49,130 --> 00:42:51,260
What are you—

646
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,660
What do you think about this woman?

647
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,020
Do you think she's normal?

648
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,230
Yes. At least more so than you.

649
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:06,040
Exactly!

650
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:11,810
Why is a normal woman who isn't even crazy going out with this a**hole?

651
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,610
Who's "this a**hole?"

652
00:43:13,610 --> 00:43:16,150
My a**hole of an ex-husband.

653
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:21,110
Darn!

654
00:43:21,110 --> 00:43:23,140
Wait— W-What should I do?

655
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,270
What should I do? Gosh, I'm f***ed!

656
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,740
He probably saw it, right?

657
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:29,710
He did, right?

658
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:32,750
He probably saw that I was stalking his Instagram. Right?

659
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,620
F***! Nothing's going well for me.

660

662
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:45,760
Would they know this?

663
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:48,460
That life is just constantly unbearable?

664
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:50,230
They wouldn't know that, right?

665
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:55,290
They probably have a false hope that things will get better. Right?

666
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,840
Should I spoil it for them?

667
00:43:56,840 --> 00:44:00,750
That life will always be unbearable!

668
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,850
Even if you don't bother to spoil it for them,

669
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:05,390
they would know, in my opinion.

670
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:09,570
I should've gotten one first, before him!

671
00:44:23,850 --> 00:44:26,340
You just need to meet a good person, too.

672
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:28,970
You think there are enough good men left

673
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:31,290
until it's my turn?

674
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,840
There will be...

675
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,960
because you're a good person.

676
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,600
Thank you, my friend.

677
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:49,360
I thought you were just a loser,

678
00:44:49,950 --> 00:44:52,970
but you do have a good eye for people.

679
00:45:01,070 --> 00:45:03,090
Should we kiss?

680
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:05,200
- Suddenly?
- Yes.

681
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:07,170
I suddenly want to do it.

682
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:09,230
Do you want to or not?

683
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:10,970
Well, I think...

684
00:45:10,970 --> 00:45:14,490
Maybe, I want to try.

685
00:45:30,830 --> 00:45:32,860
- Is there something there?
- No.

686
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:34,520
T-There's nothing there.

687
00:45:34,520 --> 00:45:36,730
Nothing. Nothing at all.

688
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,010

No, I'm not upset.

And you haven't received anything since?

805
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,840
But what happened with the accident two years ago?

806
00:52:54,840 --> 00:52:56,310

<i>A famous star in the Cheer Squad.</i>

816
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,340
<i>Everyone liked Yoo Min.</i>

817
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:33,110
<i>Until it was discovered that she was</i>

818
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:37,340
<i>secretly dating a newbie that year.</i>

819
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,410
<i>I fell over that time.</i>

820
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:47,640
<i>A rumor spread that Yoo Min favored that newbie.</i>

821
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,000
<i>What was for lunch today, again?</i>

822
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:56,670
<i>Yoo Min started to get ostracized.</i>

823
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:59,500
<i>And the bullying started to get worse.</i>

824
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:05,060
<i>In the end they crossed the line, and Yoo Min...</i>

825
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:09,290
<i>tried to leave the Cheer Squad.</i>

826
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:14,020
<i>But on her last day on stage,</i>

827
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:17,080
<i>an accident occurred during the rehearsal.</i>

828
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:32,580
Yoo Min took a leave of absence after that,

829
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:34,510
and disappeared.

830
00:54:34,510 --> 00:54:35,870
She disappeared?

831
00:54:35,870 --> 00:54:38,370
No one ever saw Yoo Min after that.

832
00:54:38,370 --> 00:54:40,080
And she couldn't be reached.

833
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:43,940
Then, did someone plan that light fixture accident?

834
00:54:43,940 --> 00:54:47,040
The cause of the rehearsal performance accident

835
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:48,980
was revealed to be...

836
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,570
a worn-out light fixture.

837
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:53,020
It was an accident.
