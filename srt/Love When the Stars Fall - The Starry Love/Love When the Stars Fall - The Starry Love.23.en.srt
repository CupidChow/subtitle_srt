21
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,990
Brother Wen Ren, I agreed to come here just to ask you a question.

22
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:58,600
How deep is your love for me?

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,750
Love is something we can't measure. It's...

24
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,760
- You should think it through before answering.
-You should think it through before answering.

25
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:06,120
- Heaven hears your words and bears witness.
-Heaven hears your words and bears witness.

26
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,860
If you are lying, you'll face divine punishment.

27
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:12,300
But...

28
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,890
<i>What are these people doing?</i>

29
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,810
<i>I shouldn't have trusted them.I should do it myself.</i>

30
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,770
Look.

31
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:39,280
Look, it's for you.

32
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,150
This umbrella is beautiful.

33
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:45,060
Do you like it?

34
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,470
This breeze is soothing and enchanting.

35
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:56,430
I think it's not the breeze's doing.

36
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,860
It's because of your presence.

37
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,240
<i>I was supposed to flirt with him,</i>

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,220
<i>why is it the other way around now?</i>

39
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:13,420
<i>She is blushing. That's cute.</i>

40
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,810
<i>No. A hunter must be patient.</i>

41
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:18,380
<i>I must take it easy.</i>

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:21,970
<i>At this rate, I'll fall in love before he does.</i>

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,320
S-Sorry. I misbehaved.

44
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,480
It doesn't matter. I'm happy today.

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:32,190
However, I prefer the way you looked when you taught me the game.

46
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,350
I just remember that I have something to do.

47
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,660
I'll come to you another day.

48
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,260
Yuexia...

49
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:51,790
Brother Wen Ren, I want this snack.

50
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,010
I want this. Come on, bring it here.

51
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,380
- I want the snack!
- Speak normally.

52
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,520
I don't have that big of an appetite.

53
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,800
Why did you come back? Did the plan fail?

54
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:05,560
If it failed, the four of you would be the cause of it.

55
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,030
- This is your fault!
- This is your fault!

56
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:08,880
Your fault. It's you two.

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,720
- It's your fault.
- Stop fighting.

58
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,340
We missed the best timing today.

59
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:14,120
We need a new plan.

60
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:16,020
Sorry, Sister-in-law.

61
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:18,080
Should we...

62
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,790
- Carry on with the act?
- Sure.

63
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,230
But we have to do it differently.

64
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:26,010
I need to think of a way to surpass him.

65
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,210
You can learn what your imperial father's consorts do to him all the time.

66
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,660
My imperial father...

67
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,870
Yeah, I could do what he always does.

68
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:43,920
- Not your imperial father! It's his consorts!
- Think about it.

69
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,870
My imperial father has always been an avid believer in fortune-telling.

70
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:50,740
Do you think Wen Ren is the same?

71

<i>[House of Colors]</i>

72
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:57,580
Wen Ren, your drawing skill has reached a new level.

73
00:04:57,580 --> 00:05:02,550
Look at this cypress. It's strong, divine, and lifelike.

74
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,150
Thank you for the compliments.

75
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:07,150
Young Master Wen Ren.

76
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,380
Sir, take a seat.

77
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,160
I'll be right back.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,710
Sure.

79
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,170
Yuexia.

80
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,340
I am so glad to see you again.

81
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,500
I left in a hurry the other day.

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,190
I've wanted to visit you again.

83
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:32,210
Are you free today?

84
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:35,100
Could you go to the marketplace with me?

85
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,740
Sure.

86
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,480
Yuexia, you go first.

87
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,010
Let's go.

88
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:50,880
Yuexia, you are quite an extraordinary girl.

89
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:57,330
How so? You have different sides to your personality.

90
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,890
You can be adorable, candid, and even mysterious sometimes.

91
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:03,230
I can't seem to see through you.

92
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:07,800
- Perfect!
- Let's check it out.

93
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,350
It's spot-on!

94
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,490
Why are there so many people here?

95
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:15,210
Sir, you are a true fortune-teller! Your prediction is totally right!

96
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:18,020
- Right. You know what? He is right about the time.
- Let's go.

97
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,760
- Let's have a look.
- I met my husband, down to the second!

98
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,230
From what I heard, you are leaving the Beast Realm tomorrow to travel to the four realms.

99
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:29,160
It's a shame for those who haven't heard your prediction.

100
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,430
They will regret it!

101
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:35,110
Let's have a look.

102
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:36,730
<i>Come on. Come.</i>

103
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:40,090
Those are just tricks to beguile us. The predictions are false.

104
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:42,300
We can only know if we try.

105
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,320
- Come on.
- Right, come on! Get your predictions.

106
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,660
Sit down.

107
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:50,730
Sir, could you tell us about our future?

108
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,000
Sure. Give me your hand.

109
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:01,770
You have less than two years to live!

110
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,940
Have you never experienced your youth?

111
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,820
Yes.

112
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,530
I have no family. I have no parents.

113
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,950
I was born this way.

114
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,910
You are a true deity!

115
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,720
You have millennia worth of life in you.

116
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,890
You were reborn into this world.

117
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:28,340
Judging by your physiognomy,

118
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:32,940
you have no desire for wealth or spiritual cultivation.

119
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,550
Your desire is to have the love of beauty.

120
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:42,180
You were born a sentimental lover.

121
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:46,530
Sir, please carry on.

122
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:50,640
You are surrounded by plenty of beautiful women.

123
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:54,820
But all of them don't share a deep connection with your fate.

124
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,030
They are not destined to be with you.

125
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,170
Hold on.

126
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:07,450
I can see that the destined one has come into your life!

127
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,980
Could it be this lady?

128
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,220
Wait.

129
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,380
Miss, could I take a look at your palm?

130
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,790
Yes.

131
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:25,530
The two of you are a match made in heaven!

132
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:32,600
I've traveled everywhere, but I've never seen such a strong connection!

133
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:39,710
I can see you shared a deep bond in your previous lifetime.

134
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:43,760
This lady's love for you is deep and true.

135
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:48,080
After your passing, she followed you into the next life.

136
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,420
She disregarded her own life and death.

137
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:57,520
Sir, I didn't think this would be a continuation of our previous lifetime.

138
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:00,230
But sadly...

139
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,460
- What is it?
- You are destined to be surrounded by beauties.

140
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:06,560
You will always be troubled by love, and there's seemingly no solution!

141
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,890
You must not give in to lust.

142
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,600
You must be sincere to make this relationship work

143
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,360
and continue your fate from your previous lifetime.

144
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,260
That's the only way to fulfill your wish.

145
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,640
Pull back before it's too late.

146
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,760
Otherwise, you will lose your true love.

147
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:27,870
The rest of your life will be down and out.

148
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:32,440
Everyone will turn their back on you. And soon enough, your life will be in grave danger.

149
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,900
Your remains will not be put to rest!

150
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:43,150
Anyway, the problem must be sorted out or you will be pestered by it.

151
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:49,130
You must employ forethought and caution.

152
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,700
- Yes.
- That's true.

153
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,720
Forethought and caution.

154
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:59,360
Don't let the thought trouble you. Whatever happens, I'll always be there for you.

155
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,800
I wonder where Kui’er is hiding.

156
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,870
Yingzhao's thorough search might...

157
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,400
Sir, look.

158
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,070
- Halt!
- Halt!

159
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:35,300
I am Crown Princess Yetan. I want to see Her Majesty.

160
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:44,710
Why did she turn herself in?

161
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,230
It's getting more difficult to read her mind.

162
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:53,390
Whatever reason she has to be here, you must keep her safe.

163
00:10:54,650 --> 00:10:58,010
Muster the soldiers from the Void Patrol Battalion.

164
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,750
Understood.

165
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:10,250
Your Majesty.

166
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:14,300
Tan’er, you should be tending to the wounded and the sick in Zhuoxin Hall.

167
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,230
What are you doing in the Beast Realm?

168
00:11:17,230 --> 00:11:19,040
I must confess.

169
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,990
Ever since I was married to the Void Realm, my sister Qingkui and I have been writing to each other.

170
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:29,570
To revive Empyrean Xuanshang, she came here to search for the three soul shards of him.

171
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:31,620
She offended you in the process.

172
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,210
I am truly concerned by her action.

173
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,130
She wants to revive Shaodian Youqin?

174
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:43,270
So, the person I saw was only his soul shard and not Shaodian Youqin himself.

175
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:46,510
That explains everything.

176
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,230
Shaodian Youqin had fallen.

177
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,720
His three soul shards fell into the human world.

178
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,120
Royal Mother.

179
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,140
This is our chance.

180
00:11:56,310 --> 00:11:59,490
The Void Realm and the Heavenly Realm are thousands of miles apart.

181
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:01,280
You and your sisters are mere humans.

182
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,280
How did you contact each other?

183
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,210
We were born from the same mother.

184
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:06,910
We share our sense of pain.

185
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:09,810
We communicate via writing on our skin.

186
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:12,310
Writing on your skin?

187
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:16,330
So, you know where the soul shards are.

188
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:21,940
I came to trade that information for my sister's life.

189
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:24,680
You're doing this only for your sister?

190
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,010
Yes.

191
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:28,560
You and Chaofeng are close.

192
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,520
Why not give him this information and help him become the crown prince?

193
00:12:38,210 --> 00:12:40,130
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

194
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:42,470
I was too blind to see it.

195
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:47,330
I thought Chaofeng was manipulative and would be a worthy crown prince.

196
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:49,660
But Chaofeng is defeated and lost his strength.

197
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:53,840
I must decide what is the best route for my future.

198
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:02,150
Princess Yetan...

199
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,130
Even you would fawn upon the powerful people.

200
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:13,560
Tan’er, I hope you don't mind.

201
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,660
It's my bad for spoiling Yun’er.

202
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:20,480
If you mean everything you said, your effort will not go unrewarded.

203
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,160
Take us to the soul shards.

204
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:25,260
I'll keep your sister safe and sound.

205
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:29,360
Much obliged.

206
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,640
Dismissed.

207
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,040
Who would have thought that?

208
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,130
Tan’er surprised me.

209
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,950
She is just an opportunist.

210
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:45,280
She isn't worthy of your praise.

211
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:51,230
I've only made it this far because I chose your royal father from all the Devils.

212
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:53,850
Tan’er reminds me of my younger self.

213
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,660
Her?

214
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,610
She is no match for you.

215
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:02,970
You need a smart woman to be your aide.

216
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:04,350
All right.

217
00:14:04,350 --> 00:14:06,010
It's just a princess.

218
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:11,980
If you don't like her, I'll get you better options after you become the crown prince.

219
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:17,710
Do you really believe the words of that fortune-teller?

220
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,490
He seemed confident with his prediction.

221
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:24,130
I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.

222
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,760
I should restrain myself a little.

223
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:35,230
By the way, keep the other ladies distracted for a couple of days, except Yuexia.

224
00:14:35,230 --> 00:14:36,310
Yes.

225
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:39,150
I didn't know you'd be so obsessed with Miss Yuexia.

226
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:42,310
Perhaps she really is the destined one for you.

227
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,610
How do I look?

228
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:46,250
As suave as ever!

229
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,400
Well said.

230
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,610
Everyone, follow me. Have a look inside.

231
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,940
I must tend to the other customers.

232
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:55,690
All right, good.

233
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,240
Sir.

234
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:24,600
Miss Liu Rong. Why are all of you here?

235
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,670
You can't simply walk away with so many love affairs.

236
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,520
Do you take us for fools?

237
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,510
Sir, what do we do now?

238
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:44,760
<i>Perhaps this is the danger the fortune-teller mentioned?</i>

239
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:47,470
Today, I'll snip you to pieces.

240
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:49,710
You'll never toy with another girl again!

241
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:52,330
Sisters, get him!

242
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:58,120
Sir...

243
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:00,000
<i>What is happening?</i>

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,500
What is going on?

245
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,740
I asked Di Lanjue to meet Fiery and Heartless.

246
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,260
- Is he on his way?
- Yes, he is.

247
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,810
Princess Ziwu thought she couldn't assist us, so she went with him.

248
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,620
Bad news, Sister-in-law!

249
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:12,070
I heard rumors on my way here.

250
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,950
Brother Wen Ren is surrounded by local women.

251
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:15,840
They were going to burn House of Colors to the ground!

252
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,140
What for?

253
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,660
It seems that words about his romantic affairs got out,

254
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:23,190
and all the girls he lied to came for a payback.

255
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,250
Let's go there now!

256
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,000
Wait for me.

257
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,071
Hurry up!

258
00:16:32,071 --> 00:16:36,740
<i>[House of Colors]</i>

259
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,450
Wen Ren!

260
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,010
Eldest Brother.

261
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,610
Wen Ren?

262
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,410
Yuexia...

263
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,140
What...

264
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:58,110
What is going on?

265
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:01,930
Miss. You should stay away from him.

266
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:07,790
I'm afraid he can't give you any happiness.

267
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:21,740
This is the Chaste Jade Belt.

268
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:24,640
It punishes debauched perverts like you!

269
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,890
If you ever think about having another love affair, this belt will tighten on its own.

270
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:31,770
It will feel worse than death for you.

271
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,380
<i>From now on, you will never win another woman's heart!</i>

272
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:40,880
<i>- Served you right!
- Served you right!</i>

273
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:48,060
Sister-in-law.

274
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:52,770
These women... they…

275
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:55,530
- Did the right thing.
- Did the right thing.

276
00:17:55,530 --> 00:17:56,570
Don't look so surprised.

277
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:00,720
If I didn't run into a jerk like him in search of the soul shards, I would've torn him apart.

278
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
With that said, how can he fall in love with this condition?

279
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,370
- Should I ask His Highness?
- Yes, you’re right.

280
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:08,330
Di Lanjue knows a great deal about magic items.

281
00:18:08,330 --> 00:18:09,370
Maybe he can help.

282
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,530
That can wait. Let him suffer a little more.

283
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,720
Let's go.

284
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,090
Sister-in-law…

285
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,300
Yuexia...

286
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,740
Sir...

287
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,490
Don't touch me!

288
00:18:33,190 --> 00:18:35,280
<i>[Standing his ground, he vented his anger.]</i>

289
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:44,730
<i>In volume three of "Romantic Heroic Chronicles", I somehow made Di Lanjue dead.</i>

290
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:46,920
<i>Should I resurrect him?</i>

291
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,100
<i>Cursed shards.</i>

292
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,330
<i>They all get to spend time with Tan’er.</i>

293
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,770
<i>And now I must guard him?</i>

294
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,400
<i>I should forge a blade and cut him down.</i>

295
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,160
<i>Should I use some flame spitting as well?</i>

296
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,640
<i>Would Ziwu be upset about it?</i>

297
00:19:09,530 --> 00:19:10,720
<i>Whatever.</i>

298
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>He is Money's friend, but the plot requires his death.</i>

299
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:19,180
<i>Why should I care if Ziwu is upset?</i>

300
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,200
<i>Fiery inferno and freezing cold.</i>

301
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,330
<i>Death by a thousand cuts! He'll die a horrid death!</i>

302
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:32,480
It's so peaceful and quiet.

303
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,960
My friend and family are here.

304
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,540
This has been my greatest day in the Human Realm.

305
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,010
Your Highness, we need your help.

306
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,090
Come with us.

307
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,710
Quick!

308
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,090
She's not removing the Chaste Jade Belt.

309
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:56,770
If that's the case, why does she need Di Lanjue's magic item?

310
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,160
We should go back.

311
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,440
If those women get ahead of us, we are...

312
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,890
What's the rush?

313
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,050
Wen Ren is now loathed everywhere. Every woman is staying away from him.

314
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:07,810
I'll head back when I'm ready.

315
00:20:09,670 --> 00:20:11,810
Well? Did you get Wen Ren?

316
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:15,400
Are we done with the search for soul shards?

317
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:16,720
Not yet.

318
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,020
You look too excited.

319
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:20,960
Wen Ren ran into some trouble.

320
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,920
I am the only one who would accept him now.

321
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:30,330
I need an item that can read his mind so I can become his only soulmate.

322
00:20:30,970 --> 00:20:34,640
You want to win his heart by knowing his thoughts.

323
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,300
Hey.

324
00:20:46,190 --> 00:20:47,890
Why is it always me?

325
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:49,720
- No way.
- Di Lanjue!

326
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,620
Ah...

327
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:53,400
Fine. I'll do it.

328
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
It's the same trick again.

329
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,500
This is the last time.

330
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,920
A pair of earrings can help one read another's thoughts?

331
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,160
Are you trying to fool us again?

332
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,850
Why don't you put them on?

333
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,500
I'll try.

334
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,200
<i>Qingkui, can you hear me?</i>

335
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:32,960
<i>Well done, A'Cai.</i>

336
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,810
<i>I wonder if he would make me some accessories?</i>

337
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,470
<i>One mistake costs me everything.</i>

338
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,060
<i>Ziwu now has control over me for the rest of my life.</i>

339
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>What did I do to these two in my previous lifetime?</i>

340
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:52,150
<i>Heaven! Please set me free!</i>

341
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,000
<i>Di Lanjue gets to be the hero again.</i>

342
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,300
<i>Why don't we have an item like this in Land of Nature?</i>

343
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:06,000
<i>Tan Tan. Let's grab some food later.</i>

344
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:12,500
I heard all of your thoughts.

345
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,600
We can overcome anything with this determination.

346
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:37,600
<i>I'll snip you to the pieces.</i>

347
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,400
<i>You'll never toy with another girl again!</i>

348
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:48,600
<i>You can't simply walk away with so many love affairs.</i>

349
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,600
<i>From now on, you will never win another woman's heart!</i>

350
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,400
<i>- Served you right!
- Served you right!</i>

351
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,200
Sir. Our staff has all left.

352
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,800
What do we...

353
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:10,800
A profusion of love gives birth to hate.

354
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:16,300
Demise by romance is my fate.

355
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:23,000
How did these women who were so affectionate and so gentle

356
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:27,200
harbor such an intense hatred toward me?

357
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,500
Sir, forget about those women.

358
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:33,100
The Chaste Jade Belt is getting tighter.

359
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,500
I want to play music.

360
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,000
I want to paint.

361
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:44,300
I must cast away all distractions and focus to survive this downfall.

362
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,600
<i>No! I must stop thinking about them!</i>

363
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:50,400
<i>Tranquility of nature outshines any form of beauty.</i>

364
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,200
<i>Nature...</i>

365
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,800
Shadowing mountains and endless oceans.

366
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,200
Think about those instead.

367
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,100
Perhaps that will alleviate the pain.

368
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,700
Yuexia! Is this a dream?

369
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
You are not in a dream.

370
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,800
I am really here.

371
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:09,000
Oh no. I look like a mess.

372
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:16,500
Whatever you become, I will never leave you.

373
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:19,800
I'll always be with you until you sever all romantic ties

374
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:23,600
and restrain yourself to become mine alone.

375
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:26,000
<i>Who would've thought that?</i>

376
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,300
<i>When everyone detests me, you're the only one I have.</i>

377
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Everyone turns their back on me.

378
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,400
My life is down and out.

379
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,300
The fortune-teller is right about everything.

380
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:49,900
The grave dangers and the horrid death will come to pass soon.

381
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:54,400
Yuexia. Aren't you worried you might be in harm's way?

382
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,800
Those words are human tricks to fool yourself.

383
00:25:58,800 --> 00:26:00,300
Do not believe them.

384
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:02,200
Have some tea.

385
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:11,800
<i>This cup seems to be a gift from Hong Bin.</i>

386
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
It broke.

387
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,300
Never mind.

388
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:41,000
I do have a method to rid you of those lingering feelings.

389
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,600
Are you interested?

390
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
What is it?

391
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,000
You are running out of paper.

392
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,300
Where do you keep the paper?

393
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,200
In the closet.

394
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:09,700
<i>Oh no.</i>

395
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:12,900
<i>The rouge left behind by other ladies is kept in the box.</i>

396
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,100
<i>If Yuexia sees it, she will be upset.</i>

397
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,800
This thing will only distract you.

398
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:30,100
I'll get rid of it for you.

399
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,200
Well thought, Yuexia.

400
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:39,400
<i>I can't let Yuexia see those women's undershirts in the closet.</i>

401
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,500
I'll burn these for you.

402
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,000
Sure.

403
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,500
<i>She seems to know my every thought.</i>

404
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,000
<i>I wish I could break his limbs, tear off his lips, and give him hundreds of slaps!</i>

405
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:12,200
<i>Judging by that look on her face, things aren't good.</i>

406
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,200
<i>All women want a loyal lover.</i>

407
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,700
<i>Yuexia is no exception.</i>

408
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:22,400
<i>Oh no. Maybe Yuexia is the one to give me a horrid death.</i>

409
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,800
<i>I should ask her to leave.</i>

410
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:25,800
Do you feel hungry?

411
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:26,700
What snack do you need?

412
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,900
I'll get it.

413
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,800
- I...
- Flower cookies, right?

414
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,000
I'll let the waiter prepare it.

415
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,700
Yuexia, you are brilliant.

416
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,600
I've never won a game the whole time.

417
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,100
<i>I know every move you will make.</i>

418
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,800
<i>How can I even lose?</i>

419
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,500
We'll continue tomorrow.

420
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,700
No.

421
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,400
I simply can't best you.

422
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,700
Did you notice anything?

423
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,400
After so many games of chess, your pain seems to have receded a lot.

424
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,800
You are right.

425
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:11,000
The belt is not as tight.

426
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,600
Yuexia.

427
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,000
Thank you.

428
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,600
<i>Thank you.</i>

429
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:31,300
<i>When I lost everything, you were willing to stand by me.</i>

430
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:34,600
<i>You'd even look past my wrongdoings.</i>

431
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,400
<i>Thank you.</i>

432
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:43,000
<i>You let me understand tranquil moments is far better than a life full of pleasures.</i>

433
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,600
<i>Thank you for understanding me.</i>

434
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,500
<i>One can know many in a lifetime, but very few can become soulmates.</i>

435
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:57,100
<i>To meet someone who knows me so well is more than enough for this life.</i>

436
00:29:57,100 --> 00:29:58,500
<i>Wen Ren.</i>

437
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:05,800
<i>Thank you for bringing me this heartwarming memory.</i>

438
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:10,100
<i>In the past, I wanted to become the biggest villain in the four realms.</i>

439
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,200
<i>But lately, for the first time ever,</i>

440
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:18,800
<i>I realized a different way of life wasn't all that bad.</i>

441
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,300
<i>For the first time ever,</i>

442
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:27,300
<i>I wondered if Empyrean Xuanshang would be as happy as you when he's resurrected.</i>

443
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:36,100
The vegetables today are fresh.

444
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:40,500
Why don't we have some stir-fried greens and fish in vinegar?

445
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:43,300
You always seem to know what I want.

446
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:46,400
Fish in vinegar sounds great. I'll do the cooking.

447
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:53,400
<i>I am too selfish.</i>

448
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,500
<i>I was so entranced by her company.</i>

449
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,900
<i>Unless I remove the Chaste Jade Belt, I can never give her happiness.</i>

450
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,200
When I was on the street earlier, I ran into Liu Rong.

451
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:17,300
Have you thought about asking her to get rid of the belt?

452
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,400
They hate me to the bones.

453
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,700
Why would they remove it for me?

454
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:34,000
If they learn that you've turned over a new leaf, they might change their mind.

455
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,500
You could apologize to them.

456
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,900
I'll go with you.

457
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:42,300
Yuexia. It's my doing.

458
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,300
So it's my responsibility.

459
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:46,200
I'll go on my own.

460
00:31:55,000 --> 00:32:00,100
Princess Yetan. My mother and I found the soul shard in the Beast Realm.

461
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,900
But we've been walking about the Human Realm for days.

462
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:06,800
Tell us now. Where is the soul shard?

463
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:09,400
Your Highness, calm down.

464
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,500
From what I've learned, my sister and her friends are weak.

465
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,200
They can't keep all three soul shards safe.

466
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,300
There is a village here called Yuewo Village.

467
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,400
There is a soul shard known as Fiery.

468
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,200
If you slay it, the glory is yours.

469
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,300
Well said.

470
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,000
But I must warn you.

471
00:32:29,850 --> 00:32:33,340
If the shard is not at Yuewo Village,

472
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:37,040
I will make you pay dearly.

473
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,440
Yes.

474
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,890
Take us there.

475
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:49,550
<i>Tan'er, I can't use magic.</i>

476
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:54,770
<i>The only thing I can do is stall the army of the Void Realm.</i>

477
00:32:56,770 --> 00:33:00,970
Judging by the direction they are headed, they are going to Yuewo Village.

478
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:07,500
Faking a surrender, deceptions, where did she learn those from?

479
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,690
She is putting her life at risk.

480
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:14,160
You are right. Where did she learn those from?

481
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:17,050
Shut it. Follow them.

482
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:21,140
Heed my advice. Don't be a hero. I'll take our men there.

483
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,430
It's all right.

484
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:29,020
Follow me.

485
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:36,390
Going to the field?

486
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,380
Water! We have water now!

487
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:10,180
Voidwalkers. Voidwalkers! Run! Voidwalkers are here!

488
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:32,130
Are you the chief?

489
00:34:32,130 --> 00:34:33,620
Yes.

490
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:36,430
Sir, don't be afraid.

491
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:41,380
Have you seen the man in this picture?

492
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:45,030
Isn't that the fire demon?

493
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,570
Fire...

494
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:48,020
It's the Fire Demon!

495
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,090
Where is this demon?

496
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:50,210
It left.

497
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:52,450
- It left...
- When?

498
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:55,810
Around a month ago. It left the village.

499
00:34:56,350 --> 00:34:58,620
A month ago?

500
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:04,980
How dare you trick us with outdated news!

501
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,850
Tan'er.

502
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,670
You are a smart person.

503
00:35:09,670 --> 00:35:12,620
You know the consequences of tricking me!

504
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:16,360
No, Your Majesty. I didn't mean to trick you.

505
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:20,770
Maybe... Maybe my sister was alert. Maybe she's hidden the shard...

506
00:35:20,770 --> 00:35:22,890
Spare me the excuses!

507
00:35:22,890 --> 00:35:27,510
If you dare fool me, I'll make sure your sister is torn into pieces.

508
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:31,160
I wouldn't dare. Please show her mercy.

509
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:34,020
I can show mercy.

510
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:37,300
You can contact her via writing on your skin.

511
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:44,000
I want you to contact her now. Find out where the shard is.

512
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,880
Scared of the pain?

513
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,710
I'll do it for you!

514
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,680
Your Highness!

515
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:31,250
Run! Run for your life!

516
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:33,140
Run!

517
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,150
Don't be afraid.

518
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,220
Chaofeng!

519
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:46,150
You knew using this technique would trigger the poisoning. Do you really want to die?

520
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,320
Chaofeng!

521
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,120
After them!

522
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:45,400
Don't bother. Chaofeng overexerted himself with that technique.

523
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,370
He will soon die of rupturing vessels and meridians.

524
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:52,930
But that sneaky Yetan had me fooled.

525
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,660
Return to the Beast Realm now. The soul shard must still be there.

526
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,630
Sir!

527
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:04,860
The poison is spreading quickly. He is dying!

528
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:10,240
Leave now! Forget about me!

529
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:15,410
Even now, you still want me to leave?

530
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:20,630
You kept me in the dark for so long, but I never doubted your love for me.

531
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:26,490
I swapped the carriages. I am the nemesis you hate the most! My fate is none of your concerns!

532
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:28,160
Yes!

533
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:34,530
You made a mistake and almost got me killed. In that case, you owe me your life!

534
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:38,020
You can't make me leave until you get my forgiveness!

535
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,600
Let's go to the Prince's Mansion!

536
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,260
Sir...

537
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:43,030
- No!
- Come with me!

538
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,540
No!

539
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:47,260
Sir... Let's go.

540
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,150
Coming.

541
00:40:21,110 --> 00:40:23,270
Miss Liu Rong...

542
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:25,310
How dare you come here again?

543
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,500
Listen up. I will never go back to you!

544
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,250
I won't let you fool me again!

545
00:40:30,250 --> 00:40:33,650
Miss Liu Rong... That is not why I came.

546
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,590
I came to apologize.

547
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:39,430
Please forgive my wrongdoings.

548
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,690
You're not here to win me back?

549
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:44,110
I've never loved anyone so deeply!

550
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,810
I thought you and I were meant for each other.

551
00:40:47,810 --> 00:40:50,800
But you betrayed my love.

552
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,410
You know what?

553
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:56,210
I can never love anyone ever again!

554
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,040
It was my fault.

555
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:03,910
But I've realized how wrong I was.

556
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:06,510
I really mean to apologize.

557
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,750
Fine. I'll gather all the ladies whose hearts you broke.

558
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:13,410
See if they would forgive you!

559
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:32,520
