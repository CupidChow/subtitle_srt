00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,500
Princess Yetan! Prince Chaofeng realized his mistake.

22
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,900
It was wrong to injure his brother.

23
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:56,600
He's reflected on his mistake.

24
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,900
Please don't be mad at him anymore.

25
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:05,400
Please have mercy and cure him. Cure him of this poison.

26
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:17,700
Tell His Highness he should apologize to the First Prince, not me.

27
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,200
Judging by the tone, you are upset, Your Highness.

28
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,800
If you wouldn't cure him of that poison, why are you still grinding the herbs?

29
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,400
I...

30
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,600
He disrespected his brother.

31
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,600
And now he is behaving like a jerk.

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:37,700
I want him to stay green till the end of time!

33
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,400
You can stop denying it now.

34
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,800
Let's go.

35
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,600
Princess Yetan,

36
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,100
His Highness used his inner strength and managed to neutralize the poison on his face.

37
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,800
But the rest of his body is turning green.

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,200
Your Highness. You haven't spoken a word.

39
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,900
What is the meaning of this?

40
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,000
Your Highness. His Highness is here to apologize.

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,300
Can't you tell?

42
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Is this how he usually apologizes?

43
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,600
A moment, Your Highness.

44
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,200
Your Highness. His Highness prepared this for you.

45
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,400
These are the most popular delicacies in the human world.

46
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,300
Please give them a try.

47
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,800
Consider this a gesture of apology.

48
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,300
Your Highness. You haven't done anything that wronged me.

49
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:39,400
I poisoned you to even the score for the First Prince.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,000
So I don't need your gifts.

51
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,600
If you realize your mistake, go to your brother and ask for his forgiveness.

52
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:57,700
If he forgives you, I will cure you.

53
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,000
I think making you upset was the greatest mistake.

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Punish me however you want.

55
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,100
But don't simply ask me to apologize to Wu Dai.

56
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,500
You should hear me out.

57
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,500
That's right, Your Highness.

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,100
His Highness has treated you well.

59
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:15,600
Be mad all you want, at least give him a chance to explain it to you.

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,500
There is a meteor shower tonight.

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,400
There will be a sky full of stars.

62
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,000
You could go to the stargazing area and admire the moon together.

63
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,800
While you're there, you can have a heart-to-heart conversation.

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,000
Let's clear up this misunderstanding.

65
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
Greetings, Prince Qingheng.

66
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,200
How have you been in Tianpa Hall lately?

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,300
Her Highness takes great care of me.

68
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,700
All is well.

69
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,200
I'm glad to hear that.

70
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:05,800
Don't be scared.

71
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,800
The meteor shower can't hurt you.

72
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,400
I've never seen a meteor shower before.

73
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,600
I was startled.

74
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,000
I've embarrassed myself.

75
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,200
It was nothing.

76
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,900
If you're scared, I can stay here and keep you company.

77
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,400
Look at that.

78
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:44,000
- Your Highness.
- A'Cai.

79
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,700
Thanks.

80
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,200
A'Cai. Look. Those are stars.

81
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:55,500
You're a dog who's seen the meteor shower in the Heavenly Realm.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,000
<i>I've seen my fair share of the world.</i>

83
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,600
<i>What's the big deal?</i>

84
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:01,000
What's wrong?

85
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,100
The stars are in the sky.

86
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,000
You can't reach them.

87
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,400
What is it?

88
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,400
Do you need to use the bathroom?

89
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,600
I can take you there.

90
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,600
You can do it here.

91
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,000
I'll clean it up for you.

92
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,800
<i>I don't feel like urinating.</i>

93
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,900
Are you embarrassed?

94
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,000
<i>Stop it!</i>

95
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,600
<i>Hey...</i>

96
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,900
<i>What have I done here?</i>

97
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,600
<i>I'm the graceful Prince of the Beast Realm.</i>

98
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,100
<i>I just peed in public.</i>

99
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,100
<i>And the girl wiped my bottom!</i>

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,300
Good boy.

101
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,500
Let go.

102
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
Let go of me.

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I forgot. This is the realm's barrier.

104
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
It's freezing cold.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,600
I wanted to leave the crowd and forgot.

106
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,400
<i>Stop nagging.</i>

107
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,300
<i>Thaw me already.</i>

108
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,300
Calm down. It's a mere layer of ice.

109
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,600
I can undo it for you right away.

110
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,700
Princess?

111
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:37,400
Your Highness?

112
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,200
Are you all right?

113
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,300
I'm fine.

114
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,800
If you have anything to explain, do tell.

115
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,900
There is no need for tricks.

116
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,400
You misunderstood.

117
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,000
This place is freezing cold.

118
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,400
I cast a barrier to keep the cold at bay, but you are still human.

119
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,900
You should put on thicker clothes.

120
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,400
A meteor!

121
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,500
Princess, slow down!

122
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Shui, this way.

123
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,400
Take a seat.

124
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,200
It's beautiful.

125
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,100
Please stay under this umbrella.

126
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,000
You could get frostbite.

127
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Did you get frostbite? It's my fault.

128
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,200
It's fine.

129
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,880
I'll put some ointment on it.

130
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,460
Yes.

131
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,400
You should stand inside.

132
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,700
It's cold outside.

133
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,700
Your honor comes first.

134
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,600
I can handle the cold.

135
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,100
They share an umbrella on a stroll under the starry sky.

136
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,600
He keeps his distance to keep her honor unblemished.

137
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:39,400
I expected nothing less from the man who knows women the best in the Void Realm!

138
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,500
Princess, I...

139
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,400
A meteor shower!

140
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,000
They are beautiful.

141
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,000
The night sky is beautiful,

142
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,800
but it's no match for your charm.

143
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:16,000
If this picturesque scenery could clear your mind of worries, I am content.

144
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,000
Princess...

145
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,600
Do you know why this place was used for stargazing?

146
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,200
This land belonged to the Fuzhu clan.

147
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:41,400
A millennia ago, my royal father wiped out the Fuzhu clan to unify the borders.

148
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,600
He left a beautiful girl alive to serve him.

149
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,700
And that was my consort mother.

150
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,400
I was born shunned.

151
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,200
I was an outcast.

152
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:58,500
When I was 1,000 years old, I was grounded in Luowei Grotto.

153
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,900
I lived worse than a beggar.

154
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:08,500
One winter, I was sending my mother some clothes for the cold.

155
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,300
But I was stuck in a hole.

156
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:14,600
He was stuck there an entire night.

157
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:16,700
Wait, what's with the hole?

158
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:20,000
He got stuck there to tease the new servant maid who had just arrived!

159
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,600
Keep your voice down.

160
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,000
He had to tell the story this way to earn her sympathy and get her to cure him.

161
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,000
Look.

162
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,500
I didn't know you had lived through such hardship.

163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,200
I grew up without my mother.

164
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,500
I can understand your love for your mother.

165
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,300
It's all in the past.

166
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,900
I'm all right now.

167
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:46,400
I know I annoy you. But I didn't know you'd get me killed because of it!

168
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,400
It was my mistake.

169
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:53,100
I forgot you were human and couldn't withstand the extreme temperature.

170
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:53,800
I am...

171
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,400
There's more?

172
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Stand still.

173
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,500
That should do it.

174
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,700
Ziwu told me the meteor shower only happens once every 10,000 years.

175
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,700
I was hoping to watch the meteor shower and make a wish.

176
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,000
But who knows?

177
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
I suffered through the extreme cold and got hit by your stupid star.

178
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,100
My birth is tied to the falling stars.

179
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:33,300
It should be possible to grant you a wish.

180
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,500
Don't be afraid.

181
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,400
That meteor is yours.

182
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,900
Make a wish.

183
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,400
Do it before it's too late.

184
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,400
I want to be the strongest in the four realms

185
00:13:56,400 --> 00:14:02,100
and conquer the realms so the four rulers will bow to me and do my bidding!

186
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Why did you remove the meteor?

187
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,200
Your wish is outrageous.

188
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,400
Arrogance is a fatal flaw for those seeking enlightenment.

189
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:13,600
You can work hard to become stronger, but you must do so with training, not shortcuts.

190
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,000
I could have made another wish.

191
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,500
Why did you remove the meteor?

192
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,700
Do you really think the meteor made your wish come true?

193
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,500
What else could it be?

194
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,200
It wasn't the meteor that made the wish come true.

195
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,200
It's the deity in charge of the meteor.

196
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:34,700
If someone's wish comes true, it's the deity in charge's doing after hearing the wish.

197
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,400
Are you saying I can make a wish to you?

198
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,200
If your wish is something outrageous, I won't make it come true.

199
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,400
It won't be.

200
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:49,200
You can easily make this wish come true.

201
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,800
What is it?

202
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,600
Fine.

203
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:01,800
You want me to undo the Iridescent Eyes for you.

204
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,400
That's easy for you.

205
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,500
You can't go back on your words.

206
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,200
If you behave the same way after I undo it for you, I'll cast it on you once again.

207
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,100
Do it.

208
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,000
Undo this thing. Undo it.

209
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,100
Did you do it?

210
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:21,800
Are you done yet?

211
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Why aren't you saying anything?

212
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,500
Undo it. Quick.

213
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,500
I can't undo it.

214
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,500
You attempted to undo it too many times.

215
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,600
That triggered its security measure.

216
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,800
It can't be undone within a month.

217
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
<i>One month?</i>

218
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,100
<i>This thing will have tortured me to death after a month.</i>

219
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,600
<i>Who knows how much suffering is Qingkui going through?</i>

220
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:49,100
I doubt there is anyone with worse misfortune than mine in the four realms.

221
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:53,700
In the first 18 years of my life, nothing ever went well for me.

222
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:56,500
Even the wedding was a mess.

223
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,000
I got sent to Heaven.

224
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,500
I wear this item of restriction and get tormented by it.

225
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,800
I even got hit by a star!

226
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,000
When I made a wish...

227
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:10,200
I'm surprised I'm still alive at this point.

228
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,500
Do you see that star?

229
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,400
It's called the Rooftop Swallow Mansion.

230
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,600
Greatness begets danger.

231
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,000
It's at the tail of the Black Tortoise in the north, shining like the last soldier standing.

232
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,900
Death is almost a certainty.

233
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:41,300
When the star shines, it's considered a bad omen.

234
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,600
A star of disaster.

235
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,900
We are very much alike.

236
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:49,100
The stars have no attachment to the world.

237
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,600
The omens were written by the people.

238
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,600
So how is it a star of disaster?

239
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,100
People of the Rooftop Shadow Mansion lead a life of hardship.

240
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,000
But they are resourceful and brave.

241
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,800
In spite of the obstacles, they prevail.

242
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:09,200
Therefore, if these people can uphold their principle and act accordingly,

243
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:13,300
Meaning this is how life is supposed to be.

244
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,600
We have suffered a grim fate, but it's possible to realize our wishes?

245
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,900
Yes.

246
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:23,200
I think you are the same as the Rooftop Swallow Mansion.

247
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:27,100
You seem rebellious, but you were born with outstanding talents.

248
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:31,600
If you can correct your mistakes, you will earn the four realms' respect.

249
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:54,300
Tonight, I grant you the Rooftop Swallow Mansion.

250
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:08,100
May your life be like the stars, shining bright in the sky, and having no fear on earth.

251
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:12,900
May you earn respect and admiration and be able to withstand ordinariness.

252
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:21,600
Use this gesture to put it away or return it to the sky.

253
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,500
Let me take you back.

254
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:39,080
If we were going back that way, I'd rather die here.

255
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't want to trouble you with this journey.

256
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,100
It belonged to my mother.

257
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:21,300
It's yours now.

258
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:24,000
This is too precious.

259
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,400
I can't possibly...

260
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,500
It's been waiting for its master.

261
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,000
That's you.

262
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:48,500
I pity Consort Xue for her fate.

263
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,600
But that is all the more reason

264
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,400
to lead an honest and righteous life for her.

265
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,700
Why did you injure the First Prince?

266
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,400
I hit him because...

267
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,900
It's because...

268
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,700
That jerk was pestering you. I couldn't stand it.

269
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:21,000
We met each other and survived the perils together before you met him.

270
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,900
He can't act as though you two are close!

271
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,400
I don't want you to draw attention and expose your true identity.

272
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:28,100
I also fear...

273
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,800
I fear that you care about him

274
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,900
the same way you care about me.

275
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,700
Princess? Princess!

276
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:49,700
Haichao! Haichao!

277
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,400
He's calling me.

278
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,900
Princess?

279
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,300
Head back to Zhuoxin Hall!

280
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,100
All right.

281
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,000
<i>Tan Tan. Like me, you've suffered the scheme of the immortals.</i>

282
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,440
<i>Don't worry. I'll figure out a way to help you escape.</i>

283
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,880
These youngsters don't mind showing their affection at all.

284
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,080
They have become even more fond of each other.

285
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,700
Your plan worked wonders, Celestial Mother.

286
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:36,080
Her Highness is back. I must return to Tianpa Hall to serve her.

287
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:37,820
Wait.

288
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,920
The night is cold. You might not make it.

289
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,660
Take this cape. It'll keep you warm.

290
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,420
Prince Qingheng...

291
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,460
Don't get the wrong idea. Simply accept my kindness.

292
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,400
Are you feeling better now?

293
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,960
I want to tell you I feel warm now.

294
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:53,660
I feel the warmth throughout my entire body. Thanks.

295
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,000
Don't mention it.

296
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,400
You're awake.

297
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,980
I felt this sudden cold and heat.

298
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:34,780
Maybe I couldn't adjust to the climate. I'm sorry if I worried you.

299
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:38,440
Do you remember what happened?

300
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,200
Just now?

301
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:49,260
I remember you and Consort Xue had a hard time surviving in the Void Realm.

302
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,520
And?

303
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,020
And...

304
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:03,920
I haven't cured you of the poison.

305
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,500
You were in a tough position. You must have had your reason to do so.

306
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:11,600
I was reckless. I'll cure you right away.

307
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,080
What's wrong?

308
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,940
The thought of Consort Xue living in the cold

309
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:40,700
with no medicine and warm clothes makes me worry about her.

310
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,200
Could you take me to Luowei Grotto? Let me look after her.

311
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,340
Those are in the past. Your life here isn't exactly easy.

312
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,760
Do not get involved in the old feud.

313
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,400
That is not right.

314
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:55,620
You said Consort Xue lived worse than a beggar.

315
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,640
And she was grounded.

316
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,480
She was tormented and exhausted. What if she falls ill?

317
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:03,720
Did I mention that?

318
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,880
Treatments for sickness must not be delayed!

319
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,400
I'll grab my kit and head for Luowei Grotto.

320
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,900
No, you can't!

321
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:16,780
Let's not delay any longer. She suffers from many illnesses.

322
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:19,900
These herbs aren't enough for her. We need more.

323
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,400
All right.

324
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:27,560
Haichao!

325
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,640
Go to my mother.

326
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,680
Qingkui wants to see my mother.

327
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:41,000
Your plan backfired hard this time.

328
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,420
- Go now!
- All right.

329
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:02,860
Consort Xue.

330
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,480
What is it?

331
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,800
His Highness is bringing a girl here.

332
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,080
He's always fooled around with girls.

333
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,600
What's the big deal?

334
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,960
Hold on. They are coming here?

335
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,880
- Yes.
- He hasn't brought any girl here.

336
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:26,200
Has he finally understood my concern?

337
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,840
He is finally settling down.

338
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,320
Is he starting a family?

339
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,820
It's complicated.

340
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:37,000
But this time, His Highness wants to make the girl fall for him.

341
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,760
He told her when he was a boy,

342
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:43,540
you were imprisoned in the cold,

343
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:49,700
mentally tormented, living without enough food and warm clothes, and suffering from illnesses.

344
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,040
The girl insists on treating you.

345
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:59,720
They will likely arrive within the next hour.

346
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,680
This is serious.

347
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,880
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

348
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,340
Do I have to pretend to be a bedridden patient?

349
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:18,120
Cover all the entrances with cobwebs!

350
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,320
- Yes!
- Cover the floor with dry leaves!

351
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,420
Get more leaves!

352
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,740
This place looks bleak.

353
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,640
I feel sorry for Consort Xue.

354
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,040
They are moldy.

355
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,080
Of course, she will fall sick from eating these.

356
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,920
Consort Mother.

357
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:10,160
Consort Mother. I brought you a healer.

358
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,880
Are you...

359
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,640
Where did you get this healer?

360
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,240
I am Liguang Yetan. Greetings, Consort Xue.

361
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,520
<i>Yetan?</i>

362
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,080
<i>You brought Princess Yetan here?</i>

363
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,640
<i>Yes.</i>

364
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,000
<i>You should've known better!</i>

365
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,800
<i>She is the future crown princess.</i>

366
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,080
<i>You are wooing her with an ulterior motive.</i>

367
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,860
<i>I thought you were turning over a new leaf.</i>

368
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,000
<i>I was willing to put on an act for you.</i>

369
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,760
<i>Just help me once. Consort Mother, please.</i>

370
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,920
<i>Help me out this time.</i>

371
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,240
Consort Mother, the healer is here. Don't be afraid.

372
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:09,820
Consort Xue. I dabble in medicine.

373
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:12,940
I could help with your ailments.

374
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:26,120
Consort Mother, you will get well.

375
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,340
You were married to the Void Realm as a human.

376
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,320
Your life here couldn't have been easy.

377
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:42,340
You had to rely on a prince for your survival.

378
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:46,280
But now, the Crown Prince hasn't been appointed.

379
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:52,660
You must keep your eyes sharp and not fall for anyone's deception.

380
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,180
Thank you for your concern.

381
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:59,860
I think women can do more than rely on men.

382
00:29:59,860 --> 00:30:04,940
Conflicts are constantly happening in the Void Realm, and many mask their ill intent with pleasant words,

383
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:10,400
but as long as I stay independent, I can earn a place here.

384
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:14,460
You are very young to have such determination.

385
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,660
That's truly hard to come by.

386
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,120
Consort Xue. The headache ailing you is a delicate matter.

387
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,380
You must have suffered a great deal.

388
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,900
Thankfully, it's easy to treat the headache.

389
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:30,900
Princess, do you really have a way to treat this headache?

390
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,020
I'll start brewing the medicine for you.

391
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,520
Don't worry. You will make a full recovery.

392
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,250
The headache has haunted me for over a thousand years.

393
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:43,450
I can finally rid myself of it.

394
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,400
Thank you, Princess.

395
00:30:46,580 --> 00:30:49,720
I am grateful to you, Princess.

396
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,040
Haichao. Escort her back to Zhuoxin Hall.

397
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,440
Yes

398
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:59,380
I should pay you a visit and thank you.

399
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,940
Consort Mother.

400
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:04,680
We owe this kindness to her.

401
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,060
Let me escort her back to Zhuoxin Hall.

402
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,080
Feng'er, we haven't met in quite a while.

403
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,880
We have a lot of catching up to do.

404
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,580
You should stay.

405
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,480
Yes, Your Highness. Stay here.

406
00:31:19,480 --> 00:31:21,520
I'll escort the Princess.

407
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:27,320
Haichao should go, then.

408
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,520
Take care, Princess.

409
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:31,860
I'll take my leave now.

410
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,880
This way, please.

411
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:59,200
With this diaper, I won't have to clean up after you.

412
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:03,240
<i>I must help Tan Tan get out of this prison.</i>

413
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,560
<i>I can't stand another day of this disgraceful life.</i>

414
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
What's wrong?

415
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,640
Are you hungry?

416
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:18,020
<i>I can handle the humiliation, but I can't let Tan Tan suffer that!</i>

417
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,460
Drink up.

418
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:25,860
I thought you loved the rock fluid from stalactite.

419
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,760
Why aren't you eating today?

420
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,520
<i>This is my chance!</i>

421
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,540
A'Cai!

422
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,000
A'Cai!

423
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,750
Hey.

424
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,180
Aren't you going to Shangshu Academy?

425
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:18,360
I have some spells to master. I should get working.

426
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:20,520
All right already, drop the act.

427
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,220
You've been smiling at the rock like a fool. I saw it.

428
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:25,940
This is no ordinary rock. It's called...

429
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:28,020
Forget it, I won't tell you. You wouldn't understand.

430
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:30,640
Why wouldn't I understand? I understand very well.

431
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:36,520
Had I not been afraid of the meteor shower, I should have gone with you to find out what happened.

432
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:38,400
Tell me.

433
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:40,400
Look at me.

434
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:45,620
Are you in love with Shaodian Youqin?

435
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:58,320
♫ <i>I have this sudden yearning to hear you say, "I like you"</i> ♫

436
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,460
♫ <i>How do I put this feeling into words and foreshadow my little excitements?</i> ♫

437
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,880
Hey.

438
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,880
Nonsense.

439
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:09,700
I just thought that Heartless Shaodian was somewhat considerate.

440
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:12,320
I was wrong about him.

441
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,220
Fine.

442
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:22,040
I was a bit touched by his moves.

443
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,600
But I am not in love with him!

444
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:28,160
Fine. If you fell for Shaodian Youqin, my master would be heartbroken.

445
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,260
At least you have a conscience.

446
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,280
What was that?

447
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,400
Your Highness!

448
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,000
Tan Tan!

449
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:54,200
Tan Tan! I've finally found you!

450
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,280
You outright ignored me.

451
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:01,160
When did you get here? W-What happened to you?

452
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,360
I...

453
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,360
It's complicated. I'll explain later.

454
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:15,080
This realm is far more horrible than I thought.

455
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:19,120
Tan Tan. Don't worry. I'll help you escape from this place.

456
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,000
Man Man. Let's go.

457
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:22,460
Go.

458
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,600
I can't leave.

459
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:26,480
Why not?

460
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:29,400
That Heartless Shaodian used...

461
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,900
It's nothing.

462
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,980
It's nothing.

463
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,760
What did he do to you?

464
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:42,980
He...

465
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,060
Did he...

466
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,900
Shaodian Youqin...

467
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,680
Shaodian Youqin! Show yourself!

468
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,400
Shaodian Youqin! Shaodian Youqin!

469
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,540
Why did you kick me?

470
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:01,880
That cursed jerk used the Iridescent Eyes on me!

471
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,460
When I break the rules here or badmouth him, I feel this excruciating pain.

472
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,760
To take me with you, you must undo this thing.

473
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,940
You heard His Highness. It will be gone after one month.

474
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:21,140
You two can escape together, and I'm tagging along!

475
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,260
<i>Where should we go for the next month?</i>

476
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,600
<i>What if that woman catches me?</i>

477
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:31,000
No. One month is too long.

478
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,500
Maybe you haven't heard.

479
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:38,320
I've gone through so much humiliation to find Tan Tan.

480
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,020
I was... I...

481
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:44,120
You're right. The rules here are strict.

482
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:47,700
You're from the Beast clan. And you spent quite a while here.

483
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,200
You must have been through a lot.

484
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,320
Di Lanjue. Thank you.

485
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,300
I said, "Thank you."

486
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,540
Oh, no. Oh, no.

487
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,540
Why are you thanking me?

488
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,140
<i>- Your Highness!

492

<i>Were you abandoned here by someone too?</i>

493
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,440
Thank you for not treating me like a walking disaster as the others did.

494
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,400
You kept me company in the darkest days.

495
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,780
Without you, I wouldn't have made it this far.

496
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:47,020
Hold on. I have a bad feeling about this. Stop it.

497
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,800
- Which is why we can be sworn siblings.
- I order you to shut up now!

498
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,780
- You kept asking me to marry you. I kept rejecting you.
- No! I can't hear you!

499
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,220
It means I will never marry you.

500
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,880
Today, to spare you from further suffering, I'll make it clear once again.

501
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,780
You and I can become sworn siblings for life!

502
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:22,800
Oh, no. Stop it.

503
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,400
That is the only possibility.

504
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,760
Be good.

505
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:40,840
Maybe the right person is looking for you somewhere.

506
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,860
Don't be so despair.

507
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:49,900
Tan Tan.

508
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:52,000
You didn't even hesitate to reject me.

509
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,860
Are you in love with Shaodian Youqin?

510
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,700
That heartless jerk?

511
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:59,920
I couldn't care less about that jerk.

512
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,440
Take a look. Do I look like someone who would be bound by love and affection?

513
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:05,620
Do I look like...

514
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,780
Was that... Was that a warning to you for lying?

515
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,780
There's more to this anomaly.

516
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,980
What is going on?

517
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:31,200
Your Highness! What is happening?

518
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,400
Who is this?

519
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:41,480
He is my master. He is dropping by for a visit.

520
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
This is...

521
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,980
Trouble in Guixu!

522
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:54,600
Man Man! Quick! Send a messenger bird to the Beast clan.

523
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,500
- Make sure my parents are safe.
- Yes!

524
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,600
Tan Tan, your heart...

525
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,640
Is it going to explode?

526
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:10,040
Your Highness. Are you getting punished by the Iridescent Eyes for planning something ill?

527
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:13,200
If I would get punished, I would have been in pain.

528
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:19,740
If it's the ultimate item, this anomaly must be related to its master.
