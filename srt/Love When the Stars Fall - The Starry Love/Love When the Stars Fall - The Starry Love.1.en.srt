00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,000
<i>[Episode 1]</i>

20
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,580
<i>At the origin of time, every creature from the four realms was given life by purity and impurity.</i>

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:00,080
<i>Chaos, however, wished to destroy the world.</i>

22
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:06,900
<i>Fortunately, the immortals in the Heavenly Realm risked their lives</i>

23
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:10,840
<i>and sealed Chaos in Guixu.</i>

24
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,380
<i>Unbeknownst to everyone, </i>

25
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:17,300
<i>the sacred tree of Dongqiu, Ganoderma Vein, had its roots so deep into the ground</i>

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,480
<i>that it nourished itself with Chaos.</i>

27
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:23,200
<i>Thus blossomed a Twin Flower that can absorb both purity and impurity</i>

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,220
<i>and who doubles as a key to Guixu.</i>

29
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:32,000
<i>For peace and harmony, the four realms worked together</i>

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,700
<i>and razed Dongqiu to the ground in an attempt to destroy the Twin Flower.</i>

31
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,840
<i>However, the spiritual essence of the Twin Flower survived.</i>

32
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
<i>After ten thousand years, it reincarnated</i>

33
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,560
<i>as the descendants of the Human Realm’s empress.</i>

34
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,540
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, push.

35
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,800
Push, Your Majesty.

36
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,140
Your Majesty.

37
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,860
Your Majesty, push.

38
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:39,120
Your Majesty. Your Majesty, push.

39
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:53,280
<i>[18 Years Later]</i>

40
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,660
I envy those who serve Princess Qingkui.

41
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,320
Unlike us who have to work for the jinx, Yetan.

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,380
Aren't both of the princesses from the imperial bloodline?

43
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,960
You are new here, so you don't know about this.

44
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,220
<i>These two princesses were born at the same time, but they have different fates.</i>

45
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:30,740
<i>Princess Qingkui is the eldest daughter of His Majesty.</i>

46
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,620
<i>She was born with auspicious signs,</i>

47
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:36,080
<i>and ever since she was young, she was given the title of Empyrean Consort.</i>

48
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,480
<i>She is the symbol of grace and elegance, the epitome of queendom.</i>

49
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,080
Second Princess Yetan is the opposite.

50
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:46,800
<i>She will be the Crown Princess of the Void.</i>

51
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,400
<i>Apparently, she was born with ominous signs.</i>

52
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:56,320
<i>The late Empress passed away after giving birth to her and her wet nurse died mysteriously too.</i>

53
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:01,200
That's why His Majesty kept her in Zhaolu Hall.
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

54
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:08,280
<i>I have lost count how much bullying</i>

55
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,560
<i>and abuses I suffered in the past 18 years.</i>

56
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:20,780
<i>Everyone thinks I should accept my fate as it is.</i>

57
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,920
<i>But I will not.</i>

58
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,240
<i>I will prove it to them</i>

59
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,900
<i>that I will not surrender to this harsh life.</i>

60
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,020
Both humans and immortals care about etiquette.

61
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:23,380
Qingkui, you cannot ever slip up.

62
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:29,400
Yetan, you are worse today than ever before.

63
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,560
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

64
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:40,240
His Majesty has said that you are not to leave your chamber unless you are summoned.

65
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,360
He has kept me here for 18 years. Is that still not enough?

66
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,740
The day after tomorrow is the day my sister and I get married.

67
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:53,580
Before I leave, vengeance will be mine.

68
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:59,900
The day after tomorrow is the day my sister and I get married.

69
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,340
I've been with my father for 18 years.

70
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,700
Now that I have to leave him soon, I can't help but be worried about him.

71
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:06,660
Come with me to pay Imperial Father a visit.

72
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,580
<i>Before I leave, I want to keep him company.</i>

73
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,740
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

74
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,080
I'm here to greet my father.

75
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,340
Please notify him.

76
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:22,300
Your Highness, His Majesty is not in the hall.

77
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,220
Where is he, then?

78
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,380
Voidwalkers are evil,

79
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:33,020
violent, and ungrateful.

80
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,460
Use all means necessary.

81
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,920
That's how you survive there.

82
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,820
What an enlightening book.

83
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:41,800
I have learned so much.

84
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,820
You villainous daughter.

85
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,300
How dare you abduct your own father!

86
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:49,200
Release me at once!

87
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,360
You? Do you deserve to be my father?

88
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,380
Look around.

89
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,580
Is there a father who treats his own daughter like you do.

90
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:59,960
Ever since my birth, you've been wanting to kill me.

91
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:03,060
For 18 years, I face either confinement or admonishment.

92
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:05,880
Have you ever shown me affection?

93
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,480
You are my father in name.

94
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:11,480
Because you treat me like an enemy for 18 years.

95
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,940
I know.

96
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:16,720
You're going to mention the auspicious and ominous signs.

97
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:21,080
But destiny is not what a baby can alter.

98
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,120
I just got the short end of the stick.

99
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,320
You favor Qingkui and treat me like a vile person. You say I'm never like Qingkui.

100
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,580
What do you think that makes me feel?

101
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,540
I will marry the voidwalkers in two days.

102
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:41,000
For any other girls, where a father and a daughter cherish their time together.

103
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,940
Now I'm here to settle the score with you.

104
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,280
How ridiculous!

105
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,820
If you don't like me, why did you give birth to me?

106
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,980
Answer me.

107
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,960
Why did you give birth to me?

108
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,660
Young Master told me to keep you company because he didn't want you to get bullied.

109
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,140
I'm not supposed to be your punching bag.

110
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,220
Also, your cloth stinks.

111
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,280
It leaves a bad smell in my mouth.

112
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,860
Transform back. I'm not done yet.

113
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:09,360
No. If you're upset, go and confront your imperial father.

114
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,260
What's the point of playing pretend every day?

115
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,780
It's annoying.

116
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,040
Let me tell you, I will not show my vulnerable side to that stone-hearted man.

117
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,860
Transform back.

118
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,040
You...

119
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,980
Just you watch.

120
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:27,680
The climax will begin soon.

121
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,600
Kui'er.

122
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,580
Imperial Father.

123
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,560
We have the same mind.

124
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,140
I was about to go to see you, but you came to me first.

125
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:49,460
If you need me, just summon me.

126
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,420
No need to come to me in person.

127
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,480
It's no hassle.

128
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,520
You will get married soon.

129
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,120
I want to spend more time with my baby daughter.

130
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:02,520
Speaking of which, I made some gowns for you.

131
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,940
We will have to separate soon.

132
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,100
By wearing the gowns I made, it will alleviate your longing for me.

133
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,600
Kui'er, you're so thoughtful.

134
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,360
Kui'er, you made a handkerchief for me too?

135
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,820
This is for Tan'er.

136
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,720
Tan'er will get married soon.

137
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,540
I'm going to visit her.

138
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:29,960
If you're free, why... not come with me?

139
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm sure she will be happy to see you.

140
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,720
It never goes well whenever I visit that sinful child.

141
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,520
But it's different now.

142
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:40,420
The immortals and the voidwalkers will come to pick us up soon.

143
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,060
She is your daughter.

144
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:47,460
I'm sure you want to bid farewell properly to Tan'er.

145
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,260
Kneel and apologize to me.

146
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,400
For these 18 years of unfair treatment,

147
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,700
<i>asking you to kneel is already too light a punishment for you.
[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

148
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,760
- No.
- Will you kneel?

149
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,800
No?

150
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,660
Then I'll hit you until you comply.

151
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,300
Imperial Father.

152
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,400
Tell your beast friend to come out now.

153
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I know where she is.

154
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,800
You disrespect your father.

155
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,500
As usual, you always disappoint me.

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,900
Calm down, Imperial Father.

157
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,300
Tan’er didn't mean it.

158
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,900
- Why not use this occasion—
- I seriously mean it.

159
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,700
Disrespecting you, you say?

160
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,200
- You imprison me for 18 years. You're not that respectable as a father anyway.
- You...

161
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,900
- Imperial Father
- Don't stop him. Let him hit me.

162
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
Kui’er!

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,800
- Qingkui.
- Vile person!

164
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,800
If you didn't share the sense of pain with Qingkui,

165
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,800
I would have already...

166
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,700
This mistake could be averted.

167
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:05,000
Once you're in the Void, kill or hurt anyone you want.

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,900
But as long as you're here, I can discipline you as your father.

169
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,500
Men!

170
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,800
Incarcerate her!

171
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,510
- Noted.
- Noted.

172
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,400
Imperial Father.

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:22,000
Don't touch me!

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,700
I know the way there.

175
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,400
Imperial Father.

176
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,200
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

177
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
- Imperial Father.
- Kui’er.

178
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,200
Let her be.

179
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,500
I heard Empyrean Xuanshang departed today

180
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
and he will take you to the Heavenly Realm the day after tomorrow.

181
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
If Yetan stays here, something bad is going to happen.

182
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,600
It's fine if we make a fool of ourselves,

183
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,300
but if she jeopardizes our diplomacy with the immortals, that will be very serious.

184
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,900
Just let her be.

185
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:06,600
As long as you can stay by the Empyrean's side, all humans, and I, will be reassured.

186
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,400
Right.

187
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:13,940
<i>[Land of Mystery]</i>

188
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,700
<i>Repairing Guixu is a dangerous task.</i>

189
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:51,600
<i>Your Majesty, Youqin and Qingheng are still young.</i>

190
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,000
As the Heavenly Empress, you should serve the greater good.

191
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
Don't be sentimental now.

192
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,900
If we don't let the princes train in solitude since young,
<i>[Ninth Heaven Hall]</i>

193
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:06,700
how can they shoulder the burden when something happens to Guixu?

194
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,200
Qingheng is still too young.

195
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:18,200
I am willing to undergo the training to reduce your burden, Celestial Father.

196
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,200
No, Youqin.

197
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,100
Celestial Father, let me do it.

198
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,500
Great.

199
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,600
You care about all living creatures.

200
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,800
Make an announcement that the Crown Prince, Shaodian Youqin, is to be promoted to the rank of Empyrean,

201
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,500
bearing the title, Xuanshang.

202
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,600
<i>He will undergo the training starting today.</i>

203
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,300
Your Highness. Your Highness.

204
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
Your Highness!

205
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:03,400
To improve yourself, you remain chaste and train for 1,500 years.

206
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,000
You can leave today and reunite with your family.

207
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,200
You rearranged the scrolls and sealed off your memories.

208
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,800
I can tell you are apprehensive about the reunion.

209
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:22,200
If you don't mind my imposition, I heard that Jade Deity, Rain Deity, and Thunder Deity,

210
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:24,600
all three respectable masters will be there for your reception.

211
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:28,700
You cast away your emotions for years, so I'm sure you don't know how to interact with others.

212
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,600
When you see them, speak tactfully.

213
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,700
Do not be as unfiltered as you usually are.

214
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,200
Otherwise...

215
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,000
I guess quiet days will soon be behind me.

216
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,500
<i>[Heavenly Realm]</i>

217

229
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:03,300
Look. He has grown up and become a dashing man.

230
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,100
- He is just as handsome as me when I was young.
- That's an understatement.

- Eldest Brother.

238

Your Majesty!

239
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,800
You have obtained the Imperfect Celestial Body.

240
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,100
Youqin.

241
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,400
You did not let me down.

242
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,100
How have you been for the past 1,500 years?

243
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,600
I heard you never took a break from your training.

244
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,800
Are you hurt?

245
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,100
Worry not, Celestial Mother. All is well.

246
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:29,500
Youqin. It only took you 1,500 years to obtain the Imperfect Celestial Body.

247
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,300
<i>You're strong. Not bad at all.</i>

248
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,400
- Even taller than me now.
- So handsome.

249
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,600
So handsome. You were so short back then.

250
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,200
You flatter me, fellow masters.

251
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,600
I started training when I was 1,200 years old.

252
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,700
If I failed to obtain the Imperfect Celestial Body after a millennium,

253
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,800
I would be either slacking or had no talent at all.

254
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Your Highness.

255
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,800
The three masters are more than ten thousand years old now

256
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
and they haven't obtained the Imperfect Celestial Body.

257
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,600
You just implied that they are stupid and lazy.

258
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,100
I...

259
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:09,000
You're dumb and you're lazy.

260
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,000
He was talking about you.

261
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,100
- Eldest Brother.
- Eldest Brother.

262
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:16,300
I have missed you so much after we parted ways last time.

263
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,000
Ziwu. Can you let go of me?

264
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,600
Eldest Brother. I have been thinking about you every day.

265
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,000
To convey my feelings, I visited the Land of Mystery every day to write to you.

266
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,400
Did you receive my letters?

267
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:34,600
I did. You complained about how harsh your masters are in the thousands of letters.

268
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,100
You wanted me to come out soon and avenge you.

269
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:42,200
Eldest Brother, I was... I was young and naive.

270
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,400
I was just ranting.

271
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,600
Don't take it seriously.

272
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,300
Youqin.

273
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,500
I have good news for you.

274
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,300
18 years ago, a certain Princess Qingkui was born in the Human Realm.

275
00:20:56,300 --> 00:21:00,900
She possesses a rare gift, and for the everlasting friendship between both realms,

276
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:05,300
I arranged for her to be your consort.

277
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,200
Now that you have completed your training,

278
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,600
head down to the Human Realm to marry her the day after tomorrow.

279
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:13,800
Consort?

280
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,400
Celestial Father, I cannot agree to this.

281
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,600
Why not?

282
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,800
I have an important duty.

283
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,700
If something goes awry in Guixu and I sacrifice my life for it,

284
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,600
Princess Qingkui will become a widow.

285
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Please reconsider this arrangement, Celestial Father.

286
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:32,700
Marrying Princess Qingkui and maintaining the alliance of both realms

287
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,900
are also your duty as the Crown Prince.

288
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,900
The Heavenly Realm likes to uphold traditions.

289
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:42,700
Rest for a bit now before you head to the Human Realm to ask for her hand with the edict.

290
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:44,400
Father, I...

291
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,800
This has been decided.

292
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,600
No need to argue.

293
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,800
<i>[Imperial Palace, Human Realm]</i>

294
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:12,220
His Majesty organized a city-wide banquet for Princess Qingkui.

295
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:14,020
<i>I have to be there too.</i>

296
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,340
<i>Please behave here, Your Highness.</i>

297
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,860
<i>Don't make things difficult for us.</i>

298
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:26,740
His Majesty said you are to reflect upon yourself here, Your Highness.

299
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,020
<i>- She's such a jinx.
- Indeed.</i>

300
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,800
<i>How come Princess Qingkui has a sister like her?</i>

301
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,220
<i>Your Highness, behave now.</i>

302
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,900
<i>His Majesty doesn't want to see you.</i>

303
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:17,460
<i>From now on, you're not my daughter.</i>

304
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,420
I guess this is my last time here.

305
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,120
Tan'er.

306
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,900
Tan'er.

307
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,020
- Tan'er.
- You are supposed to enjoy your moment in the pre-wedding banquet

308
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,980
and watch the fireworks Imperial Father prepared for you.

309
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,460
Why did you come to me?

310
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:03,720
We are getting married on the same day, so it's your pre-wedding banquet too.

311
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,640
Tan'er.

312
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:15,860
I know you dream to be a strong and free woman.

313
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,520
I then embroidered this portrait for you.

314
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:22,520
May you become the fiercest and scariest Devil of the Void.

315
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,140
Do you like it?

316
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,480
It's so ugly. No one wants to look like that.

317
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,680
I thought you would like this.

318
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:33,340
Let me embroider a new one for you.

319
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,620
It's a gift, so you can't take it back.

320
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,760
My wiping cloth is smelly now.

321
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:44,200
While this is unpleasant to look at,

322
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,640
I can still use it.

323
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,820
For years, I wonder how nice it would be

324
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:58,760
if we were born into a normal household.

325
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:08,580
That way, I can pamper you like a normal sister and you won't be mistreated.

326
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:13,260
Imperial Father has a favorite. You can't do anything about it either.

327
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,980
If you hadn't taken care of me all these years and shared whatever you had with me,

328
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:20,980
I would have been tortured to death by that man.

329
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:25,520
Tan'er. We will be separated by two realms soon.

330
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,400
We might not be able to see each other anymore.

331
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:32,500
May we be like this moon.

332
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:38,400
Whenever we see the moon, it'll be like we're together.

333
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,180
What do you think?

334
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,400
Although the Void hasn't chosen their crown prince yet,

335
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,400
but Tan'er, whoever you marry, as long as you treat him genuinely, he will do the same to you.

336
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:52,900
That will make up for the suffering you endured in the Human Realm.

337
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:56,820
Genuine affection is just a pipe dream.

338
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,320
One's heart can be treacherous.

339
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,460
Don't give your heart to anyone you see.

340
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,920
You might get hurt.

341
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:06,320
I don't think he will be able to accept my heart.

342
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,120
So it's true that Shaodian Youqin is going to repair Guixu?

343
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:18,220
So, once you become an immortal, you'll have to be alone forever?

344
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,480
Have you ever thought of saying no to this marriage?

345
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,540
This is my destiny. I have come to terms with it.

346
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:27,420
No. I can't let you walk into misery like this.

347
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,960
Enough, Tan'er.

348
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,900
My happiness means nothing in front of the collective interest.

349
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:38,260
- You...
- I only have one wish.

350
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,800
I wish that you could be the best Devil of Void.

351
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,480
Always carefree and joyful.

352
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:54,160
The Devil of Void?

353
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,360
Come on. That's not a compliment at all.

354
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,680
<i>Dummy. I won't let you marry Shaodian Youqin.</i>

355
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,260
<i>[Wangliang City]
<i>(TN: demons and monsters)</i></i>

356
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,980

357
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,110
<i>This one isn't bad.</i>

00:27:20,110 --> 00:27:21,600

359
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,660
<i>Come and take a look!</i>

<i>Come.</i>

362
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,340
Pack it. Okay.

363
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,470
Sir.

364
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:45,040
I have good news.

365
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,140
You have no idea.

366
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:51,840
Right after I spread the news that you are hiring at all costs, people flocked to me.

367
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,780
Should we have a look now?

368
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,080
How are the applicants?

369
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,360
I put a lot of money into it and I demand a skillful individual.

370
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,020
Wait. What are you saying?

371
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:07,720
You don't trust us?

372
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,620
Don't joke around now.

373
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:11,080
Look where you are now.

374
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:15,920
We're in Wangliang City.

375
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:23,580
Everyone knows that this is the hub that connects all four realms,

376
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:27,100
the hub where you see all walks of life.

377
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:33,760
I can even tell you that if you can't find who you need here, you can't find that person anywhere else.

378
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:39,560
Just trust me and follow me.

379
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:12,900
<i>First candidate. The honey trap.</i>

380
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,200
<i>She is the seductress.</i>

381
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,040
<i>Second candidate. Nimble and brave.</i>

382
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:23,120
<i>Third candidate. Strong as a mountain.</i>

383
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,800
<i>And the final candidate is even stronger.</i>

384
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,520
So, Miss? I was right, wasn't I?

385
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:49,280
Aren't they incredible?

386
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,440
They are no good.

387
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,920
You don't want someone like me?

388
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,200
How dare you look down on us?

389
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:55,960
Are you even genuine in your recruitment?

390
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:59,480
Do you think we're clowns to entertain you?

391
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,540
<i>[Wangliang City]</i>

392
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:28,400
Glazed glass! Good quality glazed glass!

393
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,120
Come and have a look. Good quality glazed glass!

394
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,220
Come and browse, Miss. I have good glassware.

395
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:35,640
Mister, what would you want?

396
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,560
My glazed glass is excellent.

397
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,360
Look at this.

398
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,360
The Xuan Amber?

399
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,500
Your Highness, Congratulations on finishing your training.

400
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:49,680
At ease.

401
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,580
I heard the Voidwalkers and my people are both expecting a wedding on the same day.

402
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:53,320
They are stationed here.

403
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:55,300
Do you know who leads them and how many there are?

404
00:30:55,300 --> 00:31:00,180
The Crown Prince of the Void is still vacant, so the First Prince, Wudai, will fetch the bride instead.

405
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:02,500
He has several thousand men with him.

406
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,360
This is the detail.

407
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,420
- Got it.
- Don't run!

408
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,760
Stay here. Stay!

409
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,580
Don't touch me.

410
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,380
Stay right there!

411
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:23,300
Don't you run!

412
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,640
Don't let her get away!

413
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,480
You have nowhere to go!

414
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:35,160
Stop. Stop there!

415
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:39,640
My friends. I'm sure she comes with money.

416
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,800
We rob her and share the loot to make our effort worthy.

417
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,200
Charge!

418
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,680
I'll hire you!

419
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,740
Don't go.

420
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,240
- Don't go.
- Let go.

421
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,540
Miss, what do you want?

422
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:16,700
I'll tell you. I want to kidnap someone.

423
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,000
I can pay you whatever you want as long as you get it done.

424
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,400
You have the wrong person.

425
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,920
I...

426
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,180
I have the right person.

427
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:26,980
The target I'm kidnapping is very powerful.

428
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:29,380
Only a magic user like you can make it work.

429
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:36,200
Please have some mercy and help me.

430
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,880
You're kidnapping someone. Why should I show mercy?

431
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,380
What exactly are you trying to do?

432
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,980
I...

433
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:50,320
I want to kidnap the Immortal Crown Prince, Shaodian Youqin.

434
00:32:57,020 --> 00:32:58,600
Shaodian Youqin?

435
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,920
Why? Isn't it enticing?

436
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:03,260
- Are you going to help me?
- No, thanks.

437
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,460
- Miss, I advise you to give up.
- Why?

438
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:10,360
Because I am Shaodian Youqin.

439
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,740
If you are Shaodian Youqin, I'm the Heavenly Emperor then.

440
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:27,700
Wait, no. I'm the Void King Li.

441
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:39,460
Well... Isn't it the Xuan Amber of Empyrean Xuanshang?

442
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,460
So you are indeed Shaodian Youqin?

443
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,420
Who are you? Why are you hiring mercenaries to kidnap me?

444
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:48,600
<i>Just how unlucky I am to run into my target right away?</i>

445
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,200
<i>Stay calm. For Qingkui's happiness, I cannot back down.</i>

446
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,560
Oh, my. It's just a misunderstanding.

447
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:57,540
Besides, we're family.

448
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:59,480
Look.

449
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,480
Have a look. Look.

450
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,740
I am a princess of the Liguang family. Look.

451
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:09,180
<i>[Liguang]</i>

452
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:16,680
Don't tell me you're Liguang Qingkui?

453
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:20,610
<i>He mistook me as Qingkui. Whatever.</i>

454
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:23,450
<i>I should use this opportunity to give him a nasty impression of Qingkui</i>

455
00:34:23,450 --> 00:34:25,390
<i>so that he withdraws from the marriage.</i>

456
00:34:25,390 --> 00:34:27,420
Yes.

457
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,580
This can't be it.

458
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:32,740
They say Princess Qingkui is kind, gentle, and loving.

459
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,900
She will never kidnap someone.

460
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:39,980
Everyone thinks becoming an Empyrean Consort is an honor.

461
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,060
What they don't know is that this honor is a cage.

462
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:47,060
And in this cage, I will be judged by the standards people hold against an Empyrean Consort.

463
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:50,800
I have to study those Heavenly Rules every day and I'm sick of it.

464
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:54,140
I don't want to be a boring consort and live in the boring Heavenly Realm.

465
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:56,040
And I definitely don't want to marry you.

466
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:59,760
The Heavenly Realm leads the Four Realms. Don't you have some respect in you?

467
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:04,120
I do. Growing up, I have only ever respected one thing.

468
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,600
- Do you know what it is?
- What?

469
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,200
The guard dog in Rixi Palace.

470
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,980
It eats disgusting food and can bite. I can do neither, so I respect it.

471
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,940
Very well.

472
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,260
How old are you?

473
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:24,840
It has been 2,700 years since my soul took a form.

474
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:30,740
2,700 years old? You're ancient and you still want a wife?

475
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:33,820
What if it doesn't work down there anymore?

476
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:37,120
For immortals, we reach our maturity at the age of 1,600.

477
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:39,240
How can this be?

478
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:46,380
I'm so young and beautiful, but now, I have to marry an old, crinkly man.

479
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:50,100
Please have some mercy. Just let me go.

480
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,540
I never want this marriage, and you definitely make me less desire it.

481
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,360
- Annul the marriage then.
- I can't wait already.

482
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,400
But this arrangement concerns the alliance between both realms.

483
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,720
I cannot annul it on my own.

484
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:04,280
People say that it is never too late to mend. One wrong step and a life of misery awaits.

485
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,360
Force a decision and you'll suffer. Concede and everything becomes better.

486
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:10,220
Can you even spend the rest of your life with someone like me?

487
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,200
You're right.

488
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,020
I'm not done yet. Annul the marriage already. Don't leave.

489
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:23,660
<i>[Wangliang City]</i>

490
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:46,140
- Where is Chaofeng?
- Your Highness, I heard

491
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,720
<i>that the first thing he did when he arrived in Wangliang City is to visit Huakui Brothel.</i>

492
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:52,220
<i>Perhaps the courtesans there have made him forget the time.</i>

493
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,700
<i>I'll bring him back.</i>

494
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,500
No need. Can't expect much from him anyway.

495
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:59,440
What's trash will be trash forever.

496
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,980
Sir.

497
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,300
So?

498
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,420
Everything is ready.

499
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:13,980
Wu Dai will not leave this city alive.

500
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,120
Sir. If I may ask, assassinating Wu Dai is challenging enough.

501
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:24,740
Framing the Second Prince, Dingyun, for it will be even more difficult.

502
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:28,220
If someone else finds out about your scheme...

503
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,500
Everyone knows the First and the Second Princes want to be the Void Crown Prince.

504
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:41,020
If my plan works, I can get rid of them simultaneously.

505
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:44,740
No one will suspect the son of a guilty official.

506
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:51,680
And then, I won't have to pretend I'm a philanderer to hide my ambition.

507
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,100
I'm not done yet. Stop shoving me.

508
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,300
- I don't like to be touched.
- You...

509
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,680
Bone Flute. Bone Flute.

510
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,880
Perfect as a love token for your wife. It even doubles as a weapon.

511
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,820
I love it. Buy one for me. Come on.

512
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:10,690
- I want one.
- You're a princess, and you mingle with a stranger man in public,

513
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,060
even asking him for money.

514
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:15,060
What do you mean by a stranger?

515
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,420
If you won't annul the marriage, it means you're my future husband.

516
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,120
I want one.

517
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:23,500
An immortal cannot own something from another realm.

518
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:27,500
So you're saying you're penniless?

519
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:30,560
My goodness!

520
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:33,960
An empyrean leads such a sorry life.

521
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,120
And your followers all kneel religiously in your temples to ask for your blessing.

522
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,380
What a joke.

523
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,340
<i>Void Army?</i>

524
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,280
<i>I just completed my training and the Void Army is here.</i>

525
00:38:52,280 --> 00:38:56,260
<i>I doubt they are targeting me. An in-fighting perhaps?</i>

526
00:38:56,260 --> 00:39:00,120
<i>Either way, I should get out of this place.</i>

527
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,720
Look. It's Wu Dai, Void First Prince.

528
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:20,220
Look! It's Wu Dai. Wu Dai! Look.

529
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:49,140
Look. Hurry.

530
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:54,700
Wu Dai, Void First Prince! Look.

531
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,380
Watch out.

532
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:09,000
- Assassin! Protect His Highness!
<i> - Yes, Sir!</i>

533
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,400
Two people saw me.

534
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,320
Find them and silence them. Come with me.

535
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:16,340
Who dares to assassinate me?

536
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:23,630
- Get them!
<i>- Yes!</i>

537
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:45,680
<i>Oh, no. The Void Army is here. They must be here to silence us.</i>

538
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,640
I didn't expect to run into someone powerful in Wangliang City.

539
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,660
But unfortunately for you, you have to die.

540
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:09,660
<i>He is bold. He even wants to assassinate the Void First Prince, so he must be very powerful.</i>

541
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,340
<i>Perhaps, I can use him to get rid of Shaodian Youqin.</i>

542
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,840
<i>That should save Qingkui.</i>

543
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,500
I'll protect you.
