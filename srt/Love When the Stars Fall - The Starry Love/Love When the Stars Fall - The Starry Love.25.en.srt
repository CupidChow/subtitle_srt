00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,000
Did Qingheng and Ziwu tell you that I was at the House of Colors?

22
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
They did.

23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Money, it's your birthday today.

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,500
Why didn't you tell me?

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,000
Thank goodness Qingheng and Ziwu gave me a reminder.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,200
Don't worry.

27
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,500
When I'm back, I'll make sure they suffer...

28
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,200
I'll make sure they know how grateful I am.

29
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,400
You should.

30
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,800
But I have already thanked them.

31
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:11,100
Thanks to their reminder, I could buy you a gift in time.

32
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
A gift?

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,800
I don't know what you like so I hired the ten best chefs in the Beast Realm

34
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,300
to cook you these gourmet Longevity noodles, garnished with the freshest food.

35
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,200
Do you like it?

36
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,500
Gourmet, you say?

37
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,400
Also...

38
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,400
There's more?

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,500
In the Beast Realm, we have this saying.

40
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,900
The Longevity Buns you eat should be the same number as your age.

41
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,600
You're 20 this year so you need to eat 20 Longevity Buns.

42
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:47,500
Twenty?

43
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,800
I highly doubt you're making a lot of money with your book.

44
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Can we return the food?

45

Don't! Eat them!

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm willing to spend much more on you.

47

Here. Eat them while it's warm.

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,700
Have a sip of the Longevity Noodles before you have the buns.

<i>I'll just take a few polite bites.</i>

52
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,400
Don't bite and sever it.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,700
If you bite the Longevity noodles, it'll bring bad omens.

65

00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,500

The toilet is next door.

71

It's a female toilet so it's a bit different from the usual ones.

72

89
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,400
Hair. Any problem?

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,900
No. Not at all.

Why did you come back?

101

Unless you need to tell me something?

102

Qingheng, these three soul shards did not inherit any of Youqin's intelligence and were easily fooled by Sister-in-law.

00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,200
Qingheng, how long do we have to wait?

Money. What is going on?

139
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,900
You three are the soul shards of my eldest brother, the Empyrean Xuanshang.

140
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,500
He gave his life to repair Guixu.

We can only revive him

I'm sorry that we had to do this to break the truth to you.

Even since we came to the Human Realm, we had gone through a lot to look for you.

We are very close to reviving my eldest brother

but my sister-in-law grows hesitant because she doesn't want to hurt you all.

148
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:13,900
Ziwu and I had no choice but to do this so that the three of you can meet each other.

149
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Money, he's telling the truth?

150

151
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,200
Truth?

Tell me.

Sister-in-law.

155
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:56,440
I know you can't bear to see the three soul shards sacrifice themselves.

156
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,940
But the three of them now know the truth.

157
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,520
And the voidwalkers are plotting something big.

158
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:05,010
The only solution is to revive eldest brother so that peace can be maintained.

159
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,960
Listen, I...

160
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,150
No wonder.

161
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:22,540
I thought you did everything

162
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,400
to win my heart.

163
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:29,890

I did everything and this is the ending I get?

165
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:49,020
Fiery. No way. No way.

166
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,550
Fiery.

167
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,120
Heartless.

168
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:02,480
Wen Ren. Hear me out.

169
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:15,650
<i>Sister-in-law...</i>

170
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,240
You're awake.

171
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,000
I lost all my power.

172
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:55,390
I lost this millennia-long battle.

173
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:58,290
You're like this because of me.

174
00:13:58,290 --> 00:13:59,920
Do you regret it?

175
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,810
Not at all.

176
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:03,890
But I owe you an...

177
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,990
No need to say it.

178
00:14:05,990 --> 00:14:08,270
I have done a lot of thinking lately.

179
00:14:08,270 --> 00:14:11,270
Whether I marry the right husband or not, what is done is done.

180
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:14,230
No matter how many lies you told me,

181
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,950
your genuine feelings toward me make up for them.

182
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:23,930
Now, whether alive or dead,

183
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,820
let's not part again. All right?

184
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,230
I just wanted to defend my consort mother

185
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:35,760
but now that I lost, I cannot go up against Yingzhao anymore.

186
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,890
Fortunately, consort mother and you are both safe.

187
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:42,560
Consort Xue has never asked for anything other than your safety.

188
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,900
I love you, not your status as the Void Prince.

189
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,070
Chaofeng.

190
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:54,370
Why don't we bring Consort Xue with us and leave this place?

191
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,160
Stay away from the politics of the Void Realm.

192
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,800
All right?

193
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:04,560
In that case,

194
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,640
let's retire in White Bamboo Valley.

195
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,980
We'll lead a peaceful life.

196
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,800
For real?

197
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,580
Yes.

198
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,900
White Bamboo Valley is located on the far edge of the world.

199
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,690
It's secluded, perfect for a reclusive life.

200
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,320
- Wonderful.
- Sister Qingkui.

201
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,420
Sister Qingkui. Please help Tan Tan.

202
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,830
What happened?

203
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,380
Sister-in-law.

204
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,230
Sister-in-law. How long do you want to run away from all this?

205
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:32,030
When you aren't decisive enough, complications are bound to happen.

206
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,910
Have you forgotten why we came to the Human Realm?

207
00:15:33,910 --> 00:15:37,370
Look for those soul shards now. They love you so much that they will forgive you.

208
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:39,990
That's right, Sister-in-law. The Void Empress will invade the Beast Realm soon.

209
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:42,960
If we don't revive eldest brother, we'll be done for.

210
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:45,520
Sister-in-law!

211
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:47,600
Let's barge in.

212
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,450
Stop!

213
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,700
Princess Yetan.

214
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:57,690
She has been in the Human Realm for more than a year.

215
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,530
No one wants Empyrean Xuanshang to come back more than she does.

216
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:05,350
But these three soul shards want to have their own future, with their own free will.

217
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,910
My sister wants to grant them their wishes.

218
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:09,400
She doesn't want Empyrean Xuanshang to toil for another life.

219
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,280
- Is it wrong?
- But...

220
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:15,130
Second Prince, Princess Ziwu, you plot and scheme.

221
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:18,560
Have you ever considered the Empyrean and my sister's future?

222
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,970
Kui'er.

223
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:36,760
If you have made up your mind and want to tell me, go ahead.

224
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,400
Kui'er.

225
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:13,820
I think I should let those shards decide their own future.

226
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,740
Are you sure?

227
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,800
If Empyrean Xuanshang isn't revived, no one can get rid of Iridescent Eyes.

228
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:23,980
Compared to what Fiery, Wenren, and Heartless did to me,

229
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:31,810
the restriction imposed by the Iridescent Eyes is nothing.

230
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:36,680
If you have made up your mind, why are you upset?

231
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:39,860
Qingheng and Ziwu are rightfully concerned.

232
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,910
The Void Realm will invade soon.

233
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:45,280
If Youqin isn't revived, how can I protect Qingheng and Ziwu?

234
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,360
I really am at my wit's end.

235
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,050
Tan'er.

236
00:17:52,050 --> 00:17:56,970
Chaofeng and I agreed to hide in White Bamboo Valley.

237
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,830
It is at the edge of the world so it's far from these politics.

238
00:17:59,830 --> 00:18:04,800
If you want, you can bring those soul shards and come with us.

239
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:10,570
But they don't want to see me now, let alone listen to me.

240
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,670
You can write to them.

241
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:18,280
I can deliver the letters to them.

242
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,260
Sister-in-law...

243
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,260
Qingheng.

244
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,810
Ziwu.

245
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,870
I have made up my mind.

246
00:18:43,870 --> 00:18:47,150
I'll let those soul shards decide their own future.

247
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:50,770
If they want to stay here, I'll bring them to White Bamboo Valley.

248
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:52,770
No. Those soul shards have to be reunited.

249
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,000
I will go back with eldest brother!

250
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,380
Her Highness is doing this for him.

251
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,660
I don't care.

252
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,860
Come. Escort Qingheng and Princess Ziwu to their rooms.

253
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,110
- Come.
<i>- Yes, Sir.</i>

254
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:03,370
- You...
- Di Lanjue.

255
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,760
- Let go!
- Di Lanjue.

256
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:07,860
- Let go of me.
- Di Lanjue.

257
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,050
- Sorry.
- Let go!

258
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:12,390
Once those soul shards have left, I'll free you.

259
00:19:13,510 --> 00:19:15,030
Tan'er.

260
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:17,230
Chaofeng and I will head to the inn now to pick up the Consort Xue.

261
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:21,400
Once you find the soul shards back, we'll meet at Mingchun Valley.

262
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:35,300
Everything is fake!

263
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:41,430
She did everything to revive that Shaodian Youqin!

264
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,140
<i>[To Heartless]</i>

265
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,930
<i>I am the second daughter of the human race's Emperor Tun.</i>

266
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,360
<i>By accident, I married into the Heavenly Realm</i>

267
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:10,610
<i>and that was how I met Shaodian Youqin.</i>

268
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:14,580
<i>He disavowed all his emotions.</i>

269
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,770
<i>But because of my reckless intrusion into his life, his emotions came back.</i>

270
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,030
<i>That's why he had to sever the three shards that are you.</i>

271
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,420
<i>I did come to the Human Realm to revive him.</i>

272
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,640
<i>But as I spend more time with you, I realize that you are not just a shard.</i>

273
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,780
<i>[To Fiery]</i>

274
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:38,490
<i>You are the best, the most loyal person in this world.</i>

275
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:43,470
<i>You three have a life of freedom.</i>

276
00:20:43,470 --> 00:20:44,890
<i>Fiery.</i>

277
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:49,390
<i>You are temperamental but you are also the most sensitive of everyone.</i>

278
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:53,730
<i>Only by meeting you did I realize that it is possible to stay true to yourself,</i>

279
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:56,370
<i>despite being misunderstood by everyone.</i>

280
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,640
<i>Heartless.</i>

281
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:05,350
<i>When you spent all your fortune to save me, you said that I was invaluable in your heart.</i>

282
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:07,580
<i>However, what truly is invaluable isn't me,</i>

283
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:11,860
<i>but this sincerity of yours that transcends all material gains.</i>
<i>[To Wen Ren]</i>

284
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:14,080
<i>Wen Ren.</i>

285
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,860
<i>Your sophistication, your thoughtfulness, I have never experienced them before.</i>

286
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,950
<i>Since I was young,</i>

287
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:28,460
<i>I have told countless lies, fooling countless people.</i>

288
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:32,400
<i>But that day when you asked me if I was truly in love with you,</i>

289
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,630
<i>that was when I realize</i>

290
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:40,370
<i>that I could fool everyone but not my heart.</i>

291
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,140
<i>I am not asking you to forgive me.</i>

292
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:50,760
<i>I just want to let you know that you can decide your own future.</i>

293
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,090
<i>If you want to stay, at a quarter to eight tomorrow morning,</i>

294
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:59,530
<i>I will be waiting for you at Mingchun Valley in the outskirt of the Beast Realm.</i>

295
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,530
<i>I will bring you all somewhere safe.</i>

296
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,260
The rendezvous time has passed.

297
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,490
They haven't shown up.

298
00:22:16,490 --> 00:22:18,400
Just wait a bit longer.

299
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,540
Haichao. Are they coming or not?

300
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:27,500
Be patient, Your Highness. Despite all your lies, you still stole Qingkui's heart.

301
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,510
I'm sure Princess Yetan can do the same.

302
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:40,070
Any news about the soul shards?

303
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:43,970
The Beast Realm is vast and their prince, Di Lanjue, is protecting the soul shards.

304
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:45,050
I...

305
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,780
- I...
- Dingyun.

306
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:48,970
Imbecile.

307
00:22:49,550 --> 00:22:52,970
Shaodian Youqin might be revived soon.

308
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:55,580
Chaofeng...

309
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:58,800
He is powerless, and Yetan is eager to protect his sister.

310
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,650
I'm sure they will seek those soul shards.

311
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,310
So we use them as our guides?

312
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,750
Genius.

313
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,230
Mother.

314
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:09,590
Chaofeng was poisoned by your snake venom.

315
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,280
Perhaps you can perform a small trick to locate him?

316
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,300
Indeed.

317
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
Come with me.

318
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,200
Sister-in-law and those soul shards must be on their way now.

319
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,300
That stupid Di Lanjue. Let me out!

320
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:49,000
Qingheng.

321
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:56,100
Maybe it isn't that bad that the soul shards of Youqin can lead a peaceful life.

322
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,100
What are you saying, Ziwu?

323
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:00,000
We were separated from Youqin for more than a millennium.

324
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
Do we have to endure that for the rest of our lives, too?

325
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,800
No. I have to stop sister-in-law.

326
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:09,100
Ziwu. You lived in the Prince's Mansion for a long time.

327
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,200
Do you know of a way to make those Beast guards open the door?

328
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:15,000
I... I can try.

329
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,900
It worked.

330
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,500
Let's go.

331
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,600
I guess they won't forgive me.

332
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,400
This is bad, it's Yingzhao.

333
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,200
Mother. The soul shards aren't here.

334
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
Has Shaodian Youqin been...

335
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,800
If he's still alive, he won't leave his consort here.

336
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,800
My patience is running thin.

337
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,400
Surrender the soul shards now.

338
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,800
We are going to die either way.

339
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,400
Do you think I will say yes?

340
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:42,600
Chaofeng. Stop playing the hero when you have lost all your power.

341
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:44,000
Kill them.

342
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,000
- Noted.
- Noted.

343
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,800
- Charge!
- Charge!

344
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,400
- That side.
- Go!

345
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:23,700
Chaofeng.

346
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,000
- Money!
- Careful, Yuexia. I will protect you.

347
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,800
- You came.
- Watch out, Sister.

348
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,100
Fiery can't live without Dear.

349
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,100
I can't write my story without you.

350
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:55,200
My heart belongs to you.

351
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:09,000
Three soul shards are here.

352
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,200
What a surprise.

353
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,000
I shall kill all of you today.

354
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,700
How stubborn.

355
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
Be careful!

356
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,500
Don't!

357
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Sister!

358
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,700
Dear.

359
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,100
- Money.
- Yuexia.

360
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,900
Sister-in-law!

361
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,800
- Dear.
- Yuexia.

362
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,200
Money.

363
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,100
What are you three doing?

364
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,400
Please, Eldest Brothers.

365
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,700
Only by combining your souls to revive Empyrean Xuanshang can we save sister-in-law.

366
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,200
Take care of her.

367
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:21,000
<i>Combining. Combining.</i>

368
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,400
<i>How are we supposed to combine our souls?</i>

369
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,000

Mother. He just came back.

399
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,000
He mustn't have all his power yet.

400
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,000
All in now!

401
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,400
- Yes, Sir!
- Yes, Sir!

402
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,000
Mother!

Mother.

406

I might not

407
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:06,800
be able to be your Crown Prince anymore.

408
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,500

<i>It's great.</i>

Dear.

418
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:08,200
Look. The most beautiful stone lotus.

419
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,100
For you.

420
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,500
A farewell gift.

421
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Farewell?

422
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,500

The ending of the Romantic Heroic Chronicles is here.

428
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,600
I wrote it for you.

429
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,600

Didn't we say we would write it together?

433
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,200

Yuexia.

437
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:02,530
Do you remember the lady in my dream that I told you about before?

438
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,700
She finally turned back and looked at me.

439
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:10,200
It turns out she is you.

440
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:14,600
Thank you for giving me these beautiful memories.

441
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:16,700
Farewell.

442
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:18,400
You can't leave.

443
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,100
You can't! You can't, Wen Ren!

444

Fiery...

445
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,300
Heartless...

446
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,900
Wen Ren...

447
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,400
Tan Tan. Tan Tan.

448
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,600
Do you feel unwell?

449
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,300
Tianpa Hall?

450
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,300
Why am I at Tianpa Hall?

451
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:05,400
I remember Dingyun and the Void Empress were there. What happened next?

452
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,700
Don't worry. You saved Empyrean Xuanshang, and he saved everyone.

453
00:37:08,700 --> 00:37:10,000
That's how we all got back to the Heavenly Realm.

454
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Empyrean Xuan...

455
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:17,000
What about the soul shards?

456
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:21,500
They combined their souls to revive Empyrean Xuanshang to save you.

457
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,800
Then they...

458
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,000
You were gravely injured.

459
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,700
The Void Empress and her army had the upper hand.

460
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:33,200
We had no other choice but to revive Empyrean Xuanshang.

461
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,800
You know what? The first thing he did after he was revived was to give our enemies a good beating.

462
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,000
He killed Dingyun.

463
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,300
Where is he?

464
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:41,600
We just came back here.

465
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,100
I guess he's meeting with His Majesty and other immortals in Ninth Heaven Hall.

466
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,300
You...

467
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,200
Where are you going?

468
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,700
- Welcome back, Your Highness.
- Welcome back, Your Highness.

469
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,300
How wonderful.

470
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,100
Celestial Father.

471
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,700
Celestial Mother.

472
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,900
I have returned.

473
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,900
Youqin. I'm so glad you came back.

474
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,700
I hope you won't resent me.

475
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:48,300
As your father, I am delighted to have you back.

476
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:53,600
But you bear the duty of representing the Heavenly Realm.

477
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:57,600
I dare not imagine what would happen if the Shaodian Youqin I used to know wasn't the one who came back.

478
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,400
Celestial Father. I can vouch for eldest brother.

479
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,900
Even if only his emotions are left, he is still a righteous person.

480
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,200
Fret not, Celestial Father.

481
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,300
Yes, Celestial Father.

482
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:07,700
I can vouch for eldest brother, too.

483
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:10,200
Speak no further!

484
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,500
You violated the Heavenly Rules and descended to the Human Realm on your own.

485
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:17,200
Do you still respect me as your father?

486
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,800
The three of them resurrected Youqin.

487
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,200
They did the entire immortals a great service.

488
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,400
Please don't punish them, Your Majesty.

489
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,100
Tell me.

490
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:36,800
Are you affected by your emotions?

491
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,600
Emotions?

492
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,600
Celestial Father.

493
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:43,300
I am still the Youqin you know.

494
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,900
Qingheng, Ziwu.

495
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,900
You two resurrected Empyrean Xuanshang, and your mother also begged for leniency on your behalf.

496
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,600
I will not punish you this time.

497
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,200
- Thanks, Celestial Father.
- Thanks, Celestial Father.

498
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,000
Youqin!

499
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,700
You.

500
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,400
As the Empyrean Consort, how can you behave in this manner?

501
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:05,000
You forgot what happened down there?

502
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,700
This is...

503
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,400
Youqin.

504
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,900
Princess Qingkui went out of her way to revive you.

505
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,200
Please don't admonish her like that.

506
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,300
Qingkui.

507
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,600
I heard you were wounded by the Void Army.

508
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:28,900
Why didn't you recuperate in Tianpa Hall?

509
00:41:28,900 --> 00:41:31,200
I am feeling much better now.

510
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,500
Thank you for your concern, Your Majesty.

511
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,200
I know you care a lot about Youqin.

512
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,400
But you don't look well so you should rest up.

513
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,200
Noted.

514
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,700
I shall excuse myself now.

515
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:45,200
Good child. Go ahead.

516
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,800
He killed your son, Your Majesty.

517
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,600
Please declare war on the Heavenly Realm now

518
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,400
and kill Shaodian Youqin.

519
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,700
Shaodian Youqin is protected by the Perfect Celestial Body.

520
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,600
He can enter Guixu without dying.

521
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,400
When his souls were scattered, that was the best time to kill him.

522
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,800
Now that we missed the chance, I think...

523
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:15,400
You are the Void Tyrant.

524
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,900
Yet you are afraid of a mere immortal.

525
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:22,400
Are you still the fearsome Yanfang that I know?

526
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:24,700
Fine.

527
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,900
You won't attack them? I will!

528
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:29,600
Come forth.

529
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
Gather the army.

530
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,040
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.
