21
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,800
Shaodian Youqin was in the Beast Realm?

22
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,320
Seems like you guys had a fruitful trip.

23
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,240
Second Prince pretended to retreat as he was afraid that it might be a trap.

24
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,430
Your Majesty, he sent me back to ask for your opinion.

25
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:04,380
That fool.

26
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:08,730
If there was truly an ambush, he wouldn't need to bring his consort with him.

27
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:12,560
Moreover, the immortals always do things in an upright manner.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,230
They do not apply dirty tricks.

29
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,990
Even if they were to exact revenge against the Void,

30
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,310
they wouldn't do it in neutral territory like the Beast Realm.

31
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,500
If so, Your Majesty means...

32
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
I thought something was off back then.

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:27,030
All who tried to repair Guixu had perished.

34
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,030
However, Shaodian Youqin was able to escape unscathed.

35
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,810
Now, it seems like there's truly more to it than meets the eye.

36
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:38,990
According to you, that Shaodian Youqin Yun encountered carried much less powerful pure air than before.

37
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:43,630
So, no matter what happened to him, this is a great opportunity to strike.

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,210
Your Majesty is wise.

39
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:48,580
However, Chaofeng led the Void Patrol Battalion and took the early initiative.

40
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,070
Your Majesty, please lend us your strength.

41
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,900
Chaofeng?

42
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:58,550
I've prepared a huge gift for Chaofeng lately.

43
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:00,700
I was wondering how to send it to him.

44
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,210
Gather our men.

45
00:03:02,210 --> 00:03:04,580
Depart to the Beast Realm immediately.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,010
Yes, Your Majesty.

47
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,360
Put your back into it!

48
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,040
Will this really work?

49
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,510
Desperate situations call for desperate measures!

50
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:19,230
Sir, you just had to fall out with Her Highness, huh?

51
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:22,010
Her Highness will never save us even if we scream and shout.

52
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:24,680
Shut up! You think I wanted to fall out with her?

53
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,430
I threatened her with our farewell because I wanted her to stay out of the soul shards' affair!

54
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,660
If Her Highness was that easily threatened, we wouldn't need to kill Zhu Jiuyin.

55
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,770
We wouldn't need to risk our lives to get rid of that stupid Medical Restraint Order! Am I right, sir?

56
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,440
- Scram!
- I'll scram.

57
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,730
I'll roll away.

58
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,820
Nice rock, no more.

59
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,350
Sir, I wish to throw up.

60
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:32,160
Fire demon?

61
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:36,130
It's you?

62
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,930
I'm not the fire demon!

63
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:40,060
Why did you chase after me?

64
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:43,770
I do want to kill you. But you guys apprehended us.

65
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,780
I'll kill you!

66
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,290
- Sir!
- Sir!

67
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:52,350
Eldest Brother, have mercy!

68
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,900
- Sir!
- Calm down!

69
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,480
Eldest Brother!

70
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:57,770
Eldest Brother!

71
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,820
Eldest Brother!

72
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,170
- I'll kill you!
- I know.

73
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:04,230
He's a bad guy. But don't worry.

74
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:07,780
He won't be able to kill you when he's tied up by my Deity-Binding Rope.

75
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,870
I understand!

76
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,290
You're very angry. You disagree with us.

77
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:12,700
- You wish to kill him. You wish to...
- I'm going to kill you!

78
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,670
Ziwu! Do something about your brother!

79
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,310
Fiery, we'll leave this to Di Lanjue.

80
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:17,710
I know you miss sister-in-law.

81
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:19,750
What about this? I'll bring you to have the liquor she had left for you.

82
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,840
Liquor! Yes, have some liquor.

83
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,550
- I'm going to kill you!
- Eldest Brother!

84
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:25,690
She brewed it herself.

85
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,750
She brewed three vats for you.

86
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,610
Let's go! Eldest Brother, let's go and drink.

87
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:33,080
Let's go.

88
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,000
- Kui'er.
- Why aren't you willing to give up?

89
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,260
Dingyun is in the Beast Realm.

90
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,290
- What did you say?
- What did you say?

91
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,880
That hurts.

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,480
I'm sorry. Sorry about that.

93
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,090
Comb my hair.

94
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:02,040
What do you think?

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,760
Hall Master, it's been three days since we closed the shop.

96
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,550
Are we still doing business or not?

97
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,750
That's none of your business.

98
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:18,250
Run! The Void Empress is attacking us!

99
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,820
- What?
- Run!

100
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,370
Let's go! Let's go!

101
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,020
Hurry!

102
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,950
- What's wrong?
- Hurry up!

103
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:41,310
Run! I'll stall them!

104
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,880
Let's go!

105
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,220
Kui'er, be careful!

106
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:04,250
You're no match for me without the magic array.

107
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,970
You guys are retreating, huh?

108
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,540
Seems like Empress Mother was right.

109
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,400
It was just a bluff.

110
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,930
Today, you will meet your end.

111
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,870
No.

112
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:42,340
Wait. You guys are being so serious here.

113
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,900
I wonder which of my business has offended you all.

114
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:48,980
Business?

115
00:07:48,980 --> 00:07:52,780
The Devil of Void might be powerful, but our hall master isn't someone to be trifled with either!

116
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,420
I suggest you release them immediately.

117
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,950
If not, our hall master will massacre you all when he gets angry!

118
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:02,090
Hall Master, don't let them get their way.

119
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,790
- Hall Master!
- Heartless!

120
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,020
Heartless, are you okay?

121
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,470
- Are you okay?
- Hall Master!

122
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:18,610
Where are your powers?

123
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,620
So, you've been deceiving us all along?

124
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,900
I...

125
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,170
Over here.

126
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,460
I detect the princess's aura.

127
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,990
Over here!

128
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,730
It's all someone's fault.

129
00:08:55,730 --> 00:08:57,560
They should've told us that Dingyun was here.

130
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,690
We shouted for you all! You guys didn't hear us, okay?

131
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,390
Just hurry up.

132
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,420
Your Highness!

133
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,590
- Your Highness.
- Princess Yetan.

134
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:21,870
Your Highness, what's the matter?

135
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:25,800
<i>I'm sure Tan'er is in trouble.</i>

136
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,470
We can sense each other's pain.

137
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,250
Go and save the soul shard and the empyrean consort.

138
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,530
I can't take it anymore.

139
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,630
Su Shui, send Her Highness back to the inn.

140
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:36,150
Yes, Sir.

141
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,520
- We'll look for Dingyun.
- Hurry!

142
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,230
Let's go!

143
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,000
Money!

144
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,470
Sister-in-law!

145
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:51,190
Money! Money!

146
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,330
Money! Are you okay?

147
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,010
Money! Money!

148
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,680
Money! Why are you so cold?

149
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,910
Money! Money!

150
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:05,450
Money!

151
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:07,840
Money!

152
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,690
Money! Wake up! Don't fall asleep! Wake up!

153
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:12,400
Tan Tan!

154
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,290
Chaofeng?

155
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:15,670
Ziwu!

156
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,660
Let's go.

157
00:11:17,660 --> 00:11:19,390
Hurry, get up!

158
00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,690
Come!

159
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,890
Kui Kui! Kui Kui!

160
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,970
Dingyun, I'm here.

161
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,100
You guys should leave.

162
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:32,640
This is between us voidwalkers.

163
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:37,200
- Let's go.
<i>Hurry.</i>

164
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,740
Hurry.

165
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,150
Chaofeng, how dare you side with the immortals?

166
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,400
You're digging your own grave!

167
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,730
Dingyun, you need your empress mother's help to kill a person?

168
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,320
He's a mommy's boy indeed.

169
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,170
You!

170
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,750
You've remained hidden for a long time.

171
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:07,590
But the appearance of Shaodian Youqin made you reveal your true ambitions.

172
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,790
Remained hidden for a long time, huh?

173
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:16,280
You guys are no match for me without my royal father.

174
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,320
Empress Mother, save your breath.

175
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,980
Let's just kill him.

176
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:22,830
Can't you tell?

177
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:25,340
We're no match for him.

178
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:29,770
But Chaofeng, you've been outside for so long.

179
00:13:29,770 --> 00:13:32,670
Do you still miss your consort mother?

180
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,910
- Feng'er!
- Consort Mother?

181
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,440
Yingzhao! How dare you kidnap a consort?

182
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:50,800
How dare you address me by my name?

183
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,660
Seems like you intend to drop the act.

184
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:55,020
But it makes sense.

185
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:57,030
We're already engaging each other in a fight.

186
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:59,690
It's pointless to keep up the act.

187
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,720
I've lost to you so many times.

188
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,840
Now, I finally understand your true powers.

189
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:09,720
Cave of Haunted Souls, Void Patrol Battalion, and the crown princess's clinic were all under you.

190
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:15,850
Ever since you and Yun'er left the realm, I started planning for this killer move.

191
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,060
Xue Qingxin is your weakness.

192
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:22,770
By capturing her, I have your life in my hands.

193
00:14:25,970 --> 00:14:27,120
Feng'er!

194
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,940
Since I'm already captured, I will surely be killed.

195
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,230
Just forget about me!

196
00:14:31,230 --> 00:14:34,440
Leave this place and never come back!

197
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,280
He could never do so.

198
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:42,710
No matter if it's his power or his deviousness, your son is truly one of a kind.

199
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:46,050
You and your mother have remained hidden for over a millennium.

200
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,620
I thought you two were leading an honest life.

201
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,820
So, you were just hiding your true ability all along.

202
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:57,350
Your Majesty, ever since the battle of Guixu, the Void Tyrant has been favoring Third Prince.

203
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:00,540
You kidnapped the consort without any evidence.

204
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:02,690
I'm afraid the Void Tyrant will punish you for that.

205
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:06,040
That's right. I do fear that.

206
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,140
To put it bluntly, we're all just fighting for the crown prince's throne.

207
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:14,800
As long as you promise me that you'll give up on the throne, we won't need to fight.

208
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,490
Fine.

209
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,440
Words alone are no proof.

210
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:29,720
Take this pill. It will seal your powers away.

211
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:33,240
If so, I will release you and your mother.

212
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,080
If you try to break the seal by force,

213
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,210
your nerves and tendons will sever all at once, making you a cripple.

214
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:41,780
I can only be at ease after you take this pill.

215
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,560
It's fine if you don't want to take it.

216
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:02,120
We shall fight each other to death then.

217
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:07,390
Consort Mother!

218
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,050
Fine!

219
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,230
- I promise you!
- Sir!

220
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:32,380
Feng'er! How could you be so silly?

221
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:53,250
Sir!

222
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:18,840
Mother!

223
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:22,230
Let's go.

224
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,780
Mother, are we going to let them off?

225
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,490
We should not strive for instant success.

226
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,720
If we get rid of him, your father will never let us off.

227
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,230
It's better if we make him useless.

228
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:59,130
When he has lost his value, your father will never pay attention to him again.

229
00:17:59,130 --> 00:18:03,650
Once you become the crown prince, everything will be under our control.

230
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,210
Di Lanjue,

231
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,880
- Money.
- Why aren't we heading to the Prince's Mansion?

232
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,930
Money.

233
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:20,350
Come here.

234
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,830
Fiery is still in Prince's Mansion.

235
00:18:22,830 --> 00:18:24,250
We cannot let them meet each other.

236
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,150
Man Man said this place is Heartless's territory.

237
00:18:34,830 --> 00:18:37,030
Don't do this!

238
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:38,530
Okay.

239
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:42,260
Since you all risked your lives to save us, you all must be Money's best friends.

240
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,380
I'm begging you guys. Please save her.

241
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:46,130
Please.

242
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,130
This is Void Frost Poison.

243
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:51,730
I'm afraid there's no cure for it.

244
00:18:54,150 --> 00:18:57,900
If it's truly Void Frost Poison, not only will frost grow on her body,

245
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,000
but she'll also fall into a deep sleep, plagued by hallucinations.

246
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,640
She won't be able to wake up.

247
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:18,220
What am I doing here?

248
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,190
Tan'er. Come here.

249
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,530
Imperial Father wants you to play Chinese chess with him.

250
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,120
This set of Chinese chess is...

251
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:43,020
Tan'er, this is the first item you gave me.

252
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,070
I always treasured it.

253
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:47,990
You knew that I made it?

254
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:50,590
I'm not that dumb.

255
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,660
Kui'er can never make such crude items.

256
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,220
Give it back if you don't like it!

257
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,430
Tan'er, you made this for me personally.

258
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:01,707
I love it.

259
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:06,290
Imperial Father cherished it so much that he kept it in this hall.

260
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:09,810
Tan'er, I've already discussed it with the Grand Preceptor.

261
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,990
Tomorrow, you can join your sister in school.

262
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:16,260
- I can go to school now?
- Of course.

263
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,880
Come and take a look. See if you like it or not.

264
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:20,630
It's for me?

265
00:20:30,275 --> 00:20:31,700
<i>[The Book of Songs]</i>

266
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:39,230
Tan'er, look at this.

267
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:42,050
<i>[Liguang Yetan]</i>

268
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,250
Liguang Yetan?

269
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,390
This is my name.

270
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,600
Imperial Father, did you carved it for me?

271
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:55,940
Imperial Father chose his favorite pen and carved your name on it.

272
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,330
Imperial Father.

273
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,940
<i>Money! Don't sleep!</i>

274
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,930
<i>Money! Wake up!</i>

275
00:21:09,930 --> 00:21:11,340
<i>Don't sleep!</i>

276
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,200
What sound was that?

277
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,600
Why does it sound so familiar?

278
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,650
Why is the frost poison getting worse?

279
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:36,930
Ziwu, since you recognize this poison, do you know how to neutralize it?

280
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,250
I can't remember. I dare not simply speak.

281
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:43,240
What if I said the wrong thing and harmed Money instead?

282
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,490
Her Highness is already in critical condition.

283
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:49,520
What could be worse than this situation?

284
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,740
I vaguely remember that Jade Deity once said we need different heavenly fires to produce different pills.

285
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,110
One of the heavenly fires is called the True Golden Fire.

286
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,360
However, we need tens of thousands of gold to create that fire.

287
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:05,240
Only then, we can neutralize the frost poison without harming her body.

288
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,230
Tens of thousands of gold?

289
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,120
Where can we find that much gold in such a short time?

290
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,390
I'll beg Mother.

291
00:22:11,390 --> 00:22:13,860
Your Highness, Her Majesty has always been in charge of the gold vault.

292
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:16,730
Even the Beast King couldn't make her give up a single cent. How could you do it?

293
00:22:16,730 --> 00:22:20,490
I'm afraid Her Highness would be gone by the time you acquired her permission.

294
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,000
Tens of thousands of gold?

295
00:22:31,490 --> 00:22:32,990
I have them.

296
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,190
This...

297
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:49,610
This is great. There's hope now.

298
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:53,160
Although there's plenty of gold here, if we wish to create the True Golden Fire,

299
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:57,980
I'm afraid all the silver and gold here will be destroyed.

300
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,150
There's too much gold in the vault.

301
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:05,220
I think it's more convenient for us... to create the fire here.

302
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:12,240
With our current powers, all three of us need to use our powers together to produce a pure True Golden Fire.

303
00:23:52,870 --> 00:24:00,980
<i>I've only managed to build this gold vault. Now, I have to lay waste to all of them.</i>

304
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,010
<i>The killer hornets are here.</i>

305
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,780
<i>There's hope for us to make plenty of gold!</i>

306
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,220
<i>Money!</i>

307
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,880
<i>Money! Don't sleep! Wake up!</i>

308
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:39,990
Let us

309
00:24:41,290 --> 00:24:43,230
begin.

310
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:58,020
<i>For Money's sake, it's worth it.</i>

311
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,260
Burn them.

312
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:14,850
Tan'er?

313
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,390
I'm taking yours.

314
00:26:18,750 --> 00:26:21,060
This is my next move.

315
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,250
Tan'er, are you sure you want to make that move?

316
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,960
If you do so, I'm going to checkmate you.

317
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,360
Wait!

318
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,650
Did you see? Tan'er is trying to cheat again.

319
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,130
- Imperial Father, you cheated when you played with me too.
- Fine.

320
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,730
Tan'er, take it back.

321
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:41,830
Tan'er, do this.

322
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:43,890
Imperial Father won't be able to do anything to you now.

Tan'er, what's the matter?

329
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:23,190
Imperial Father,

330
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:26,770
if only you were real.

331
00:27:26,770 --> 00:27:30,330
If only... everything was real.

332
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:32,200
No, I still have things to do.

333
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,190
I can't stay here.

Could...

335
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:23,470
Could it be that I was mistaken?

Since you're awake, that means Princess Yetan is safe.

386
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:11,000
Right now, you should be worried about our Third Prince.

387
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,370
What happened to him?

388
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,590
He went looking for Second Prince for your sake.

Even now, he hasn't returned yet.

Sir, let me carry her.

391
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:30,900
I'll carry her myself.

392
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:34,180
Feng'er, put me down.

393
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,640
You should leave.

394
00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:40,990
I got ahead of myself.

395
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:42,490
I left the realm without permission.

396
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:44,920
Consort Mother, I failed to protect you.

397
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,730
I know my fault now.

398
00:31:46,730 --> 00:31:50,570
After we go back, please teach me a harsh lesson.

399
00:31:50,570 --> 00:31:54,800
Please use the spikiest cane you can find, okay?

400
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,990
I don't blame you for this.

401
00:31:56,990 --> 00:32:01,480
I just hope that you won't get yourself involved in the power struggle anymore.

402
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,640
I want you to lead a peaceful life.

403
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,980
I haven't lost yet!

404
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,790
I will never stop until the day your name is cleared.

405
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:16,200
Ever since you were born,

406
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:21,760
I never thought of myself as a slave.

407
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,860
I watched over you as you grew up day by day.

408
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,280
I remembered each time you called me "Consort Mother."

409
00:32:30,330 --> 00:32:36,030
I already felt like I was the luckiest person in the world.

410
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:38,570
I... I understand.

411
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:42,600
Consort Mother, you're seriously wounded. You shouldn't speak.

412
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,340
You've remained hidden for a millennium

413
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:48,000
and did all you could

414
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:53,400
to fight for the crown prince's throne for my sake.

415
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:57,490
But today, you lost because of me too.

416
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:01,700
Are you sure this is worthwhile?

417
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,740
Feng'er, put me down.

418
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:10,270
In the future, you should live for your own sake.

I will not put you down!

We've endured so many hardships together.

Sir!

424
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,680
Feng'er, I've lost all of my clan members.

425
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,470
I cannot afford to lose you anymore.

426
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:36,920

Time to have snacks.

438
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:41,690
You didn't eat much at all.

439
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:43,290
This won't do. Here.

440
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:47,100
I already took my eighth bowl. My body will become heaty if I keep taking it.

441
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,630
- Please let me off, okay?
- No.

442
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,680
Your body was invaded by cold qi. You have to nourish it.

443
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,280
All finished.

444
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,320
That's more like it.

445
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,400
Come.

446
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:11,420
I've spent all of your savings.

447
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:14,320
Don't worry. I'll return them to you one day.

448
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,930
You wouldn't have sustained such serious injuries if you didn't try to save me.

449
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:23,610
But even now, I still don't understand why the voidwalkers were after me.

450
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:30,800
Forget it. I guess karma is coming after me since I've committed so many misdeeds.

451
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,700
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

452
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:37,460
Although my savings are gone, I'm going to make money using my true ability.

453
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:39,560
What do you mean? Do you mean scriptwriting?

454
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,890
That's right. Think about it.

455
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:44,820
I deceived the entire Beast Realm for an entire year with Romantic Heroic Chronicles.

456
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,570
That proves that I'm talented at storytelling.

457
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:50,450
But you can't make quick bucks writing scripts.

458
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,670
So what?

459
00:35:52,670 --> 00:35:56,220
Actually, I wanted to tell you this long ago.

460
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:00,390
You're the most important wealth in my heart.

461
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:04,110
You've already won my heart.

462
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:09,820
So, in the future, it doesn't matter how much I earn.

463
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,320
It's fine as long as I can be together with you.

464
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,660
Stop. Don't cry yet.

465
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,520
Here, cover yourself.

466
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,320
I'll get you another bowl of soup.

467
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,520
No, I don't want it.

468
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,850
No. You have to drink it.

469
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:34,450
<i>Who would've expected Heartless Shaodian to have such a kind side?</i>

470
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,080
<i>Seems like I need to change his nickname.</i>

471
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,190
I'll locate the last soul shard.

472
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:43,940
Ziwu, you and the rest can stay and take care of sister-in-law and eldest brother.

473
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,520
What gives?

474
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,800
Last time, I had to watch over Fiery. Now, I have to watch over Heartless?

475
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,640
Stop arguing. We don't have much time.

476
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:55,270
Your Highness.

477
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,510
What were you guys arguing about?

478
00:36:57,510 --> 00:37:00,320
We heard that the Void Empress had deployed additional manpower

479
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,850
to locate the soul shard in both Mortal Realm and Beast Realm.

480
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:04,400
That's why we've decided to split up.

481
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,700
I'll locate Eldest Brother's last soul shard.

482
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:09,810
They'll stay to look after you and Eldest Brother.

483
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,110
It's important to locate the soul shard.

484
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,300
However, protecting Heartless and Fiery is equally important.

485
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,950
Di Lanjue, how's Fiery doing in the Prince's Mansion?

486
00:37:16,950 --> 00:37:19,390
Di Lanjie hid Fiery well.

487
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:22,180
Even the Beast King didn't know about him.

488
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,370
If so, how's my sister doing?

489
00:37:27,810 --> 00:37:31,610
Chaofeng took her away.

490
00:37:31,610 --> 00:37:33,580
Why are you guys only telling me that now?

491
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,490
We were afraid that you might panic.

492
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:41,770
Don't worry. Chaofeng may be despicable, but he's loyal to Princess Yetan.

493
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:47,200
Without him, we would've never been able to escape from the Assassin Assembly Hall.

494
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:48,310
He's trying to kill the soul shard for his desire

495
00:37:48,310 --> 00:37:51,200
and save us so that we can owe him a favor. Chaofeng does know his goals clearly.

496
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,910
It's no wonder Tan'er fell for him.

497
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:55,320
Where are they right now?

498
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,010
Don't panic. I'll ask my underlings to find out.

499
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,240
Sir.

500
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:20,330
How's Consort Mother doing?

501
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,810
Sir, please don't worry.

502
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:24,500
The consort's life is out of danger after Her Highness treated her.

503
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,490
Su Shui is watching over her.

504
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:30,810
Although the consort is safe, you are...

505
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,840
The poison pill given to you by Yingzhao was made with tens of thousands of

506
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,770
snake gallbladder extracted from the Snake clan.

507
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:39,450
Its toxicity cannot be neutralized even by Her Highness.

508
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,650
Is there any news from the Void Patrol Battalion?

509
00:38:42,650 --> 00:38:48,450
Now that the Void Empress has nothing to fear, Dingyun is preparing to abolish the entire battalion.

510
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:53,550
I never expected one careless move to cost me the entire game.

511
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,530
Sir,

512
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:01,290
even though you've lost everything, you won Her Highness's heart.

513
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:03,050
Isn't that worth it?

514
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,350
Right now, I'm literally useless.

515
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,290
The closer she gets to me, the riskier it is for her.

516
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,420
- Tan'er.
- Sister!

517
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,230
I rushed here when I heard that you were here.

518
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,780
I was struck by the Void Frost Poison.

519
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,320
You must've been implicated too.

520
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,840
I'm fine.

521
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:03,900
Are you okay? Have you fully recovered?

522
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:06,370
I'm fine. I'm almost fully healed.

523
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:09,340
I'll be fine after some rest.

524
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,890
It was terrifying.

525
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:12,960
Both Dingyun and the Void Empress were after your lives.

526
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:15,270
You were lucky to escape from their grasp.

527
00:40:15,270 --> 00:40:17,090
Dingyun?

528
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:22,880
Are you saying that the person who tried to kill Heartless in the Assassin Assembly Hall was Dingyun?

529
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,670
That's right.

530
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,200
You mean that Dingyun who swapped our carriages?

531
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:29,930
That's right.

532
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,640
<i>If the person I saw that day was Dingyun,</i>

533
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,020
<i>who was the one who tried to assassinate Wu Dai in Wangliang City?</i>

534
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,210
Kui'er.

535
00:41:04,950 --> 00:41:07,080
Chaofeng? Why did you get up?

536
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:10,280
Great timing. This is your first time meeting Tan'er, right?

537
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,440
Is he Chaofeng, the third prince you mentioned?

538
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:22,680
Yes.

539
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:27,310
This isn't our first encounter, Third Prince.

540
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:35,410
Our carriages were swapped because I saw someone trying to assassinate the Void First Prince, Wu Dai.

541
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,740
And that person is Third Prince.

542
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:44,670
Tan'er, what nonsense are you saying?

543
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:47,890
The person who swapped the carriages was clearly Ding...

544
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:52,720
I expected this to happen when I headed to Assassin Assembly Hall.

545
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,270
I never expected it to happen so soon.

546
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,010
That's right. I'm the one who swapped the carriages.

547
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:14,100
I framed Dingyun for everything to acquire your trust.

548
00:42:16,730 --> 00:42:21,070
But you took on the blame for me when I killed Zhu Jiuyin.

549
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,810
Do you truly think that you can kill Great General Zhulong with your powers alone?

550
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:28,940
<i>I was the one who shifted his neck toward your hairpin.</i>

551
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:34,330
<i>If not, I would've no way to drag a loyal and elegant princess like you</i>

552
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:38,000
into the ditch for my manipulation.

553
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,450
If that's the case,

554
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,480
why did you need to battle the Void Empress for my sake?

555
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:51,800
For your sake?

556
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,380
I came to Assassin Assembly Hall just to kill the second soul shard.

557
