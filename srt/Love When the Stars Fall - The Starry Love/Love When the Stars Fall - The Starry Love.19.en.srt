21
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,800
Come!

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,600
You're coveting my wealth indeed.

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,300
You're seeking death!

24
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,700
Wait! Wait!

25
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:15,500
I have admired you for a long time.

26
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:18,000
I came today to get to know you.

27
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,500
I was tempted by my obsession with you that I sneaked in without permission.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Unexpectedly, as soon as I entered, I stumbled upon the gold.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,200
Please spare me, Hall Master.

30
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,200
- Hall Master, spare me.
- Please spare me.

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,500
- Hall Master, have mercy.
- Please have mercy.

32
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,600
This room is hidden and was set up with mechanisms.

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,800
How did you sneak in here?

34
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,000
They're nothing but some small tricks.

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,700
It's not worth mentioning.

36
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:44,300
You're the Hall Master of the Assassin Assembly Hall, the top assassin in the Beast Realm.

37
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:47,400
Even if you give me the courage, I wouldn't dare to plot against you.

38
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm truly here to get to know you.

39
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:56,100
Since we have met today, why don't I offer myself to you?

40
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,000
You'll have a one-in-a-million beautiful wife without spending a penny.

41
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
What do you think?

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
You need to spend money to have a wife.

43
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,700
Moreover, with your appearance, I wouldn't even take a second glance. So leave.

44
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm a princess with a perfect appearance.

45
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,200
How dare you speak like that?

46
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,700
Scram!

47
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,300
What did I say earlier? For this soul shard, we've spent all our wealth and possessions.

48
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:23,500
It's at least a blessing in disguise and we found the second soul shard.

49
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,500
Now that we've found him, I have ways to make him fall in love with me.

50
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Wasn't Fiery acted out when he first met me?

51
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,300
Fiery merely carries mystic flame within his body. Besides, he has a kind heart.

52
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,800
But you saw what Heartless did at the Assassin Assembly Hall.

53
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
This person is ruthless and not a good person.

54
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,000
How will you deal with him?

55
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:42,100
Heartless Shaodian, where did you get all these indecent desires?

56
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,600
Whose fault do you think this is?

57
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,900
You were the one who triggered the desires of these three soul shards.

58
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:49,100
Heartless would do anything for wealth and possession.

59
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,200
Could it be...

60
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,300
<i>One dish costs 100 thousand spirit beads?</i>

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,600
<i>Heartless Shaodian, I never expected you who looks upright to have learned how to be sneaky and deceptive.</i>

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,900
<i>You took advantage of the three deities first.</i>

63
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:06,500
<i>I'm only giving you a taste of your own medicine and that's all.</i>

64
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:11,200
Don't tell me making me return my winnings had aroused your greed.

65
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,200
It's indeed my fault.

66
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,700
Heartless Shaodian, I will never play mahjong anymore.

67
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,000
Stop whining already. Don't bring that up anymore.

68
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,700
Our priority is to make Heartless bow down under your feet.

69
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:27,500
As the saying goes, a good man will eventually fall for a persistent woman.

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:34,200
As long as I persist, the soul shard will fall in love with me not once, not twice, and thrice.

71
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,000
Stop dreaming.

72
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,600
How is it a dream?

73
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,800
Hubby.

74
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,800
You again.

75
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,900
I'm sure you haven't had breakfast since you're up this early. So I brought you breakfast.

76
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,300
I'm not your hubby.

77
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,300
You broke into my residence yesterday. Today, you're addressing me as your hubby.

78
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Tell me. What exactly do you intend to do?

79
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:09,400
I'll be honest. When I saw you for the first time, I was captivated by your handsome and charming face.

80
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,200
It left a deep impression on me that I can't forget.

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,700
If you don't mind, you can be my hubby.

82
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,000
You're being ridiculous and unreasonable.

83
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,400
Don't lose heart.

84
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,200
Men are creatures who say one thing and mean another.

85
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,600
Perhaps you didn't like the soup dumplings last time.

86
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,800
Today, I have brought more options for you to choose from.

87
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,200
There must be one that suits you.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,400
If you're interested, you can also take me home as one of these options.

89
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,300
Don't move. I've almost finished drawing.

90
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,900
Rest assured.

91
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:14,400
We charge high fees because we focus only on the target without any distractions...

92
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,200
Run!

93
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,900
Get out of here!

94
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't let me see you again!

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,400
What do we do now?

96
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,800
We can't even get close to him.

97
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,800
Perhaps our approaches were not suitable.

98
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,000
Give me some time to think.

99
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:58,800
Heartless has a lot of followers.

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:03,800
If we want the chance to get close to him, we must target those around him first.

101
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
You have a point.

102
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,800
There he is. Three, two, one. Let's go.

103
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,400
Excuse me, Mister. Have you not eaten yet?

104
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,500
We brought you the best stewed meatballs of the Beast Realm.

105
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,500
Try it while it's still hot.

106
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,400
She knows you're tired from your work. So she specially prepared this for you. Come and try it. Have a taste.

107
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
I understand your kind intention.

108
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,400
Assassin Assembly Hall has a rule that we must hand in all gifts given to us by merchants.

109
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,300
If there's nothing else, please leave now.

110
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,500
To be honest, since I met Hero Heartless, his gentle and refined appearance

111
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:47,200
has left a deep impression on me, making me unable to forget and constantly yearning for him.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,200
If I could marry him, my life would not be a waste.

113
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:53,100
Our Hall Master is the top assassin in the Beast Realm.

114
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,000
Don't you know how ruthless he is?

115
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:00,400
I advise you to give up for the sake of the stewed meatballs.

116
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:05,100
Please do me a favor and help me get along with him.

117
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,400
No! Leave.

118
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,300
Tell me this! Your Hall master is someone who's obsessed with wealth.

119
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,600
All of you work so hard to complete your mission.

120
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,700
How much commission does he even pay you?

121
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,800
If you help me win his heart,

122
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,700
I will promote you and increase your salary!

123
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,200
Truly?

124
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,200
My words...

125
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,400
- Carry weight!
- Carry weight!

126
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:29,100
<i>Well, since joining the Assassin Assembly Hall, Master has never been willing to give me a salary.</i>

127
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:32,400
<i>If this matter works, my salary will increase.</i>

128
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:36,100
<i>If it doesn't work, she'll be the one who dies, not me.</i>

129
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,500
Let's do it!

130
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,800
We must know ourselves and the opponent to be successful.

131
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,200
If you want to win our master's heart, you need to have a deep understanding of him.

132
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,800
<i>[Romantic Heroic Chronicles]</i>

133
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,200
- Romantic Heroic Chronicles?
- Romantic Heroic Chronicles?

134
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,400
Precisely.

135
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:00,500
Hall Master wrote this book himself, where he includes all of his great achievements.

136
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:05,200
After reading it, you'll know what kind of person he is.

137
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:10,400
"Captured the Five Great Bandits"?

138
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,000
"Defeated Prince Di Lanjue"?

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,200
How's that possible?

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,000
His Highness has been searching for the soul shards with us the whole year.

141
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,400
He never had the chance to fight him. I don't believe it.

142
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,600
How could it be possible?

143
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:35,560
"The great Hero Heartless gained fame and respect, attracting numerous aspiring talents to join him.

144
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,580
Eventually, he established the Assassin Assembly Hall, which became a powerful force in the region."

145
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,600
<i>It seems there's more to it than meets the eye.</i>

146
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,200
<i>When I see him again, I must ask him directly.</i>

147
00:09:56,400 --> 00:10:00,200
Eldest Brother's only hobby used to be playing the zither and brewing tea.

148
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,100
Now he likes carving flowers on stones.

149
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,000
It's been less than half a day and the entire mansion has turned into a cave.

150
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,200
It's not about the stone flowers.

151
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,600
He just has nowhere else to vent his longing for Qingkui.

152
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,000
He has such a faithful heart.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,800
Indeed, the relationship between Sister-in-law and Eldest Brother has reached the point of enduring all hardships.

154
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:21,800
The flowers?

155
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,600
They look so distasteful.

156
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,200
Those stones are for me to make magic items.

157
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,600
Don't be so stingy.

158
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:32,400
<i>Both of us were named after flowers.</i>

159
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,700
<i>Now, we both have someone who loves us.</i>

160
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:43,600
Hopefully, the trouble of the soul shards will come to pass. So everything can return to peace.

161
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:47,200
The trouble of the soul shards will surely come to pass.

162
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,700
The Prince's Mansion's defense is solid as a rock.

163
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:53,540
Even if the Void Patrol is competent, he won't be able to harm Eldest Brother Fiery one bit.

164
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,070
So don't worry.

165
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,580
Fiery sure is safe and can happily be his stone carver here.

166
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,520
But my...

167
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,900
Kui Kui and Man Man are still outside.

168
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:09,660
Just imagine Chaofeng's cultivation combined with the clever strategies of the Void Patrol Battalion.

169
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,610
If they were caught, what...

170
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,520
What should we do then?

171
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:19,500
Since I'm here, I won't let Qingkui bear such heavy pressure.

172
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,210
Then what do you plan to do?

173
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,330
Are you heading back to stall Chaofeng again?

174
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,920
I want to lure him to attack the Prince's Mansion.

175
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,430
Princess Yetan, what are you saying?

176
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,820
Using defensive tactics to attack them?

177
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,550
- Won't this be too risky?
- What are you afraid of?

178
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,930
You have the number one magic item expert of the four realms here.

179
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,420
I dare not brag about the rest.

180
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:48,040
But anyone who dares to come to my Prince's Mansion will not leave alive.

181
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,950
They'll have their bodies shattered, bones crushed, and ashes scattered.

182
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,570
Absolutely not.

183
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,560
We only need to protect the soul shard.

184
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,630
Don't harm him.

185
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:00,330
This is a good plan.

186
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:04,660
But what do we use as bait?

187
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:30,140
- What kind of tea is this?
- Sir, it's Laojunmei tea from the Mortal Realm.

188
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:31,560
What about the princess's health-preserving tea?

189
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,630
We haven't been able to find any soul shards lately.

190
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:35,770
You've been upset and already finished it.

191
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:40,660
Besides, the princess isn't here, and I don't know how to make tea.

192
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,260
Sir!

193
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,200
Any news?

194
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,440
We found this at the human-beast border.

195
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,520
After comparing, it's exactly the same as the one beside the stone hut in Yuewo Village.

196
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,800
I believe it was made by the soul shard.

197
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,640
Green granite.

198
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,560
This is a special material used by the Beast King's tribe.

199
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,850
Beast Tribe?

200
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:15,670
Princess Yetan and the Beast Tribe's prince are close friends.

201
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:19,660
Could it be that they went to the Beast Tribe because of our pursuit?

202
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:25,590
Hey, hey. You got it.

203
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:26,800
That's not bad.

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,980
That felt great.

205
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,540
Let's go for a drink.

206
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:33,100
Sure, let's go.

207
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,525
<i>[Closed]</i>

208
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:27,230
<i>Master's whereabouts have always been mysterious.</i>

209
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:30,450
<i>During closing time, he never lets us into the hall.</i>

210
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:35,470
<i>But before I finish work, he'll ask me to brew a pot of fine tea for him.</i>

211
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:38,430
<i>This is Beast Realm's finest tea, Shuxu Tea.</i>

212
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:45,900
<i>If you bring it to him and share a cup of tea under the lamp, it would surely be beneficial to your relationship.</i>

213
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:12,530
We'll put another act again tomorrow, and it'll surely boost our reputation.

214
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,510
You? What are you doing here?

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,800
So you killed people and acted ruthlessly in Assassin Assembly Hall

216
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,360
to deceive your subordinates and customers?

217
00:15:54,360 --> 00:16:00,290
Then does that mean your reputation as the Beast Realm's top assassin is also fake?

218
00:16:00,290 --> 00:16:02,440
Stop spouting nonsense!

219
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,760
- Give me the hand!
- No!

220
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,740
- Give it to me!
- No!

221
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,760
- Give it back!
- No!

222
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,190
- Let go!
- No!

223
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:13,270
- Give it back!
- No!

224
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,840
I'm not giving it back!

225
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:26,010
- Get off of me!
- No way.

226
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:28,720
- Get down!
- Still not confessing, huh?

227
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,410
If you want me to get down, use your real skills then.

228
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:38,030
Steadfast as a rock, strength of the mountains, come to my aid!

229
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:42,620
Get off of me! Get off!

230
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,910
You can't even undo such a basic spell.

231
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,640
Yet you still want to trick me?

232
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,620
Listen, here. Your men are outside.

233
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:57,410
So tell me. If they see you in such a state, do you think they'll still risk their lives for you?

234
00:16:57,410 --> 00:16:59,350
If you don't tell me the truth, I'll call them in.

235
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:00,540
You wouldn't dare!

236
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,830
- My fellow buddies...
- No, please don't.

237
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:05,400
Don't call them.

238
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,010
I'll tell you.

239
00:17:09,330 --> 00:17:14,240
This appearance is all I could remember since I was born.

240
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,140
<i>I don't know where I came from.</i>

241
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,290
<i>And I had neither family nor friends.</i>

242
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:22,260
<i>But I've always had the desire to make money.</i>

243
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:25,260
<i>- So I worked hard to earn it.
- Stop dawdling! Hurry up! </i>

244
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,190
<i>When I first arrived in the Beast Realm, I did any work I could find.</i>

245
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,610
<i>I moved sandbags, ran errands, and ran small businesses.</i>

246
00:17:30,610 --> 00:17:32,810
<i>Pardon me, please move aside. Please make way for me.</i>

247
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,260
<i>- Passing through! Make way.
- Next!</i>

248
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,740
<i>But the money I made was not worth the amount of work I put in.</i>

249
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,810
<i>Xiao Li. Here you go.</i>

250
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:44,780
<i>- Heartless!
- I'm right here!</i>

251
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:48,710
<i>Heartless, this is your pay for today.</i>

252
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:51,460
<i>Don't drop it. Work harder.</i>

253
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:00,300
<i>What are you looking at? That's a lot.</i>

254
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,810
<i>Thank you. Thank you very much.</i>

255
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:05,330
<i>Next!</i>

256
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:27,730
<i>Then I heard the fastest way to make money in the Beast Realm is to be an assassin.</i>

257
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,470
<i>But what to do? My cultivation was too low.</i>

258
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,840
<i>I can't even handle such work.</i>

259
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,430
<i>So I went to the food stalls to inquire about the assassins' news.</i>

260
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,070
<i>Waiter! Coming, sir!</i>

261
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:41,890
<i>- What would you like to have?
- Bring me your best wine and best dishes.</i>

262
00:18:41,890 --> 00:18:42,910
<i>All right. Thank you, Sir.</i>

263
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,260
<i>I'll have them ready. Please wait.</i>

264
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:46,340
<i>Let's drink. Cheers.</i>

265
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,780
<i>Drink up.</i>

266
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,240
<i>Yesterday, I killed Mr. Liu, the moneybag and made 200 gold taels.</i>

267
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,530
<i>Drink up. Money isn't an issue. Cheers!</i>

268
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:00,540
<i>- Cheers!
- Drink!</i>

269
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,600
<i>Help yourselves. Cheers.</i>

270
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:07,610
<i>It looks like assassins make money the quickest in the Beast Realm.</i>

271
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,500
<i>You're right about that. You said it.</i>

272
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,380
<i>It only happens to assassins in the Beast Realm.</i>

273
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,590
<i>But I found that no one claims the credit for the unsolved cases.</i>

274
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:17,430
<i>So I claimed them, compiled them into a book,</i>

275
00:19:17,430 --> 00:19:20,500
<i>built my reputation, and used it to establish the Assassin Assembly Hall.</i>

276
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:31,640
That's how I went from Heartless to Hero Heartless.

277
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,370
Miss. No, I mean, Heroine.

278
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,910
No, I mean, Sister Fairy.

279
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:38,190
Don't call me, "Sister".

280
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:42,750
Fairy, you mustn't expose me.

281
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:47,160
Or else my daily income of hundreds of gold will be cut off.

282
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:53,270
So this book is all just your own boasting and none of it's true?

283
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:58,630
What about the capture of the Five Great Bandits?

284
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,130
That was just them killing each other over the spoils.

285
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:05,370
Well, what about the capture of Prince Di Lanjue?

286
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,630
Di Lanjue...

287
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,460
He disappeared over a year ago. So I made up a story.

288
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:14,060
I almost got into trouble with Beast King with that one.

289
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:18,480
So you just make up stories to claim credit for any unclaimed cases in the Beast Realm, huh?

290
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,260
Yes.

291
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,610
But it's making money. It's nothing shameful.

292
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:26,290
What about the mechanism in your residence?

293
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,640
It's just some small tricks.

294
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,540
It was to scare people.

295
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:32,530
Has no one ever suspected you of you doing this?

296
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,300
Well... Of course, there are.

297
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:40,900
Normally, besides collecting money, I keep a low profile and won't easily show my hand.

298
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:46,270
Even if they have doubts, they wouldn't dare to challenge me.

299
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:54,810
In just one year, you came up with so many tricks.

300
00:20:54,810 --> 00:20:56,040
Top money lover.

301
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,250
You're flattering me.

302
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,890
Sister Fairy.

303
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:01,720
Fairy.

304
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,680
As long as you don't expose me, I...

305
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,970
I'll do anything you want.

306
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,630
What do you want?

307
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:14,260
Come here.

308
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:20,090
This is what I've been waiting to hear.

309
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:24,400
I heard that in the Beast Realm, when a man and a woman are in a relationship,

310
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,050
they're called "Mandarin Ducks."

311
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:30,280
As long as you agree to be with me, I'll keep it a secret.

312
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,970
Wait. You see.

313
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:38,440
Since you already know my true identity, why bother being in a relationship with me?

314
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:43,060
I have no cultivation and am a liar, I'm really not worthy of you.

315
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,030
Fellow buddies outside...

316
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:48,570
No, please don't.

317
00:21:48,570 --> 00:21:50,290
Don't shout.

318
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:52,490
Will you do it?

319
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:53,600
I'll be honest.

320
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,200
It costs a lot of money to be in a relationship.

321
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,200
You see, if you buy this and that for a girl that I love,

322
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,100
what if I have to marry her and hand in all of my property,

323
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,800
my heart would...

324
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:09,700
You don't have to worry about this. I'm not after your money.

325
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,200
I'm after you.

326
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,700
Moreover, not only will I not spend a penny of your money, but I'll also help you make money.

327
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,600
Really?

328
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:18,100
Yes.

329
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,300
In that case,

330
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,800
I'm willing to make a bet with you.

331
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,000
If you can make 5,000 gold taels within half a month,

332
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,200
I will get on my knees and submit myself to you.

333
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,100
But if you fail, from then onward, don't pester me, and more importantly, don't reveal my secrets to anyone.

334
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,200
What do you think?

335
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,800
<i>This woman is persistent and is difficult to deal with.</i>

336
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:46,000
<i>As long as she agrees to the bet and sees how difficult it is to make money, she'll back off herself.</i>

337
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,500
<i>He thinks he can scare me off with this bet.</i>

338
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,600
<i>This is fine too.</i>

339
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,300
<i>Blackmailing may work for now.</i>

340
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,900
<i>But it won't work forever.</i>

341
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:55,900
<i>Heartless loves money more than life.</i>

342
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:00,100
<i>As long as I can make money, he'll look at me in a different light.</i>

343
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,600
All right. It's a deal.

344
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,000
Deal then.

345
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,600
So tell me, how you're going to make 5,000 gold taels?

346
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,800
I'm skilled in gambling.

347
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,800
I only need to go to the gambling house to...

348
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,900
Miss, didn't I tell you

349
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:18,400
I did any work I could find back then?
<i>[How to Make Money by Heartless]</i>

350
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,800
You did all kinds of jobs?

351
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,600
All of them?

352
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,100
You even graded them based on the speed of making money?

353
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:44,100
Miss. If you want to be in a relationship with me,

354
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,300
you have to move sacks for 3,680 years,

355
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:54,000
sell magic items for 580 years,

356
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:59,000
or kill 168 evil beasts in the Beast Realm.

357
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,600
<i>So he's trying to make me give up.</i>

358
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,500
<i>You really don't know me.</i>

359
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,300
I'm not going to use the foolish ways you mentioned.

360
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:10,100
Then what are you going to do?

361
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,000
Tomorrow morning, I'll take you somewhere.

362
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,400
Luckily you told us to mask our scent,

363
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:34,100
and we were able to avoid the Beast Army and arrive at the Prince's Mansion.

364
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,300
But Sir, I heard Di Lanjue is very cunning.

365
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,400
I'm sure there are protective formations and artifacts inside and outside the mansion.

366
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:45,800
Even if the soul shard is inside, can we even go in?

367
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,500
Sir, why don't I return to the Void to bring reinforcement?

368
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,100
Come back here.

369
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:55,200
If we mobilize troops, Wu Dai and the Empress will definitely be aware of the soul shard's whereabouts.

370
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:59,300
If we want to assassinate the soul shard, we must catch them off guard and attack them unexpectedly.

371
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,700
Otherwise, if the Beast Army surrounds us, we will have no way to retreat.

372
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,200
How about this?

373
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,800
Let's disguise ourselves as the Beast Army and sneak in.

374
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,500
Are you a dog? Can you turn into a dog?

375
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,600
Then what are we supposed to do then?

376
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:16,600
Find a spot where the defense is weakest and go straight in.

377
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,400
All right.

378
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,700
It's such a personal token,

379
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,600
but how could the soul shard be so careless to lose it, and let it coincidentally be picked up by our men?

380
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,200
Could it be a trap?

381
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,900
Why isn't Chaofeng taking the bait?

382
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,000
Could it be that the stone flower I threw out wasn't picked up by them?

383
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:50,300
Since the Void Patrol can deduce the location of my brother's soul shard

384
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,800
and Yuewo Village from the slightest clues, he must be very scheming.

385
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,000
We're taking a huge risk with this plan.

386
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,700
What if he sees through it?

387
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,800
Chaofeng has always been decisive and ruthless.

388
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,800
Now the temptation of the soul shard is big enough for him.

389
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,200
He'll take the risk.

390
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,100
Then I'll remove some guards at the entrance to lure him.

391
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,500
No.

392
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,500
We have to increase the guards.

393
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,400
The more they feel like they're facing a big threat, the better.

394
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,300
Sir, look.

395
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:46,200
They've increased Prince's Mansion defense.

396
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:51,200
They're trying to lure us in and also increasing their guards on the surface.

397
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,600
Isn't the pretty obvious?

398
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,400
Yetan isn't a fool.

399
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,500
If you put it that way, there could be no trickery involved.

400
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,900
I still have doubts.

401
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:06,800
But killing the soul shard is my best chance to turn things around.

402
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,200
I must not miss this chance.

403
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,900
Even if the Prince's Mansion is a dangerous place,

404
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,000
we must still take the risk.

405
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,600
Let's go.

406
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,700
Why is there no one inside?

407
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,000
Sir, we fell for their trick!

408
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,400
I know that. Shut up!

409
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,260
S-Sir...

410
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,600
Look up there!

411
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:46,300
You had to go down the wrong path instead of the right way.

412
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,400
You didn't expect it, did you?

413
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:52,500
This Prince's Mansion of mine is the most powerful magic item in the world.

414
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,400
You still want to kill the soul shard?

415
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,800
Take this!

416
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,500
You can wait inside for Shaodian Youqin to come back.

417
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,800
Don't be too proud.

418
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:04,400
It was Yetan who first thought of Chaofeng's thoughts and outsmarted them.

419
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,300
That's how we manage to catch them.

420
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,300
Without my magic item, this plan wouldn't have worked anyway.

421
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:11,400
It's the art of war.

422
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:14,600
It was Sister Yetan who made the greatest contribution.

423
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,600
All right.

424
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,800
Whatever you say.

425
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,800
Why does this rope get tighter the more I struggle?

426
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,400
Let me help you.

427
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,500
Try harder to loosen it, Shui'er.

428
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,200
No, it's still tight.

429
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:41,400
It won't work.

430
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,200
This is the Deity-Binding Rope specially made by the Beast Tribe.

431
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,800
Royal father used this to subdue the Heavenly Emperor during the battle in Guixu.

432
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:54,300
Sir, we've always proceeded with caution and never engaged in battles without preparation.

433
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,000
We were only greedy and reckless for success once.

434
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Only this one time and we ended up being tied like merfolk in the sea.

435
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,300
How do I look as merfolk, Sir?

436
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,900
We were not greedy and reckless for success but betrayed.

437
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:09,400
Di Lanjue couldn't have come up with such a strategy.

438
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,600
It must be Qingkui.

439
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,300
Princess Qingkui?

440
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:20,400
Are you saying she used her beauty to stall you

441
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:24,000
and then set a trap for you based on her understanding of you?

442
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,700
After all you've done for her, she's still an ingrate.

443
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:31,100
Perhaps she has her reasons.

444
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,200
It's all my fault.

445
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,100
I shouldn't have brought her.

446
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,400
In short, we shouldn't have switched the brides and dug our own holes.

447
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,600
You even ended up having feelings for her.

448
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,900
Look at us now.

449
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:47,400
She's going to bury us alive here.

450
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:03,200
Your Highness.

451
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:08,300
When this is over, we'll return to the Void.

452
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,000
I'm afraid you'll have to stay here these days.

453
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,600
Princess Qingkui, you don't need to return to the Void anymore.

454
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,900
As the Empyrean Consort, it's your duty to protect the soul shard.

455
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,700
I forgot about that.

456
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,500
Chaofeng.

457
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,200
I forgot that two people with different goals can't walk together.

458
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,200
You can be angry with me.

459
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:40,400
But you know that I'm not doing this to harm you.

460
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,000
I'm considering our future.

461
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,400
Future?

462
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:46,000
If I lose the position of Crown Prince,

463
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,900
my mother and thousands of soldiers from the Void Patrol Battalion will all die a tragic death.

464
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:52,200
Here you are, talking about the future?

465
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,000
I've said everything I needed to say.

466
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,900
If you are still so stubborn, there's nothing I can do.

467
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,000
You should rest now.

468
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,600
I will come back tomorrow.

469
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,400
No need.

470
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,500
Do we have to give up our feelings

471
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:22,200
just because we have different standpoints?

472
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,600
We're different.

473
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,100
You grew up with privileges since childhood.

474
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:27,900
You can be generous and benevolent, and bring good fortune to the people.

475
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,200
But me?

476
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,800
I come from a lowly background.

477
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,600
I've struggled hard to get to where I am today.

478
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:36,800
I won't tolerate any disloyalty from those around me.

479
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:46,000
If you refuse to let me go today, then when Shaodian Youqin returns,

480
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,200
it'll be the time for us to part ways forever.

488
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,900
Thanks to Sister Yetan that we managed to trap this hateful Void Patrol.

489
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,400
I get upset at the thought of him trying to kill my brother.

490
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,900
That's right. He's lucky that we're not killing him.

491
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,500
If he still doesn't know what's good for him, I have plenty of magic items to make his life a living hell.

492
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,600
If you're still not satisfied, I can help you.

493
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:14,800
How can you help?

494
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:15,800
There are plenty of ways.

495
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,200
I have a magic item that can make people extremely hungry.

496
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,500
We can use it on him, and we won't give him any water or food.

497
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,400
Starve him to death.

498
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,000
Yes, starve him to death.

499
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:34,300
Princess Yetan, are you sad?

500
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,900
I'm just tired.

501
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,100
Then why are you crying?

502
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,700
Well, why don't you get some rest?

503
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,700
Let's go.

504
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Sir, how did you let her fool you?

505
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,400
How did she manage to fool you?

506
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:30,200
Why did you let her fool you?

507
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:31,700
Stop talking meaningless things!

508
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,800
Can't you see her intention?

509
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:33,800
We don't need you to say more.

510
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:34,800
What intention?

511
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Using his feelings was her intention.

512
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:39,400
- How dare you say that about her?
- Why can't I?

513
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:40,400
Third Prince is right.

514
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,700
He should be more decisive and make a clean break.

515
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Shut up!

516
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,800
Why did you take me here?

517
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Where are we?

518
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,000
Is... Is this the good idea you meant?

519
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:16,200
This place is where the most powerful killer hornet resides in the Mortal Realm.

520
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,830
I have sent Man Man to the market to buy a large batch of killer hornet ointments.

521
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:24,700
Then we just need to go to the evil district and release these hornets.

522
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,500
So the villains will buy the medicine, and then we can collect the money.

523
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,100
Clever.

524
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,900
<i>I didn't expect her to be this smart.</i>

525
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:38,000
I think it's indeed a good trick.

526
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,800
But where did you get so much money to buy the ointments?

527
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,200
On credit with your name.

528
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:47,600
You spend my money again.

529
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,800
There, there.

530
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
You need to invest to earn more money.

531
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:54,400
Go and trap the hornets.

532
00:36:54,900 --> 00:36:57,100
- You want me to go?
- Hubby.

533
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,400
Stop it. Don't call me that.

534
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,200
Nothing good happens when you call me that.

535
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,500
Before you make money, just call me by my name.

536
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:06,000
I don't care if I make any, you're still my hubby.

537
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,200
Things like catching killer hornets should be the work of a husband.

538
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,700
- Go!
- No!

539
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,600
I don't want to die.

540
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,000
The killer hornets are venomous.

541
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,200
What if I die?

542
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,500
Not only will you lose money, but you will also lose a wife who can make money.

543
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:17,900
It'll be a huge loss for you.

544
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,200
Did you say venomous?

545
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,400
Then you go.

546
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,800
I want money and my life. But I don't really want a wife.

547
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,200
You're greedy and not loyal.

548
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,400
I'm trying to make money for you here. Is this how you treat me?

549
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,800
Fine. How about this?

550
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,400
If you don't go and trap the hornets yourself, the deal is off and we'll go separate ways.

551
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,600
I'll go!

552
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:44,900
- What's this?
- Light it.

553
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,600
Don't get stung.

554
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:32,000
