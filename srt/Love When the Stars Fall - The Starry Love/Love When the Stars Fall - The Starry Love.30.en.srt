You've healed and saved the lives of many voidwalkers.

22
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,400
You've won the hearts of our people.

23
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:08,500
You'll surely be a great helper to First Prince in the future.

24
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,000
First Prince, you know where my heart lies.

25
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Tan Tan, marry me.

26
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,400
I promise I will treat you well.

00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,660
Good.

28
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,990
Relay my orders.

29
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:42,800
A banquet shall be held in three days in the Void

30
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:47,040
to celebrate Wu Dai and Chaofeng.

00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,520

- Congratulations, First Prince!

00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,800
Congratulations, Void Tyrant!

36
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:04,800
This is great news.

00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,200
<i>I'll see how much longer you can hold out.</i>

38
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Highness, what do we do?

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,100
The Void Empress has already sent over the wedding robes.

40
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:34,600
Are you and His Highness actually going to marry someone else?

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,400
You may leave first.

42
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,200
Yes.

43
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,200
Why did you stop me back in Fenyuan Hall?

44
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,300
If I resisted till the end, we…

45
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,000
You'd have fallen into the Void Empress's trap.

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,800
The Void Empress had it all planned.

47
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:58,900
If we agreed to the marriage, First Prince would owe her a favor.

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:04,100
If we publicly objected, she would use this opportunity to impose guilt on us.

49
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,600
I underestimated the Void Empress.

50
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:12,500
She has us in a dilemma with no viable way out of this.

51
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,700
It's all my fault.

52
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,600
I shouldn't have come back.

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,100
If we had gone to the White Bamboo Valley, none of this would've happened.

54
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,200
The Void Patrol Battalion is your heart and soul.

55
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,000
If it were me, I would've returned, too.

56
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,900
There's no other choice.

57
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,600
I must leave with you this time.

58
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,300
What about the Void Patrol Battalion?

59
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,700
I can leave it to Jia Louluo.

60
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,400
With the protection of the Saintess of the Snake clan, they'll be fine.

61
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
All right.

62
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,400
I'm sorry to put you through this.

63
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,300
As long as we can be together, none of this is suffering to me.

64
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
All right.

65
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,900
I'll go to Jia Louluo and tell her everything right now.

66
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,900
She is in love with Wu Dai.

67
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,000
She will help us.

68
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,500
Fairy, Immortal Tuiyun did this for your sake.

69
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,800
Please don't stay angry with him.

70
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,700
I'm not angry at him.

71
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,200
It's all that Qingkui's fault.

72
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,700
Instead of harming her, I harmed cousin.

73
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,100
If he refuses to stay as an Empyrean, I won't be able to become the Empyrean Consort.

74
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:33,500
If Empyrean Xuanshang does step down, Immortal Qingheng will surely catch His Majesty's eye.

75
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,200
Why not consider him, Fairy?

76
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,900
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,000
You know I have feelings for my cousin!

78
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,600
It's true that I want to become the Empyrean Consort. But I would still marry him even if I can't.

79
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,400
I know. But Qingkui has His Highness wrapped around her finger.

80
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,500
I worry that you might not even be able to become his concubine.

81
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,700
What's so good about that Qingkui?

82
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,200
Youqin would even give up his title for her.

83
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:01,200
Her actions and mannerisms are unbefitting of an Empyrean Consort!

84
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,100
That's right. She wears footwear on her head, steals items from the Heavenly Realm,

85
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,300
and escapes to the Mortal Realm without permission.

86
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,200
Even those rumors about her zither skills turned out to be fake.

87
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,800
How did the human emperor raise such a daughter?

88
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,000
If I didn't know any better, I would think Emperor Tun sent us a fake

89
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,100
because he couldn't bear to part with his daughter.

90
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,000
A fake?

91
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,800
Go to Tianpa Hall right now and find me some clues!

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,000
You're kidding, Fairy.

93
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Impersonating the Empyrean Consort is a serious crime.

94
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,700
I was only making assumptions.

95
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,600
The tea is cold. I'll get you another pot of tea.

96
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,200
Your Majesty, the Grand Chancellor requests an audience.

97
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:56,200
Let him in.

98
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,700
Yes.

99
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,390
Your Majesty.

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:09,100
Grand Chancellor.

101
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
The Void has issued an announcement to the four realms.

102
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,700
First Prince, Wu Dai was named Crown Prince.

103
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,000
He will marry Princess Yetan in three days.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,800
The wedding invitation came today.

105
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,200
<i>[Wedding Invitation]</i>

106
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,300
Why so rushed?

107
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,400
Is three days from now an auspicious date?

108
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,400
The odd thing is, it is not.

109
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,100
The Void…

110
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,300
Have they no respect at all?

111
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:40,400
The crown prince of the Void's wedding is set in three days, and we were only informed today.

112
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,600
They decided this matter so informally.

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,400
He will marry Princess
Yetan in three days.

114
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,400
There is no need for Your Majesty to be upset.

115
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,400
Moreover, Princess Yetan is a cursed being.

116
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,200
Leave her be.

117
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,700
Your Majesty, the Void is a dangerous place.

118
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:58,900
I would suggest Your Majesty not attend the wedding.

119
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:02,300
You want me not to attend the wedding?

120
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:06,200
Well, we should at least send some hefty gifts to them.

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:09,400
We can't let the Void criticize us for lacking in etiquette.

122
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,000
Your Majesty is right.

123
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,500
I will make the arrangements right away.

124
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,000
Wait.

125
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,100
Yetan has a lot of portraits of Wu Dai in her chambers.

126
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,800
Have my painter paint a portrait of them together and send it to them.

127
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,500
I…

128
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,700
Wu Dai will eventually become the Void Tyrant.

129
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,900
It would be in our interest to be in his good graces.

130
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,800
Your Majesty is thoughtful.

131
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,300
I'll have them get it done as soon as possible.

132
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,200
Thank you, Grand Chancellor.

133
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,600
<i>Yetan has always admired that Wu Dai.</i>

134
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,800
<i>Letting her marry himwould make her happy.</i>

135
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,000
<i>No matter what, </i>

136
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,400
<i>at least Kui'er and Xuanshang's marriage is something that pleases me.</i>

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,700
Your Majesty, Yetan and Chaofeng intend to elope and flee the Void.

138
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:13,600
Good.

139
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,800
I thought Chaofeng would act the second His Majesty bestowed the marriage.

140
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:24,200
When they leave the Void, arrest them and bring them back immediately.

141
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:28,800
Yes. I will not let them escape this time.

142
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,500
General Wuyun has arrived.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,700
Your Majesty, these are gifts sent by the Mortal Realm.

144
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:46,200
First Prince has ordered me to send them all to you.

145
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,000
His Highness also wants to thank Your Majesty for granting his marriage to Princess Yetan.

146
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,300
These gifts should be given to Your Majesty.

147
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,400
First Prince is thoughtful.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:56,300
Relay my thanks to him.

149
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,700
Yes.

150
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:07,800
First Prince is grateful to Your Majesty indeed.

151
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:12,800
Apparently, Emperor Tun made an excuse and said he would not be attending the wedding.

152
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:16,000
The human race has always feared the Void.

153
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Back then, the immortals wished to marry the human First Princess

154
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,600
because of that once-in-a-million-year auspicious sign.

155
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,400
The Void Tyrant was unhappy, and that's why he sent us his second daughter.

156
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:31,700
If we kill Emperor Tun's daughter, he will not let the matter go easily.

157
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,800
The strongest rules all.

158
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,400
That is the way of the four realms.

159
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,000
That's…

160
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,600
Is the current Crown Princess an impostor?

161
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,800
Yetan's conduct is hypocritical and despicable.

162
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,600
I thought that was just the ill habit of the human race.

163
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:17,000
But now, it looks like Emperor Tun fears the Void Tyrant.

164
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:22,200
<i>He would never allow his daughter to marry into the Void with her medical skills.</i>

165
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,400
If the woman in the portrait is Yetan, then our Crown Princess

166
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:30,000
must be the first princess of the human race, Princess Qingkui.

167
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,700
Well-versed in the art of medicine.

168
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:35,300
Obedient and virtuous.

169
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,900
When we were pursuing the soul shards in the Beast Realm,

170
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>I thought that Qingkui by his side was fierce and decisive.</i>

171
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,500
She carried herself quite like a voidwalker.

172
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,500
So his second daughter would've been easier to marry into the Void.

173
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,000
But why would the first princess end up marrying into the Void instead?

174
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,800
Who cares how she ended up here?

175
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,200
We can't let such a wonderful opportunity slip away.

176
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,400
So…

177
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:05,200
What do you wish to do, Your Majesty?

178
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,700
What do you think will happen if His Majesty learns of this on the day of the wedding?

179
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,500
His Majesty would kill the fake on the spot.

180
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,200
Chaofeng will surely resist.

181
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,300
When that happens, both of them will not escape death.

182
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:26,300
If my guess is right, Emperor Tun should be unaware of this as well.

183
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:30,600
Otherwise, he would not have sent this portrait as a gift.

184
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
Head to the Mortal Realm and bring Emperor Tun here at once.

185
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,500
I'll stall Chaofeng.

186
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:43,400
I want Emperor Tun to witness this magnificent show himself.

187
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,600
Understood.

188
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,300
Yun'er,

189
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:02,600
if only you were still here…

190
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:24,480
There's a piece missing.

191
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:48,080
Who are you?

192
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,830
Princess Yetan's wedding is tomorrow.

193
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,830
I've come to invite Your Majesty to attend the wedding in the Void.

194
00:13:54,830 --> 00:13:58,340
Well… I've written to the Void Tyrant.

195
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,690
I have matters I need to attend to. I can't attend the wedding.

196
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:02,210
His Majesty has given the orders.

197
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:05,410
Please come with us at once, Your Majesty.

198
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,010
No… I have things I need to do!

199
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:10,960
The court can't be without the emperor!

200
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,800
Have you arranged everything with the Saintess?

201
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:17,930
- Yes.
- Sir!

202
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,353
Sir, Her Majesty has deployed heavy forces at the Passage of Twilight.

203
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:27,250
No matter how difficult it is, we must leave the Void.

204
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:31,143
Haichao, I'm powerless right now.

205
00:14:31,143 --> 00:14:32,710
I'll be counting on you.

206
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,610
Sir, rest assured.

207
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:44,550
- Saintess.
- Saintess.

208
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,630
Sir, our plan has changed.

209
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,830
What happened?

210
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:50,930
Her Majesty has brought Emperor Tun to the Void in the name of attending the wedding.

211
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,413
Imperial Father?

212
00:14:53,413 --> 00:14:56,380
You guys should leave first. I'll rescue His Majesty.

213
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,160
Emperor Tun hasn't been seen since his arrival.

214
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,410
We don't know where he is being kept by Her Majesty. How will you save him?

215
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:03,973
It's too late.

216
00:15:03,973 --> 00:15:06,500
Emperor Tun will be at the wedding.

217
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,260
We'll find a way to save him then.

218
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:10,080
You've lost all your powers.

219
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:13,351
How will you survive if you try to save my imperial father?

220
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,463
What's this?

221
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,680
A sacred item of my clan.

222
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,220
Cultivated from the snake biles of our late matriarchs.

223
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,040
It cures one of all effects of snake venom.

224
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,450
Take it, and you'll recover your powers in six hours.

225
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:41,060
It is the duty of the Saintess to protect this item.

226
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:44,330
How will you answer your clan if you give this to me?

227
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,250
Tan'er cured me. And you left me in charge of your Void Patrol Battalion.

228
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:52,093
Consider this a token of my appreciation.

229
00:15:52,093 --> 00:15:56,360
As long as I don't say anything, no one will know about this for the time being.

230
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,993
Stop hesitating.

231
00:15:59,993 --> 00:16:01,230
The wedding is tonight.

232
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,870
You must prepare at once.

233
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,920
If all goes well tonight, we'll meet again.

234
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:12,790
Thank you, Saintess.

235
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:14,333
Hurry up.

236
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:28,130
Her personality reminds me of Tan'er.

237
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:31,000
Loyal. Genuine.

238
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:34,240
She lives without regrets.

239
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:41,060
Sir, did you know that by giving her the Void Patrol Battalion, she would give you the sacred treasure?

240
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:43,510
This really wasn't within my plans.

241
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,233
Kui'er, I'm going back to the Void Patrol Battalion now.

242
00:16:48,233 --> 00:16:51,261
We'll leave right after we save your imperial father.

243
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:00,010
Be safe.

244
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,400
<i>In the end, I can't rely on any of them. I have to do things myself.</i>

245
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,000
<i>Why don't I have loyal servants like Husui and Man Man?</i>

246
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,840
<i>[Tianpa Hall]</i>

247
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,570
<i>How do I get inside?</i>

248
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:58,150
<i>Don't! Don't put me into the water…</i>

249
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,990
<i>You cursed servant!</i>

250
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,610
<i>When I get my chance, I'll exile you from the Heavenly Realm!</i>

251
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,940
I'll take care of you later.

252
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:41,100
You're back, Your Highness. I washed some grapes for you. I've left them on the table.

253
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,773
All right.

254
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,390
Have some grapes.

255
00:19:58,460 --> 00:19:59,580
No.

256
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,900
Youqin is still locked up in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice. I have no appetite.

257
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,290
Then, I'll eat them myself.

258
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:10,900
Why is the floor wet?

259
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,940
Yan probably spilled some water.

260
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,660
That new girl, Yan'er, is diligent at work.

261
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,660
The Xia clan sent me some gifts as an apology a few days ago.

262
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,620
I think they sent me some clothes. Give some of them to Yan'er.

263
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:23,460
I've been working for you for so long.

264
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,860
I even stole His Highness's divine bull for you.

265
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:28,480
I don't see you giving me any clothes.

266
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,080
You ingrate. I've given you plenty of things.

267
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,873
<i>Again?</i>

268
00:20:35,873 --> 00:20:36,781
<i>Let me go!</i>

269
00:20:36,781 --> 00:20:40,580
Oh, right. I heard from Feichi that the Void had named their crown prince.

270
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,700
Who is it?

271
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,960
I think it's Wu Dai.

272
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,640
My sister's heart is with Chaofeng. She would never marry Wu Dai.

273
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,880
Maybe ask her, using the Rainbow Whisperer?

274
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,380
Tan'er? Is it you, Tan'er?

275
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,080
Sister, I heard Wu Dai was named the crown prince.

276
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,530
Are you going to marry him?

277
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:21,300
I may have married into the Void by mistake, but I've already chosen Chaofeng as my fated one.

278
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,260
<i>There's no way I would marry anyone else.</i>

279
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:26,700
- So Chaofeng and I plan to…
- Princess Yetan.

280
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,010
What are you and Chaofeng planning?

281
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,340
It is time.

282
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,920
Please proceed to Fenyuan Hall.

283
00:21:40,660 --> 00:21:43,380
Sister? Sister?

284
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,960
Say something, Sister!

285
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,620
I… I can't hear anything anymore.

286
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,680
Is it broken?

287
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:55,540
I'll take this to His Highness and ask him to fix this.

288
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:58,740
If Wu Dai is named the crown prince, what should we do?

289
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:00,060
Don't worry.

290
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:02,700
Chaofeng has more ideas and schemes than the holes of a hornet's nest.

291
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:04,980
It's in his territory. He'll come up with something.

292
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm going to see Youqin to discuss this.

293
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,680
- Your Highness! Your Highness!
- What is it?

294
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:32,171
Take the hand warmer with you so you won't be cold.

295
00:22:32,171 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm off.

296
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,680
Take care!

297
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,313
Got it.

298
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,633
Yan'er!

299
00:22:43,633 --> 00:22:46,020
Her Highness gave you two sets of clothes from the Xia clan.

300
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,500
Come and get them later.

301
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,580
Really?

302
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:50,930
All right. I'll be right there.

303
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:57,300
I need to send the Rainbow Whisperer to His Highness to fix it.

304
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,386
Where did it go?

305
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,980
Sister Man Man. Sister Man Man.

306
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,240
Yan'er, did you see the conch on the table?

307
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,640
The… The conch?

308
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:16,020
What conch? I didn't see anything like that.

309
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:18,740
That's strange.

310
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,380
I have something I need to do. The clothes are in the wardrobe. Get them yourself. I'm off.

311
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,680
Sister Man Man... Sister Man Man?

312
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,170
Wu Dai was named the crown prince?

313
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,150
Chaofeng isn't as capable as I thought.

314
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,880
If you ask me, I think Wu Dai is much better than Chaofeng.

315
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,060
At least he wouldn't trick my sister and get her into all this mess.

316
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:46,280
But my sister insists on marrying Chaofeng.

317
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:48,040
What can I do?

318
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:54,540
Chaofeng is cunning, but when they were sieged by the Void Empress, he protected your sister with his life.

319
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:56,600
He is sincere about her.

320
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,780
But I just can't trust him.

321
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:01,080
Besides, you and I are both in the Heavenly Realm.

322
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,760
How can we help them?

323
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:08,640
Here. Take my Xuan Amber and find Erlang Deity.

324
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,420
Have him go to the Void and rescue them.

325
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,000
You're being held in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice, yet, I'm still asking you to help me.

326
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,540
I'm not just doing this for you.

327
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:25,140
That guy saved me in the Mortal Realm.

328
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,540
I'm repaying my debt to him.

329
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,073
Go on.

330
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,173
I'll leave now.

331
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,620
How do I say "Die"?

332
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,140
That's not imposing enough. Like this.

333
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,833
How's that?

334
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,440
Better.

335
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,780
What about "bad guy"?

336
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:01,680
Can't you learn some nicer words?

337
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,040
All… All you ask me to teach you are bad words. What's all this for?

338
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,220
Eldest Brother is still in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

339
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,660
I'm not in a good mood.

340
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,293
All right…

341
00:25:09,293 --> 00:25:10,640
- Your Highness!
- Have some tea.

342
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,131
Your Highness! Your Highness!

343
00:25:13,131 --> 00:25:16,340
The Rainbow Whisperer! Someone stole the Rainbow Whisperer!

344
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:18,460
Someone stole it? Who stole it?

345
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,540
I wouldn't be here looking for you if I knew!

346
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:23,820
I'm going to look for it.

347
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,300
- Come on!
- What happened?

348
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,700
This way! Hurry!

349
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,033
All right.

350
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,120
Your Majesty, His Highness has only just returned.

351
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,680
He hasn't fully recovered yet.

352
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,580
Please release him soon.

353
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,100
His soul and cultivation won't be able to handle it otherwise.

354
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,560
Jade Deity is right.

355
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,140
It was only an argument between father and son.

356
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:00,620
Even if Xuanshang was wrong, you could just berate him.

357
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:04,681
Look. Without His Highness, all matters of the Heavenly Realm are cluttered.

358
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:06,200
Whatever shall we do?

359
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,500
His Highness has not acted out of line since he returned.

360
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:11,960
Your Majesty, why must you insist on erasing his memories?

361
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,420
I've discussed this matter with the Heavenly Empress.

362
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,340
Youqin made a mistake.

363
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:21,280
He must endure seven days of punishment.

364
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,020
Deities, please do not make this difficult for me.

365
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,653
All right?

366
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,140
- Stop!
- Fairy Biqiong!

367
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,200
What are you guys doing?

368
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,960
Fairy Biqiong, you took something you shouldn't have, didn't you?

369
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,440
How is that any of your business?

370
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,860
Oh, but it is my business.

371
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,220
You took something of mine.

372
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,560
I didn't take anything that's yours. Make way.

373
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,730
Stop right there.

374
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:46,400
How dare you say you haven't been to Tianpa Hall! You're still wet!

375
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,980
What did you take? Hurry up and hand it over.

376
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,060
I didn't take anything.

377
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,493
I smell it. It's right in her arms.

378
00:26:51,493 --> 00:26:52,580
Get it.

379
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,420
- Give it here.
- You… Insolent! - Give it back to me.

380
00:26:54,421 --> 00:26:55,560
Right there. She has it on her.

381
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,700
Liguang Yetan impersonated the Empyrean Consort!

382
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,040
- Biqiong asks…
- Be… Be quiet.

383
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,860
<i>Biqiong asks…</i>

384
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,940
Your Majesty. Fairy Biqiong and the Prince of Beast Realm have gotten into a fight outside.

385
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:11,660
Fairy Biqiong claims that… The Empyrean Consort is fake.

386
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:14,010
The guards are blocking them.

387
00:27:14,010 --> 00:27:16,380
- This…
- Fake?

388
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,480
Empyrean Xuanshang wants to step down.

389
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:24,940
The fairy from Xia and the prince of the Beast Realm are arguing outside the Ninth Heaven Hall.

390
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,580
Even the Empyrean Consort is a fake.

391
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,860
The Heavenly Realm has lost all sense of order.

392
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,500
Bring them in.

393
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:38,020
I want to see His Majesty!

394
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,420
The Empyrean Consort is fake!

395
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,560
Lies and slander!

396
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,500
You… You're just a thief!

397
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,540
Everyone in the Heavenly Realm knows you're jealous of the Empyrean Consort.

398
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,580
She's a fake!

399
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,660
You… Stop your accusation!
- Orders from His Majesty.

400
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:47,900
- You even accuse me!
- She's a fake!

401
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,900
- She's a fake!
- You thief! You're a thief, and you even accuse me!

402
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,101
- You're a thief, and you even accuse me!
- She's fake!

403
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:52,280
Orders from His Majesty.

404
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:58,320
Fairy Biqiong and Di Lanjue, Prince of Beast Realm, have been summoned to the Ninth Heaven Hall.

405
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:05,760
I wasn't summoned. I'm not going. Don't drag me. I…

406
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,780
I wasn't summoned. Why are you taking me there?

407
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:09,300
I… Don't drag me!

408
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,033
Let me go!

409
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,973
Your Highness!

410
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,420
You're the immortal attendant who pleaded for leniency on me and Princess Qingkui's behalf.

411
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,140
Fairy Biqiong shouted that Her Highness was impersonating the Empyrean Consort

412
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,160
- outside the Ninth Heaven Hall!
- What?

413
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,640
His Majesty has summoned her. Please do something to help her!

414
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,050
This day has come, after all.

415
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:33,393
Stand back.

416
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:49,391
Liguang Qingkui greets the Heavenly Emperor and Heavenly Empress.

417
00:28:49,391 --> 00:28:50,793
Liguang

418
00:28:50,793 --> 00:28:52,720
Yetan.

419
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,370
Do you still dare to pretend to be the Empyrean Consort?

420
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,420
<i>How did she find out about my identity?</i>

421
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:09,220
Biqiong, I know you do not get along with Princess Qingkui.

422
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:12,660
But the Ninth Heaven Hall is no place for nonsense.

423
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:16,120
Slandering the Empyrean Consort is a grave crime.

424
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:19,620
I doubt Biqiong would be that reckless.

425
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,600
I'll hear you out.

426
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,220
But if your accusations turn out to be baseless and without proof, you'll be punished according to the laws.

427
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,540
Yes, Your Majesty.

428
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:34,560
I'm sure all of you have heard that Princess Qingkui is elegant and sophisticated.

429
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,380
<i>She is well-known to be refined and virtuous in the Mortal Realm.</i>

430
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:40,460
But how much trouble has our Empyrean Consort caused since coming here?

431
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,720
I doubt even she can keep track of all of them.

432
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,000
She doesn't behave like the Empyrean Consort

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
that was supposed to be raised for 18 years in the Mortal Realm.

434
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,500
Furthermore, five years ago, Princess Qingkui wowed the world

435
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:51,760
with her performance of the Song of Cleansing at the Luotian Ritual.

436
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:53,480
That became the talk of the four realms.

437
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:58,020
But during my birthday banquet some time ago, our Empyrean Consort

438
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,720
couldn't even distinguish between the musical tones and keys of the zither.

439
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:07,360
You didn't cause such a commotion just to harp on such trivial matters, right?

440
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,380
Of course not.

441
00:30:08,380 --> 00:30:10,530
I'll shut you up right now.

442
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,020
Earlier, in Tianpa Hall, I heard with my own ears that the empyrean consort

443
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:21,580
was talking to a woman in the Void using this magic artifact.

444
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:23,260
She called her "sister".

445
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,460
That woman called her "Tan'er".

446
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,560
As all of you know, the human race has two princesses.

447
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:33,800
The one that was supposed to be married to the Void was named Liguang Yetan.

448
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:38,960
You mean our Empyrean Consort is Liguang Yetan?

449
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,100
Precisely.

450
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:43,680
Biqiong, why were you inside my sister-in-law's chambers?

451
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:48,180
I thought she was suspicious. That's why I went inside to investigate.

452
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,600
That's theft.

453
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,400
How can we trust your words in this case?

454
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:57,190
Biqiong, are you slandering my sister-in-law just because you want to marry my eldest brother?

455
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,333
- I…
- Enough.

456
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,220
I'll give you a chance to explain.

457
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,220
What is going on?

458
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:12,620
I created that magic artifact and gave it to her.

459
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,780
I designed it so that she could store her voice in it

460
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:19,820
and give it to her younger sister so… so that she could listen to it when she missed her.

461
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:21,453
Lies!

462
00:31:21,453 --> 00:31:25,480
Every word I said was true. I swear on my life.

463
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,180
Since Di Lanjue created this magic artifact, then let's have him activate it.

464
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:32,210
We'll know once we ask.

465
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:36,980
<i>Qingkui is already in a perilous situation.</i>

466
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,300
<i>I can't make her worry about me even more.</i>

467
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,900
<i>There's no way out of this anyway.</i>

468
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:44,440
This…

469
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,560
Look! She did that because she was guilty!

470
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,800
I am Liguang Yetan.

471
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,533
This…

472
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:06,540
<i>Is His Highness actually enduring the punishment of the heavenly lightning strikes for Her Highness?</i>

473
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:08,373
Your Highness!

474
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,760
If I can't even handle this, how can I marry her?

475
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,280
Your Highness! What are you doing?

476
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,020
Impersonating the Empyrean Consort is a crime punishable by death.

477
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,220
I have to save her!

478
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,600
You're serving your punishment right now!

479
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,100
If you escape without permission, you'll be punished by a hundred heavenly lightning strikes!

480
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:39,650
How many can you possibly endure?

481
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,920
Every one of them!

482
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,873
Your Highness!

483
00:33:38,873 --> 00:33:46,156
Your Majesty, even if she is Liguang Yetan, she crossed the Love Bridge with Empyrean Xuanshang.

484
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,580
She is Empyrean Xuanshang's fated one.

485
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,170
Even if there was a mistake, it was Heaven's Will.

486
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:58,480
That's right. Furthermore, she risked her life to search for the soul shards in the Mortal Realm.

487
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,260
If it weren't for her, the Heavenly Realm wouldn't even have Empyrean Xuanshang anymore.

488
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:08,820
Since coming to the Heavenly Realm, she has been rather mischievous…

489
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:12,700
Rather mischievous… But even so, she has never done anything

490
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,640
that has actually caused great harm to the Heavenly Realm.

491
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:20,440
I think we should ask her if there was a reason for all of this and find out the truth.

492
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,170
Why did you pretend to be the Empyrean Consort?

493
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,780
Someone swapped the bridal sedan chairs on the day of the wedding.

494
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:31,980
Who?

495
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:35,240
Dingyun, Second Prince of the Void.

496
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,690
All four realms know that he is dead.

497
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:42,080
You're pushing all the blame onto someone who is dead.

498
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,800
How can I be convinced?

499
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,530
Besides, you had chances to clarify matters.

500
00:34:47,530 --> 00:34:48,800
Why did you not speak up?

501
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,460
When I first arrived in Heavenly Realm, I realized it was a mistake.

502
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:58,420
<i>I wanted to tell the truth, but I saw the cloud relief on the Heavenly Southern Gate</i>

503
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:01,320
<i>and was reminded of the feud between the voidwalkers and immortals.</i>

504
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,980
I didn't want to die, so I didn't say anything.

505
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,600
Moreover, ever since I entered Tianpa Hall, I was treated well by all the immortals.

506
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,950
I didn't want to leave anymore.

507
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:14,520
But you are not Liguang Qingkui.

508
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,500
The kindness and grace of the immortals were not meant for you.

509
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:20,720
But you took advantage of the situation and enjoyed their treatment of you.

510
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,340
You coveted the position of the Empyrean Consort and deceived us all.

511
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,420
You completely disregarded any respect for the Heavenly Realm.

512
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:31,410
I received everything I have now because of the marriage incident.

513
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,160
But the warm welcome and kindness of the immortals made me indulge in them.

514
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,890
Because I never had any of those.

515
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,080
But you said I coveted the title of Empyrean Consort.

516
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,780
What would I possibly stand to gain?

517
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,940
To become a widow of the Shaodian family? To watch my husband leap into the Guixu?

518
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,240
Or do I enjoy suffering?

519
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,180
Going against your orders, escaping to the Mortal Realm, and bringing him back to life?

520
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:52,000
You're truly the harbinger of the calamity of the human race!

521
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,513
Your Highness!

522
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,390
You disrupted the Heavenly Realm.

523
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:34,420
You drove a wedge between my son and me.

524
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,300
Yet, you act with such audacity.

525
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:40,330
Is it because you think you have Youqin's protection?

526
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,333
Men!

527
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:43,920
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

528
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,860
Take her to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

529
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:48,960
Throw this harbinger of calamity that has wreaked havoc on the Heavenly Realm

530
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,500
into the Well of Reincarnation and return her to the Mortal Realm!

531
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,640
- Yes.
- Yes.

532
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,373
Your Highness!

533
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,413
I won't let you!

534
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,570
I was planning on dealing with them, too.

535
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,620
Tie them up as well!

536
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:12,040
Celestial Father! Princess Yetan saved Eldest Brother!

537
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,600
The immortals owe a great debt to her!

538
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,920
Please spare her, Celestial Father!

539
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,420
Please spare Yetan, Celestial Father.

540
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,740
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

541
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,540
Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

542
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:25,760
For Youqin's sake, she cannot stay.

543
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:27,873
Your Majesty,

544
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,380
what do you mean?

545
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:33,260
I finally figured it out.

546
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:41,120
Youqin must have insisted on stepping down because he knew who she was all along.

547
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,060
But Youqin is the role model of the immortals and the future Heavenly Emperor.

548
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,940
If he continues to be entangled with her, his reputation will be in ruins!

549
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,900
But you don't know how important she is to him.

550
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:55,980
If you kill Yetan, Youqin will hate you for life.

551
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,900
I can lose my son.

552
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:01,600
But the immortals cannot lose Empyrean Xuanshang!

553
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,213
Take her away.

554
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,890
Who dares to touch her?

555
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,673
Youqin.

556
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,390
I knew you wouldn't let her down.

557
00:39:28,390 --> 00:39:30,033
Youqin…

558
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,870
I'll take you away from here.

559
00:39:37,260 --> 00:39:44,093
Youqin, you would endure the lightning strikes of the Heavenly Ministry of Justice to save her.

560
00:39:44,093 --> 00:39:46,280
Have you gone mad?

561
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,720
She is a harbinger of calamity.

562
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,440
She is the crown princess of the Void.

563
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,300
For such an absurd love, you would abandon the entire Heavenly Realm and me?

564
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,860
I restored the Guixu for the immortals.

565
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:01,120
I have no regrets.

566
00:40:01,120 --> 00:40:03,420
I've fulfilled my filial duties.

567
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:10,010
This life was given to me by Tan'er. I will live for her for the rest of my life.

568
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:14,020
If the four realms accept her, then so be it.

569
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:18,800
But if they don't, I will take on the entire world.

570
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,560
I have made my decision.

571
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,640
From now on, there is no more Empyrean Xuanshang of the Heavenly Realm.

572
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,673
You unfilial…

573
00:41:17,673 --> 00:41:19,490
You unfilial son…

574
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:24,300
Youqin!

575
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,380
Your Highness!

576
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:28,560
Youqin!

577
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,453
Cousin!

578
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:38,093
Youqin…

579
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,953
Let's go.

580
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:50,013
Let him go!

581
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:59,433
He is no longer a son of mine.

582
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,533
Celestial Father!

583
00:42:04,533 --> 00:42:06,910
<i>His Majesty is overwhelmed with rage.</i>

584
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:17,753
Youqin!

585
00:42:17,753 --> 00:42:21,420
Youqin… Can you hold on?

586
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,293
I'm fine.

587
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,180
Was I very handsome?

588
00:42:29,180 --> 00:42:30,993
Yes.

589
00:42:30,993 --> 00:42:32,453
Very handsome.

590
00:42:32,453 --> 00:42:36,000
A perfect match for my horrid self.

591
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,773
Youqin…

592
00:42:39,940 --> 00:42:41,573
Yetan…

593
00:42:41,573 --> 00:42:43,413
Let's go.

594
00:42:43,413 --> 00:42:45,053
All right.

595
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,280
<i>From now on, you can finally call me by my name.</i>

596
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:58,250
<i>Liguang Yetan.</i>
