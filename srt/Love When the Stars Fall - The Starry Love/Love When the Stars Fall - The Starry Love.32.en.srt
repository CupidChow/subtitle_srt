What about now?

22
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:56,600
Why are you telling me this right now? Is it because you're not afraid anymore?

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,800
Imperial Father?

24
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:03,200
I no longer wish to hide this matter.

Why did you bring me here?

Imperial Father often came here to mourn her loss.

36
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,000
Emperor Tun had no one to confide in.

37
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,000
Maybe your mother was the only one who could understand him.

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:15,500
That's why Emperor Tun hid your gifts under your mother's memorial tablet.

For many years, the Emperor Star of Ziwei didn't shine consistently.

It's as if one cannot make up his mind.

Emperor Tun is worrying indeed.

Luckily, the Star of Fate has been protecting the Emperor Star of Ziwei all along.

Sir, that means you've been making meticulous plans to serve the country.

Could it be that the Grand Chancellor is the harbinger of doom?

Imperial Father, it's been so long since we last played Chinese chess together.

Okay.

00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,600
I'll get the chessboard.

98

Hurry, join me.

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,500
Imperial Father, haven't you been keeping the set of Chinese Chess that Tan carved for you?

100
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:16,200
One of the chess pieces was missing.

101
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,800
Last year, a theft broke out in the palace.

102
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,400
I felt nothing when my treasures were stolen.

103
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:28,200
But that darned thief just had to steal the chess piece of General.

104
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
I was heartbroken.

105
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,900
That darned thief!

106
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,700
Imperial Father.

107
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,900
Last year, when I was trying to save Youqin, I came back to retrieve some treasures.

108
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,900
And I brought it back too.

109
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,800
I'm sorry.

110
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,100
Liguang Yetan!

111
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,800

112
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:08,480
How could I not think of this?

113
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:14,080
Who else but you would steal it?

114
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,020
Imperial Father, do you not blame me?

115
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:21,600
How could I blame you?

116
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:27,340
Since you took it away, that means you missed me.

117
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:31,860
Now, the chessboard is complete.
<i>[General]</i>

118

You've returned too.

119

Now, we're starting again with a clean slate.

120
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,360
My life

121
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,520

122
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,140
Hurry.

123
00:12:00,140 --> 00:12:05,740
Tell me about the ridiculous things you two had done

124
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,600
after leaving the palace.

125
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,380
Consort Mother, how do you feel?

126
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:32,740
I feel like I'm completely healed.

127
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:36,280
But Consort Xue, that's not what Physician Peng said.

128
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,080
Sushui.

129
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:43,100
Physician Peng said Consort Xue received serious injuries one after another.

130
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,040
Her heart meridian was already damaged.

131
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,560
She only managed to stay alive all thanks to Princess Qingkui's superb medical skills.

132
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,780
However, due to all the injuries she had sustained, she has to recuperate for at least two to three years.

133
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,640
Consort Mother, it's my fault for implicating you.

134
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:01,460
It's all in the past.

135
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,900
Don't take it to heart.

136
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,480
Besides, my condition isn't that serious.

137
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,760
Don't listen to them.

138
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,200
But you should come up with a way to obtain your father-in-law's forgiveness.

139
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,980
Consort Mother, I'm already allowing him to do whatever he wants to me without retaliating.

140
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,020
What else do you want me to do?

141
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:23,720
Precisely. He was reprimanded during the entire journey, yet he didn't utter a single word.

142
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,320
It was so satisfying.

143
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,540
- Sir, you are tough indeed.
- Feng'er. Feng'er.

144
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,560
Feng'er, withstanding the temper of your father-in-law is your duty as his son-in-law.

145
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,080
You two have grown up.

146
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,360
You two can shoulder your responsibilities by yourselves now.

147
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,880
And you two had found excellent husbands too.

148
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,660
I'm very relieved.

149
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:02,060
So, Imperial Father, do you agree to my marriage with Chaofeng?

150
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:08,000
A grown girl can't be kept at home.

151
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,760
I've straightened out my thoughts too.

152
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,940
There's no turning back.

153
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:14,360
It's fine as long as you two are happy.

154
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:19,740
Imperial Father, I have something else to tell you.

155
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,060
Go ahead, Tan'er.

156
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:25,660
I know someone must be terrified to know that I'm back.

157
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:30,060
I assume you've received petitions to chase me away.

158
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,500
Imperial Father, you don't need to put yourself on the spot.

159
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,840
Youqin and I are considering settling down in the Beast Realm.

160
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,840
Our friends are there too.

161
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,980
It'll be more convenient for us to see each other.

162
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,420
Imperial Father, I've decided to leave with Tan'er.

163
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,600
But you guys just came back.

164
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,900
I no longer care about the opinions of others.

165
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,280
I'm serious.

166
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:53,380
Don't you guys believe in me?

167
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:56,200
Imperial Father, both Tan'er and I believe you.

168
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,400
However, those old subjects are stubborn.

169
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,040
You're caught in a dilemma.

170
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,160
I'm no longer caught in a dilemma.

171
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,100
The Grand Chancellor has lost his influence.

172
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,340
The Grand Chancellor always called himself the reincarnation of the Star of Fate.

173
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:18,860
But according to a report from the Heavenly Observatory, the Star of Fate turned into Jinx Star and fell from the sky.

174
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,260
The entire observatory now sees him as the harbinger of doom.

175
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:25,880
They submitted a joint petition so that I could remove him from his post.

176
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:30,720
I approved it.

177
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,080
That actually happened?

178
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,840
That's right.

179
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,240
Imperial Father, I'm very thankful that you're trying to keep me here.

180
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:42,640
Although the Grand Chancellor is no longer around, there are still plenty of people who see me as a jinx.

181
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:51,960
Imperial Father, the issue on my mind has been resolved.

182
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,480
I'm glad to know that you still love me.

183
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,860
However, Imperial Father, I can't bear to let you go against the entire human race for my sake.

184
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,920
Please grant me this chance to fulfill my filial duties.

185
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
Imperial Father.

186
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,380
Tan'er and I will support each other.

187
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:17,660
Don't worry about us.

188
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,920
That's great too.

189
00:16:28,350 --> 00:16:33,630
At least you guys can lead a carefree life in the Beast Realm.

190
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,960
You guys won't need to be judged by other people.

191
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:42,140
Remember to visit me from time to time.

192
00:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,950
<i>[Liguang Palace]</i>

193
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,140
You two must be extra careful

194
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,440
on this trip.

195
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,420
If you two encounter any difficulties out there,

196
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,660
come back.

197
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,660
I'll protect you two.

198
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:15,380
Imperial Father, don't worry about us.

199
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:16,600
Your daughter is amazing.

200
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:18,780
You should be thankful that I'm not bullying other people.

201
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,940
You're something else.

202
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,140
That's right, Emperor Tun.

203
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,920
You should only be concerned about whether she'll bully me or not.

204
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,980
Father-in-law...

205
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:32,840
Emperor Tun, you provided my mother with medical treatment in the palace.

206
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,460
I'm eternally grateful for that.

207
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,320
Physician Peng is an excellent physician.

208
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,080
Your mother will recover soon.

209
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:43,100
Sorry for the trouble then, Emperor Tun.

210
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,200
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

211
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,800
Thank you.

212
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:53,980
Consort Mother, I'll pick you up once I've settled down.

213
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,900
Just rest and recuperate, okay?

214
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,900
Don't stir up trouble again.

215
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,840
Listen to Kui'er more often.

216
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,320
- Don't get too full of yourself.
- Yes, Consort Mother.

217
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,840
Be more tolerant toward others.

218
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,600
Got it.

219
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,660
And... remember to wash your legs often.

220
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,920
You were never a fan of washing your legs.

221
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,320
I've grown up. I already changed that habit of mine.

222
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,380
As if.

223
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:24,960
You're my son. Do you think I don't know the real you?

224
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,800
You're so naggy. I got it.

225
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,560
Give me a hug.

226
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:33,560
- What? You're shy?
- Consort Xue, leave the hugging to me.

227
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,360
- Come.
- Goodness.

228
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,420
Kui'er, I'll leave Feng to you.

229
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,680
- Sushui...
- Keep him in check for me.

230
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,020
I'll leave Consort Mother to you two.

231
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,580
- Got it, Consort Mother.
- See you guys later.

232
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,760
Don't worry, Sir.

233
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,780
Take good care of yourself when I'm not by your side, okay?

234
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:50,480
You guys must take care.

235
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,520
Go now.

236
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,320
Go ahead.

237
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,920
Kui'er, let's go.

238
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:04,740
Take care, Emperor Tun.

239
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,860
Take care.

240
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,140
It's been vacant for too long. It looks decrepit.

241
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,780
Why must we stay in a place like this?

242
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:07,580
- Let's find an excellent inn.
- No, we'll stay here.

243
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,700
This is the place where you sacrificed all of your wealth for me.

244
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:10,860
It's meaningful.

245
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,380
Silly girl.

246
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,100
The Fifth, is this the place in your realm where the richest ones stay?

247
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,280
It doesn't look that fancy to me.

248
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,720
A cracked bell can never sound well.

249
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,620
I'll clean it up.

250
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,660
Heartless was just keeping a low profile.

251
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:29,940
He's unlike you. You achieved nothing even when you're this age.

252
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:32,720
Why do you always look down on me?

253
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm looking down on you.

254
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,860
You're incompetent, and you don't like to wash your feet.

255
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:39,000
You're not good enough for my sister.

256
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,320
I was just lazy before this.

257
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,580
Right now, I always bathe my feet with the herb packs your sister made for me.

258
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,060
Tan'er, stop making things difficult for him.

259
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:50,400
He's your brother-in-law after all.

260
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,580
I'm not making things difficult for him.

261
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,940
I'm going to ask him a few questions.

262
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,360
You better be honest with your answers.

263
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,880
I'll call you my brother-in-law willingly if I'm satisfied with your answers.

264
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,180
If not, I'll...

265
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,600
I'll let Youqin deal with you.

266
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,380
Go ahead.

267
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,560
What do you love about my sister?

268
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,540
Because she's pure and beautiful.

269
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,880
I knew you only fell for her good looks.

270
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,000
I beg to differ.

271
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,500
Before this, I used her to pretend to be imprisoned.

272
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,060
But I never expected her to risk her life for me.

273
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:23,020
<i>She spent all of her fortunes trying to gain the prison guards' favor so that I could suffer less.</i>

274
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:26,400
I laughed at her for being a fool, but I fell for her unknowingly.

275
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,060
After that, she treated the patients in the Void Realm without expecting anything in return.

276
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:36,220
Before this, the word "kindness" never meant anything to me.

277
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,940
But after meeting her, I finally understand that kindness is true beauty.

278
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:44,440
After that, I witnessed her bravery.

279
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,060
She was also good at strategizing and making plans.

280
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:50,000
Right now, I only fear that people might take you away from me.

281
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,060
I will never let you down.

282
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,160
All right. I believe in your words.

283
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,700
However, you don't even have a place to live in the Beast Realm.

284
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,080
How could you provide Qingkui with a good life?

285
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,700
Naturally, I'll buy a mansion for Kui'er after earning enough.

286
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,740
Buy a mansion for her? That means you'll be handling all the money.

287
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:13,520
I'm not good at that. Kui'er can manage our assets.

288
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,740
Let me ask you this then.

289
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:20,000
If Qingkui and your mother get into an argument, who will you side with?

290
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,520
You don't need to worry about that.

291
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:23,240
My mother likes Kui'er more than me.

292
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:28,780
And mother said before that she wouldn't live with us or take care of our children for us.

293
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:32,080
Children? Have you asked Qingkui if she was willing to give birth to children for you?

294
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,860
You're taking things into your own hands again.

295
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:39,560
You'll decide how many children we have.

296
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,500
You're leaving it to Qingkui again? Haven't you made any plans for your future?

297
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,700
You're ambitionless.

298
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:46,360
I wonder how you can provide Qingkui with a good life.

299
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,220
Qingkui can operate a clinic by herself. And she has a strong personality.

300
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,180
But you? You achieved nothing.

301
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:53,900
How could you stand shoulder to shoulder with her?

302
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,620
Enough, Tan'er. Stop making things difficult for him.

303
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,560
Sister, I'm not making things difficult for him.

304
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,860
I have to let him know that your sister is backing you up.

305
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:06,440
This way, he won't dare to bully you.

306
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,320
Fine.

307
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,980
How do you want me to prove myself?

308
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,360
This place belongs to Youqin, and imperial father was the one who provided us with the money.

309
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:17,000
You can't just sponge off us.

310
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:19,800
Right now, you're no longer the Void Third Prince.

311
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,960
You should do something and prove that you can make a living.

312
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,840
Only then will I be able to entrust my sister to you.

313
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,380
Fine.

314
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,280
All right.

315
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:34,540
Since you're so driven right now, I'll assign you to your first task.

316
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:37,060
Tan'er, what do you want him to do?

317
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,100
It's mealtime!

318
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,880
It's mealtime at the House of Colors!

319
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,380
Sir, please come in!

320
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:47,560
Sir, join us for a meal.
<i>[House of Colors]</i>

321
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,380
We have plenty of delicacies.

322
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,500
Sir, you can even admire paintings inside!

323
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:52,940
- Sir, come inside!
- What are you doing?

324
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:53,980
Sir, do you want to eat?

325
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,820
- Come here.
- Let go!

326
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,500
Sir, come and have a try!

327
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,580
Miss, please come inside!

328
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,460
Don't go! Sir, please come inside!

329
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:06,280
Miss. Table for how many?

330
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,500
You must be starving.

331
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,100
We have plenty of delicacies inside.

332
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,140
You can admire paintings inside.

333
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,840
Miss, please come inside.

334
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,840
What are you doing?

335
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,380
What are you trying to do to my daughter?

336
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,400
So, table for two, huh? You should've told me.

337
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,800
- Come, join us.
- Go away!

338
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,760
You must be sick in the head! Pervert!

339
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:25,500
Please don't go!

340
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,500
You can even admire paintings inside!

341
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,220
Ma'am!

342
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:32,860
Why hasn't Chaofeng returned yet?

343
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,800
He cannot come back unless he finishes his job.

344
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:38,760
Sister, here.

345
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,320
Kui'er, I'm back.

346
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:48,480
I've done all the chores in the House of Colors.

347
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,320
I didn't even take lunch in order to clean the loo.

348
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,720
Sister-in-law, are you happy now?

349
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,740
How much did you earn?

350
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:00,760
One hundred beast coins.

351
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,580
That's great!

352
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,540
One hundred beast coins?

353
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:07,340
That's not even enough to buy my sister a new outfit.

354
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:11,550
You must be starving. Join us.

355
00:25:16,660 --> 00:25:20,520
This meal alone costs 50 beast coins.

356
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,920
I'm not hungry yet. You guys can go ahead.

357
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:30,260
I still have work to do.

358
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:32,880
You should eat first.

359
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,740
Finish your meal first.

360
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,100
Sister, here. You should eat up.

361
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,520
Tan'er, stop making things difficult for him.

362
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,340
Sister, imperial father isn't here.

363
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,060
There's no one who can stand up for you now.

364
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:47,680
If I don't do this now, what if he treats you badly in the future?

365
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,520
I'm just taking precautions here.

366
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,700
Thank you then, Tan'er.

367
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,420
Both of you are worrying indeed.

368
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,640
You can rest at ease when I'm around.

369
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:58,700
Have a drumstick. Here, I'll feed you.

370
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:14,000
Is there rice left?

371
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,660
This is the last bowl.

372
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:18,020
What's wrong?

373
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,280
I can tell that your wife is putting me on the spot here.

374
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,580
So, a dummy like you could actually tell, huh?

375
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,860
It must've been tough.

376
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,180
But think about all those things you'd done.

377
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,060
I guess this is a small price to pay.

378
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:34,780
If she's unhappy with me, she can beat me up and get it over with.

379
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,460
Don't torture me like this.

380
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:38,520
I have no patience for this.

381
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,180
What are you trying to do?

382
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,420
I just want to make enough money so that I can provide Kui'er with a good life.

383
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,480
I can't just let this continue.

384
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,140
I heard that your soul shard once made buckets of gold.

385
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,540
Why don't you teach me?

386
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,540
No.

387
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,920
- Fifth.
- What did you call me?

388
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,880
Eldest Brother. Eldest Brother, help me out.

389
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,360
That's more like it.

390
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,920
However, my experience is nothing.

391
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:06,060
Tan'er is the expert here.

392
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:09,480
She once made over 10,000 gold within half an hour from the desert dwellers.

393
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:10,760
Desert dwellers?

394
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,140
How did she do it?

395
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,060
- Listen...
- Youqin.

396
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,380
What were you guys talking about?

397
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:18,420
He's in a rush to make money.

398
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,420
He wants to know about your experience.

399
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:21,880
Who said so?

400
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:25,940
I'll come up with a way myself.

401
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,120
Chaofeng!

402
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,180
What's with that attitude?

403
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,900
Sister, he glared at me!

404
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,580
I'll beat him up when he comes back.

405
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,640
What are you up to?

406
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,060
What did you bring back?

407
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,670
Let's go and drink.

408
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,460
Let's go.

409
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:49,540
Don't fall behind.

410
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,900
You're here?

411
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,000
Great.

412
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:53,060
Send this to the warehouse.

413
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:55,460
All right! Let's go!

414
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,780
Come on!

415
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,180
Let's go!

416
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:27,540
You should stop teasing Chaofeng when he comes back.

417
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,340
I...

418
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:31,580
Right. I think you should stop now.

419
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:33,620
I know you're doing it for my sake.

420
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:36,060
But I can't bear to see him suffer.

421
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:39,460
Got it.

422
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:49,180
Look.

423
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,520
Where did you get all this money in such a short time?

424
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,040
It's all thanks to your tips.

425
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,220
I robbed the Desert Dwellers' treasure vault.

426
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,260
Sister-in-law, this time, I'm not sponging off you.

427
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,840
I have enough to buy Kui a mansion now.

428
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:07,480
You actually robbed the Desert Dwellers' treasure vault and escaped unscathed?

429
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:11,100
Not only that, but I also gave them a good beating.

430
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:14,240
I think they won't be able to commit crimes for a few months.

431
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,740
Not bad at all. That's impressive.

432
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,220
Brother-in-law, I'll acknowledge you now.

433
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,580
Not me!

434
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:27,100
I didn't choose to be with you for the sake of wealth or power.

435
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,100
I never thought you were poor.

436
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,980
I will make a living together with you anyway.

437
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,140
But now, you're stealing other people's fortunes.

438
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,040
What makes you different from them then?

439
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:39,260
Do you plan to do this for the rest of your life?

440
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,520
And you. Not only did you not stop him from doing so, but you also praised him.

441
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:47,660
Are you planning to mellow in the mire with him? Both of you have disappointed me.

442
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,860
Actually, the Desert Dwellers are criminals.

443
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,940
Even so, it's wrong for him to do so.

444
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,540
It's wrong for him to do so.

445
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,020
- Kui'er!
- Sister!

446
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,500
Don't move. It's his.

447
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,760
I'm just taking a look.

448
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,300
Fine.

449
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,840
Kui'er, are you still angry?

450
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,880
I'm angry at you for being so muddle-headed.

451
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,240
Tan'er was just testing you for my sake.

452
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,800
It's not like you don't know I don't care about wealth and fame.

453
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:53,260
I know that. But Tan'er has a point.

454
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,060
You said you wanted to open a clinic.

455
00:30:55,060 --> 00:30:56,940
At work, we'll provide aid to the people.

456
00:30:56,940 --> 00:30:58,780
After work, we can enjoy our days.

457
00:30:58,780 --> 00:31:01,240
I said yes without a second thought.

458
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,200
But I forgot that I had nothing.

459
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,720
You're the sole breadwinner.

460
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,340
Husband and wife go hand-in-hand.

461
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:12,740
I don't care about other things as long as you follow the righteous path.

462
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,140
After you reprimanded me, I was reflecting upon my actions.

463
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:20,840
I know I shouldn't have robbed them.

464
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,640
But through this incident, I came up with an idea.

465
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:27,320
The Desert Dwellers got their treasures from robbing other people.

466
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:30,340
I was thinking that I should open an armed escort agency in the future.

467
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:33,560
I'll protect other people from crooks with my power.

468
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,580
Kui'er, what do you think?

469
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,860
I think... my clinic should be right beside your armed escort agency.

470
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:47,920
If your escorts are injured, they can come to my clinic.

471
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,440
What do you think?

472
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:53,600
Kui'er, you're thoughtful indeed.

473
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:07,940
An armed escort agency?

474
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,640
That's right.

475
00:32:11,460 --> 00:32:15,500
If you have made up your mind, I can contact my buddies from the Assassin Assembly Hall.

476
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,080
They're pretty capable.

477
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,620
It would be good if they could use their powers for the greater good.

478
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:22,500
That's great, Old Fifth.

479
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,740
I was planning to recruit new people.

480
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,100
I never expected you to change this much for my sister's sake.

481
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:29,460
You've impressed me, Brother-in-law.

482
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:31,140
It's all thanks to you, Sister-in-law.

483
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:34,440
I would never come up with such ideas without your help.

484
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:39,640
Sister, I promise you I won't stir up trouble again.

485
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
Good girl.

486
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,140
- Tan Tan!
- Eldest Brother!

487
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,300
Husui? What are you doing here?

488
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,220
Qingheng and Celestial Mother told me to pass this to you, Eldest Brother.

489
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:04,960
Qingheng said he would take your place as the empyrean until the day of your return.

490
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:09,560
Ziwu, I might not return to the Heavenly Realm.

491
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:16,040
Tell Qingheng that he can handle all affairs in Penglai Hall.

492
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,580
Tan'er and I wish to remain in the Beast Realm and enjoy a carefree life.

493
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,160
I wasn't honest with you before this.

494
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,700
Please don't blame me.

495
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:33,080
Sister-in-law, I saw for myself what you did to save eldest brother.

496
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,860
Therefore, no matter what your identity is, I will always treat you with respect.

497
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,360
Sister-in-law. Qingheng and I weren't the only ones who felt that way.

498
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,100
Celestial Mother felt the same too.

499
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,300
Ever since you left, Celestial Mother condemned the Xia clan.

500
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:46,180
She even took Fairy Biqiong back to discipline her.

501
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,140
Did the Heavenly Emperor make things difficult for you all when we came down here?

502
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:53,720
We're fine. We were just chased out of the realm.

503
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:57,720
But Husui was loyal to you indeed.

504
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:00,640
Sister-in-law, when we met Husui at the Heavenly Southern Gate,

505
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,560
she was planning to break through it in order to seek you down here.

506
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,240
Luckily, Qingheng was there.

507
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,420
If not, Husui would've been stripped of her immortal status.

508
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,920
Husui, you were already punished when you left the realm last time.

509
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,380
This time, you're getting yourself into trouble again.

510
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,120
Why are you so silly?

511
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:21,520
Your Highness, my wish is to follow you.

512
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,020
Sister, she's the good friend I made in the Heavenly Realm, Husui.

513
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,460
So, you're Husui.

514
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,400
Tan'er often mentioned you to me.

515
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:36,220
Although it's our first encounter, for some reason, it feels as if we've known each other for a long time.

516
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:37,640
I thought so too.

517
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,500
It's as if we met each other 10,000 years ago.

518
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,160
Is that so?

519
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,980
In the future, we'll be friends then.

520
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:47,140
That's right. In the future, we can enjoy coriander pancakes together.

521
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:50,580
What an ingrate.

522
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,820
I was also chased out of the realm when I tried to save my master.

523
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,560
Where's my reward?

524
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:58,880
Is that enough for you?

525
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,740
Yes!

526
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:07,920
Di Lanjue, have you guys heard anything about the voidwalkers on your way here?

527
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,240
No.

528
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,940
Seems like both immortals and voidwalkers have accepted the fact that the marriages were swapped.

529
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:20,440
Everyone, I've offended you all before this.

530
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:22,640
I'll apologize to you all.

531
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:24,620
I've already turned over a new leaf.

532
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,940
Please give me a chance to be your friend.

533
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,600
I've already forgiven him.

534
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,740
He's no longer the same Chaofeng he used to be.

535
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:42,000
If that's the case from now on we'll be friends.

536
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,620
Ziwu, how did you guys manage to find us?

537
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,400
- We...
- Well...

538
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,200
Tan'er and I have been buddies for so many years.

539
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,600
Our hearts are interconnected.

540
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,580
It's because of eldest brother's footwear.

541
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:03,160
Di Lanjue, in the past, I took you as a human. Seems like I underestimated you.

542
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,800
Is there something we cannot know?

543
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,520
- He...
- Ziwu!

544
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,120
Please.

545
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,760
He tracked the stench of your footwear!

546
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:19,320
I'll strip you of all your feathers today!

547
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:20,640
Come here! Don't run!

548
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,240
- Your Highness, I know my fault now!
- I'll strip you of all your feathers!

549
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,080
- Stop chasing me! I know my fault now!
- Come here! Stop moving!

550
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:27,440
- Tan'er, do something about him! He's chasing after me!
- I'll bite you!

551
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,840
Come here!

552
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,040
Try this.

553
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,580
The fruits I nurture are as good as the ones in the Heavenly Realm.

554
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,720
- It's sweet, right?
- Yeah.

555
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,540
Reporting in!

556
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:47,540
What's the situation?

557
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:51,020
Your Majesty, His Highness has returned to the Beast Realm once again.

558
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:53,180
That brat.

559
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:54,640
Tell him to see me immediately.

560
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,820
But His Highness has gone missing again.

561
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,260
What?

562
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:01,080
He didn't return to the Prince's Mansion after coming back from the Heavenly Realm?

563
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:01,980
Where did he go?

564
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,480
He told our soldiers to pass a message to you.

565
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:07,580
He said he was going to locate Immortal Xuanshang and Princess Yetan.

566
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,600
Why doesn't that brat know how to keep a distance from them?

567
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,600
He already created enough trouble in the Heavenly Realm.

568
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,240
He would've never escaped unscathed from the Heavenly Realm if they didn't let him off on account of Your Majesty.

569
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,180
Go now. Capture him.

570
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:22,800
Princess Ziwu is also here.

571
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,280
Should we bring her back as well?

572
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,600
Princess Ziwu is here too?

573
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,080
That's right.

574
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,020
You may leave for now.

575
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,760
Yes, Your Majesty.

576
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:41,580
We tried our best to send Lan'er to Shangshu Academy so that he could court Princess Ziwu.

577
00:37:43,600 --> 00:37:49,200
If Princess Ziwu finds out that we're timid and cowardly, she'll bear a grudge against us.

578
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,660
You do have a point.

579
00:37:50,660 --> 00:37:52,960
The empyrean and the Heavenly Emperor are father and son after all.

580
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,580
If, one day, he returns to his position,

581
00:37:55,580 --> 00:38:00,260
and he's reminded of the fact that we looked down on him after losing his position,

582
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,060
I'm afraid he'd bear a grudge against us.

583
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,360
That's right.

584
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,540
Why don't we pretend to be in the dark and just let nature take its course?

585
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:12,420
My dear, you're intelligent indeed.

586
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:29,900
The rest have followed Di Lanjue to their quarters.

587
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,980
What are you doing here alone?

588
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:37,560
I was thinking that I'm the happiest person in the four realms.

589
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,460
Why do you say so?

590
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,420
Because many people love me.

591
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:47,640
There's you, sister, imperial father, and all of my friends.

592
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:50,980
I've never felt this lighthearted before.

593
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:54,340
It's as if I could fly into your galaxy.

594
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:00,080
But do you think your life is complete now?

595
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:03,400
Don't you think I'm being too greedy to say that it isn't complete yet?

596
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,960
But I think it isn't complete yet.

597
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,260
I'm sorry.

598
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:13,220
You lost your family members because of me.

599
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,840
What are you saying? You're overthinking it.

600
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:20,140
Although we couldn't see each other,

601
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:24,580
if we loved each other, we'd never be apart.

602
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm saying that you need one more thing before your life is complete.

603
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,780
What is it?

604
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,940
Did you forget? I still owe you a favor.

605
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,000
What is it?

606
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,280
I said I would prepare a sincere wedding for you when you come back.

607
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,440
Heartless said it. Did you forget?

608
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:53,720
The day after tomorrow was supposed to be our wedding in the Heavenly Realm.

609
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,640
Who would've expected us to have come back here?

610
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,600
Since that's the case, and since everyone's here, let's hold the wedding here.

611
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,820
Isn't that better?

612
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,560
Youqin, do you know how much I love you?

613
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,480
How much?

614
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:12,820
I'm even willing to die for you.

615
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,920
What are you saying?

616
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:17,760
Don't say that.

617
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:25,580
I heard from people that there's a hot spring nearby called the Zhuochun Spring.

618
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:30,440
Why don't we take a bath in the hot spring and wash away your bad luck under the radiant moonlight?

619
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:32,880
Dear, do you wish to join me?

620
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,960
We should hurry then.

621
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,260
Let's go.

622
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:52,000
This hot spring can soothe your nerves and relieve you of your tiredness.

623
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,900
I'm sure it'll be great for your injuries.

624
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,200
Speaking of which, it's pretty strange.

625
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,120
My injuries couldn't heal completely.

626
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,940
Didn't you already take the pure air elixir that Ziwu had brought here?

627
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:02,180
Why aren't your injuries healed yet?

628
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:04,100
Maybe I lack a catalyst.

629
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,760
What is it?

630
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,620
Is that all?

631
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,320
What else did you think it was?

632
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,460
Why don't we play in the water and bathe together?

633
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,180
Over here.

634
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,860
This hot spring can soothe your nerves and relieve you of your tiredness, which is great.

635
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,540
Kui'er, is that all?

636
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:34,040
What else did you think it was?

637
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,340
Since we're here, of course, we need to play in the water and bathe together.

638
00:41:40,150 --> 00:41:41,690
Sister! Sister!

639
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,420
We should do it next time.

640
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,580
The hot spring is already occupied.

641
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,880
What are you guys doing here?

642
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,940
You two always make an unwelcome appearance.

643
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:52,540
You two are annoying indeed.

644
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:54,140
I could say the same for you.

645
00:41:54,140 --> 00:41:56,340
Sister, let's head over there.

646
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,740
- Tan'er?
- Let's go!

647
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:59,300
Mind you, tonight's our date!

648
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,820
Tan'er?

649
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,140
Forget it. I guess we can take a dip together.

650
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,040
Who wants to take a dip with you? You don't wash your feet.

651
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,720
The fish will be dead when you soak your feet.

652
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:12,160
Is there even fish in a hot spring?

653
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,500
How could you know that my feet stink?

654
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:15,700
Take it or leave it.

655
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,460
Go ahead.

656
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:20,380
We wouldn't have come here and interrupted you two had we known that you guys were here.

657
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:22,880
Sister, it's better with you around.

658
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:26,660
Tan'er, why do I feel like you look extra happy today?

659
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,460
You can tell?

660
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:31,040
Youqin and I will get married the day after tomorrow.

661
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:32,760
That's great!

662
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:37,640
Speaking of which, you two would've gotten married long ago if it weren't for the ordeals along the way.

663
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,200
Although imperial father isn't able to come, I have you with me.

664
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,440
I have Man Man, Di Lanjue, Ziwu, and Husui.

665
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
Everyone I cherish is here.

666
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,760
That's more than enough for me.
