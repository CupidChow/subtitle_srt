What about Feng'er and Immortal Xuanshang?

23
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,560
Immortal Xuanshang teleported us back here.

00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,130
Both Prince Chaofeng and he are still in Dongqiu.

I'm clueless about what has happened to them now.

No, he won't.

30
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:26,880
His Highness has been through worse, he will definitely be fine this time.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,520
Yes, you're right.

- Sister.

- Sister.
- Princess Yetan.

35
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,820
We have yet to go to Dongqiu, right?

36
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:48,610
Sister is still alive.

Imperial Father.

38
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:52,610
Imperial Father, it's all right.

39
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,440
Sister is still alive, Imperial Father.

40
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,960
Imperial Father. Imperial Father, look at me.

41
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,290
Sister is still alive.

42
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:00,730
Suzhi. Suzhi, tell Imperial Father that my sister is still alive.

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,790
Tell him. Now.

44
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:04,710
Suzhi, tell him now.

45
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:07,370
Tell him that my sister is still alive. Say something!

Princess Yetan.

47
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,840
Princess Qingkui has already passed away.

48

Stop lying to yourself.

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,670
I'm to blame.

50
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:28,520
Before, Princess Qingkui asked me whether the Twin Flower was commensal.

51
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:31,920
I failed to discern that she was actually having that idea.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,560
No.

53
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,120
This is impossible.

54
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,720
It can't be. Sister is still alive for sure.

55
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,890
- Oh, right. I will carve letters on my arm.
- Princess Yetan.

56
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:42,140
- She will know it's from me.
- Tan'er.
- Where's my dagger?

57
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,700
Give me my dagger. Give me back my dagger!

58
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,850
- Tan'er!
- Give it to me!

59
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:48,580

60
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,200

I'm heartbroken too.

62
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:59,730
But Sister... She has perished.

63
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:01,890
- Imperial Father, don't say that.
- She has already perished.

64
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:04,650
- She has already perished...
- Imperial Father, don't cry.

65
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,798
Sister is still alive.

66
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:08,108
- It's true, she has perished.
- Sister is still alive.

67
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,810
I'm sure she's still alive.

68
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:12,710
Sister...

69
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:14,970
Sister has already left us.

70
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,530
No, she's still alive.

71
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:18,340
She is.

72
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,580
I peg you as my trusted aide and the pillar of the immortals.

73
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:31,150
A mere mortal woman is enough to make you besotted with.

74
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:37,640
Had I foreseen this, I wish you wouldn't have revived.

75

Still, you're my son.

76
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:50,000

77
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,780
to find back the former Shaodian Youqin I approve of.

78
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,960
What were you doing?

79
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,800
I want him to forget those absurdities and return

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,050
to the Shaodian Youqin when he just left the Land of Mystery.

81
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,770
Did you seal his memory?

82
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,810
Celestial Father, you...

83
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:29,450
Despite eldest brother being severely injured already, you still expect him to return to his former self?

84
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:30,330
Celestial Father.

85
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,090
What the immortals need is Immortal Xuanshang who's ready to serve his life for the four realms,

86
00:05:35,090 --> 00:05:39,420
instead of the one who blindly pursues the love relationship.

87
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:42,870
The flower spirit is eliminated and Guixu is restored to peace.

88
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,750
Everything is over.

89
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,840
My trusted empyrean who always considers the big picture shall come back to me now.

90
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:55,180
From today forth, everything will start anew.

91
00:05:55,180 --> 00:06:00,560
I will warn all immortals that they must not bring up the past in front of Youqin.

92
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,710
If Youqin were to recall the past and fall through into it,

93
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:11,160
I will destroy Yetan even though she has lost the flower spirit power.

Even Wu Dai starts to avert me.

That wretched Qingkui wanted me to make that promise before the public just now.

00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,930
No mistake is allowed.

163
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:53,990
Understood.

164
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,960
Sir.

165
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:11,470
Sir.

166
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,300
Sir.

167
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:20,380
Am I not dead yet?

168
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,810
Void Tyrant fears the internal turmoil in the Void, hence, you'll be incarcerated here forever.

169
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,710
<i>Currently, there's no turning back.</i>

170
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,860
<i>Instead of being killed here, allow me to take all the sufferings.</i>

171
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,200
<i>Kui'er!</i>

172
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,010
<i>Being together with you in this life,</i>

173
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:49,440
<i>I'm contented.</i>

174
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,970
<i>Thank you.</i>

175
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,370
<i>Kui'er!</i>

176
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,970
They forced Kui'er to end her life.

177
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:12,000
I wish I could die yet now I'm breathing helplessly here.

178
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:14,740
Let me out.

179
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:17,280
- I will avenge Kui'er.
- Sir.

180
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:19,710
Sir.

181
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:23,000
Now that the Cave of Haunted Souls is guarded by the men of Void Tyrant and Chief Wizard.

182
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,560
Besides, you're in a vulnerable state.

183
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:30,300
You can't leave the Cave of Haunted Souls even if I release you, let alone avenge Princess Qingkui.

184
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,540
Let me out.

185
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,840
Sir.

186
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,700
I beg of you.

187
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:42,670
Princess Qingkui has passed away and she wouldn't want to see you die for avenging her.

188
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:52,560
Open the door.

189
00:13:54,590 --> 00:13:56,070
I...

190
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,960
Did you not hear that?

191
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,010
Open the door.

192
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,880
Void Tyrant forbids anyone from...

193
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:54,380
I thought I won't be able to take this revenge.

194
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,690
I'm so elated to see you end up here today.

195
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:02,090
It's a shame that I missed the chance

196
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,800
to witness the scene of that wretched Qingkui killing herself in Guixu.

197
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,910
I wasn't satisfied when I knew that Void Tyrant didn't kill you.

198
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:16,850
But upon seeing you in such devastation, this is even better.

199
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:20,230
Because you will suffer more in life than in death.

200
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:25,630
You better make sure that I'm dead. Otherwise, I will take revenge on you one day.

201
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:29,810
Do you still see yourself as a Void Patrol?

202
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,700
You killed my brother.

203
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,200
I want you to be in extreme misery.

204
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:54,990
The pair of you are merely the dogs of the Queen and Dingyun.

205
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,010
Your barks sound so hilarious.

206
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:04,430
I will show you that you're worse than a dog.

207
00:16:13,630 --> 00:16:18,620
After plotting against us for so many years, you wind up being no more than a prisoner.

208
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:24,260
You were like a weakling who stood idly and witnessed Qingkui's death.

209
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:29,000
Such heart-devouring pain is awful, right?

210
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:40,080
I ordered my men to retrieve this amber from Guixu.

211
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:43,700
I heard that this is the love token of yours and Qingkui's.

212
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:16,040
Since you're not afraid of death, I will torture you slowly.

213
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,260
This amber is merely the start of your torment.

214
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:24,370
I want you to witness the gradual destruction of the bond between you and Qingkui.

215
00:17:24,370 --> 00:17:29,090
I want you to remember how she died in front of you.

216
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,990
Isn't this pain excruciating?

217
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,760
Yingzhao.

218
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,520
I will kill you for sure.

219
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,960
Why bother running your mouth when you've already fallen into my hands?

220
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:51,100
I wish to see you collapse by your pain deep down

221
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:57,400
until you kneel in front of me and beg me to end your dreadful life.

222
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:16,520
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

223
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:21,700
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

224
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,040
Please eat something, Princess Yetan.

225
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:36,600
You haven't eaten for three days.

226
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,960
If you keep this on, your wound won't recover.

227
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:45,260
I want to seek justice.

228
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:50,660
But we're sitting ducks against the voidwalkers and immortals.

229
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,880
Now that only you and I are left of Dongqiu, I can't let anything happen to you.

230
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,900
I've thought it through.

231
00:18:56,900 --> 00:19:01,160
My life will be unlivable if I can't kill the foes.

232
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,940
Suzhi.

233
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:07,460
The power of flower spirits disappears if the Twin Flower is parted by death.

234
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:10,860
Do you know how to resume the power?

235
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,780
You know it, right?

236
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,520
Tell me.

237
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,380
This is very dangerous.

238
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,180
If the method doesn't work out, you're going to lose your life.

239
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,560
I insist on doing it even though my flower spirit power has disappeared.

240
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:24,640
Princess Yetan.

241
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
Please tell me.

242
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,400
Please tell me for my sake.

243
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,960
Suzhi, please.

244
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:40,640
Chief once said

245
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,080
that the remnant root of the Ganoderma Vein is able to rally the flower spirits.

246
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:48,940
Supposedly, if the flower spirits of the Twin Flower are intact,

247
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:52,640
the flower spirit in you can be resumed.

248
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,680
Where's the remnant root, then?

249
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:56,340
Princess Yetan.

250
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,600
Have you made up your mind?

251
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,540
Before both of your flower spirits were destroyed,

252
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,040
we were all committed to fighting against the immortals and the voidwalkers, but we failed.

253
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,220
Now that you're alone, the revenge task is perilous even though you obtain the power again.

254
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,673
Plus, both you and Princess Qingkui share a sense of pain.

255
00:20:13,673 --> 00:20:18,240
You will be penetrated by the terrible pain once the flower spirits are rallied.

256
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:23,000
Just tell me how to regain the flower spirit power.

257
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,940
The Twin Flower of Ganoderma Vein is sourced from Chaos and is robust.

258
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:45,340
Your blood is the sole instrument to awaken the remnant root and reunite the flower spirit of Qingkui.

259
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,660
Princess Yetan.

260
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,880
This is beyond you. Please give up!

261
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,780
No, it's not.

262
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,020
Princess Yetan!

263
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:16,340
Princess Yetan.

264
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,420
Suzhi.

265
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,960
No.

266
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,640
You're the last hope of Dongqiu.

267
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:31,500
If you were to be drained off by the remnant root, that would make me the sinner of Dongqiu.

268
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,060
Though I don't possess the flower spirit power, the blood of Dongqiu runs through my body.

269
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,800
As long as I can be of your help,

270
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:44,100
I'm willing to forsake my life to assist you.

271
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,400
Your Highness.

272
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,100
Immortal Qingheng, Princess Ziwu, and the three masters

273
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:21,100
are worried about you and have been waiting outside, hoping to pay you a visit.

274
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:24,980
Must they have to be so passionate?

275
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,600
They mean well.

276
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,800
Don't be nervous, Your Highness.

277
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:37,580
Let's go.

278
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,320
- Eldest Brother.
- Eldest Brother.

279
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,100
Greetings, Masters.

280
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:53,320
Eldest Brother, how are you doing?

281
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,440
Eldest Brother. Have you noticed my new hair accessory?

282
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,640
Do you find it interesting?

283
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,880
There's no such an unrefined person like you in the Heavenly Realm.

284
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,200
What makes you so smug when you're putting footwear on your head?

285
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,840
His Highness...

286
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:25,140
His Highness seems to have forgotten everything about the past.

287
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:28,440
It's most difficult to suppress one from being effusive.

288
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,840
To remind Youqin of Yetan, we must start with something related to them.

289
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,360
Thunder Deity, work your magic.

290
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:47,880
Look over there. Thunder strikes out of nowhere.

291
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,400
That's right.

292
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:58,600
- Look.
- Look over here.
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

293
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,020
How come thunder strikes suddenly?

294
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,020
- Why?
- Right.

295
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:07,260
Could it be that His Highness is having an unstable mind?

296
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:13,540
I remember a weird celestial phenomenon once happened back then like this too.

297
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:17,600
But something special happened that day.

298
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,440
I wonder what happened on that day.

299
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,480
This is merely a common strike.

300
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,860
I don't have an unable mind.

301
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,280
It's different from that day.

302
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,260
That day?

303
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:38,760
Your Highness, do you still remember?

304
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,180
Certainly.

305
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,900
<i>It was when Youqin first fetched Qingkui here.</i>

306
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,880
Only when something abnormal happens in Guixu,

307
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,680
a strange celestial phenomenon will occur in the Heavenly Realm.

308
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,400
It was a catastrophe.

309
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,500
How can I not remember that?

310
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:00,840
Gosh.

311
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:02,200
Let's go home.

312
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,980
Come on.

313
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,980
<i>Celestial Mother</i>

314
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:15,920
How is he?

315
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:18,400
Did Youqin recall anything?

316
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:23,320
Eldest Brother has totally forgotten everything about Yetan.

317
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:27,800
At this rate, there's nothing much we can do.

318
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,740
Perhaps going their separate ways is the best ending for them.

319
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,060
<i>[Funeral]</i>

320
00:26:48,155 --> 00:26:51,310
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Princess Liguang Qingkui]</i>

321
00:26:53,420 --> 00:27:00,580
Since the day I was born, they peg me as a jinx and want to kill me.

322
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,100
Sister.

323
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,540
You were obedient and cute since you were little...
<i>[Memorial Tablet of Princess Liguang Qingkui]</i>

324
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:09,120
and you were also admired by the people after growing up.

325
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:14,600
But why a pristine lady like you had to die, leaving behind an ominous one like me?

326
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,980
They believed that by coercing you into killing yourself,

327
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,960
they would make me a mortal and break my spirit.

328
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,900
No, they're wrong.

329
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:28,000
I, Liguang Yetan, am never a sheep to slaughter.

330
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,020
Kui'er.

331
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,640
Kui'er.

332
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,160
Imperial Father.

333
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,960
I have no idea whether I will be back this time.

334
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,760
Please forgive me for leaving you, Imperial Father.

335
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,700
Feng'er is still alive?

336
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,420
Consort Xue. Cave of Haunted Souls has heavy security.

337
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:34,500
It's infeasible to get him out with only a few of us.

338
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:36,020
We should still try.

339
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:38,200
Right, we should go.

340
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,960
- Please don't...
- I will go with you.

341
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,580
Princess Yetan.

342
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,960
You...

343
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:52,160
I have regained my flower spirit power to avenge my sister.

344
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:57,800
But once you take this step forward, you will have to fight to the bitter end and there's no turning back.

345
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:00,780
I don't need to turn back, and I will not.

346
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:05,160
I'm living now as I want to make the world pay.

347
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:40,860
The flower spirit power is immeasurable.

348
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,480
Where's Chaofeng?

349
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,120
I found him being confined in the Cave of Haunted Souls.

350
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,740
<i>Her Majesty ordered me to torture you day and night.</i>

351
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,580
<i>You murdered my brother.</i>

352
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:07,300
<i>I will make you pay for it.</i>

353
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,240
You refuse to give in even at this moment?

354
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,300
It seems like I'm not going to give you a quick death.

355
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,380
Liguang Yetan?

356
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,660
The flower spirit power?

357
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:26,800
No, it can't be.

358
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,900
- Sir.
- Your Highness.

359
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:39,000
- Sir.
- Feng.

360
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,660
When you intruded to steal the soul shards and killed Man Man,

361
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,300
you should've predicted that I would do away with you in return.

362
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:52,020
Everything I did is for the sake of my brother.

363
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,400
That bird had a really soft neck.

364
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:01,040
That darned bird.

365
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,940
Man Man.

366
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:48,360
I have avenged you.

367
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,740
Finally, you're here.

368
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,140
I'm here to wipe out all those who drove my sister to kill herself.

369
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,300
Is your injury serious or...

370
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:09,100
Had I died,

371
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:14,220
I would've gone to meet Kui'er instead of holding on to my last breath.

372
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,000
Fenyuan Hall... I will head there with you.

373
00:34:27,180 --> 00:34:28,820
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

374
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,680
Eliminate them.

375
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:33,980
Chaofeng, Xue Qingxin. You sinful slaves!

376
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,650
Your Majesty.

377
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,680
I said I would kill you.

378
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,580
Didn't you want me to remember the pain of losing my loved one?

379
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:47,640
Likewise, I wonder if you still remember how Dingyun called you at his final moment.

380
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:50,580
Don't you say my son's name!

381
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,420
Consort Xue.

382
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:20,600
I should have killed you back then.

383
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,240
I never wanted to fight you.

384
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,960
It was you who forced me to do so.

385
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,020
Sir.

386
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:11,180
Consort Mother!

387
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:25,180
- Sir.
- Both my son and I have been tormented by you for thousands of years.

388
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:31,080
Over the years, I always endured it, yet you kept crossing the line.

389
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:35,040
Today, I won't let you harm Feng'er again.

390
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:39,500
You have been scheming for Dingyun to obtain the position of Void Crown Prince.

391
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:43,900
However, all Feng'er and I want is a peaceful life.

392
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:48,200
We're both mothers and shouldn't have hurt each other.

393
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,420
Yun'er.

394
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,960
I failed to avenge you.

395
00:39:58,180 --> 00:40:00,760
I have failed you.

396
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,500
Princess Yetan.

397
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:22,480
Void Tyrant is Feng'er's father, after all.

398
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:23,820
But he has forced my sister to kill herself.

399
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:27,140
His sin is intolerable and only his death can make my sister rest in peace.

400
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,020
My father is ruthless.

401
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:33,260
But he saved my mother's life from the rebellious army which was against his character.

402
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,980
Royal Father.

403
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:39,520
You do have feelings for both my mother and me, right?

404
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,560
A calamity befell the Void today

405
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,493
because I took you in out of my bleeding heart.

406
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:58,020
You're sinful slaves as you were.

407
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:02,120
You are only my slaves and prisoners.

408
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,400
You don't deserve my feelings.

409
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,440
Yet to this day, you still can't understand that it was you and Yingzhao

410
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,660
who got the Void into this trouble due to your oppressive greed.

411
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:15,980
Unless you are overthrown, the four realms are bound to be drenched in blood.

412
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:48,080
Fellow generals of the Void Realm, from this day forward, you shall serve under my command, Liguang Yetan.
