Yes.

What is this? Daylight robbery? That's right. You...

28
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,690
Daylight robbery?

29
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,530
I...

30
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,760
You scammed those three masters.

31
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,780
So I'm just giving you a taste of your own medicine.

32
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,440
Heartless Shaodian.

33
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,940
Your pretty face knows how to lie now?

34
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,120
Just remove the Iridescent Eyes already.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:40,560
We could negotiate properly if you didn't plot a scheme.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,760
Since it's no longer negotiable, I sure am not going to regurgitate your treasure.

37
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,970
Don't ever think you can entice me with worthless things like these.

I...

39
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,920
It's working.

40
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:04,720
I'm telling you...

41
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,370
I will not surrender!

42
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,040
That was close. I almost fell for his trap.

43
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,440
We have so many treasures with us.

44
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:41,390
Can't we treat ourselves to a meal?

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,940
No. I would rather starve to death than give him the satisfaction.

46
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,530
When I see all these treasures on my table,

47
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:59,700
I feel joy, not hunger.

48
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:13,980
If I may comment, if you keep treating Princess Qingkui like this, she isn't going to walk into your trap.

49
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,180
This should be enough to pay for this meal.

50
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,730
Tiny Dragonfly, come and take it.

51
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,613
It is enough.

52
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,540
It's so delicious.

53
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:53,570
Why did you change your mind?

54
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,140
You went out of your way to find all this food, so I don't want them to go to waste.

55
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:02,900
For this, I am willing to look past your stupid schemes.

56
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:09,600
Fine. That's your last chance.

57
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,660
I paid for it. I get to eat, and you don't.

58
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,000
As a human princess, your eating manner is so disappointing.

59
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,300
As if you haven't had anything to eat for half your life.

<i>I don't feel too well, so I can't come with you.</i>

63
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,890
<i>Where do you feel unwell?</i>

64
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:42,920
<i>Oh, I know. Did those palace maids forget to send you food again?</i>

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,840
<i>Don't worry. I'll teach them a lesson now.</i>

66
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:46,573
<i>Don't.</i>

67
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,660
<i>Here it is.</i>

68
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,920
<i>This is so unfair.</i>

69
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,160
<i>Qingkui even has her own kitchen, while you can only have leftovers.</i>

70
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:26,020
If you had a life where you constantly worried about your next meal,

71
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,440
your eating manner would definitely be worse than hers.

72
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:30,740
What do you mean by worrying about my next meal?

73
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,280
You're a human princess. How could you live in destitution?

74
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,560
That's because she...

75
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,480
Because she is very special.

76
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,600
You think being an Empyrean Consort is an easy job?

77
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:52,180
She... She knows people fast in the Heavenly Realm, so since young, she has to fast too.

78
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:55,320
She hardly had a full tummy. Poor soul.

79
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,420
You think it's easy being an Empyrean Consort?

80
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,200
<i>Will he buy into this farce?</i>

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,660
<i>The title of the Empyrean Consort has made her suffer.</i>

82
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:15,020
<i>Ultimately, she starves because of me.</i>

83
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,993
Don't...

84
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,680
Liguang Qingkui!

85
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,600
Your Highness. Don't pull my hair!

86
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,600
She paid for it.

87
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,373
It's okay. Don't worry about it.

88

No. Let me go!

91
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,600
Don't pull me away. Don't.

92
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,000
Calm down. You...

93
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,820
You want to go to the dining hall again today?

94
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,260
We only have this Holy Fabric left.

95
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:56,930
You promised we would use it to make my armor.

96
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,500
It's so easy to spend all your fortune away.

97
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,920
The leftover buns from yesterday's supper.

98
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,120
You can make do with them. Don't go there anymore.

99
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:11,080
Why should I make do? I finally have a dining hall.

100
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:14,740
- Worse comes to worst, I'll go to the three masters—
- Why are you going to them?

101
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,180
To scam them again?

102
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:23,120
I knew you would do that, so I closed the dining hall down.

103
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,240
Scam all the treasures you want from them and you still have no place to spend your money.

104
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:30,620
You got all my money and closed down the dining hall.

105
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,220
The Heavenly Empress gave me this hall, so what if I bring this to her attention?

106
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:38,120
Sorry to disappoint you, but I have already notified my parents.

107
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:43,440
Tomorrow, at the hour of Chen <i>(7 - 9 a.m.), you will head to Shangshu Academy and study divine arts and the rules here.</i>

108
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,900
Become an immortal as soon as possible and stop being a troublemaker.

109
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,540
Academy?

110
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,720
I will have someone send you food. For free.

111
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,880
- If I say no?
- Sure.

112
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,560
You can live with the leftover buns.

113
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:05,760
No school, no food.

114
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,480
Heartless Shaodian... You...

115
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,210
Hey.

116
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:14,640
You pretty-faced vile person!

117
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,120
It hurts.

118
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,740
It's been a while since we last had beautiful weather.

119
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:45,220
Outsmarting Princess Qingkui sure has brightened your mood, Your Highness.

120

<i>[Food Menu]</i>

121
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,040
I have jotted down Princess Qingkui's diet and favorite food.

122
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,940
Prepare her meals accordingly.

123
00:10:57,940 --> 00:11:01,580
I thought your millennium-long training will cause you to have no interpersonal skills.

124
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,320
Who would have known that you could do this?

125
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,380
She likes freedom.

126
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:09,980
Without the burden of an Empyrean Consort, she would be enjoying herself as an ordinary person.

127
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:12,160
I'm...

128
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,100
just trying to make up to her.

129
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:19,420
I went to the Land of Mystery with you for a millennium.

130
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,840
Do you know what I like to eat?

131
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:24,340
A dragonfly likes to eat

132
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,593
flies and mosquitoes.

133
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,480
Anyway, I am busy.

134
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,330
You should get going.

135
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,400
<i>I trained for more than a millennium.</i>

136
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,800
<i>I thought my heart was already a still lake.</i>

137
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
<i>But several days after I came out of my training, </i>

138
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,400
<i>you have caused so many ripples in my heart.</i>

139
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:58,700
<i>A distracted mind is to be avoided before I master the Perfect Celestial Body.</i>

140
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:03,600
I need to find a way to get rid of her.

141
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
<i>Don't!</i>

142
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:12,200
Liguang Qingkui. You are definitely something.

143
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,300
<i>I like it. Of course, I do.</i>

144
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,000
Per His Majesty's order, I'm here to bring you to the court.

145
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,500
All right.

146
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,500
Come with me.

147
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Move.

148
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:42,000
Your Highness. He asked His Majesty to adjudicate on the death of his lackey.

149
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
I think the Second Prince wants you dead.

150
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,500
Killing Zhu Jiuyin is akin to stepping on his toes.

151
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:49,800
Of course, he won't let it slide.

152
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:54,100
But that's precisely what I want. I want rage to blind him so that he slips up.

153
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,300
Hurry up!

154
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,200
Sir, my shackles.

155
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
Right.

156
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:03,300
On the surface, the First Prince looks like a formidable man in the Void Realm.

157
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,800
But compared to the Void Empress and the Second Prince, the First Prince is just all brawn and no brain.

158
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,300
He is not a threat.

159
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:14,300
If you successfully assassinated the First Prince and framed the Second Prince for it,

160
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,200
you wouldn't need to take such a huge risk.

161
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,600
If the Void Empress isn't fiercely protective of Dingyun,

162
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,800
I won't have to resort to a dangerous plan that is framing.

163
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
But it's fine.

164
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:30,700
Wu Dai can be a wild card for our fight against Dingyun.

165
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,100
This way!

166
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,900
Yes, Sir.

167
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:38,200
Sir, your plan is risky.

168
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Should I inform Princess Yetan about it?

169
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,500
No need. Just do your job.

170
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,200
Yes, Sir.

171
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:49,600
The Third Prince is here.

172
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,000
I count on you two, generals.

173
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,800
Go now.

174
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:56,900
Thanks, Sir.

175
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,200
Royal Father.

176
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,100
Your Majesty.

177
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:30,600
Oh, Chaofeng.

178
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,800
Your mother consort was just a surviving descendant of the Fuzhu clan.

179
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,700
She was lucky enough to have earned the favor of His Majesty, and thus you were born.

180
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:45,500
I let you and your mother stay here so that our royal family can have more descendants.

181
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:50,200
But you have the audacity to kill Yun'er's most trusted man.

182
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,900
Royal Father, please take Chaofeng's life.

183
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,600
Chaofeng, do you plead guilty?

184
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,600
Royal Father, I only care about pretty ladies.

185
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Why would I kill Second Brother's man?

186
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:06,000
That day, I found Zhu Jiuyin's behavior rather suspicious.

187
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I confronted him, but he attacked me.

188
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,300
I then accidentally killed him

189
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,600
in self-defense.

190
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,400
Excuses!

191
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,100
Does my general need to report to you wherever he goes now?

192
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:23,200
If Zhu Jiuyin did step out of line, you are supposed to report to His Majesty.

193
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,900
What makes you think you can kill him?

194
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,300
Your Majesty.

195
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:32,700
If you do not make an example of Chaofeng by killing him, no one will respect the rules in the Void Realm.

196
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,800
- Royal Father.
- Royal Father!

197
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,900
You only have yourself to blame.

198
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:23,200
Chaofeng. You dare to defy your royal father's order?

199
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:29,600
Do I have to do this myself now?

200
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,300
The First Prince is here!

201
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,500
<i>Finally.</i>

202
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,200
Royal Father.

203
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Weren't you commanding the army by the border?

204
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:13,000
Why are you here?

205
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,500
Eldest Brother. Help me, please.

206
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,400
You killed Zhu Jiuyin?

207
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,200
By mistake.

208
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,400
I'm surprised.

209
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,000
A spineless man like you accidentally made my job easier.

210
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,800
Eldest Brother.

211
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,600
You can't make up anything you want here.

212
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:40,800
What do you mean by that?

213
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,200
Funny you asked.

214
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,600
- Bring them here.
<i>- Yes, Sir. </i>

215
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:02,500
Royal Father, several days ago,

216
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:06,000
I received news that more than one hundred spies

217
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,200
operating under Dingyun's leadership tried to divide the Void Army.

218
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,500
My investigation confirmed its veracity.

219
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,500
And these traitors said they were waiting for Mr. Zhulong's order.

220
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:20,500
Royal Father. Wu Dai made it all up.

221
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,900
As if I have the time to frame you.

222
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,000
Insolence, Wu Dai!

223
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,800
You dare hit me?

224
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,200
- Stop!
- Why can't I hit you?

225
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,200
Mercy, Your Majesty.

226
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,800
The Second Prince asked me to do this.

227
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
I... I was just following orders.

228
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,800
It cannot be clearer now.

229
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,400
Royal Father.

230
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,600
Royal Father.

231
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,000
If Chaofeng didn't kill Zhu Jiuyin by mistake,

232
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,500
I would be facing a mutiny right now.

233
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:55,700
- Royal Father...
- Aren't you my dear son?

234
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,700
Your Majesty, Yun'er has always been an obedient child.

235
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,400
He won't ever betray you.

236
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,000
Please don't be fooled by Wu Dai.

237
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,200
Silence!

238
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:06,200
Wu Dai is just like me.

239
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,400
He frowns upon dirty tricks like deception.

240
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,800
And the evidence is here anyway.

241
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,500
You sure did a great job raising him.

242
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,800
Royal Father... I was framed.

243
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:28,000
I fought for millennia and killed so many to become the ruler of the Void Realm.

244
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,900
You think lowly tricks such as dividing the Void Army

245
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,500
and framing your own brothers can fool me?

246
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:37,800
Kill all of Dingyun's lackeys.

247
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,900
Including their family.

248
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,700
I'll do it.

249
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,200
<i>Mercy. Please, have mercy.</i>

250
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,700
<i>Mercy. Spare me!</i>

251
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,400
Take this scum away.

252
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,900
Strip him of all his titles so that he can stop abusing his power.

253
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,700
Your Majesty!

254
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:24,000
Royal Father, I truly had no idea about Second Brother's plan.

255
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
Your mother bears a modest status.

256
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,100
I never had any expectations of you.

257
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:32,500
Nevertheless, you contributed inadvertently this time.

258
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,800
I grant you the right to supervise the generals now.

259
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,800
Learn from your eldest brother.

260
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
Thanks, Royal Father.

261
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:55,700
Sir. You came out unscathed. I guess your plan worked.

262
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Come.

263
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,000
Come.

264
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,000
Come on, Haichao.

265
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Haichao.

266
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:05,100
I told you to deliver the message to Wu Dai, so what took you so long?

267
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,800
I was almost strangled to death in there.

268
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,800
Have a taste of it now.

269
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:15,800
The First Prince isn't as smart as you.

270
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
He acted slowly and took his time identifying the spies.

271
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,900
You can't pin that on me.

272
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,800
Your Highness, Consort Xue wishes to see you tomorrow.

273
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:31,600
I told you not to alert my mother.

274
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:38,000
You created such a huge ruckus, so it was impossible to not let her know.

275
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,500
Sure.

276
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,060
Your Highness, you've never done all this for yourself.

277
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:52,070
I hope Princess Qingkui appreciates your kindness and learns to behave.

278
00:21:52,070 --> 00:21:55,860
That will allow you to concentrate on your Perfect Celestial Body training.

279
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,350
I trained for a millennium, and I thought the Perfect Celestial Body would be easy for me.

280
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:07,200
All it took is one Qingkui to distract me so.

281
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,090
She is mischievous, but I am at fault too, for being too easily distracted.

282
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:17,100
School starts tomorrow. Send this book pannier to Tianpa Hall.

283
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,533
Noted.

284
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,953
Your Highness! Your Highness.

285
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,830
Fairy Biqiong wants to see you.

286
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:28,093
Cousin.

287
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:29,700
Fairy Biqiong.

288
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,900
My mother, Danxia, has heard that you came out of your training.

289
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:37,100
She then asked me to deliver this Dragon Ganoderma for your general well-being.

290
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,980
I appreciate that immensely.

291
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:43,640
Cousin, I have to study at Shangshu Academy tomorrow.

292
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,600
Do you have anything you want to tell me?

293
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:50,240
Princess Qingkui will be studying there too.

294
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,480
She will be your classmate.

295
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,780
Please take care of her.

296
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:59,820
She sure is a lucky woman to have earned your affection so.

297
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,380
Unlike me, who came to study alone.

298
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:06,120
I will feel so lonely.

299
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:09,200
The Xia clan is the Shaodian family's in-laws.

300
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,860
The immortals will not mistreat you.

301
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:16,480
However, if you encounter any problems, feel free to turn to the Heavenly Ministry of Education.

302
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,100
Cousin. What I want to say is that I want to stay in Penglai Hall and keep you company.

303
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,560
Not only can I learn from you, but I can also

304
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:30,620
share some of your burdens.

305
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,760
Fairy Biqiong.

306
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:41,020
I cherish your offer.

307
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:44,080
In that case, why don't you come to Penglai Hall tomorrow

308
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,320
so that we can commence the rite of discipleship?

309
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,000
You can become my disciple.

310
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,900
You would let me stay by your side and even take me as a disciple?

311
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,080
I am elated.

312
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,480
Fairy.

313
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,180
Fairy, why are you smiling?

314
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,960
I managed to stay close to my cousin effortlessly. Naturally, I'm happy.

315
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,340
You're sorely mistaken. Teach you a day and he'll be your master forever.

316
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:20,440
The Heavenly Realm forbids disciples and masters from developing romantic feelings.

317
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:25,480
After you go through that rite, you won't be able to start a romantic relationship with His Highness.

318
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:29,300
Fairy.

319
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,740
His Highness gave you a book carrier?

320
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:44,180
Although sending you to Shangshu Academy is a punishment,

321
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,790
your dream of attending a school can be fulfilled too.

322
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,200
<i>[Shangwen Hall]</i>

323
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,640
<i>Today, we'll study the Three Character Classic.</i>

324
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,700
<i>Repeat after me.</i>

325
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,660
<i>- People at birth.
- People at birth.</i>

326
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:10,370
<i>- Are naturally good.
- Are naturally good.</i>

327
00:25:10,370 --> 00:25:13,260
<i>- Their natures are similar.
-Their natures are similar.</i>

328
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,700
<i>Their natures are similar.</i>

329
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,920
<i>- But their habits make them different.
- But their habits make them different.</i>

330
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:20,150
<i>But their habits make them different.</i>

331
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:24,680
This is a blessing in disguise. Are you excited?

332
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,600
What's there to be excited about?

333
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,660
I wouldn't attend school if he didn't threaten me with food.

334
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,900
Is that so?

335
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:38,120
This... Since I'm stuck with Iridescent Eyes, I have to stay here.

336
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,240
I guess I might as well go to Shangshu Academy and learn some divine tricks.

337
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,080
I wouldn't want that Heartless Shaodian to look bad.

338
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,000
You sound nonchalant.

339
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,060
So, why did you pre-read the basics of divine arts?

340
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,620
Don't touch my book.

341
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,900
You're damaging it.

342
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,870
Petty.

343
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:56,790
<i>[Divine Arts Form]</i>

344
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,120
Let's go.

345
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,180
Slow down.

346
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:06,220
First day at school. I don't want to be late.

347
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:08,700
No Empyrean Consort should carry the book carrier herself.

348
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,840
Give it to me.

349
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,660
No. You'll ruin it.

350
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,780
Fine. Walk slowly then. Careful.

351
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:15,020
Stop yammering. Come.

352
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:17,020
<i>Hurry.</i>

353
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,260
Your Highness.

354
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,540
The Princess is heading to Shangshu Academy.

355
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:23,300
Should we see her off?

356
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,860
No need.

357
00:26:25,433 --> 00:26:28,660
I wanted to give them a prep talk to ask them to work harder.

358
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,660
It looks like I no longer need to do that.

359
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,800
The immortal officials are about to arrive.

360
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,800
We should head back now.

361
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,580
<i>Liguang Qingkui.</i>

362
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:59,220
<i>I'll show you what a graceful Empyrean Consort should look like.</i>

363
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,220
Pardon me, Fairy.

364
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:07,540
Who are you? Why do you have this odor on you?

365
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,960
I am from the Five Spice clan.

366
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,160
My name is Husui.

367
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,500
I am in charge of the hygiene of Shangshu Academy.

368
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,950
So you're just a coriander plant.

369
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:22,340
So, this is what Shangshu Academy looks like?

370
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:23,981
Let's find a good seat.

371
00:27:23,981 --> 00:27:26,860
Forgive me, Fairy. I will clean it for you now.

372
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,220
Stop, you half-wit.

373
00:27:28,220 --> 00:27:30,340
Don't you know this Butterfly Cloud Gown is expensive?

374
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,660
A common cleaning spell will ruin it.

375
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,340
You have to buy a new one for me.

376
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,900
Otherwise, I'll see you in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

377
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,460
What a bully.

378
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,560
Let's stay out of it.

379
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,760
I don't want to miss my class.

380
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,860
You're just a vegetable.

381
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:49,140
You don't deserve to even be here in the Heavenly Realm.

382
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,880
Know your place.

383
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,000
<i>Princess Qingkui.</i>

384
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,960
<i>Today, we'll learn about ethics.</i>

385
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:02,360
<i>Those who follow the teachings of Taoism are ethical.</i>

386
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,660
<i>Those who don't are unethical.</i>

387
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:08,060
<i>Taoism is our origin.</i>

388
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:09,680
<i>Our root.</i>

389
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,560
<i>It means in exertion, integrity,</i>

390
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,500
<i>humility, and compliance.</i>

391
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,140
<i>You think you're good enough to learn how to read?</i>

392
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:24,940
<i>Know your place. Come back with me.</i>

393
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,400
<i>Don't you know this Butterfly Cloud Gown is expensive?</i>

394
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,860
<i>A vegetable like you shouldn't even come to the Heavenly Realm.</i>

395
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,100
<i>Why can't I learn how to read?</i>

396
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:35,160
<i>Princess Qingkui goes to school because she is meant to be the Empyrean Consort.</i>

397
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,720
<i>She brings honor to mankind.</i>

398
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,960
<i>You're a jinx.</i>

399
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:41,020
<i>The smarter you are, the more harm you'll do.</i>

400
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,160
<i>I'm not a jinx!</i>

401
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,900
<i>Not a jinx, you said?</i>

402
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,860
<i>Look. I'm bleeding now.</i>

403
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,820
<i>Take her away.</i>

404
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,253
It hurts.

405
00:29:12,253 --> 00:29:14,073
Oh, it hurts.

406
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,620
You stepped on me.

407
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,240
Why are you saying "it hurts"?

408
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,620
Heartache.

409
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,160
My shoes are very precious.

410
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:26,080
You have now dirtied my sole. I demand an apology.

411
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,320
Also, you have to pay up

412
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,080
500,000 spirit beads.

413
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:36,540
Where do you even come from anyway?

414
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:40,360
You stepped on me first, so why should I apologize to you?

415
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:43,820
I also saw you bump into the attendant.

416
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,260
She was supposed to make way for a fairy like me.

417
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,700
Why didn't you make way for me then?

418
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,060
- You...
- As a fairy, you behave unreasonably. That's ignorance.

419
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,940
You bully the weak. That's mean.

420
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,040
You're ignorant and mean.

421
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,640
I wonder who gives you the right to throw a tantrum here.

422
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:59,080
How disrespectful!

423
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,820
My aunt is the Heavenly Empress.

424
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,270
You dare to cross me?

425
00:30:03,270 --> 00:30:05,680
You're from a powerful family?

426
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,000
Wow, I'm so scared.

427
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,880
So scared.

428
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm about to faint.

429
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,840
I'm so scared. This is scary.

430
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,153
<i>Sister-in-law?</i>

431
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:19,340
Hey.

432
00:30:19,340 --> 00:30:20,180
You're here.

433
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,530
Master said we played too much when we were young, so we have to reinforce our fundamentals here.

434
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,820
We meet again

435
00:30:26,820 --> 00:30:29,590
You are the human princess?

436
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:37,480
Your Highness, you need not help me.

437
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:40,380
I have no idea what to do to repay you, Your Highness.

438
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,980
Don't worry.

439
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,140
I do not tolerate any class-based discrimination.

440
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:48,540
I would still intervene even if you weren't the one who got bullied today.

441
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,093
You...

442
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,900
It's morning revision time.

443
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,700
Why are you congregating here?

444
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:57,720
Sir.

445
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
Sir.

446
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:06,060
My mother used my clan's Cloud Stitch techniques

447
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:09,080
to sew this Butterfly Cloud Gown for me.

448
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:14,120
I wanted to dress up before I meet Princess Qingkui today.

449
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,813
But when we met, she picked on me and...

450
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:21,813
and...

451
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:25,420
And even injured my foot.

452
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:29,800
A mortal like me injured a fairy?

453
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:33,140
Let me recall. What did I do just now?

454
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,020
Did I step on you like this?

455
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,870
What are you doing?

456
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,560
You sure run fast despite your alleged injury.

457
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:46,220
Princess Qingkui, can you stop with your antics?

458
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,840
She was bullying an immortal attendant.

459
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:51,140
I merely exposed her hypocrisy.

460
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:55,880
- I...
- If she is in the wrong, you should come to me and ask me to intervene.

461
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,080
You shouldn't get physical with your classmate.

462
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,180
Come to you?

463
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:03,080
When you arrived, that attendant would be locked up in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

464
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,500
Princess Qingkui, you sure are as obstinate as your reputation claims.

465
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:13,980
I don't care what rules the mortals follow, when you're at Shangshu Academy, you respect the rules here.

466
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,920
I am not the only one involved in this incident, but you only reproach me.

467
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:24,840
Is nepotism the rule here at Shangshu Academy?

468
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,773
You...

469
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:27,940
Princess Qingkui.

470
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:33,780
I'm afraid your irreverence and insolence cannot be corrected in my academy.

471
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:37,200
Find another teacher, Princess Qingkui.

472
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,040
Suit yourself.

473
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,700
What?

474
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:52,000
She was expelled by Shangshu Academy?

475
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,300
Well, she hadn't even started school, so she was just rejected.

476
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:02,800
An Empyrean Consort from the Shaodian family was expelled by Shangshu Academy?

477
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,600
Unprecedented.

478
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,800
She is hopeless.

479
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:11,400
You will demolish the dining hall immediately.

480
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
Calm down, Your Highness.

481
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,700
It was all my fault.

482
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:26,100
Please do not punish Princess Qingkui for the kindness she extended towards me.

483
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,000
Kindness?

484
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,600
Stand up and explain.

485
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:35,000
Today in Shangshu Academy, I accidentally bumped into Fairy Biqiong.

486
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Fairy Biqiong then insulted me in public and said she would bring me to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

487
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,500
She even wanted to fine me 50,000 spirit beads.

488
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,900
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

489
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:47,000
That is one unfair teacher.

490
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,200
How is he supposed to educate people?

491
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,500
And you.

492
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,900
How could you just walk away like that?

493
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,800
Explain everything, at least.

494
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:56,500
They are all the same.

495
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,000
I'm used to it by now.

496
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,700
Instead of prolonging my humiliation, I would rather walk away.

497
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,300
What should we do now?

498
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,000
You were expelled. How are we supposed to face His Highness now?

499
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,400
There's nothing we can do.

500
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,600
You want me to apologize to that incompetent teacher?

501
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,500
No way.

502
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,400
Throw the carrier away.

503
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Perhaps I am never meant to go to school.

504
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:40,000
I'll leave you two to speak. I should go.

505
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,800
If you want me to apologize to him, you can save yourself the trouble.

506
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:51,600
However, Knowledge Star Deity expelled me.

507
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,100
So you can't cut off my food.

508
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:07,000
In three days, there will be a test at Shangshu Academy.

509
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:09,000
Prepare for it.

510
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:12,000
A test?

511
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,800
But I was expelled.

512
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,200
His Highness has cleared the whole misunderstanding.

513
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,000
Knowledge Star Deity now allows you to sit for the test.

514
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,400
If you pass it, you can study at Shangshu Academy.

515
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:33,700
<i>Just because you recommended her in doesn't mean she can bypass the rules of the academy.</i>

516
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:39,100
<i>Princess Qingkui saw a quarrel between Fairy Biqiong and an attendant.</i>

517
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,800
<i>She might have been carried away by her emotions.</i>

518
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:47,100
<i>I hope that you can forgive her for my sake.</i>

519
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:49,200
<i>Please give her another chance.</i>

520
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,800
<i>Shangshu Academy isn't a place for childcare.</i>

521
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:59,800
<i>If she passes the talent test in three days, I will forget this incident.</i>

522
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,700
<i>Or else, please take her back, Your Highness, and tutor her yourself.</i>

523
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:06,700
<i>Qingkui is a human.</i>

524
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:11,100
<i>The subjects in Shangshu Academy might be too hard for her.</i>

525
00:36:11,100 --> 00:36:13,600
<i>Besides, she is the future Empyrean Consort.</i>

526
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,200
<i>It'd be a dishonor among the immortals if she was expelled by Shangshu Academy.</i>

527
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,000
<i>Sir, can you give her more time?</i>

528
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:26,400
<i>Your Highness, is this an order from you?</i>

529
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,000
<i>If it is a coercive order from you, I will comply.</i>

530
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,500
<i>Surely not.</i>

531
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,000
<i>Then, do as you see fit.</i>

532
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,800
A test cannot determine if I am good enough for the school.

533
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,900
If you pass the test, I will dispel your Iridescent Eyes.

534
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,900
You said it yourself. You cannot take it back.

535
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,600
I am an immortal of my word.

536
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,500
I will help you prepare for this test.

537
00:36:56,500 --> 00:37:00,200
Pack up and come find me in Penglai Hall.

<i>[Divine Arts Form]</i>

00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,600
So you're here.

540
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,800
Pardon me, Your Highness. I didn't mean to study the divine arts in secret.

541
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:08,100
I must have frightened you.

542
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:11,700
I saw you when I went to Penglai Hall to see my brother.

543
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,400
I then followed you here.

544
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,000
I wanted to thank you for voicing up for my sister-in-law. Otherwise, she would be expelled for real.

545
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,500
Her Highness was punished because of me.

546
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:23,600
I cannot let her suffer from the unjust blame.

547
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,700
Well... Your name is Husui?

548
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,100
What I mean to ask is, are you the coriander plant

549
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,200
that I watered in secret when I was down in the Human Realm?

550
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:36,600
You watered me?

551
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,600
Yes, I did.

552
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,400
I used to visit the Land of Nature regularly.

553
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,600
<i>Through the Source Mirror, </i>

554
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,700
<i>I saw a coriander plant in the Human Realm, </i>

555
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:47,600
<i>so I took Rain Deity's Purifying Vial and poured a drop of Heavenly Dew on it.</i>

556
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,100
<i>Someone found out about it, and I was punished.</i>

557
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,800
The dew must have allowed you to become an immortal.

558
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,400
That's why we could meet here.

559
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:19,800
If someone ever bullies you, you tell me.

560
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,200
I'll defend you.

561
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

562
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:27,300
But I am very weak.

563
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,200
After I trained for a millennium, I barely became an immortal.

564
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,800
I don't think I was blessed by the Heavenly Dew.

565
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,500
You must be mistaken, Your Highness.

566
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,400
Are...

567
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,700
Are you sure?

568
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,400
But I saw you practice so hard just now.

569
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:50,600
Not unlike the coriander plant who longed to become an immortal.

570
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,700
I do not want to lie to you, Your Highness.

571
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:57,800
But I'm not the coriander plant that you mentioned.

572
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,200
Right.

573
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:03,400
Coincidences don't appear every day.

574
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,700
A coriander plant has a short life.

575
00:40:05,700 --> 00:40:09,100
Perhaps it is no longer alive.

576
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,000
However, we get along very well.

577
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,600
I'm sure we can be friends.

578

Don't you think?

579
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,700
I'll take your silence as a yes, then.

If you want to browse any scrolls, come to me.

581

I heard the Prince ran away again.

593
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,000
The Beast King is furious and asked us to keep a close watch.

594
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,400
- We're to capture him if we see him.
- Noted.

Do you have to do this for her?

For Tan Tan, everything is worth it.

603
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,700
Deal with the rest.

604
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,300
Your Highness, are you sure it can fly?

605
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,600
Back off.

606
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,400

I am the genius artifact inventor of the Four Realms.

The wind glider I made can ride the wind current and bring me to the Ninth Heaven.

609
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:24,600
It even got first place in an artifact tournament.
