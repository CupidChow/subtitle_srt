00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,200
<i>How did that happened?</i>

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,380
What is this?

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,280
Your Highness. Does that count as one move?

25
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,640
Yes.

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,700
But what is happening to me?

27
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,820
What sorcery is this? Why can't I move my legs?

28
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,860
I simply used silver needles to block your meridian pathways.

29
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:32,800
It causes your limbs to go numb and blocks the meridian flow.

30
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,760
Your Highness, that is the wonder of medicine.

31
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,390
Medicine?

32
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:42,740
<i>Never heard of it.</i>

33
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,020
Thank you for not killing me, Your Highness.

34
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,700
Your Highness.

<i>[Tianpa Hall]</i>

36
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,340
Congratulations, Your Highness! You passed Shangshu Academy's test!

37
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,840
Of course, I did.

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,280
You're awesome.

39
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,720
What is that delicious smell? Did you prepare food for me?

40
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,260
I'll tell you later. Quick.

41
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,820
Your Highness.

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,800
Hu Sui. What are you doing here?

43
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,840
Husui prepared all of these for you.

44
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
Those are gifts from Shangshu Academy.

45
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,820
Your Highness had to go through the trouble for speaking up for me.

46
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:37,440
I don't have much. I could only prepare some spicy dishes.

47
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,780
I hope you don't mind.

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,640
That was nothing. Don't mention it.

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,720
We can meet every day when you make it to Shangshu Academy.

50
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:47,960
I caused a dispute soon after I came to the Heavenly Realm.

51
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,500
The supervisor blames me for it.

52
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,580
I will be stripped of my duty here.

53
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,440
I must return to the Five Spice clan.

54
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,800
Do you want to go back?

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,900
I worked hard to become a deity.

56
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,700
I'd hate to go back before I accomplish anything.

57
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,780
You are stripped of your duty, not your status as a deity.

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,020
Why must you go back?

59
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,780
That's right.

60
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,320
Tell them...

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:13,280
Tell them Princess Qingkui offered you a position in Tianpa Hall.

62
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,340
From now on, you work for me.

63
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,060
Thank you for taking me in and caring for me.

64
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,720
I... I'll make you more coriander pancakes!

65
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
Go ahead.

66
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,080
You went against the principle of a bully again.

67
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,300
I did it because I admire her cooking.

68
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:43,260
Think about it. If your cooking was half as good, that Heartless Shaodian couldn't have blackmailed me.

69
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,000
Don't touch it. I haven't read it yet.

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,420
Fine, you can have it. Stingy.

71
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,420
Fine, take it.

<i>[Liguang Qingkui]</i>

73
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,820
When you were little, you wished for the day you could go to school.

74
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,600
Your wish came true now.

75
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,140

<i>[Liguang Qingkui]</i>

79
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:06,280
It may be your sister's name on it, but you didn't get into Shangshu Academy with that name.

80
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,060
You got in with your hard work and brilliant mind.

81
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,100
You earned the right.

82
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,180
I didn't earn it.

83
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,960
You once asked me, when I was little, why everything in the hall had Qingkui's name on it.

84
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,180
She grew up having everything she needed.

85
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:25,580
She knew I didn't have any, so she secretly sent those things to my room.

86
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,500
She told others she lost them.

87
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,720
Well, the old maidservants scolded me for it.

88
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:35,020
I was born with a rough fate.

89
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:38,580
That silly girl did a lot of thankless things for me.

90
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,700
Given her personality, she is bound to suffer in the Void Realm.

91
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,900
How could I use her name to realize my dream here?

92
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,860
I wish I could...

93
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,940
Are you thinking about rescuing your sister?

94
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,620
Do you want more punishment?

95
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,940
Heartless Shaodian...

96
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:55,800
He promised he would remove this thing after I finished the entrance test!

97
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,460
The test is over, but he went missing!

98
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,500
I must find that jerk.

99
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:17,060
Your Highness. It's been over 1,500 years since you left Shangshu Academy.

100
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:23,320
Finding your old notes and files here is almost impossible.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,460
We've made it to files from 1,200 years ago.

102
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:28,700
Dig deeper. Perhaps we can find them.

103
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,060
They will be handy for Qingkui's studies.

104
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,180
Heartless Shaodian! I've finally found you!

105
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,080
I looked everywhere for you!

106
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,400
When did you leave just now?

107
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,760
Did you witness my astounding performance?

108
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,100
I did.

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,360
I only got the second grade, but I have the level of the first grade. Aren't you happy?

110
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,240
As an Empyrean Consort, you almost couldn't keep your status as a student.

111
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,120
How could you be celebrating?

112
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,600
I knew you wouldn't say anything nice to me.

113
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:56,660
Either way, you must fulfill your promise now.

114
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:02,280
Your Highness! I found it!

115
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:15,180
I... I got the wrong section.

116
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,960
I'll keep looking. I'll keep looking.

117
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,060
What do you want?

118
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,660
Remove this Iridescent Eyes!

119
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,740
- No.
- Why not?

120
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:26,360
Did you use the Revitalization Spell?

121
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,980
Yes.

122
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:34,180
I admit. I added a pinch of extra ingredients.

123
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,540
But the spell was hard! I didn't have the time to master it.

124
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:39,920
Thankfully, I have a brilliant mind.

125
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,860
Knowledge Star Deity saw through it, but I passed the test and earned second grade.

126
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,300
You admit you didn't master the technique.

127
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,020
How dare you call yourself worthy?

128
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,620
Knowledge Star Deity let you pass out of appreciation for talents.

129
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:53,780
I won't let you pass so easily.

130
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:56,080
You must keep the Iridescent Eyes.

131
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,860
When you become a worthy Empyrean Consort, I will undo it for you.

132
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,420
I have work to finish. Go.

133
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,940
Heartless Shaodian! Heartless Shaodian! Heartless Shaodian!

134
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:11,460
Heartless Shaodian!

135
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:18,300
Heartless Shaodian! You rigid jerk! Show some leniency!

136
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,960
You... You will pay for this!

137
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:26,860
Calm down. I knew Shaodian Youqin wouldn't release you.

138
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:30,100
I may be his Empyrean Consort, he has no right to do this to me.

139
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,840
Your Highness, don't be upset.

140
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,440
The four realms bow to the immortals, especially the Shaodian clan.

141
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:39,100
They can decide a person's fate and shift the world to their will.

142
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,460
I had heard about this before in the Human Realm before becoming a deity.

143
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,600
I don't care what he does to the others. I've had enough of his torment.

144
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,620
I think you should. You should try to earn his favor.

145
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,660
When he's in a good mood, he might actually undo the Iridescent Eyes.

146
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:53,900
Earn his favor?

147
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,900
You are right.

148
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,440
He wants me to become a worthy Empyrean Consort.

149
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,640
So be it.

150
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,220
Your Highness!

151
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:28,920
Your Highness! Did you use medicine to defeat the First Prince?

152
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,100
Yes. What's the matter?

153
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,680
The First Prince resembles the Void Tyrant the most.

154
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,580
He loves fighting and never admits his defeat.

155
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:40,540
It's said that someone won the fight by a hair and was then hunted to the edge of the world.

156
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:42,040
What do I do now?

157
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,080
I only wanted to save the Third Prince.

158
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,500
I didn't give it much thought.

159
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,460
I have an idea. I'll take you to the Third Prince's manor to wait it out.

160
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:51,500
- Let's go.
- Okay.

161
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,500
<i>I simply used silver needles to block your meridian pathways.</i>

162
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,300
<i>It causes your limbs to go numb and blocks the meridian flow.</i>

163
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,700
<i>That is the wonder of medicine.</i>

164
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,200
<i>I never knew she had such courage.</i>

165
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,300
<i>She is truly special.</i>

166
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,500
Come here.

167
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,300
Your Highness! What do you want?

168
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,900
The voidwalkers always have great respect for martial arts.

169
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:11,800
Since I defeated you, even the Void Tyrant can't change that outcome.

170
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,300
You got it all wrong.

171
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,400
I respect my father more than anyone.

172
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,700
Second to him are those who can fight.

173
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,300
Your medicine is unpredictable.

174
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,800
I spent hours studying it, but I couldn't fathom it.

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
I was hoping you could teach me a thing or two.

176
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,500
Jab me with some needles so I can remember it.

177
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,000
I can use this technique to uphold justice.

178
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,200
Don't be surprised.

179
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:37,200
If I can master skills such as yours, I can conquer the four realms and become unstoppable.

180
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,500
Come on.

181
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,700
Jab me with this.

182
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,400
Your Highness, I...

183
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Don't be afraid. My skin is thick. I'll live. Do it.

184
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,200
Your Highness, this needle... The needle...

185
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,900
Don't mind the needle. Go ahead and jab me.

186
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:53,700
Come on. Jab me!

187
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,000
Jab! Jab me!

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
It's not the right needle!

189
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,400
- Do it!
- I can't.

190
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,800
- Jab me right here.
- Brother!

191
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,800
Eldest Brother, what are you doing?

192
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,000
I yearn to learn medicine. I came for the knowledge.

193
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,500
What are you doing here?

194
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,600
Tan Tan, ignore him. Let's carry on.

195
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,100
Jab me at my vital points.

196
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,300
Eldest Brother, you broke the taboo and came seeking medicine.

197
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,300
If royal father learned of it, you'd be punished.

198
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,200
Drop the act. I don't buy it.

199
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,300
I know she healed your wounds.

200
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,100
I know what she did.

201
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Besides, she decides whether she will teach me.

202
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,400
Why do you care? Mind your own business.

203
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,800
I care because she risked her life to save mine.

204
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,600
The two of you, stop fighting.

205
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,200
Third Prince, I will never forget the kindness you've shown me.

206
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
First Prince, you should go.

207
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,700
Kindness?

208
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,400
You did it only to repay my kindness?

209
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,600
Of course.

210
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,000
What else could it be? Get over yourself.

211
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,200
You misunderstood.

212
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,300
Tan Tan, forget about him.

213
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,200
Let's carry on.

214
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,300
Eldest Brother, please conduct yourself.

215
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,500
Let go.

216
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,500
You let go.

217
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,100
Who do you think you are?

218
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,300
Let go now!

219
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,500
You let go!

220
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:10,600
Tan Tan! Come here!

221
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,200
- Let go!
- Come over here!

222
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,500
- Let go!
- Stop!

223
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,600
You two are perfectly healthy and well, so why are you two bothering me?

224
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,500
Get out, all of you!

225
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,200
Tan...

226
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:24,000
First Prince...
<i>[Zhuoxin Hall]</i>

227
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,100
Tan Tan?

228
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:27,200
Tan Tan! You...

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,500
You...

230
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,200
Take care, Eldest Brother.

231
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,600
Kindness?

232
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,100
Do you believe that?

233
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,900
Why would any girl risk her life to save another man out of kindness?

234
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,500
Impossible!

235
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,700
That's right.

236
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,700
She can't repay the kindness you've never shown her.

237
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:19,800
She should take revenge on you.

238
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:24,200
She must think I am surrounded by women.

239
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,800
So she used Wu Dai to see if I had feelings for her.

240
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:30,800
But curse that Wu Dai.

241
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,800
How dare he hold her hands and ask her to teach her acupuncture!

242
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
He was up to no good!

243
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,800
Outrageous! Cursed Chaofeng!

244
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,500
I only wanted to learn acupuncture.

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:42,600
Why must he get in my way?

246
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:46,000
I bet that brat was up to something!

247
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,800
I think you are overreacting.

248
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,500
The First Prince is very straightforward.

249
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,400
He doesn't hide his feelings for a woman.

250
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:53,600
We should wait for our chances.

251
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,100
Calm down.

252
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,200
Clear your mind.

253
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,800
I think you are overreacting.

254
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,800
Princess Yetan is the future crown consort.

255
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,100
The Third Prince is very cautious.

256
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:05,300
He only ever asks about the Void Patrol Battalion.

257
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:07,700
He grabbed Qingkui's hands and forced her to jab him.

258
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,400
And he tried hard to please her.

259
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,300
A man like him is not worthy of being our commander!

260
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,800
He protects her so jealously, as if I'd eat her alive!

261
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,600
Who does he think he is?

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,200
Who is he to marry Princess Yetan?

263
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,800
Have you heard?

264
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:27,600
Princess Yetan who had just arrived is quite the beauty.

265
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,100
Princess Yetan is a mere mortal.

266
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,300
She doesn't get along with voidwalkers.

267
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,400
What's the problem?

268
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,900
Her beauty is the only thing that matters.

269
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,800
Listen. The woman acts so cold and distant.

270
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,100
She is playing hard-to-get!

271
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:49,000
If I ever get the chance to hold her hands...

272
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,600
If I could give her a kiss...

273
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:55,600
<i>Who do you think you are?</i>

274
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,000
<i>Only I can have those thoughts!</i>

275
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,800
They just had to run into each other...

276
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,800
Tan is my future consort!

277
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,300
How dare you vie for her!

278
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,400
You're a son of a sinner!

279
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,000
- You should know your place! You're not worthy!
- No!

280
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,200
That's right! You're not worthy!

281
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,400
It seems I should knock some sense into you today.

282
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,500
Your Highness.

283
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,800
Too many are watching.

284
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,500
You will expose your true power if you fight him.

285
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,700
You must control yourself.

286
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,300
I know.

287
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,100
I'll make you realize that Tan Tan is mine!

288
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,400
You can only dream on ever having her!

289
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,500
Are you all right, First Prince?

290
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,700
Your Highness!

291
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,600
Your Highness, are you all right?

292
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,200
The Third Prince is strong.

293
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,300
<i>Oh no.</i>

294
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,700
<i>Dingyun and the Void Empressare watching me. </i>

295
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
<i>I mustn't expose my strength again.</i>

296
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,000
Eldest Brother! Eldest Brother!

297
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,400
I've been away from battles. I overdid it.

298
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,000
I apologize.

299
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,200
Cursed brat...

300
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,600
A mighty punch, Eldest Brother.

301
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,200
Your Highness?

302
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,800
Your Highness!

303
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,700
Stop watching. Let's leave.

304
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,100
Everything is as you expected.

305
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:57,400
Chaofeng and Wu Dai had a fight in public over Princess Yetan.

306
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:58,800
And guess what?

307
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,500
Chaofeng overdid it and hurt Wu Dai.

308
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,600
He knelt before the public.

309
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
What an embarrassing sight.

310
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,800
Chaofeng is the son of a sinner.

311
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,500
He wanted to join hands with Wu Dai to stand against us?

312
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,000
Our alienation tactic should put an end to his malicious intent.

313
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,200
Thus,

314
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,000
your judgment was astute, Royal Mother.

315
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Wu Dai is used to being so brash.

316
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,800
If Chaofeng ruffles his feathers, Chaofeng's future will be even more perilous.

317
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,600
But he is vigilant.

318
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:37,900
Despite his defeat today, we can't be sure if he won't find a chance to make a comeback.

319
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,700
We should stay cautious.

320
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,800
You are right, Royal Mother.

321
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,500
I understand.

322
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,500
Greetings, Your Highness.

323
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:15,500
What are you doing here?

324
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:17,400
Dining.

325
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:21,100
This is my favorite food from the human world.

326
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,300
Stinky tofu and snail rice noodles.

327
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,000
Try it out.

328
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,200
I was asking why you're dining here.

329
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm here to keep you company.

330
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I don't need that. Go now.

331
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,500
I didn't want to come here either.

332
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,400
But the Iridescent Eyes made me come here.

333
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,100
The more you refuse to undo it, the more I want it gone.

334
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,000
And it hurts the more I have the thought.

335
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,800
But if I'm closer to you, the Iridescent Eyes don't hurt as much.

336
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:45,600
Therefore, I am not leaving you.

337
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,000
It won't be a waste of time anyway.

338
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,500
I could use the opportunity to learn how to be an Empyrean Consort.

339
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,100
You must get used to it.

340
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
We are going to spend the rest of our life together.

341
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,800
Right?

342
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,700
Where should I put this?

343
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,600
Do you need some ink?

344
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
Leave it to me.

345
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,600
Are you reading documents?

346
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,600
Leave it to me.

347
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,100
Do you want some tea?

348
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
Leave it to me.

349
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,400
What else do you need?

350
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,420
Your Highness, some fresh petals?

351
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,600
Never mind.

352
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,700
Do you need to wipe yourself after the bath?

353
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,160
Wipe down?

354
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,460
We aren't married yet. Do you have no shame?

355
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:20,180
What are you thinking?

356
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:26,360
I was asking if you needed a towel.

357
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:36,360
Be prudent. Make sure there are no mistakes.
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

358
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,000
Understood. I think...

359
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,900
Your Highness!

360
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,720
Your Highness, why didn't you call me when you woke up?

361
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,220
I didn't get the chance to serve you.

362
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,720
You spent the night tormenting me, wasn't that enough for you?

363
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,120
We were here early.

364
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,940
We'll come back later to report back to you.

365
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:00,340
- No! Not...Not...
- We saw nothing. Nothing at all.

366
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:02,560
Wait, let me explain... I...

367
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:37,540
Your Highness. Do you need help falling asleep?

368
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:39,960
Let me know if you need anything.

369
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,640
I've lived 2,700 years.

370
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,840
That was my first nightmare.

371
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
Fairy Husui.

372
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:08,940
Greetings, Prince Qingheng.

373
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,060
I never saw you again at Shangshu Academy.

374
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,720
Where were you?

375
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,300
The supervisor refused to let me work there due to the recent incident.

376
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:21,740
But Princess Qingkui took me in and made me an attendant in Tianpa Hall.

377
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,380
I didn't know about that.

378
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,640
Why didn't you come to me? I could've pled with them.

379
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,880
I-I wouldn't dare trouble you with such a trivial matter.

380
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,860
It concerns you, so it's not trivial.

381
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:38,180
You already know I'm not the person you were looking for.

382
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:40,960
Why do you still care about me?

383
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:45,220
I just thought I got this cordial feeling whenever I meet you.

384
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,560
I really want to be your friend.

385
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,580
It's fine. You are already working at Tianpa Hall.

386
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:52,380
It's a nice place to be.

387
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:55,800
But don't forget that you can count on me for help.

388
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,480
You need not hide from me.

389
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,820
By the way, there is something I need your help with.

390
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:09,200
What is it?

391
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,740
I read about a magic item in an ancient scroll.

392
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,380
It's called the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

393
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:18,300
One can collect souls and contain them in the item.

394
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:20,480
Have you heard about it?

395
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,220
No.

396
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,820
But why are you interested?

397
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,460
I was just curious. I wanted to learn more.

398
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:31,200
In that case, I could ask around for you.

399
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,420
Perhaps the three masters know about this item.

400
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:38,220
I asked out of curiosity. I shouldn't trouble the other deities.

401
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:41,100
I have work to do. I should go.

402
00:25:57,660 --> 00:26:03,100
Your Highness, you let anger get the better of you and hit the First Prince, exposing your true might.

403
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,060
He talked about Qingkui. He asked for it.

404
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:11,180
A human girl was the reason you broke your cover after centuries of disguise.

405
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,060
You even asked me to get you these flowers for her.

406
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:18,000
Perhaps this is love.

407
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,320
Shut it.

408
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,680
I didn't expose myself.

409
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,360
As if the First Prince would believe it was a mistake!

410
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,340
I know my chances of dealing with Wu Dai.

411
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,780
He may not believe it, but I can convince him.

412
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,700
- You're—
- Your Highness!

413
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:38,940
Sushui said the First Prince went to Princess Yetan to heal his injury.

414
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,340
What?

415
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,300
That cursed Wu Dai again!

416
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:49,480
You couldn't teach him a lesson, but you gave him a chance to see Princess Qingkui again.

417
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,640
Your Highness. Picture that.

418
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,120
Qingkui is tending to Wu Dai's injury.

419
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,900
To do that, he must undress for her.

420
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,920
No. I must end this menace!

421
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,040
Not again! I was just kidding!

422
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:03,100
- Move aside! Move aside!
- Calm down. Calm down!

423
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,540
- Back off!
- Not again!

424
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,740
Your Highness. You could expose your cover at this rate!

425
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:11,040
- Get off of me!
- Not until you calm down!

426
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,120
Get down.

427
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,820
Calm down.

428
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,920
Let's prepare the flowers. Don't let them go to waste.

429
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,240
What flowers? I'll make Wu Dai regret it!

430
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,400
Your Highness! Your Highness!

431
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
Your Highness. The Princess dressed your wounds.

432
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,120
It'll heal in three days.

433
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,840
Why are you...

434
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:41,680
You fool. Do I need to recover so soon?

435
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,620
- Don't you?
- Do I?

436
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:51,080
You want to use the injury as an excuse to visit Princess Yetan and get close to her.

437
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:53,920
You finally got smarter.

438
00:28:01,160 --> 00:28:03,020
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness.

439
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,580
- Eldest Brother!
- Your Highness!

440
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,180
Eldest Brother!

441
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,340
It's you again.

442
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,360
<i>You'd use your injury to approach her?</i>

443
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,900
<i>I'll make you pay for that.</i>

444
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,360
What is the meaning of this?

445
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,000
Eldest Brother. Back at the tavern, I wounded you by accident because I was rusty.

446
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,740
I regret my action deeply.

447
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,720
I came here to ask you to train me.

448
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,580
Please accept this as my apology and help me out.

449
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,260
I am the greatest warrior in this realm.

450
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:56,360
A clumsy guy like you can never hurt me in a fight.

451
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:05,920
Seeing it's a fine blade, I shall gladly give you some guidance.

452
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,800
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

453
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:37,060
Eldest Brother. You're awesome.

454
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:39,180
Did you get it?

455
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,700
Show me.

456
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,000
Eldest Brother, I'll give it a try.

457
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,200
Eldest Brother...

458
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,860
How clumsy of me.

459
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,880
Eldest Brother, are you all right?

460
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,220
I'm all right.

461
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:08,040
- I'll take it out.
- Don't!

462
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:14,400
Eldest...

463
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,760
Hurts! That hurts!

464
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,920
Hurts!

465
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,420
Well... The ax doesn't suit you.

466
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,780
Let's try using hidden weapons.

467
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,780
So... I showed you the steps.

468
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:35,520
- Do you get it now?
- Yes, Eldest Brother.

469
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,280
Show me.

470
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:43,040
Yes, Eldest Brother.

471
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,620
Eldest Brother. I missed again.

472
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:03,500
The First Prince and the Third Prince have been training very hard lately.

473
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,460
If they know you're visiting, they will be overjoyed.

474
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,020
I'm glad they get along.

475
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:12,780
Move aside.

476
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,960
Eldest Brother. Teach me more!

477
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,800
You... You are too dumb.

478
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
I can't train you.

479
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,680
Yes, I am dumb. I am talentless.

480
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,980
- That is why I must train!
- No. No need.

481
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,480
You are very talented.

482
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,060
If my hunch is right, you are a peerless martial art prodigy!

483
00:31:30,060 --> 00:31:33,320
But... I don't have the skill or the talent to train you.

484
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,740
Go to Dingyun. Go to him instead.

485
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,920
- Go to Second Brother.
- Wudai!

486
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:39,980
Be nice, Your Highness.

487
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,120
Stop!

488
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,140
Tan Tan! Tan Tan!

489
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:53,160
Tan Tan! Save me!

490
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,240
Sushui. Take the First Prince to Zhuoxin Hall and tend to his injury.

491
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,920
Your Highness. Please come with me.

492
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:05,660
<i>Be careful, Your Highness. Watch your steps.</i>

493
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
Well played, Your Highness.

494
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,600
You wounded your brother for no reason.

495
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:22,860
You are not better than the Second Prince who pulled a switcheroo with my sister and me.

496
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,120
They are the same.

497
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,040
I wanted... I wanted to send a message.

498
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:32,040
I don't want him to trouble you.

499
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,740
He only wants to learn about medicine.

500
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:35,440
He has always been nice to me.

501
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,180
When has he ever caused me any trouble?

502
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,480
Why are you defending him?

503
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,260
I'm not defending anyone.

504
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:45,400
I hate people who oppress others with power and those who harm their own families.

505
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,620
I never thought you would be so vile.

506
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,020
You are wrong!

507
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:56,120
Your actions and behaviors are beyond horrible.

508
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,200
I brewed this potion to quell evil.

509
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,720
I want you to reflect on your mistakes.

510
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,380
Princess Yetan...

511
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:06,020
Your Highness? Your Highness!

512
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,200
How do I look?

513
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:14,960
You're turning green.

514
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,120
Your Highness.

515
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,900
This mustn't go on. Apologize to her now. Ask for the antidote.

516
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,620
Never!

517
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,820
Back off!

518
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,220
Your Highness. Do you want to wash your face?

519
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,380
Go out!

520
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,620
Do you need to get changed?

521
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:39,640
I can do it myself.

522
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:41,860
Don't you want me to become a worthy Empyrean Consort?

523
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:45,260
I'm doing everything an Empyrean Consort should do.

524
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,560
Go away!

525
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:51,680
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

526
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,260
Your Highness, don't go!

527
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,600
Don't touch me! Leave, or I will!

528
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,860
Your hair is all messy.

529
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,700
Don't touch me!

530
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,740
Princess Qingkui's love for him is true.

531
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:05,020
It seems I made the right decision.

532
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:08,300
I wonder when I will know love such as theirs.

533
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,660
- What? Get over here! Be a good boy.
- You're annoying!

534
00:34:10,660 --> 00:34:13,220
Don't touch me! I said don't touch me!

535
00:34:13,220 --> 00:34:17,380
- Eldest Brother doesn't look as cold and distant as before.
- Go away!

536
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:20,460
At least he's learned to be agitated.

537
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,340
The immortals are too gentle.

538
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:24,900
We won't force Youqin to do anything because we empathize with him.

539
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:29,120
Princess Qingkui is a human. She is outgoing and brash, smart and carefree.

540
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:32,800
She is exactly what your brother needs.

541
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:38,380
With her around, any effects and influence on the mind can be healed.

542
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,360
Starting today, if you ever come close to me, you will never get rid of the Iridescent Eyes.

543
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,600
But...

544
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,160
Let's go.

545
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,340
Come on.

546
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,280
Just you wait, Heartless Shaodian.

547
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,360
I've never seen anyone with a relationship like Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law's.

548
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,820
The healer is no match for the patient.

549
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:09,580
It might take a lot more to heal Eldest Brother.

550
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:12,840
It seems we must give them a push.

551
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,420
I was told there will be a rare meteor shower tomorrow.

552
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:18,300
Everyone is looking forward to it.

553
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,100
Are you saying...

554
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:25,500
The company of a lover, a date under the stars, that should make even the densest mind understand.

555
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,540
You're right.

556
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:31,680
It's said lovers who watch the meteor shower together will have eternal love.

557
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:35,920
That will work wonders for Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law.

558
00:35:36,860 --> 00:35:41,250
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

559
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,840
I know you don't like crowds. So I picked a quiet place for stargazing.

560
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,040
How do you like it?

561
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,660
Thank you, Celestial Mother.

562
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,880
I will let the servants to get things ready.

563
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,300
Never mind. I won't be here.

564
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,460
Are all of these meant for me alone?

565
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:09,120
Celestial Mother.

566
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:18,280
Celestial Mother. I brought sister-in-law here.

567
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,960
I wouldn't leave you here to sit in loneliness.

568
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,120
I asked Princess Qingkui to keep you company.

569
00:36:24,120 --> 00:36:26,720
Enjoy this beautiful night.

570
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,540
Celestial Mother. Aren't you going to join the other deities for stargazing?

571
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:34,020
I don't really mind joining the crowd.

572
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,120
I'm here for you.

573
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,100
You need not trouble yourself.

574
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,180
Don't worry, Your Majesty. I will serve His Highness well.

575
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,860
I won't bother you any longer.

576
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,340
Celestial Mother?

577
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,340
Stay away from me.

578
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,060
Is everything ready?

579
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,720
Don't worry. I got everything ready.

580
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:10,720
I haven't seen you in a while. I've missed you so much.

581
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,020
Have you been busy?

582
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:15,040
Not really. I just didn't want to see you.

583
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,080
What a loving couple.

584
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:21,480
When the mood is just right, I'll take out my Spirit Music Box.

585
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:24,700
That device will detect the atmosphere

586
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:28,420
and play the most wonderful tune in the world.

587
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:33,440
I'll cast a spell to make the petals

588
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:36,580
rain down on them.

589
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,320
We had rehearsals.

590
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:39,360
Nothing will go wrong.

591
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
A night of meteor shower.

592
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,680
A couple staring into each other's eyes.

593
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:47,340
Fine wine under the starry sky.

594
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:49,960
Such a romantic night.

595
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,760
If you don't want to see me, why don't you undo the Iridescent Eyes for me?

596
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,520
Then, I will avoid you whenever I see you.

597
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,820
Why do you want the Iridescent Eyes gone?

598
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:09,840
Why won't you undo it for me?

599
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,380
Old geezer! Read the mood before you play the music!

600
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,840
It's not my fault.

601
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,420
The Spirit Music Box detected the mood and played the tune.

602
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:37,220
You're no good.

603
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,940
Do it if you can.

604
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,120
Hold it.

605
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,580
What is the meaning of this?

606
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,600
I'll show you how it's done.

607
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:04,840
You made a mistake first!

608
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,720
Masters, what are you doing here?

609
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:12,300
You did all of that?

610
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:19,760
Stop right there.

611
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,460
This is clearly a set-up.

612
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:24,560
I don't want to be mocked. We'll talk elsewhere.

613
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:27,500
What are you doing?

614
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:36,200
Your Majesty. There were some errors with the plan.

615
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:39,820
But that Starry Way is the best stargazing spot.

616
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:43,420
Everything we do can only do so much help.

617
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:46,460
The rest is up to Youqin.

618
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,660
So... Your Highness.

619
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,000
Perhaps we could apologize to her.

620
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,360
Why?

621
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:11,780
I did nothing wrong.

622
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:12,980
Why beg her for help?

623
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,800
It's just mere poison.

624
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,620
I can cleanse myself of it.

625
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:42,120
Harder! Harder! Try harder!

626
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:52,440
You did it. Impressive, Your Highness.

627
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,540
It moved elsewhere.

628
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,740
Let's try again.

629
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,780
It didn't work.

630
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:21,900
Maybe it went to the lower parts.

631
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,940
Your Highness. Whatever happens, I will never abandon you.

632
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:04,940
Princess Yetan! Prince Chaofeng realized his mistake.

633
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:06,520
It was wrong to injure his brother.

634
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,900
He's reflected on his mistake.

635
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:11,420
Please don't be mad at him anymore.

636
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:16,820
Please have mercy and cure him of this poison.
