Youqin!

27
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,723
Sister?

28
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,000
<i>This place is Dongqiu.</i>

29
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,990
<i>The Ganoderma Vein.</i>

30
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:15,780
<i>The seal is done now and the four realms are born.</i>

31
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:22,720
<i>When Guixu has been purified, your duty shall end.</i>

32
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,250
This is the memory of the Twin Flower?

33
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:32,030
Eons ago, the Grand Empyrean planted the Ganoderma Vein in Dongqiu.

34
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,200
With Chaos as our bed soil, Qingkui and I were born.

35
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:53,520
The cycle of life is perpetual.

36
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,660
The Ganoderma Vein isn't the tree that forebodes the end of the world.

37
00:04:56,660 --> 00:05:03,020
Qingkui's and my duty isn't to absorb all purity and impurity before destroying all four realms.

38
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:07,300
We are supposed to keep Chaos at bay and purify Guixu.

39
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:23,640
Sister. You used your life to show me this edict from the Grand Empyrean.

40
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:33,223
Tan'er!

41
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:37,370
Guixu is about to collapse. Let's leave.

42
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:57,620
The Force of Chaos is getting unstable.

43
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,980
We cannot afford to let it break through.

44
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,613
Hang in there.

45
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,880
Look!

46
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,560
It's Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law!

47
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,560
Don't worry, Tan'er.

48
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,710
I will bring you to safety.

49
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,200
<i>I'm back.</i>

50
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,930
<i>You must be in pain.</i>

51
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:53,250
<i>Guixu has been resealed.</i>

52
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:56,983
<i>No one will be in pain anymore.</i>

53
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,830
Eldest Brother.

54
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,980
- Sir...
- Tan'er!

55
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:00,640
What are you doing?

56
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,470
The seal placed by the Grand Empyrean has been destroyed.

57
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:06,540
We can gather all the forces in the world, but none is strong enough to reseal Chaos.

58
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:10,930
For me and the four realms, you have done enough.

59
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:13,590
It's my turn now.

60
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:17,083
Sister-in-law!

61
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:23,390
When I was in there, I saw the edict left by the Grand Empyrean.

62
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,010
The Ganoderma Vein was a gift from him.

63
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,470
After I combine my flower spirit with Qingkui's, we can use the power of the Ganoderma Vein to the fullest.

64
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:36,730
We can then contain the Chaos and restore Guixu to its former self.

65
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:39,870
But you will die, Tan'er!

66
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:43,710
This is my duty as the Ganoderma Vein.

67
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:46,610
Maybe...

68
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:53,570
Heaven took pity on me and allowed me to encounter you.

69
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:59,440
To be able to love and be loved by you is the best thing that has happened to me.

70
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,650
Tan Tan, don't do anything stupid.

71
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,110
Sister-in-law, I don't want you to die. Sister-in-law!

72
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,560
Sister-in-law, come back.

73
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:09,460
I'm sure the immortals can come up with another solution.

74
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:12,510
Thank you.

75
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:18,210
Growing up, everyone has been hostile toward me.

76
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:21,610
And because of this resentment, I embraced my identity of being a demoness.

77
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,640
But all of you kept me company.

78
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,620
You bring warmth to my world.

79
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:31,620
I never understood why I should protect all beings.

80
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,090
What makes them so worthy of protection?

81
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,940
But now I see why.

82
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:45,540
I want to protect all beings because they are capable of loving.

83
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,070
Tan'er!

84
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,350
Kui'er!

85
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,260
- Sister-in-law!
- Kui'er!

86
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,093
Sister.

87
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,140
You died for me.

88
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:09,190
Now, it's my turn to repay the kindness.

89
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,190
Tan'er!

90
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,160
- Tan'er.
- Sister-in-law!

91
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,340
- Tan Tan!
- Tan'er.

92
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:56,620
- Sister-in-law!
- Tan'er.

93
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,110
Tan'er.

94
00:10:58,110 --> 00:11:01,000
Tan'er!

95
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,260
Tan'er! Tan'er! Tan'er!

96
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,793
Tan'er! Tan'er!

97
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,620
Youqin.

98
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:23,663
Tan'er?

99
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:51,990
Oh my.

100
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:54,500
Why are you crying?

101
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,600
Peace has returned.

102
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,210
You should be happy.

103
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,860
I'm sorry.

104
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,960
I failed to protect you. I failed to protect you.

105
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:12,520
You did well enough.

106
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,580
It's such a shame, you know.

107
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:28,500
How nice it would be if I were the Herb of Nine Lives.

108
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:34,890
That way, I will have several lives and will be able to spend my life with you.

109
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,710
The first 18 years of my life weren't amazing per se.

110
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,480
But I do not want to resent them.

111
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:53,110
Because those days allowed me to meet you.

112
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,780
Every single day spent with you

113
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,310
is the happiest,

114
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:02,960
the greatest day I have ever had.

115
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,570
It didn't last very long,

116
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:12,920
but it's enough to make all the suffering

117
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,840
worth it.

118
00:14:18,230 --> 00:14:21,140
Tan'er. Tan'er. Tan'er.

119
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,673
You...

120
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:25,150
I'll be fine.

121
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:28,910
I'm just leaving.

122
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:32,350
Immortals live such a long life.

123
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:36,630
Maybe I'll come find you in my next life.

124
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:43,410
I will wait for you forever.

125
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,690
Before you return,

126
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,123
I will not die or perish.

127
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,490
Tan'er. Tan'er. Tan'er.

128
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:05,640
The Rooftop Swallow Mansion.

129
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,590
When you gave it to me,

130
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:16,060
you said you hoped that I would be like the stars,

131
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:21,020
shining bright in the sky and having no fear on earth.

132
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,660
Can you see it now?

133
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:25,070
I did it.

134
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:27,820
If you miss me,

135
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,660
just look at it.

136
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,960
If it flickers,

137
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:37,310
it means I'm missing you.

138
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,480
I have to go now.

139
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,013
Tan'er!

140
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:54,290
Tan'er! Tan'er!

141
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:09,810
Tan'er! Tan'er!

142
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:21,870
<i>We thank you, Princess Yetan. We thank you, Princess Yetan.</i>

143
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,900
At ease now.

144
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:36,663
At ease, please.

145
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,660
Tan'er.

146
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,870
Ever since you were born,

147
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:11,870
you had to live with this unfair prejudice imposed against you.

148
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:15,580
You were hurt by everyone else.

149
00:17:15,580 --> 00:17:20,870
But now, you repaid our wrongdoings with kindness.

150
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,920
You used your generosity and compassion

151
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:27,820
to rebuke the vile things thrown at you.

152
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:31,820
You are a good child of mine.

153
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,770
I...

154
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:41,150
am immensely proud of you.

155
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:55,630
We were right about Yetan.

156
00:17:55,630 --> 00:17:57,463
Indeed.

157
00:17:57,463 --> 00:18:01,780
Regardless of the difficulty, she faced it with grace and calmness.

158
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,870
She is courageous and wise.

159
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,440
But alas, she is gone.

160
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,940
No one will play Sparrow Mahjong with us anymore.

161
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:21,150
Feng'er. You still have your injuries.

162
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,060
Instead of resting, you came to study here.

163
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:26,910
Are you still searching for a way to revive the flower spirits?

164
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:30,340
This here says that wood spirits will regrow when the spring breeze blows.

165
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:33,300
Perhaps it applies to the Ganoderma Vein too?

166
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:36,300
Mother, do you need anything?

167
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:42,090
Immortal Xuanshang was gravely wounded by the Force of Chaos and he also lost Yetan.

168
00:18:42,090 --> 00:18:44,580
I wonder how he is doing now.

169
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,260
Perhaps you can pay him a visit in the Heavenly Realm?

170
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:50,230
It can also take your mind off things.

171
00:18:50,230 --> 00:18:54,440
He is strong enough to bounce back from those injuries.

172
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,670
Do not worry about him, Mother.

173
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,420
The loss of his loved one, however,

174
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,020
will be torturous.

175
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,910
Visiting him will only add to his woes.

176
00:19:04,910 --> 00:19:07,160
We should give him some time.

177
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,570
You brat. Feeling better now?

178
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,090
You're out now?

179
00:19:17,090 --> 00:19:20,340
How is the meal in the Cave of Haunted Souls?

180
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:24,170
I came for two things.

181
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,000
One.

182
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,040
About our royal father, I have done a lot of thinking.

183
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:32,780
We were at fault and it cost Kui'er her life.

184
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:36,620
That Twin Flowers sacrificed their lives for us.

185
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:38,950
They have saved countless lives.

186
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:41,050
We have to thank them.

187
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,470
And two.

188
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,670
Your sorry state here...pissed me off. What are you doing?

189
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:52,240
If Kui'er sees you like this from high above, will she be happy?

190
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,340
Don't pretend you know Kui'er very well.

191
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,230
I want you to get back on your feet.

192
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:59,680
Initially, when I heard about the death of Kui'er

193
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,810
and the assassination of royal father, I was grieving too.

194
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,300
But I survived.

195
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:12,240
However, if you keep dwelling in your misery, your mother and Kui'er would not be happy either.

196
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,100
As the mighty men of the Void Realm, we shouldn't let the women worry about us.

197
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,780
Come on.

198
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,910
What for?

199
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:25,190
Just cry it all out on my chest.

200
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:28,550
Once you're done, I want you to move on and live your life.

201
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:30,100
Go away.

202
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,510
What? I'm the eldest brother.

203
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:34,060
I'm trying to care for you.

204
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,493
Come on.

205
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,030
Don't come near me. Otherwise, I'll hit you.

206
00:20:40,030 --> 00:20:42,540
Now you hit like a man.

207
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:45,230
Keep it up. Don't sulk.

208
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:48,040
I will soon accede to the throne.

209
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:51,230
I'll need your help.

210
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,933
Come with me.

211
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:08,820
You brat. Don't dally. Come.

212
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:10,140
- Stop hugging me!
- You little brat.

213
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,090
You have grown so tall!

214
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,523
Let's go.

215
00:21:56,330 --> 00:21:58,430
Greetings, Celestial Mother.

216
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,483
Celestial Mother.

217
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,540
You don't need to come from the Xia clan to visit me.

218
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,270
Youqin. You look worse than last time.

219
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:13,380
Jade Deity, did the injury reach his organs?

220
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:18,370
Your Majesty, Empyrean Xuanshang has the Perfect Celestial Body, so his organs were not wounded.

221
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:21,950
I'm afraid the problem comes from his psyche.

222
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:26,420
Please rest well and do not dwell in misery.

223
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,090
The Perfect Celestial Body didn't protect me.

224
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:31,123
Tan'er did.

225
00:22:31,123 --> 00:22:36,380
In the most crucial moment, she pushed me out of the barrier and saved me by sacrificing herself.

226
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:38,830
She also saved the four realms.

227
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,810
My fellow masters, the Ganoderma Vein is a gift left by the Grand Empyrean.

228
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:49,140
Did the ancient scrolls mention a way to revive it?

229
00:22:52,430 --> 00:22:56,970
The ancient scrolls hardly contain any information about the Ganoderma Vein,

230
00:22:56,970 --> 00:23:00,570
let alone its revival.

231
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:06,403
Youqin.

232
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:24,230
- Celestial Father.
- Celestial Father.

233
00:23:26,770 --> 00:23:28,970
I have heard the news.

234
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,440
I failed you,

235
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,760
your mother,

236
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:42,370
and the world.

237
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:46,020
The four realms were in a crisis.

238
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:49,540
Yetan and you are now separated.

239
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:54,410
All of them are because of me.

240
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:57,620
When the disaster broke out in Guixu,

241
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:04,790
as the Heavenly Emperor, I should be on the front line to lead everyone.

242
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:07,410
But I was too comfortable with my power and position,

243
00:24:08,650 --> 00:24:11,520
so I asked you to shoulder my duty.

244
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,750
Yetan and you are in love,

245
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:19,010
but because of my narrow-mindedness, the sisters died.

246
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:25,980
Even dying a thousand times isn't enough to atone for my sins.

247
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,673
Youqin.

248
00:24:29,673 --> 00:24:30,990
Celestial Father.

249
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,723
No.

250
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,850
Princess Yetan saved the world.

251
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:46,430
She's nothing but admirable.

252
00:24:46,430 --> 00:24:52,150
Looking back, what I did was shameful.

253
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:57,610
I shouldn't be the Heavenly Emperor anymore.

254
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:06,610
Since three deities are here, can you be the witnesses?

255
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:13,180
Recently, I notice that Qingheng has been handling the immortal affairs.

256
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:16,630
Everyone thinks highly of him.

257
00:25:16,630 --> 00:25:19,010
I want him

258
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,500
to accede to the throne.

259
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,470
What do you think?

260
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:29,803
Celestial Father.

261
00:25:29,803 --> 00:25:32,363
I agree.

262
00:25:32,363 --> 00:25:36,390
Qingheng has what it takes.

263
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:39,963
Qingheng. Be a wise ruler.

264
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:44,810
Under Youqin's guidance, do not repeat my mistake.

265
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,073
Qingheng?

266
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,653
Qingheng?

267
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:07,063
I will not let you down.

268
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,133
At ease.

269
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:35,720
I do not ask for your forgiveness.

270
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:43,350
But I might have a way to revive the Ganoderma Vein.

271
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,173
What is it?

272
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,240
He has a solution?

273
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,490
I heard that for the flora spirits, the more thriving they are, the stronger they are.

274
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,730
I believe we can rebuild Dongqiu.

275
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:04,270
All immortals can descend there to plant flowers and impart them with mystic power.

276
00:27:04,270 --> 00:27:09,740
On one hand, this can make up for what we did to Dongqiu.

277
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:14,470
On the other hand, perhaps with the assistance from all the flora spirits in Dongqiu,

278
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,730
the Ganoderma Vein might regrow.

279
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,990
Okay.

280
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:25,860
I will head to Dongqiu now and arrange for its reconstruction.

281
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,430
Feichi, Hanmo.

282
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,470
Stay here to help Qingheng.

283
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,780
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

284
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,270
But, Youqin, you're still wounded.

285
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:34,410
You can go there once you are healed.

286
00:27:34,410 --> 00:27:36,743
Celestial Mother, I can't wait anymore.

287
00:27:36,743 --> 00:27:39,270
Your Majesty, just let him go.

288
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,550
It will only do him good if he thinks he is doing it for Yetan.

289
00:27:43,550 --> 00:27:47,820
We three will look after him, so he will be fine.

290
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,260
Celestial Mother. I want to join eldest brother too.

291
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,903
Haichao!

292
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:48,980
Yes, Your Highness?

293
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:52,230
The new Heavenly Emperor is rebuilding Dongqiu

294
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:55,380
so that all flora spirits can help the Ganoderma Vein regrow.

295
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,270
- For real?
- Yes.

296
00:28:57,270 --> 00:28:59,770
That's amazing, Your Highness.

297
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:03,380
I will be over the moon if the two princesses can be revived.

298
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:06,430
Pack up now. I will relocate to Dongqiu.

299
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:08,440
From now on, I'm a citizen of Dongqiu.

300
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,190
- Okay.
- Calm down, Your Highness.

301
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,910
The flora spirits are timid.

302
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,130
You will just scare everyone there.

303
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:15,290
What? No.

304
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:18,580
Regardless if they can revive Kui'er or not, they are my saviors.

305
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:20,000
I will treat them kindly.

306
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,630
Wasn't Old Fifth some kind of Guardian of Guixu?

307
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:25,970
I can be the Guardian of Flowers.

308
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,710
Guardian of Flowers...

309
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:29,860
Pack up now!

310
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:33,250
Right away. Come on. Let's pack up.

311
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:50,100
Thanks to the help from all immortals, Dongqiu was rebuilt this quickly.

312
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,670
Indeed. The growth of a plant requires four seasons.

313
00:29:53,670 --> 00:29:57,650
Qingheng has always been the one in charge of the seasons.

314
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:01,300
Now that he will be the Heavenly Emperor soon,

315
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:05,950
I wonder who will take over.

316
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,850
I can do it.

317
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:14,070
I have stayed in the Heavenly Realm for millennia and seeing these two old faces all the time is getting dull.

318
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,950
Many things still need to be done for the reconstruction of Dongqiu.

319
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,380
It'll keep me busy.

320
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,340
I quite like that.

321
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:23,190
Besides, I manage the Jade Pool too.

322
00:30:23,190 --> 00:30:26,710
My presence itself can already impart wisdom to the flora spirits.

323
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:33,160
My sojourn here might help the Twin Flowers to regrow sooner.

324
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,440
Brilliant idea.

325
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,480
I count on you, Master.

326
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:40,950
I shall concoct potent pills that will infuse the plants with wisdom and send it here.

327
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:42,620
Just my contribution.

328
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:48,250
I will assist the other two deities to manage Dongqiu too.

329
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:51,230
Thank you, Masters.

330
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:57,990
I'm sure my daughters will be very grateful to you.

331
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:03,230
On behalf of all mortals, I hereby declare that we will give you our full support.

332
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,750
Tan Tan is a good friend of mine too.

333
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,380
You can count the Beast Realm in!

334
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:13,100
May all flora spirits awaken Princess Qingkui and Yetan soon

335
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,370
so that they can return to the Mortal Realm.

336
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:23,230
From now on, I will live in Dongqiu until their resurrection.

337
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,510
Me too.

338
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:29,820
I will also live in Dongqiu until they return.

339
00:31:31,370 --> 00:31:33,820
No one knows when they will return.

340
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,920
Are you willing to wait forever?

341
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:40,900
My dear father-in-law, no matter how many years it takes, I will keep on waiting.

342
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:45,583
Father-in-law, I am sure I will live to see that day.

343
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,113
Okay.

That's right. If the two princesses come back, I shall reward you three.

When the princesses were here, she kept us entertained.

Actually, it's very fun.

399
00:35:15,410 --> 00:35:16,830

400
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:18,463
Shut up.

401
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:28,790
What if Kui'er grows in this spot? She'll be blocked by you.

402
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:30,210
I will not move.

403
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:32,511
I will stay very close so that when Tan'er comes back, she sees me right away.

404
00:35:32,511 --> 00:35:35,600
You should shower, by the way. I can smell your stinky feet from here.

405
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:36,910
That's right. Go away then.

406
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,870
What if I miss the moment when Kui'er is reborn?

407
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:43,620
Tan'er. Regrow already.

408
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,430
I have been putting up with him for more than a year now.

409
00:35:45,430 --> 00:35:47,850
- If I have to spend any more time with him, I'll...
- Fall in love with me?

410
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,620
Fall in love with you? I'll smite you.

411
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:51,060
I want to smack you just as well too.

412
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:52,893
Go ahead.

413
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:55,610
Look! The flower of impurity!

414
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,260
Childish.

415
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,430
The Twin Flowers is here!

416
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,370
Master, why are you using his trick too?

417
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,410
They came back for real.

418
00:36:03,410 --> 00:36:05,143
Tan'er!

419
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,593
Tan'er.

420
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:11,910
They are regrowing.

421
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,220
Heaven is merciful!

422
00:36:18,910 --> 00:36:20,310
Tan'er.

423
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:22,043
Kui'er.

424
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:40,573
Tan'er, is that you?

425
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,673
Kui'er.

426
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:02,470
It's you.

427
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:06,360
I have waited so long.

428
00:37:06,360 --> 00:37:07,950
I knew it.

429
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:10,180
You're so kind.

430
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:12,260
Heaven will not take you away from this world.

431
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,893
Kui'er.

432
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,350
What is going on?

433
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,423
Tan'er.

434
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,330
Tan'er. What is going on, Master?

435
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:41,470
Your Highnesses, calm down.

436
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:45,850
- Do you remember that the Twin Flower can absorb purity and impurity?
- Yes.

437
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:49,160
After the Twin Flower is reborn, its pistils remain closed.

438
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:53,090
They need to be nourished by purity and impurity concentrate to bloom.

439
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:55,740
What is purity and impurity concentrate then?

440
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,000
Your blood!

441
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,540
Use the blood of purity to nourish the flower spirit of Qingkui.

442
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,910
And use the blood of impurity to nourish the flower spirit of Yetan.

443
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:12,680
Once the Twin Flowers blooms, it can absorb nutrients from purity and impurity on its own.
