I really, really do!

As long as you're willing, I will take care of you with all my heart.

I will protect you with my life and never let you suffer.

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,860
I will respect you, adore you, and be obedient to you.

I... I swear.

27
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,660
First Prince, I am afraid I have to reject you.

28
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,520
It is because...

29
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,380
my heart already belongs to someone else.

30
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:57,520
First Prince, you are brave and heroic.

31
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,760
I am sure many women admire you.

32
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,000
I am merely a mortal. How can I be worthy of your attention and affection?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,660
Your Highness,

34
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,000
please take your leave.

35
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,100
Her Highness has been busy all day.

36
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,620
It is time for her to return to the palace to have some rest.

37
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:23,020
Princess Yetan.

38
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:37,980
It is the first time I express my love to you, but you prefer Chaofeng over me.

39
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,600
I blame myself for not being able to beat Chaofeng in battle and skillfulness.

40
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:56,420
Just you wait.

41
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,460
I will go to the border to defend it and fight the enemies.

42
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:04,860
After I have done great deeds and built my reputation, I will return.

43
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:07,540
I want to see if you will reject me again!

44
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,140
First Prince values his reputation above all else.

45
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,060
Was I too harsh just now?

46
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,740
Will he do something rash?

47
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:32,180
He'll be all right. Wu Dai is a boor.

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:35,560
So you must be stern for him to give up.

49
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,340
But...

50
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,540
we're finally out of trouble.

51
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:45,160
We can live a peaceful life from now on.

52
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,200
I can never find peace when you're around.

53
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,400
Why don't you leave too?

54
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,740
I'm not going anywhere. I want to stay by your side.

55
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,000
I'll do anything you ask, whether it's grinding herbs or serving tea.

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,020

Something inside the palace has been stolen!

60
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,220
What? Did you say something inside the palace has been stolen?

61
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

62
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:22,400
Something inside the palace has been stolen last night!

63
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,080
As the palace guards, were you shirking from responsibilities?
<i>[Lingxuan Hall]</i>

64
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,600
Some of you eunuchs are usually untrustworthy.

65
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,200
I'm starting to suspect that you were involved in this.

66
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,540
Don't just stand there!

67
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,960
Go and find them!

68
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,160
If you can't find them, say goodbye to your heads!

69
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:54,620
- Hey, you're taking too much. It should be enough.
- Five liang? Just five liang?

70
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,800
Give me some more.

71
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,940
Changxing Palace lost one Rainbow Dragon Box.

72
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,620
<i>Zhihan Palace lost one Cloisonné Enamel incense burner,</i>

73
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,260
a pair of Taotie Jade Wine Pots...

74
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:17,500
Enough.

75
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,440
Does anyone have a clue about this?

76
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,040
Please calm down, Your Majesty.

77
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,780
This matter is really strange when you think about it.

78
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:25,320
There are many palaces and halls in the inner palace, and the terrain is complicated.

79
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,880
<i>But this thief can come and go easily.</i>

80
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:30,520
<i>Wherever they go, the locks show no signs of being picked.</i>

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,100
<i>The thief seems to be familiar with the palace.</i>

82
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,080
<i>I previously thought it was an insider thief.</i>

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,000
After several investigations, we didn't find anyone suspicious.

84
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,940
So we concluded that it was done by an outsider who's familiar with the palace.

85
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:47,600
To think a few outsiders could freely come and go in the imperial palace!

86
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,680
How can we face the world if this gets out?

87
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,320
Deliver my decree.

88
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:55,160
From today on, we'll station elite soldiers to guard and ambush all the palace gates and roads.

89
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,660
We must capture those thieves!

90
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:58,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

91
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:06,525
<i>[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

92
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,440
The palace is strangely quiet today.

93
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:13,200
Did they find out we've been stealing and setting up an ambush for us?

94
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,360
Do you think so?

95
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,720
You look exhausted from stealing these days. That's why you're absent-minded.

96
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,240
Perhaps.

97
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,140
These few days, His Highness and I have been taking turns accompanying you.

98
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:24,040
- We are worn out. Can you still manage?
- I guess.

99
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,800
Today we will carry out our final theft.

100
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:29,060
Then we can finally pay the compensation to the villagers.

101
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:31,460
- Come on.
- Okay.

102
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,560
We've finally caught you!

103
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,020
Put down the treasures!

104
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,600
Run!

105
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,800
- Stop right there!
- After them!

106
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,420
- I'll fly you out of here.
- They'll recognize you.

107
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,720
Lure them away!

108
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,520
- Stop right there!
- Stop!
- Stay where you are!

109
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:06,160
- After them!
- Stop!
-After them!

110
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
- Hold it right there!
- Stop running!
- Stand still!

111
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,480
- Stop!
- Stay still!

112
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,620
- Don't run!
- You can't escape!

113
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,980
Over there!

114
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,500
Over here!

115
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,160
Don't come any closer!

116
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,560
Don't move!

117
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,440
Sir.

118
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:01,000
I'll be back.

119
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:06,920
What happened?

120
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,600
Sir. Since the defeat of the Guixu battle,

121
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,240
we put aside all secret reports outside the boundary for the sake of self-cultivation.

122
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,780
We only resume it yesterday.

123
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,660
Our spies from the Mortal and Beast Realm reported

124
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,620
that some immortals were behaving secretively at the human-beast border.

125
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:23,400
They seem to be plotting something.

126
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,720
Shaodian Youqin?

127
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
We don't have news of him yet.

128
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,700
At present, we only know the whereabouts of Immortal Qingheng and Princess Yetan.

129
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,980
Sir, this Princess Yetan always stirs up trouble.

130
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,940
But this time, she was not being conspicuous.

131
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:41,440
It seems that she doesn't want others to know her whereabouts.

132
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,740
This matter involves the secret of the Heavenly Realm.

133
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,980
I suggest you go and investigate this in person.

134
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,240
What's the matter?

135
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,740
Did something happen?

136
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,940
Nothing.

137
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:57,600
I just need to take care of some trivial things outside the realm.

138
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,280
So I won't be able to keep you company.

139
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,540
It's all right. Matters of the Void Patrol Battalion are more important.

140
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:14,775
Sir, the Empress and Second Prince are watching us closely.

141
00:10:14,775 --> 00:10:18,675
If you set out to the Mortal Realm so openly, I'm afraid it'll attract their attention.

142
00:10:19,355 --> 00:10:21,135
Since the establishment of Void Crown Princess's clinic,

143
00:10:21,135 --> 00:10:24,515
our veiled strife with Void Empress has turned into an open one.

144
00:10:25,615 --> 00:10:28,595
Dingyun is keeping watch on the Void Patrol Battalion.

145
00:10:28,595 --> 00:10:30,495
They can tail us if they want.

146
00:10:30,495 --> 00:10:34,440
It depends on their luck whether they can keep up.

147
00:10:37,255 --> 00:10:39,175
The whole battalion moved out.

148
00:10:39,635 --> 00:10:43,395
What is Chaofeng planning to do?

149
00:10:43,395 --> 00:10:44,935
All right.

150
00:10:59,115 --> 00:11:00,615
It was a trap.

151
00:11:00,615 --> 00:11:01,935
Zhu Duanshan!

152
00:11:03,155 --> 00:11:04,695
Yes, Your Highness.

153
00:11:04,695 --> 00:11:06,030
Are you here just to be a bystander?

154
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:07,370
Rest assured, Your Highness.

155
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:12,315
Even if I have to turn the four realms upside down, I'll definitely find Chaofeng and his battalion.

156
00:11:12,315 --> 00:11:17,135
You? Turn the four realms upside down?

157
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:21,755
I led the Zhulong Tribe to seek your refuge

158
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:31,595
so I can seek revenge for my brother, Zhu Jiuyin, on Chaofeng.

159
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,200
Did you save me?

160
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,740
I thought you didn't believe me.

161
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,780
Why did you save me?

162
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,380
Why... did you help me... compensate them?

163
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,760
How did you know?

164
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,160
You followed me.

165
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,180
That's why you could save me.

166
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,900
Thank you. If it weren't for you, I would be dead.

167
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:33,240
You stole the money. Give it back!

168
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,040
I didn't steal. I only took my...

169
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:41,120
It's hard for me to explain it to you. Next time, I'll explain it to you.

170
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,040
Besides, how can I save you if I don't take this money?

171
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:48,820
Why does a demon hunter... want to help a fire demon?

172
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,360
I already know you're not a fire demon.

173
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,960
Look, you saved my life and you even smiled foolishly at the children from the village.

174
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,540
There's no kind-hearted fire demon.

175
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,580
Last time, it was really a misunderstanding.

176
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,060
Or else, why would I use my money to help you pay the compensation?

177
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:07,760
If you still don't believe me, you can just kill me.

178
00:13:19,555 --> 00:13:21,855
<i>I finally had the chance to get close to him.</i>

179
00:13:21,855 --> 00:13:23,815
<i>I must not let him get away.</i>

180
00:13:24,715 --> 00:13:25,775
Don't go!

181
00:13:25,775 --> 00:13:27,815
I'm starving.

182
00:13:27,815 --> 00:13:29,895
Can you lend me some fire?

183
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:47,580
Come here. Try my cooking. It's really delicious.

184
00:14:02,115 --> 00:14:05,395
Before this, I lost my temper with you.

185
00:14:05,395 --> 00:14:07,515
I'm sorry.

186
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,315
I... don't know how to control the fire and my temper.

187
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:13,735
What a coincidence. I have a bad temper too.

188
00:14:13,735 --> 00:14:15,915
So we better don't disdain each other.

189
00:14:18,735 --> 00:14:23,415
It's been so long... since someone is kind to me.

190
00:14:23,415 --> 00:14:24,715
You eat.

191
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:26,095
You know what?

192
00:14:26,095 --> 00:14:28,215
For the past few days, I've been running about.

193
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:29,495
It was so exhausting.

194
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:33,255
I didn't even have a proper meal. I'm so hungry.

195
00:14:33,255 --> 00:14:36,915
You make people hate you. No, I mean...

196
00:14:36,915 --> 00:14:39,715
You said you understood me.

197
00:14:39,715 --> 00:14:41,415
How?

198
00:14:48,735 --> 00:14:52,655
When I was a child, people around me disliked me too.

199
00:14:52,655 --> 00:14:54,495
They disdained me.

200
00:14:57,155 --> 00:14:59,595
They even wanted to kill me.

201
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:04,735
I just take it as my lucky tattoo.

202
00:15:05,795 --> 00:15:09,435
I know how this feels.

203
00:15:09,435 --> 00:15:14,535
Since young, only one person was kind to me.

204
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:17,015
But she never experienced all these.

205
00:15:17,015 --> 00:15:19,495
So how would she know?

206
00:15:22,155 --> 00:15:23,775
Thank you.

207
00:15:24,315 --> 00:15:27,195
But... I rather you do not know.

208
00:15:27,195 --> 00:15:28,815
It's all right.

209
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:33,775
Since the beginning of times, people have hated fire demons.

210
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:35,455
I'm used to it.

211
00:15:35,455 --> 00:15:37,755
How can anyone get used to such a thing?

212
00:15:37,755 --> 00:15:40,475
We just pretend that we don't care.

213
00:15:42,295 --> 00:15:44,535
Have you ever thought of leaving this place?

214
00:15:45,235 --> 00:15:47,395
That's because you don't know the outside world.

215
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,875
Come with me. I'll save you from this suffering.

216
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,835
No. I must stay.

217
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,795
I hope they don't hate me.

218
00:15:54,795 --> 00:15:58,515
That's impossible. You don't know what humans are like.

219
00:15:58,515 --> 00:16:01,215
You do? Help me.

220
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:08,355
We have to expel the fire within you before they can get close to the real you.

221
00:16:08,355 --> 00:16:13,215
You once said an idea. An idea, right?

222
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,595
I have an idea. Follow me.

223
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:28,240
Come on.

224
00:16:49,795 --> 00:16:52,315
This is the Holy Fabric that's impervious to water and fire.

225
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:53,895
A treasure from the Heavenly Realm.

226
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,415
After you wear this, it'll keep the fire contained inside.

227
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:59,235
Then the villagers will no longer think you're a fire demon.

228
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:06,475
It works.

229
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:08,655
Treasure. Give it to me.

230
00:17:08,655 --> 00:17:10,995
You were the reason this item was obtained in the first place.

231
00:17:10,995 --> 00:17:15,575
You can say it has been returned to its owner after helping you solve your problems.

232
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,875
Obtained it for me?

233
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,715
You'll find out in the future.

234
00:17:21,715 --> 00:17:23,975
I like these clothes.

235
00:17:23,975 --> 00:17:27,355
You... You're very kind.

236
00:17:27,355 --> 00:17:31,175
It's the first time I've heard you say that after knowing you for a long time.

237
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,895
Know for a long time?

238
00:17:34,795 --> 00:17:36,355
I need to do something about your messy look.

239
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,835
Come here.

240
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:44,039
♫ <i>Love and affection accompanies the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

241
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,219
♫ <i>In full bloom,</i> ♫

242
00:17:47,219 --> 00:17:50,579
♫ <i>you and I agreed that eternity is only a flash</i> ♫

243
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:55,979
♫ <i>The moment the flower and fire blossomed in splendor</i> ♫

244
00:17:55,979 --> 00:17:57,919
♫ <i>It all turned into sweetness</i> ♫

245
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:02,839
♫ <i>I am you, and you are me</i> ♫

246

♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

247
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,599
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

248

251
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:25,920
<i>A person as pure and lovely as him could have experienced all the pleasures in this world.</i>

252
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,660
<i>Yet, he insisted on making his life difficult.</i>

253
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,200
<i>Perhaps he doesn't know the vastness of the world.</i>

254
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,080
<i>Why don't I show him around?</i>

255
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,540
<i>Let's see how likable he can be.</i>

256
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:39,239
♫ <i>The passion, between you and I will never be forgotten</i> ♫

257
00:18:39,239 --> 00:18:41,595
Let me see.

258
00:18:41,595 --> 00:18:43,195
See? You look so much better.

259
00:18:43,195 --> 00:18:44,935
♫ <i>The silhouette of our embrace</i> ♫

260
00:18:44,935 --> 00:18:46,675
I'll take you somewhere.

261
00:18:46,675 --> 00:18:51,859
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

262
00:18:56,175 --> 00:19:00,415
Your Highness, many people seek medical help since the clinic was set up.

263
00:19:00,415 --> 00:19:02,275
You must get some rest.

264
00:19:02,275 --> 00:19:06,115
If you fall ill, His Highness will not spare me.

265
00:19:06,115 --> 00:19:09,575
It wasn't easy for voidwalkers to put aside their prejudice to come and seek treatment from me.

266
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,515
I'm happy to do this.

267
00:19:13,235 --> 00:19:16,275
But these patients from Void Patrol Battalion should have come for a return visit.

268
00:19:16,275 --> 00:19:18,535
But why didn't they come?

269
00:19:18,535 --> 00:19:21,175
Oh, them? I think they won't be able to come for the time being.

270
00:19:21,175 --> 00:19:23,855
His Highness led the whole battalion out. I think they were—

271
00:19:23,855 --> 00:19:25,975
The whole battalion was mobilized?

272
00:19:26,775 --> 00:19:29,895
What exactly happened?

273
00:19:29,895 --> 00:19:33,515
Well, I'm not so sure either.

274
00:19:33,515 --> 00:19:38,295
I think they said something about some immortals at the human-beast border.

275
00:19:38,295 --> 00:19:40,295
The immortals?

276
00:19:41,935 --> 00:19:43,855
It involves the immortals?

277
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:47,975
I supposed so.

278
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:52,175
Since the defeat in Guixu, the Void has been brooding over it.

279
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:54,255
Don't tell me Chaofeng's trip to the Mortal Realm this time

280
00:19:54,255 --> 00:19:56,815
is another attempt to start a war at the human-beast border.

281
00:19:56,815 --> 00:20:00,015
Su Shui, go to the Void Patrol Battalion and retrieve the secret reports.

282
00:20:00,015 --> 00:20:01,535
We can't do that.

283
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:05,055
Before the Third Prince left, didn't he tell you to follow my orders?

284
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:08,595
Since I want you to retrieve the secret reports, I'll naturally bear the responsibility if anything goes wrong.

285
00:20:08,595 --> 00:20:11,515
If you refuse to go, I'll go and see Consort Xue.

286
00:20:11,515 --> 00:20:15,055
Please don't. Consort Xue doesn't like it when His Highness fights for power.

287
00:20:15,055 --> 00:20:19,295
If she finds out about this, the whole battalion would be doomed.

288
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:23,215
I...

289
00:20:23,215 --> 00:20:25,035
I'll go and retrieve the secret reports then.

290
00:20:25,035 --> 00:20:26,815
Go now.

291
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,075
[Secret]

292
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,475
Empyrean Consort?

293
00:20:43,475 --> 00:20:45,235
Tan'er.

294
00:20:45,235 --> 00:20:46,515
It's Tan'er.

295
00:20:46,515 --> 00:20:50,315
Su Shui, pack up my belongings. I'm going to find Tan'er.

296
00:20:55,075 --> 00:20:58,480
<i>[Jufu Inn]</i>

297
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,820
<i>Come back often, all right?</i>

298
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:23,095
Sir.

299
00:21:23,095 --> 00:21:24,715
Come in.

300
00:21:27,515 --> 00:21:28,415
So?

301
00:21:28,415 --> 00:21:31,255
The Second Prince is using the power of the Zhulong Tribe to pursue us relentlessly.

302
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:34,975
We were caught up with them in the Beast Realm for a long time before we managed to escape.

303
00:21:39,575 --> 00:21:41,115
Zhulong Tribe?

304
00:21:41,115 --> 00:21:44,095
It seems the Second Prince is desperate to deal with us this time.

305
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:47,315
Just you wait and see. They will come knocking on our door within three days.

306
00:21:47,315 --> 00:21:48,435
I can't be bothered anymore.

307
00:21:48,435 --> 00:21:51,875
We've spent too much time trying to lose Dingyun's pursuit.

308
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,975
What have you found about Yetan?

309
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:57,715
I've found out that Princess Yetan sneaked into the palace of the human race late at night to steal.

310
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,700
Then she took the stolen money to a human race village called Yuewo Village

311
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,000
and distributed it among the local villagers.

312
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,500
She robbed her family to help the poor.

313
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,700
This isn't something Yetan would do.

314
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:12,500
I've brought one of the villagers who received the money here.

315
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:17,400
He said Princess Yetan was paying compensation for a fire demon.

316
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,800
Fire demon?

317
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,300
This fire demon...

318
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,400
Sir. The villager we captured drew a portrait of the fire demon.

319
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:40,600
Why does he look so familiar?

320
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,800
Shaodian Youqin?

321
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,600
Steamed Buns for sale!

322
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Hot Steaming Buns for sale!

323
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,100
Come and take a look!

324
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,400
Come on.

325
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,900
Don't be scared.

326
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:08,500
The Holy Fabric you're wearing has contained the mystic fire. You won't burn anyone.

327
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:11,200
Why did you bring me here?

328
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,000
You stay in that small stone hut every day. There's nothing fun to do there.

329
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm showing you the world.

330
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,600
So you can learn how to get along with other people.

331
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,200
Let's go.

332
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
Come on.

333
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,600
Follow me.

334
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,700
What do you think?

335
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,500
Don't be scared.

336
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,800
I'm sorry, Young Master.

337
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Are you all right?

338
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,000
Come on.

339
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,700
Just come.

340
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:53,300
Young Master, don't leave.

341
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,000
Hello, Young Master, Miss.

342
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,200
We have sachets, scented pouches, and trinkets for sale.

343
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,600
Pick the one you like.

344
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,800
<i>Here you go.</i>

345
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,500
<i>This grasshopper is for you.</i>

346
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:13,200
<i>Help!</i>

347
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,000
Young Master, is this the one you want?

348
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:22,800
Don't be scared.

349
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,800
You're wearing the Holy Fabric. You won't burn anyone.

350
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:27,900
Try and take it.

351
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,500
Just take a look and pick what you want.

352
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,500
- Try it. Touch it.
- Nothing happened.

353
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,800
All right. Since you like it, I'll take it down for you.

354
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:44,200
All right.

355
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,700
- Nothing happened, right?
- Yes.

356
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
How much is it?

357
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,760
One wen.

358
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,730
- Here's one wen.
- Thank you, Miss.

359
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:51,800
- Nothing happened.
- Take care, Young Master, Miss.

360
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,100
- Wait for me!
- Come again!

361
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,300
Young Master, how about a kite?

362
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,000
Look how pretty this is.

363
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
- Do you like it?
- Buy one.

364
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,600
It's a tiger.

365
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,900
Come. Try this.

366
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,400
I like it.

367
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,600
It doesn't look good on you.

368
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,900
I didn't know a soul-shard can be quite fussy about cleanliness.

369
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,600
No, you gave me these clothes.

370
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
I must not let it get dirty.

371
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,100
Fire!

372
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,900
They're playing with fire.

373
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,500
But why are they fine?

374
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,100
Silly. Those are street performers showcasing their skills.

375
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,200
Let's go check it out.

376
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,000
Awesome!

377
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:48,000
One more time!

378
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:48,800
Do another one!

379
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,600
Incredible!

380
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,900
Tell you what.

381
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,900
Not only did no one drive them away when they set fire, but there are also people rewarding them.

382
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,700
Fire. I can do it too.

383
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,500
One more!

384
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,800
Come on.

385
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:46,000
The fire demon is here!

386
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,400
It's here!

387
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:50,200
Villagers! The fire demon is here!

388
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,400
It's here! It's really here!

389
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,600
Go get him!

390
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,300
Hurry! Bring any weapons you can find!

391
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,900
Hurry!

392
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,650
Don't be scared. You're not a fire demon anymore.

393
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:04,000
<i>He's coming over!</i>

394
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,900
Everyone, listen to me. He's no longer a fire demon.

395
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,700
- I'm not going to believe that!
- No way!

396
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:11,000
He's a fire demon!

397
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,300
The mystic fire on him had been expelled.

398
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,800
You don't have to worry about being burned anymore.

399
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,915
And he also brought you gifts.

400
00:27:18,915 --> 00:27:21,000
<i>That's impossible.</i>

401
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,100
<i>I won't believe it anyway.</i>

402
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,800
<i>How is that possible?</i>

403
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,800
<i>Who's going to believe that?</i>

404
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,000
<i>Leave now. Don't come any closer!</i>

405
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,600
<i>Stay back!</i>

406
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,400
<i>If you come any closer, we'll beat you up!</i>

407
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,300
<i>I dare you to come!</i>

408
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,000
We'll beat you to death!

409
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,100
Stay away from us!

410
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,800
- Get lost!
- Don't come near us!

411
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,700
It's all right.

412
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Child, don't touch him.

413
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,200
Come back here!

414
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,900
Hey, do you want to die?

415
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:02,800
Don't go!

416
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,200
Come back here!

417
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,600
<i>Don't go!</i>

418
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,100
Stop!

419
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Can I have one, Brother?

420
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:17,300
Here you go.

421
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,500
Don't take it!

422
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,900
Smile.

423
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,500
- Get out of here!
- Get lost!

424
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,000
- Leave!
- Go away!

425
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Get out of our village!

426
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,500
- Beat him to death!
- Go away!

427
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,200
Leave now!

428
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,500
- Beat him to death!
- Get lost! You fire demon!

429
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,700
Beat him!

430
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:49,400
- Go away!
- Stop harming people!

431
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,100
You, fire demon!

432
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,500
Go!

433
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,200
He wants to get along with all of you!

434
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,500
How could you treat him this way?

435
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:03,500
I endured all of you so you can accept him, not let all of you trample on him and humiliate him!

436
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,600
Quiet! You and the fire demon are in cahoots!

437
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,600
<i>Get out!</i>

438
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,800
<i>- Get lost!
- Leave!</i>

439
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,200
<i>Leave Yuewo Village!</i>

440
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,100
Beat him!

441
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:14,100
Stop it!

442
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,200
I won't let you hurt her!

443
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,700
Kill the fire demon!

444
00:29:21,700 --> 00:29:23,800
Kill him!

445
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,300
Run for your lives!

446
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,700
Does it hurt?

447
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,300
No.

448
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:04,500
You gave me these new clothes.

449
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,200
It's dirty now.

450
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,800
It's all right.

451
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,600
These rude commoners...

452
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,800
I'll make them pay.

453
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,700
People always believe anything easily.

454
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:20,400
A bad reputation is like maggots clinging to bones, which can never be restored.

455
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,600
I've experienced it for 18 years.

456
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,400
No one understands your feelings better than I do.

457
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,300
I was a fool.

458
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,500
It's easier to extinguish a fire than hate.

459
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:37,300
Once you're a fire demon, you carry the bad name for life.

460
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:41,900
If you were born with a bad omen, people will always loathe you.

461
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,100
Fiery.

462
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,000
There is countless beautiful scenery in this world.

463
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:50,700
I will take you to experience all the delicious and interesting things I mentioned.

464
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,900
What do you think?

465
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,200
Let's leave Yuewo Village together.

466
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,400
Come with me.

467
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,800
I cannot leave.

468
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,300
They will never change the way they see you.

469
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:11,300
I didn't go through all that trouble to find you just to see you being humiliated and oppressed.

470
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,800
You must come with me!

471
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,500
No!

472
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,000
Don't tell me you still feel hopeful of those unruly commoners.

473
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,100
They don't dare to kill you today.

474
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,800
Tomorrow, they will find someone to kill you.

475
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,700
Besides, look at the life you're living now.

476
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:25,400
You have nothing but bare walls. You don't even have any decent furniture.

477
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,900
Why are you so reluctant to leave this place?

478
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,400
No. I said I'm not leaving.

479
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,600
I'm not leaving!

480
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,800
You...

481
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,500
Why are you angry at me when I suggested it for your sake?

482
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,500
I'll leave if you don't open the door.

483
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,400
Open this door now!

484
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,300
Is she angry?

485
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,200
It's all my fault.

486
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,100
<i>He wants to get along with all of you!</i>

487
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,700
<i>How could you treat him this way?</i>

488
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:40,300
<i>I endured all of you so you would accept him, not let all of you trample on him and humiliate him!</i>

489
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,100
<i>I've experienced it for 18 years.</i>

490
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:46,300
<i>No one understands your feelings better than I do.</i>

491
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,300
<i>Fiery.</i>

492
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:11,100
I don't want to lose you.

493
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:12,900
I don't want to.

494
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,600
Your Highness. Recently, there has been a female thief appeared in the imperial city.

495
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,900
The palace is heavily guarded. I couldn't get any information.

496
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,600
But I asked the people in the city.

497
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,300
They said they didn't see Princess Yetan return.

498
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:30,700
I thought Tan'er would go home since she was here even if she doesn't get along with imperial father.

499
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:35,500
Your Highness, you see. Princess Yetan didn't come home and the Mortal and Beast Realms are vast.

500
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:38,200
How can we find her with only the two of us?

501
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,900
Why don't we return to the Void?

502
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,200
Wait.

503
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
What did you say just now?

504
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,400
There was a female thief in the imperial city?

505
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,600
But please rest assured. Emperor Tun is safe and sound.

506
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,100
That female thief was only stealing some treasures.

507
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,700
That's not what I'm worrying about.

508
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,300
Su Shui, go and ask around about it.

509
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,000
A girl who dares to steal from the palace.

510
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:01,000
Only Tan'er would do something like this.

511
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,600
How is that impossible?

512
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,200
It's her family's treasure. She didn't have to steal them.

513
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,800
I can't explain it now. Just go and find out.

514
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:14,300
With my current identity, I can't let the guards see me. So I can only count on you.

515
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,400
Go now. Hurry.

516
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,800
All right.

517
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,100
Tan'er?

518
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,300
He saved you?

519
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:36,300
You had a fallout with him instead of using such a great opportunity?

520
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,900
Everything went smoothly at first.

521
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:39,600
He lost his temper out of a sudden.

522
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,200
How did you provoke him?

523
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,400
Me? Provoke him?

524
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,200
I didn't even have the chance to treat him well even if I wanted to.

525
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,200
I just told him to leave Yuewo Village.

526
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:49,100
There will be people who treat him well. But he ended up being mad at me.

527
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,900
Tell me. Why does he take me for granted after what I did for him

528
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:54,800
but feel reluctant to leave the villagers who are always giving him a hard time?

529
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
I don't know what is wrong with his head.

530
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,800
Since you know he's stubborn, why don't we take it slowly?

531
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,900
Take it slowly?

532
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,400
Is it because Iridescent Eyes are not planted in your body? Am I right?

533
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,900
It sure is easy for you to say.

534
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:09,800
The news of Heartless Shaodian's death won't stay a secret forever.

535
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:13,800
If the voidwalkers find out about this, not only our mission to gather the soul shards will fail,

536
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,800
but we may also not be able to escape from them.

537
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,700
Sister?

538
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
Eat slowly. There are still more.

539
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,000
Sister Qingkui, you're very thoughtful.

540
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:56,800
Tan Tan and I have been running about for the past few days,

541
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,800
I haven't even had a taste of meat.

542
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,000
Tan'er, eat up.

543
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,400
Why did the voidwalkers come to the Mortal Realm?

544
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:06,900
Are they using you to find my whereabouts?

545
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,500
Rest assured. That's not going to happen.

546
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,000
I snuck out from the Void. No one knows about it.

547
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:15,900
What's more, the person who came to investigate is the Void Third Prince.

548
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,600
He's an upright and trustworthy person.

549
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,800
He would never do such a thing.

550
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:20,800
Trustworthy?

551
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,400
He also took part in the battle in Guixu.

552
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:24,800
The voidwalkers have always been despicable and cunning.

553
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,100
You must not trust them easily.

554
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:30,200
I thought you revered the voidwalkers since childhood.

555
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
When did you start thinking badly of them?

556
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:37,975
But it's indeed shameful that the voidwalkers started the battle in Guixu.

557
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:40,500
But the Third Prince was there under orders.

558
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,400
He is definitely not a bloodthirsty killer.

559
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,200
You don't know what he did.

560
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,500
From the day we switched places,

561
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:50,600
I would have been dead for a long time if the Third Prince didn't intercede for me.

562
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:53,700
Don't tell me you fell in love with the devil?

563
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,800
- I...
- I'm warning you.

564
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:59,600
A villain will always be a villain, no matter how much he cares for you.

565
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:04,000
If they find out about Shaodian Youqin, it's possible they will develop the desire to kill him.

566
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,100
What happened to Empyrean Xuanshang?

567
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,200
Have you seen a petite lady with a hood standing here just now?

568
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,100
No.

569
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,800
She was here. Please try to recall.

570
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,800
I didn't notice. I've been busy with my business.

571
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,100
Please try to recall. She was just here.

572
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,400
Isn't that Su Shui?

573
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,800
What is she doing here?

574
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,200
Shui'er!

575
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,600
Come here!

576
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,800
What happened?

577
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,200
Her Highness found out Empyrean Yetan is in the Mortal Realm.

578
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,300
So she made me bring her here to find Yetan.

579
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:37,800
I only went asking for information for a while.

580
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:40,200
Then... Her Highness is nowhere to be found.

581
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,200
What?

582
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,200
What did you say?

583
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:44,800
Why didn't you watch her properly?

584
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:49,000
Order the Void Patrol Battalion to search the entire city and find Kui'er.

585
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:50,700
Yes, Sir.

586
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:56,000
For the past year, the Void didn't dare to do anything reckless because they were wary

587
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:00,400
of Empyrean Xuanshang's unfathomable cultivation after returning from Guixu safely.

588
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:02,315
Unexpectedly, it turned out Empyrean Xuanshang exhausted all his powers

589
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,000
to put on a show for the four realms to see.

590
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,400
Empyrean Xuanshang's foresight and strategic planning are truly admirable.

591
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,100
It took us one year only to find one soul shard.

592
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:12,900
It would be even harder if Chaofeng finds out.

593
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,100
Tan'er, search the soul shards without worry.

594
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,300
Chaofeng doesn't know about the soul shards yet.

595
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,900
Leave the voidwalkers to me.

596
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,600
I'll do my best to cover for you.

597
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,500
Don't tell me you still want to go back there.

598
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,400
Since we switched places, I've been wanting to go and rescue you.

599
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,700
I just couldn't wait to rush to the Void.

600
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:29,100
I'm taking you with me no matter what.

601
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,800
Tan'er. Guess what?

602
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:36,000
I've never looked down on myself whether it was when I first entered the Void and was criticized by others,

603
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
or when I set up a clinic and was loved by people.

604
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:42,900
Because I know my sister, Tan'er, always thinks about me.

605
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:52,200
As long as we feel the same for each other, we can always overcome any difficulties.

606
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,500
What's more, I now have the Third Prince to protect me.

607
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,600
The Void Army?

608
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:10,200
It's Chaofeng. Tan'er, go now. Remember this.

609
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,000
As long as Empyrean Xuanshang returns to the world, the voidwalkers wouldn't do anything reckless.

610
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,000
- Go now.
- Hurry!

611
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,100
- Sister.
- Go now.

612
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
- Protect yourself.
- You too.

613
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:22,700
Kui'er!

614
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,800
Kui'er.

615
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,300
Kui'er, are you all right?

616
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,100
I'm all right. I just saw some snacks that I haven't seen for a long time. So I got a little hungry.

617
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,600
I'm sorry for making you worry.

618
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Your Highness, did you eat all of that yourself?

619
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:42,600
I was hungry.

620
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:45,300
Your Highness, you gave me a fright.

621
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,000
Next time, don't wander off again.

622
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,400
All right.

623
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,400
Su Shui told me you came to the human-beast border to gather information about the enemy.

624
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,600
I've been away from the Mortal Realm for a long time, and I've missed it.

625
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,500
So I came.

626
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:58,000
You won't blame me, right?

627
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,700
Of course not.

628
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,200
Have you found anything in your investigation?

629
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,200
We haven't found anything yet.

630
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,400
It's all right. You can take your time.

631
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,800
<i>[Jufu Inn]</i>

632
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,300
There were dozens of trays at the steamed baozi shop just now.

633
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:27,000
<i>She must have met her sister today.</i>

634
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,600
But why didn't she tell us?

635
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,400
Why do you think she didn't tell us?

636
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,600
That's right.

637
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:34,400
Her Highness clearly came here after reading the secret report.

638
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:37,700
Now she said she came because she missed the Mortal Realm...

639
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:39,400
Shui'er, you had the nerve to bring that up.

640
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:42,400
How could you show Void Patrol Battalion's secret report to Her Highness?

641
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,400
I'm sorry.

642
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,700
Enough.

643
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:49,200
Even I can't defy Kui'er's order, let alone her.

644
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,200
That's right.

645
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,700
But Kui'er is acting out of the ordinary.

646
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:55,600
It must be related to Shaodian Youqin.

647
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:59,400
By the way, how did Shaodian Youqin end up as a fire demon?

648
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,900
Could it be he has gone mad after restoring the seal in Guixu?

649
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:06,000
Princess Qingkui is afraid that we'll find out that he has gone mad.

650
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,800
That's why she...

651
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,000
Sir, I suggest we go to investigate it as soon as possible.

652
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,500
If this is true, you can kill Shaodian Youqin and be the Crown Prince.

653
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,000
<i>If this is true, the voidwalkers and the immortals will go to war after I kill Shaodian Youqin.</i>

654
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:36,600
<i>Even if I could protect Kui'er's life at that time, I wouldn't be able to keep her heart.</i>

655
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,300
Everyone, are you done eating?

656
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,800
If you're done, it's time to set out.

657
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:42,600
- All right.
- Let's go.

658
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,800
You've worked hard, my fellow soldiers.

659
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:47,800
I specially brewed some medicinal wine to reward your hard work.

660
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,500
<i>But we still have official business to attend to.</i>

661
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,800
You've worked so hard.

662
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:54,600
No need to rush in investigating the immortals.

663
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,800
My wine can strengthen the body and bones.

664
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,000
Strengthen the body and bones?

665
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,100
If combined with my unique acupuncture technique,

666
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,400
It can be of great benefit to your cultivation and progress.

667
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:08,000
Then we'll kindly accept the offer.

668
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,200
- Great. Take this.
- Thank you.

669
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Everyone! Grab your bowls.

670
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,200
Get a bowl.

671
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,100
- Pour some for me.
- Here.

672
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:19,300
No rush, everyone will get to drink.

673
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,000
It feels so nice.

674
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,100
Pour me some more.

675
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,600
- I'll have another bowl.
- Drink some more.

676
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:26,100
Anyone else?

677
00:42:26,100 --> 00:42:27,000
It's my turn.

678
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,800
- My turn!
- You then.

679
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,100
Make sure she stays here.

680
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,800
Both of us will investigate the fire demon.

681
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,400
Yes, Sir.

682
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,000
Drink more.

683
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,400
How do you feel now?

684
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,900
I feel so much better after the acupuncture.

685
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,500
Sir.

686
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,000
Sir.
