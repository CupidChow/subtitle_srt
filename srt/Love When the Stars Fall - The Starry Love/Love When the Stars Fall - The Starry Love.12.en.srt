No one in this world is stupider than you.

160
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,880
Heartless Shaodian.

161
00:12:57,880 --> 00:13:00,920
Heartless Shaodian. Look at me.

162
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,200
Talk to me. Heartless Shaodian.

163
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,120
Don't you die on me. You hear me? Heartless Shaodian.

164
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,840
Hang in there. We're almost there.

165
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,180
Hang in there, Heartless Shaodian.

166
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,180
Heartless Shaodian.

167
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,060
His immortal soul has disappeared.

168
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,080
I'm afraid it's too late.

169
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,180
- Eldest Brother.
- Youqin.

170
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,820
Eldest Brother...

171
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,980
Youqin.

172
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,720
Youqin.

173
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,480
I won the battle, Eldest Brother.

174
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,540
I can protect the immortals with you now.

175
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:19,140
Eldest Brother. Eldest Brother!

176
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:22,000
Youqin devoted his life to our safety.

177
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:27,460
His contribution is on par with that of a Grand Empyrean.

178
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,800
I am so proud of him.

179
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,960
Youqin.

180
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,100
Come forth.

181
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,380
Yes, Your Majesty.

182
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:46,520
Erect... a statue for Youqin in Yingming Temple

183
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,840
so that all generations can pay respect to him.

184
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,120
Noted.

185
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,160
Youqin.

186
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,740
Nihong.

187
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,440
My condolences.

188
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,080
Qingheng, Ziwu.

189
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,820
Yes, Celestial Father.

190
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,360
Withdraw to your chamber with your mother.

191
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,900
Don't let her witness the departure of Youqin's body.

192
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,860
Celestial Mother...

193
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,880
Youqin...

194
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:04,700
♫ <i>If only I wander to the lighthouse of destiny with you</i> ♫

195
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,720
Heartless Shao...

196
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,860
♫ <i>We will be each other's object of yearning</i> ♫

197
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,080
Empyrean Xuanshang.

198
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,080
I'm afraid... this is the final goodbye for us.

199
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:20,019
♫ <i>As we look back, this bond has taken root in the depths of our eyes</i> ♫

200
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,880
Farewell.

201
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,740
♫ <i>No matter how far it is, we'll get there</i> ♫

202
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:29,400
<i>If there is a second life, I hope you'll be free from your duty.</i>

203
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:33,840
<i>You can have fun, slack off,</i>

204
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,840
<i>and live a happy life.</i>

205
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,099
♫ <i>If I do shed tears,</i> ♫

206
00:17:43,099 --> 00:17:49,439

♫ <i>In this flawless world</i> ♫

213
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,380
I miscalculated.

214
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,560
I didn't expect Shaodian Youqin to survive from Guixu.

215
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,940
Don't blame yourself, Royal Father.

216
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:42,020
Once we reassemble the rest of our army, we still can fight the immortals.

217
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:48,820
As long as Shaodian Youqin still lives, we cannot rule the four realms.

218
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,660
Listen to me now, you three.

219
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,540
Stop your pointless infighting.

220
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:58,960
Whoever kills Shaodian Youqin will be the Void Crown Prince.

221
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:02,220
- Noted.
- Noted.

222
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,440
Feng'er, you did well in this battle.

223
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,080
I now grant you the right to reassemble our army.

224
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,780
Do your best.

225
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:12,400
Don't let me down like your two brothers.

226
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,300
Duly noted, Royal Father.

227
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,660
Royal Father, I have something to say.

228
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,020
If he hadn't just stood there and done nothing on the battlefield because of his cowardice,

229
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,880
I would have killed Qingheng already.

230
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,500
Chaofeng sabotaged my operation.

231
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,600
Punish him now.

232
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,920
We already lost the battle.

233
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,560
- There's no use bringing this up now.
- But he—

234
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,280
Silence!

235
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,300
You failed to kill him so you began pointing fingers at your brother.

236
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,080
If Chaofeng didn't come in time to save you,

237
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,200
the heads of you two would be hanging on the Heavenly Southern Gate now.

238
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,920
You two imbeciles.

239
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,460
Go and serve your punishment in the Cave of Haunted Souls.

240
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,840
The Cave of Haunted Souls?

241
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,980
- Noted.
- Go!

242
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:49,680
Yes, Royal Father.

243
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:59,080
<i>Oh, no. Princess Qingkui...</i>

244
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,720
<i>The Void Realm has always been a dangerous place.</i>

245
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,760
<i>But you made it bearable.</i>

246
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:24,760
<i>I know you don't plan to stay in the Void Realm.</i>

247
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,240
<i>And I know you are supposed to be the Empyrean Consort.</i>

248
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:28,600
<i>But I am in love with you.</i>

249
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,360
Your Highness.

250
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,420
- What's the matter?
- Go now, Your Highness.

251
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,420
What happened?

252
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:46,680
First Prince and Second Prince have to serve their punishment here.

253
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:48,760
They'll be here soon.

254
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,440
- Come with me.
- What happened?

255
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,300
Oh, no.

256
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,760
An ambush in Guixu and the Void Army lost?

257
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:12,900
Yes.

258
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:17,420
It's only been one day and so many life-changing events have transpired.

259
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,900
Is the Third Prince injured?

260
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,020
Time is running out, Your Highness.

261
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,480
It will be terrible if they see you here.

262
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,770
Come with me.

263
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,740
Sir, you can't take this path.

264
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,300
Take another path.

265
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,260
Come.

266
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,740
- Your Highness.
- Open the gate.

267
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,220
Do it now.

268
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,580
Your Highnesses.

269
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,060
Third Prince.

270
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,440
Why are you here?

271
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:06,020
To mock us?

272
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:09,040
I don't want you two to suffer so I came to ask them to be gentler with you.

273
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,460
Save your crocodile tears.

274
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:14,220
Come inside, Eldest Brother, Second Brother. Come.

275
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,700
Here.

276
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,020
Why is there a zither here?

277
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:31,060
Welcome, Your Highness.

278
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,180
You look stupid.

279
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,700
Oh, my.

280
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:40,600
Is this the Cave of Haunted Souls?

281
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,240
Why is there human food here?

282
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,780
Here's the thing.

283
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:53,420
I heard two princes are coming so I quickly prepared a reception.

284
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:58,280
There's a new human chef in Wangliang City so I asked him to cook something for you.

285
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,160
- Really?
- Yes.

286
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:03,960
Why is there only one bowl here?

287
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,340
I...

288
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,120
No need to glare at me. I'll eat first.

289
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,080
- Come. Bring another bowl and a pair of chopsticks.
- Okay.

290
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,560
Sit, Second Brother.

291
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,000
Sit.

292
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,840
Tan Tan.

293
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,600
You're finally back.

294
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:00,940
What happened?

295
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,340
Guixu has been resealed?

296
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:07,300
And Empyrean Xuanshang died.

297
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:16,240
Shaodian Youqin... died for his duty.

298
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,320
This is his destiny.

299
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,780
My condolences.

300
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,960
But he didn't remove the Iridescent Eyes from her.

301
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,360
What?

302
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,220
He didn't...

303
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:30,460
I know you didn't want to bring this up when he was dying.

304
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,380
But...

305
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,620
I don't know how to talk about him.

306
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:36,140
He thought about everything before he left,

307
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,760
but he just had to forget about the Iridescent Eyes.

308
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:43,080
Now that his immortal soul is gone, who knows what we can do to remove it.

309
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,360
Don't worry. I'm here.

310
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
I can remove all sorts of artifacts.

311
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,360
Stop being sad now.

312
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:58,980
I should hate self-righteous preachers like him, right?

313
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,920
He used to torture me, but now that he's gone, I should be...

314
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,820
But when I saw him fight the enemies in Guixu despite his heavy injuries,

315
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,000
<i>my heart ached so much for him.</i>

316
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:20,640
When he disappeared just now, I felt so devastated.

317
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,040
Perhaps...

318
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:28,240
he was no longer just an Empyrean in your heart.

319
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,560
Your Highness!

320
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,300
Your Highness, please head to Ninth Heaven Hall.

321
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:43,500
I'm not in the mood.

322
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:47,480
Her Majesty and Prince Qingheng were requesting His Majesty to collect the immortal soul to revive His Highness.

323
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,300
But His Majesty kept rejecting that.

324
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,900
<i>Revive him?</i>

325
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,980
Yes.

326
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:56,640
Records in the Shangshu Academy state that as long as the remaining immortal soul is preserved,

327
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,660
immortals can be resurrected even if their body turns to dust.

328
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:24,040
Where did they go?

329
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,640
Who's there?

330
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,980
Give chase!

331
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,440
Youqin's immortal soul has all disappeared.

332
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
You can't revive him.

333
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,300
Youqin discarded his emotion and trained for a millennium.

334
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,320
In the Land of Mystery, thousands of his emotions lie dormant. If...

335
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,660
If what?

336
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,360
The Land of Mystery is constructed by Youqin's mind.

337
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,140
It is collapsing as we speak.

338
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:52,740
No one can enter it... to retrieve his emotions.

339
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:55,540
With your permission, Celestial Father,

340
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:58,260
I am willing to take the risk and retrieve Youqin's emotions.

341
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:01,180
I know you care about your brother,

342
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,640
but do you know you're the only prince we have here in the Heavenly Realm?

343
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:10,800
If you lose your life in the Land of Mystery, the immortals will not have a future emperor.

344
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:12,320
Celestial Father.

345
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,620
Let me do it.

346
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:15,960
Utter nonsense!

347
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,860
The immortal soul in the Land of Mystery

348
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:22,580
originated from the emotions Youqin discarded in his training.

349
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:25,840
They are violence, greed, or even lust.

350
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:32,640
If you use them to revive Youqin, we aren't bringing him back.

351
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,650
We are creating... a monster instead.

352
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:42,040
So this plan will not work.

353
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,560
Eldest Brother was a virtuous and generous soul.

354
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,680
I'm sure his immortal soul does not harbor any malice.

355
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,700
I believe in Eldest Brother, too.

356
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:53,660
Once we bring back Youqin, if his ill intent manifests itself, I will discipline him.

357
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,500
You need not worry about this, Your Majesty.

358
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,420
Youqin has the Perfect Celestial Body. He is powerful.

359
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,740
If he is enticed by his dark desires and wreaks havoc in this world,

360
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,620
who can stop him among the four realms?

361
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,620
When there was an anomaly in Guixu, you told him to sacrifice his life for it.

362
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:18,080
Now that peace has returned, you said he's a threat and refused to revive him.

363
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,260
He worked dutifully so that you can sit on your throne comfortably.

364
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,520
He sacrificed himself for the pride of the immortals.

365
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:28,620
He tossed himself into the Guixu for the four realms, as you claimed. But what did you do?

366
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:31,660
What did you do for your son, for all beings?

367
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:32,780
Insolence!

368
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,280
I toil very hard for the four realms.

369
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:37,220
I don't need to answer to a mere mortal.

370
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:40,860
I thought you regarded him as your son.

371
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:47,260
But now I know all you want is a pawn to secure your position.

372
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,700
Not a son.

373
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,860
This is bad.

374
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,700
Fine. You won't save him. I will.

375
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:02,960
Sister-in-law. I will go, too.

376
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,480
Sister-in-law.

377
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,870
You dare to defy me?

378
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,640
Your Majesty,

379
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,140
Qingkui and Qingheng let emotions get the better of them.

380
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:17,300
Please spare them.

381
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,500
Your Majesty, Empyrean Xuanshang has passed away.

382
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:21,240
The immortals have lost a powerful man.

383
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:24,740
Qingheng is the only one who can continue the immortal's imperial bloodline.

384
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,680
Please think twice, Your Majesty.

385
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,240
<i>Please think twice, Your Majesty.</i>

386
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,260
I...

387
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,240
Sister-in-law.

388
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,320
I hereby declare

389
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:50,840
that Qingkui and Qingheng will be confined to their respective abode

390
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,720
and will not venture out unless summoned.

391
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,600
No immortals... should revive Youqin.

392
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:02,120
Violators will be sent to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice to receive Heavenly Strikes.

393
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,220
Noted.

394
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,960
You are a stubborn fool. An obstinate ruler.

395
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,740
- Heartless Shaodian shouldn't have served you.
- Let's go, Your Highness.

396
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,760
You stubborn fool.

397
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,400
Fool!

398
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,000
Stop it.

399
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,860
I knew what to do.

400
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:25,520
I sent the princess away before First Prince and Second Prince arrived.

401
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,400
Well done.

402
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:43,000
You...

403
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,940
You returned.

404
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,580
I did.

405
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,780
Your Highness!

406
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:01,600
Hooray! We survived this.

407
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,080
Wait. Hush.

408
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,460
What's wrong with you?

409
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,460
Stop yelling.

410
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,160
- Nothing.
- They...

411
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,720
- Let them be.
- Oh, a shooting star.

412
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,980
The enforcer told me the battle in Guixu was fierce.

413
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,120
I'm so glad you came out unscathed.

414
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:23,040
The Voidwalkers have no right to start this battle at all. But I had to obey my royal father's order.

415
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:29,060
I put you in the Cave of Haunted Souls because I didn't want any harm to come to you when I was gone.

416
00:31:29,060 --> 00:31:33,840
And besides, I didn't want to involve you in this battle.

417
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,160
I know what you are doing.

418
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,340
It's just that I can't help but be worried when I think about it.

419
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:41,680
I embody the alliance between immortals and mortals.

420
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:46,100
If you hurt the Heavenly Emperor and the Empyrean, I will have failed miserably in my job.

421
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,740
But if you are hurt, I won't...

422
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,820
You won't what?

423
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,440
I...

424
00:31:57,420 --> 00:32:00,280
In Guixu, I saw Yetan, too.

425
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,900
She did not fear my father and went to the Heavenly Emperor's rescue.

426
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:09,180
It seems like no matter where you are, you two always act with your heart.

427
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,900
How is Tan'er doing?

428
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:13,480
Don't worry. She is safe.

429
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:18,040
She even insulted royal father to make him furious.

430
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,900
She has always been dauntless.

431
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:24,200
As her older sister, I should learn that from her.

432
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:28,040
Just let the men handle these things.

433
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:33,740
I promised you that I would give you a happy life.

434
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:12,440
They always talk about morals and justice, but at the moment that matters, they behave like a bunch of ingrates.

435
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,280
You shouldn't let emotions get the better of you.

436
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,760
If we could sneak into the Land of Mystery to retrieve His Highness's emotions,

437
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:19,280
Shaodian Youqin would be out and about by now.

438
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,380
I didn't know that Heavenly Emperor would treat his son like that.

439
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:22,700
The Land of Mystery is collapsing.

440
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,500
If we don't go there now, Heartless Shaodian will be done for.

441
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,380
If our Prince of Beast Realm is here...

442
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,900
Wait. Where is he?

443
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,840
That's not our Prince of Beast Realm at all.

444
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,120
It's the Howling Celestial Dog.

445
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,860
The Heavenly Realm regards you as important.

446
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:49,760
First, they put up the barrier. Now, they have the Erlang Deity do the rounds.

447
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:56,960
Everyone here does the Heavenly Emperor's bidding.

448
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,280
What are you doing?

449
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:24,880
Stop.

450
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:27,780
Why is he doing the rounds within the barrier?

451
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:30,060
And he has gone several laps.

452
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:32,480
Is he here to free you?

453
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,840
Thanks, Erlang Deity.

454
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,340
When I come back, I'll treat you to a hotpot.

455
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:13,880
Go.

456
00:35:16,180 --> 00:35:18,400
- Let's go.
- Okay.

457
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,880
Stupid dog.

458
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,320
Luckily, we weren't discovered.

459
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,300
What a brave and kind princess.

460
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:29,380
She'll risk her life for His Highness.

461
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,360
I'm sure she can find his emotions in the Land of Mystery to revive His Highness.

462
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,440
Come.

463
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,220
Stupid bird. After many years at my side, you still haven't learned the art of sneaking out?

464
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:50,040
Sorry.

465
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,820
Let's deliver it quickly.

466
00:36:12,620 --> 00:36:14,820
Let's take that path.

467
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:20,160
Oh, no. Someone saw us.

468
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,620
- Forget it. Let's go.
- Go.

469
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,820
Come.

470
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:25,300
How did you use that spell?

471
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,400
I practiced very hard for it.

472
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,680
Run.

473
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,040
Let's go.

474
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,560
- Go...
- Let's go?

475
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,940
I don't think they can see us.

476
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,960
Be quiet.

477
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,680
- Just focus.
- Yes.

478
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:01,580
Let's speak over there.

479
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,600
Thanks.

480
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,880
Thanks.

481
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:14,960
Thank you.

482
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:16,760
Thank you.

483
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,500
Let's go.

484
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:27,080
Erlang Deity didn't let me down. He released you.

485
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:32,680
What's the Land of Mystery like now?

486
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,440
It's collapsing.

487
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:37,620
In the Heavenly Realm, only you can enter it with your Iridescent Eyes.

488
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:40,560
However, you only have half an hour to do so.

489
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,360
If you can't come out by then...

490
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,600
This is too dangerous.

491
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,740
I don't have time for all that.

492
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,060
I am very grateful for your sacrifice, Your Highness.

493
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,620
Please take care inside.

494
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,120
Heartless Shaodian.

495
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,920
Wait for me, Heartless Shaodian.

496
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,260
Don't go.

497
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,260
Don't go.

498
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:07,920
Heartless Shaodian, wait for me.

499
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:24,580
Don't go.

500
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,980
Heartless Shaodian.

501
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,700
Heartless Shaodian, don't go.

502
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,780
Don't go.

503
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,760
Stay.

504
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,840
Stay!

505
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,200
His emotions!

506
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,220
Be gentle, I said! Gentle!

507
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:07,660
Useless trash. Move!

508
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,120
Those imbeciles in the Cave of Haunted Souls.

509
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:18,020
And that stupid enforcer.

510
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,160
He said he prepared a reception for me

511
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,280
but when it was time to administer my punishment,

512
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,980
he... hit hard.

513
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,440
You should have done better as well.

514
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:30,840
The Heavenly Southern Gate had no elite soldiers or generals.

515
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,080
And you couldn't even deal with Qingheng.

516
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,500
You gave Chaofeng an opening.

517
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:39,400
What did I tell you before the expedition? Did you forget it already?

518
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,080
No, I didn't.

519
00:40:41,080 --> 00:40:42,480
It's Chaofeng's fault.

520
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,700
I... I asked

521
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,940
Chaofeng to stand guard by the Heavenly Southern Gate

522
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:49,400
and watch us as we invade the Heavenly Realm.

523
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:52,140
Curse that Wu Dai.

524
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:56,580
That brute only knew how to charge ahead and he walked into Shaodian Youqin's trap.

525
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:58,860
That's why we...

526
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:01,680
That's how they managed to head to Guixu.

527
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,300
Watching by the side before taking an action.

528
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,000
This Chaofeng is more cunning than we thought.

529
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,280
He just pulled off a feat, and he's going to become more powerful.

530
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,180
In the future...

531
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:17,900
you have to be wary of him.

532
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,160
Don't let him find another opening.

533
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,280
Chaofeng...

534
00:41:30,857 --> 00:41:34,400
<i>[Land of Nature]</i>

535
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,600
This is great!

536
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,260
We did find Empyrean Xuanshang's soul shards.

537
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:47,400
They fell from the Land of Mystery.

538
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:50,900
It seems like you retrieved three soul shards from the Land of Mystery.

539
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:53,180
How can we locate those three shards?

540
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,160
Well... I do not know.

541
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,460
It is hard to pinpoint where the shards will go.

542
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:01,780
So I have no idea where they are.

543
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:05,120
Fellow Masters, do you know, perhaps, how we can attract these shards?

544
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,560
Detached from Shaodian Youqin, these three shards will not contain his memory.

545
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,840
I suppose they have transformed into humans in the four realms.

546
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:15,300
Finding them is akin to finding a needle in a haystack.

547
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,680
I'm afraid we don't have a solution here.

548
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,920
So... So how are we supposed to find his soul shards and revive him, then?

549
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,160
Calm down. There might be a way.

550
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,600
I just checked the Ancient Scrolls.

551
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,840
They say that to combine shards into an immortal soul, you have to resonate with each of the shards.

552
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,700
However, this method is heavily reliant on one's fate.

553
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:40,060
Your Highness, you are chosen as His Highness's soul mate by the Marriage Bridge.

554
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,140
If you can make all three shards fall in love with you,

555
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:47,180
you will open up the possibility of his resurrection.

556
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,300
Marriage Bridge?

557
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,540
Yes.

558
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:52,300
The Marriage Bridge is a sacred artifact capable of identifying your soul mate within the four realms.

559
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,800
It never misses.

560
00:42:53,800 --> 00:42:59,760
Besides, we all bear witness to the undying love between you two.

561
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,280
If you can't combine those soul shards, no one can.

562
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:11,760
So I need to make three soul shards fall in love with me to revive him?

563
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:14,200
<i>- That's right</i>
- How is that right?

564
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:15,840
Who do you think our princess is?

565
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,160
She may be a bit unreasonable at times,

566
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,220
But dating three men at the same time?

567
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:22,020
She will never do that.

568
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:23,240
I will do it.

569
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,260
Are you out of your mind?
