I want the best beef in the Beast Realm.

As if I'd let you marry Tan'er.

68

I wouldn't allow it either.

What kind of bride are you?

70
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,920
You put on the wedding gown but not the veil.

And now you're cuddling the groom.

72

- That is unorthodox.
- Exactly.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,760
The veil is to keep the bride from feeling embarrassed.

74
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,160
I don't feel embarrassed.

75

Pay respect to Heaven and Earth, your parents, and your brother-in-law.

These are the things you must do.

Shut it.

81
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,100
I'm not paying respect to them.

00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:49,320
I want to spend some time with my sister-in-law and eldest brother.

162
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:54,440
I used to think of weddings as mere ceremonies.

163
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,220
But now that I witnessed their wedding today,

164
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:04,240
I realized how nice it is to be in love and spend the rest of your life with your loved one.

165
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,060
If you are willing,

166
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:16,980
we can have a life together.

167
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,100
Because... you're always so clumsy. And...

168
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,680
What?

169
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,960
No.

170
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,840
I mean...

171
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:27,440
You're innocent.

172
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,360
It's innocence.

173
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,600
I want to take care of you.

174
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:36,140
I don't mind being by your side as A'Cai did.

175
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:41,620
I thought you hated to be A'Cai.

176
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,480
As long as you like it.

177
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,340
Actually,

178
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:53,720
I want to stay here not just for my sister-in-law and eldest brother.

179
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,260
I want to...

180
00:10:58,020 --> 00:11:00,300
stay here with you.

181
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,100
You mean it?

182
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,740
Yes.

183
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,160
I was never a drinker!

184
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,020
So stop drinking.

185
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,760
All right. That's enough.

186
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,480
Tan Tan has her Empyrean Xuanshang.

187
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,700
His Highness has Princess Ziwu.

188
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,780
Sister Qingkui has Prince Chaofeng by her side.

189
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,640
They are all in love.

190
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:06,820
But I am still alone and single!

191
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:11,040
<i>It seems I was right to keep you from the truth.</i>

192
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,620
I love being alone and single.

193
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,580
I'll do fine by my lonesome.

194
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,280
- I'm happy!
- I can't eat anymore.

195
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:20,280
All right.

196
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:25,000
Thanks to Old Fifth, we have enough men for our armed escort agency.

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,860
We'll have lots of work to do soon when we're open for business.

198
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:33,280
I found a spot in your area to set up my clinic.

199
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,460
Don't worry.

200
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,400
You can keep all the money I make.

201
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,380
Keep them yourself.

202
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,020
I have no need for money.

203
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,940
I am all yours too.

204
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,080
See that?

205
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,300
The moon looks beautiful tonight.

206
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:04,460
It reminds me of the poem you read for me.

207
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,020
"Under the moonlight, on Lake Xi, a boat carries us.

208
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:10,400
Lying enchanted, on the flowers, our night is far from over."

209
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,500
What's wrong?

210
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,600
Are you not feeling well again?

211
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,840
No.

212
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,620
You admired the moon and the poem,

213
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:22,040
but do you remember it's our wedding night?

214
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,600
Of course, I remember.

215
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,260
So...

216
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,100
Yun'er...

217
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,760
Your Majesty.

218
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:21,120
Are you ever going to stop looking at the ornate mirror?

219
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,000
His Majesty imprisoned me here.

220
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,800
What else can I do?

221
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,000
You have me at your service.

222
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,760
You?

223
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,520
I can avenge you.

224
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,800
Why?

225
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:40,240
My eldest brother and the Second Prince both died in regret.

226
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,960
I can't sleep.

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,980
I can't accept this.

228
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,200
And does it even matter?

229
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:49,610
You can't even defeat Chaofeng.

230
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:53,380
Now, Shaodian Youqin is working with him.

231
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,460
You are only throwing your life away.

232
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,260
I can't kill them.

233
00:15:01,540 --> 00:15:04,700
But I can kill those they love.

234
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,660
I want them to feel our anguish.

235
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,960
Yetan...

236
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,980
Qingkui...

237
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,920
Correct.

238
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:26,460
<i>Go.</i>

239
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:31,900
<i>Carry my hate with you as you tear them into pieces.</i>

240
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,700
<i>Brother.</i>

241
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,160
<i>You may rest in peace now.</i>

242
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,880
<i>I'll make sure they suffer.</i>

243
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,825
<i>[To Imperial Father: My wedding with Youqin is complete.]</i>

244
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,120
Great.

245
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,220
Your Majesty looks overjoyed.

246
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,980
Is it because of merriment?

247
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,700
Great merriment!

248
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,240
Look.

249
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,520
I should have your fingers chopped.

250
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:59,600
I deserve as much!

251
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,480
Tan'er and Youqin are finally married.

252
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,240
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

253
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,140
Congratulations!

254
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,860
Empyrean Xuanshang will take care of Princess Yetan.

255
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:14,020
Your Majesty, that's a weight lifted off your shoulder.

256
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,840
Indeed.

<i>[Memorial]</i>

258

Liguang Chiyao has been sending memorials through his former peers.

259
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,020
He wants to be reinstated.

260
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,440
He is pestering me.

261
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,120
Your Majesty. The Grand Chancellor has turned over a new leaf.

262
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,740
I doubt he will give you or Princess Yetan any trouble.

263
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,580
Fine.

264
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,320
He is my uncle, after all.

265
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,860
I'll make him wait for a few days.

266
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:47,800
I'll send him to the Void as a human ambassador.

267
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,260
I don't feel like seeing him now.

268
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,880
Yes.

You used my Assassin Assembly Hall and my nickname!

Your Romantic Heroic Chronicles made waves in the world.

You can use my name, but I want half of the profit.

Make it 60 percent.

297

Fine, you get half the profit.

298

But there's a problem. I need more guards.

Could you point some guards here?

Deal. Pour me some tea.

The words just got out, and there's already a crowd.

302
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,240
I should inform them.

303
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:11,260
Our plan was to lure Shaodian Youqin here and track down the two princesses.

304
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:14,440
But all we got was this stinking bird.

Very well.

306

- Yes.

I can't take it anymore. Stop it. I can't drink anymore.

309
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,400
Just one more cup.

310

- I am stuffed. Stop pouring me tea.
- Just one more cup.

311
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,340
No. Stop it!

312
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,540
Stop it.

313
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:40,680
Empyrean Xuanshang. I need a word with you.

314
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,340
I need your wife tomorrow.

315
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,420
- What for?
- I want her company.

316
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:46,540
- Whose company do I get?
- She's been with you for days!

317
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:49,340
Why can't she spend a day with me? I barely remember what she looks like.

What is it?

321

I'm not telling you.

322
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:01,400
By the way, Prince Chaofeng, I just passed by your agency. A dozen of people were waiting.

00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,440
- Really?
- Yes.

324
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,020
I already have customers?

325
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,200
I should go and take a look.

326
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,600
My nickname works wonder.

327
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,660
I don't have enough guards.

328
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,960
Old Fifth.

329
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,240
You are getting half of the profit. You must come with me.

330
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,560
Wait. I only contribute the name. Why should I work?

331
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,920
- I'm changing the name.
- Let's go.

332
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,420
Kui'er!

333
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:22,900
Old Fifth and I are going to the agency! We have customers!

334
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:24,940
- Get your lunch first.
- Never mind.

335
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,500
Don't teach my husband bad stuff.

336
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,820
Me?

337
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,040
He's worse than me.

338
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,360
- Let's go.
- Go on.

339
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:34,360
Stay safe.

340
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,780
Let's go.

341
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,840
Come. Try the fruits our Beast King grew.

342
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,560
- Did you steal these?
- Thanks.

343
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,860
You can't call this stealing.

344
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,980
It's perfectly normal for a bird to gather fruits from the field.

345
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,380
The only difference being these are from the Beast King's field.

346
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,320
Man Man. You should try the pancake I made.

347
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,540
Sure.

348
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:12,380
Thanks.

349
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,540
Are you going out tomorrow?

350
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,080
I am getting some new clothes.

351
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,680
What's the occasion? Why do you need new clothes?

352
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:24,640
I think it's...

353
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,740
It's just a normal day.

354
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:30,240
What's so special about tomorrow?

355
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,480
Even I know.

356
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,720
Where are Di Lanjue and Ziwu?

357
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,040
Why aren't they with you?

358
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,160
They will be here later.

359
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,180
They had just fallen in love.

360
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,900
They are now inseparable.

361
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,260
All of you are loving couples.

362
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:44,760
I'm the only one who can't fit in.

363
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:47,140
And you too, Husui.

364
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:49,400
You are enjoying your life here.

365
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,520
Zhu Duanshan!

366
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,720
Void Tyrant has declared to let us leave the Void.

367
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,360
What are you doing here?

368
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:04,680
Are you disobeying Void Tyrant's order?

369
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,920
What if I am?

370
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,760
Kill them.

371
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,740
Watch out!

372
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,400
Sister!

373
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,080
Husui!

374
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,640
Cursed bird.

375
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,920
Man Man! Man Man!

376
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:28,320
Your Highness! Your Highness!

377
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:29,880
Tan'er...

378
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,020
Man Man!

379
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:53,120
Man Man...

380
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:02,100
What a nuisance.

381
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:08,160
Man Man!

382
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,360
Man Man!

383
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Man...

384
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,100
I'd love to see the look on Chaofeng and Shaodian Youqin's faces.

385
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,580
<i>That's Dongqiu magic!</i>

386
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,260
Old Fifth. Quick.

387
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,240
Look at the crowd.

388
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,260
They are finally here.

389
00:27:36,260 --> 00:27:37,920
My apologies. Sorry for the wait.

390
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,440
I am the owner of this agency.

391
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,040
It's all right.

392
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:43,820
We all run major businesses.

393
00:27:43,820 --> 00:27:45,420
We've been waiting for your opening.

394
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,860
We'd like to have a word.

395
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,500
<i>Exactly.</i>

396
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:52,180
Sure. We'll talk inside. This way.

397
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:54,640
After you.

398
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,060
Who are you?

399
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,360
<i>Run!</i>

400
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,720
They left without a fight.

401
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,660
Oh, no. They are the decoy.

402
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:26,120
Let's go.

403
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,280
Grab his hand!

404
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:58,040
Tan'er!

405
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:15,200
Tan'er?

406
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:24,720
I may have failed to kill you,

407
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:27,920
but you won't live for long.

408
00:29:28,540 --> 00:29:31,280
You have to kill him!

409
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,820
Man Man!

410
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:39,880
Are you all right?

411
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,520
Are you all right?

412
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:45,940
Sister. Sister, save her now. Sister!

413
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,380
All right.

414
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,100
Sister, save her.

415
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,460
Sister, help her.

416
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,840
Sister...

417
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:02,100
Sister, you must save her.

418
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,340
Sister...

419
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,960
Tan'er...

420
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,440
Tan Tan...

421
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,060
I'm right here. I'm here.

422
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,540
Hang in there.

423
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:12,800
I know. This is my end.

424
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,320
That's nonsense!

425
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:15,420
You will live!

426
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:17,980
I prepared a surprise for you at House of Colors.

427
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,500
You have to be there.

428
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,600
You have to live!

429
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,680
Hang in there, do you hear me?

430
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,980
I knew you'd remember.

431
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,440
His Highness sent me as a gift

432
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,560
so I could

433
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:39,860
make you happy.

434
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:45,640
But you've brought me more joy.

435
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,380
- Don't say that now.
- Happy...

436
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,940
Don't say that!

437
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,700
Hang in there!

438
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,300
If you die now, I'll never forgive you!

439
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:59,360
Hang in there!

440
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:03,780
When you took the Holy Fabric,

441
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,360
you still

442
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,840
owe me a wish.

443
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:13,020
Yes, I remember that.

444
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,350
Listen to me.

445
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:17,240
After...

446
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,400
After I'm...

447
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,840
After I'm gone,

448
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:26,260
you can only grieve for three days.

449
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,360
After that,

450
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:31,240
you must be

451
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:38,160
the carefree little devil you are again.

452
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,540
Don't say that!

453
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:44,120
Man Man, get up!

454
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:05,360
Tan Tan...

455
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,740
Man Man!

456
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:16,240
Man Man...

457
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,800
Man Man!

458
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:36,800
Did you get him?

459
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,400
He got away.

460
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,840
Youqin!

461
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:43,100
Youqin, save her!

462
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,760
Please save her!

463
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,380
Youqin, figure something out!

464
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,940
Let's go.

465
00:32:49,790 --> 00:32:50,940
Save her!

466
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:54,540
Tan Tan! Did you see that extraordinary magic?

467
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,720
- Man Man!
- Man Man!

468
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,960
Feel her. Feel her.

469
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,140
Her body is still warm.

470
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,680
She can still be saved.

471
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:06,980
Please save her.

472
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:09,940
Feel her.

473
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,160
Save her.

474
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,840
Eldest Brother, what happened here?

475
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:21,940
Save her. You must know a way.

476
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,600
Please save her.

477
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
Can't you save her?

478
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,020
Save her if you can!

479
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:31,760
Save her!

480
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,340
Who did this?

481
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:36,040
Zhu Duanshan.

482
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,460
Was he here for you?

483
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,240
Why aren't you hurt?

484
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:49,220
Why was Man Man killed instead?

485
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,840
It's my fault.

486
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,180
I thought the Void Empress would relent after she was jailed.

487
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,340
Di Lanjue. They came prepared.

488
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,000
They lured us away.

489
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,880
They caught us off guard.

490
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:05,040
Di Lanjue. Calm down.

491
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,740
He never wanted this.

492
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,400
Sister-in-law is already heartbroken.

493
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,040
Now is not the time to fight.

494
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:29,260
I'll save you.

495
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,500
You will be fine.

496
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,940
We should first give Man Man a proper funeral.

497
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,640

519
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:50,740
<i>Long ago, there was someone called Yu Boya.</i>

520
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:53,740
<i>He was great at playing the zither.</i>

521
00:36:53,740 --> 00:36:57,060
<i>One day, he was playing his zither in the mountain.</i>

522
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:59,320
<i>He met someone who was there for firewood.</i>

523
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,520
<i>That person was Zhong Ziqi.</i>

524
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:07,480
<i>Upon hearing the melodies of Boya's qin, he said, "As majestic as Mount Tai."</i>

525
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:11,540
<i>Yu Boya thought, "The message of this tune was about the mountain's view."</i>

526
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,760
<i>So, he played another tune.</i>

527
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,660
<i>This time, it's the running river.</i>

528
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:17,320
<i>Zhong Ziqi heard the tune.</i>

529
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,380
<i>"The roars of a running river."</i>

530
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:26,240
<i>Whatever tune Yu Boya played, Zhong Ziqi could tell what was going on in his mind.</i>

531
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,520
<i>Hence, the two became close friends.</i>

532
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,720
<i>And then?</i>

533
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,700
<i>And then, Zhong Ziqi passed away.</i>

534
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,480
<i>Yu Boya was very sad. So, he smashed his qin.</i>

535
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:43,060
<i>He swore to never play any music again.</i>

536
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:47,160
<i>So, the humans have a name for those</i>

537
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:50,840
<i>who can read our minds: "soulmates."</i>

538
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,840
<i>You always know what I am thinking.</i>

539
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,060
<i>Are you my soulmate?</i>

540
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,280
<i>You are mine too.</i>

541
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:01,860
<i>From now on, we'll make this day our "Soulmate Day."</i>

542
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:06,200
<i>Wherever we are, we must celebrate this day every year. Alright?</i>

543
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,620
<i>A promise of a lifetime.</i>

544
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:11,720
<i>- Sealing it.
- Sealing it.</i>

545
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:21,360
I must bring Man Man back to Mount Cangdan myself.

546
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,700
That was her birthplace.

547
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,740
I'm coming with you.

548
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:28,800
You must not go.

549
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,840
Why not?

550
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:38,000
Is there something you're hiding from me?

551
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,380
Why is it I can now absorb turbid air?

552
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,320
I feel different too.

553
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,440
What did you do to us?

554
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,620
Your Highnesses. Let's talk in private.

555
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:51,420
We all trust each other with our lives.

556
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:53,800
Why can't you say it here?

557
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:00,340
It wasn't me.

558
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,220
You possessed this power yourselves.

559
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:09,940
That's because you are the Twin Flower of the Ganoderma Vein.

560
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:15,240
You're the flower spirits of Dongqiu's sacred tree.

561
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,600
What are you talking about?

562
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:30,840
How are they even related to that plant of destruction?

563
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,860
Tan'er and I are daughters of humans.

564
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,460
We were born into the human royal family.

565
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,260
How are we flower spirits?

566
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,840
This is nonsense.

567
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,080
Twin Flower of the Ganoderma Vein.

568
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,960
Separated, they absorb pure and turbid air.

569
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:45,000
Together, they can open Guixu and activate the Force of Chaos!.

570
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:48,080
Do you know how serious this accusation is?

571
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:52,160
The flower spirits were born with such powers, how is that a crime?

572
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:56,900
Ten millennia ago, the four realms feared them for their power to open Guixu.

573
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,300
So they uprooted the Ganoderma Vein.

574
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:02,120
The Twin Flower was scattered.

575
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,500
Who would've thought?

576
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,340
The flower spirits were reunited after ten millennia.

577
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,540
They were reincarnated as humans.

578
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,020
All of these...

579
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,740
Not even my father had experienced these.

580
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,000
Why would you, a young girl know about this?

581
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:19,880
Because I witnessed the demise of Dongqiu myself.

582
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,700
<i>The Ganoderma Vein is sacred to Dongqiu!</i>

583
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,580
<i>We will defend it with our lives!</i>

584
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:47,480
<i>Then we shall destroy Dongqiu!</i>

585
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,560
<i>The Twin Flower from the Ganoderma Vein can open Guixu!</i>

586
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,040
<i>That's an ancient legend.</i>

587
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,640
<i>No one can prove this claim.</i>

588
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:56,840
<i>The people of Dongqiu have lived here in peace.</i>

589
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,520
<i>Why would we want to destroy the world?</i>

590
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,420
<i>Please, show us mercy.</i>

591
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:02,160
<i>Spare our sacred tree.</i>

592
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,460
<i>If the legend is true, the fate of the world is tied to the Ganoderma Vein.</i>

593
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,600
<i>How can we live in peace knowing that?</i>

594
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:13,480
<i>If the legend is false, the Ganoderma Vein is just a tree.</i>

595
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:17,580
<i>Why would you sacrifice your lives for a plant?</i>

596
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:20,220
<i>Stand aside and we shall spare you.</i>

597
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:24,960
<i>The Ganoderma Vein is connected to the souls of the people of Dongqiu.</i>

598
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,040
<i>Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant, if you insist on destroying the sacred tree, then do it over our dead bodies.</i>

599
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:33,340
<i>We will sacrifice our blood to the spirit of the sacred tree!</i>

600
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,960
<i>Suzhi, hide here and don't come out.</i>

601
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:39,800
<i>- Don't come out.
- Stay here.</i>

602
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,780
<i>Don't come out.</i>
