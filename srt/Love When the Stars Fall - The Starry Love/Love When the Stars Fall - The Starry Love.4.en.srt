Thunder Deity, why are you so worked up?

31
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,520
I'm not.

32
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,600
I control thunder and lightning, but I didn't do that.

33
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,800
You... This isn't my smell, either. Then...

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,860
Who? Who is it? Who's doing this?

Who's doing my job?

36
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,240
Xuanshang is the spirit of the stars.

37
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,000
When he's having a mood swing, the stars will be affected.

38
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,460
In extreme cases, that affects the astronomical phenomenon in the Heavenly Realm.

39
00:02:55,460 --> 00:03:00,520
Did Xuanshang have an extreme encounter?

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,420
The smell is so strong.

41
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:09,420
How many did you eat?

42
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,580
Just one?

43
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:18,160
<i>Just one is enough to make me lose control?</i>

44
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,340
A bunch.

45
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,480
Liguang Qingkui, you...

46
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,660
Empyrean Xuanshang, I can't wait any longer.

47
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:28,000
I want the token now.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,533
Stop!

49
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,900
You won't give it to me?

50
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:37,060
Well, I won't give up.

Get up!

60
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
You came to ask Xuanshang to let you leave the Heavenly Realm.

61
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,200
But was it necessary to go this far?

62
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,160
You didn't come back, so I waited all night for you outside.

63
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:15,260
When I saw Empyrean Xuanshang leaving the hall, I knew something bad had happened.

64
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,430
My master's love has been forsaken...

65
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:20,800
Hold on. Wait.

66
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,833
You mean last night...

67
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:27,300
Heartless Shaodian and I...

68
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,680
You forgot? You don't remember anything?

69
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,580
My master is so young.

70
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,560
Yet he was betrayed by you...

71
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,980
Well, it's all your fault.

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,460
Do you know what that fruit you brought was?

73
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:46,360
What about leaving the realm?
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

74
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,600
Why don't you use what happened last night to blackmail him?

75
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,420
After all, he won't be able to defend himself.

76
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,620
He'll hand over the token. He might...

77
00:04:53,620 --> 00:04:55,880
We'll leave this matter at that. Just like that?

78
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:00,120
I won't bawl my eyes out like other girls, trying to make someone take responsibility.

79
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,860
Besides, he can't be the only one in the Heavenly Realm to have a token.

80
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,410
Who would be so dumb to give you their token, then?

81
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,180
Here he comes.

82
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,440
- Sister-in-law?
- Qingheng. Come here.

83
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,873
I...

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,320
Why are you here, Brother Qingheng?

85
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,380
I came to submit my homework to my brother.

86
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,460
Are you here to see him as well?

87
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,720
I woke up hungry, so I came to ask him for some food.

88
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,080
But your brother isn't here.

89
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,813
He isn't?

90
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:35,120
Then... Please wait for a bit.

91
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,120
I'll have the immortal attendants bring over some pastries.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
No need.

93
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,400
I have the pastries.

94
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,020
I just need you to get me some liquor.

95
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,240
Of course. Not the pure air liquor, though.

96
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:48,400
Qingkui, do you mean the liquor brewed by Liquor Deity Shaokang?

97
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,540
The kind that can make one dizzy and put one to sleep?

98
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,340
Yes, that's the one.

99
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:55,080
You get the liquor, and I'll prepare the food.

100
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,480
Let's meet at Tianpa Hall.

101
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,013

What are you up to now?

104
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,680
Why so anxious?

105
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,480
You go and prepare some food.

106
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,960
I'll get this silly boy drunk.

107
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,840
Within two hours, his token will be ours.

108
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,520
All they eat here is pure air.

109
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,970
Where am I supposed to find you food?

110
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,093
Sister-in-law?

111
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:14,080
Qingheng, you're here.

112
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,380
What is this?

113
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,100
Hotpot.

114
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:24,840
Brother, come and sit. Let's enjoy a meal while we drink and chat.

115
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,180
How did you prepare this entire spread of food in such a short time?

116
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,460
You want to know? Come here.

117
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:33,380
I'll show you something.

118
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,753
I... I...

119
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,780
Oh, don't hold back.

120
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,200
I've got plenty of tea eggs. They're delicious.

121
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,180
Here.

122
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,313
Tea egg?

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:50,540
Those who practice immortal cultivation should no longer consume the food of the mortal.

124
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:53,520
I dare not disobey the Heavenly Rules.

125
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,660
I thought you wouldn't be a stickler to the rules like your brother.

126
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,160
But it turns out you two are the same. How boring.

127
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,060
That's not it. You don't know.

128
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,820
My brother isn't restraining himself and following the Heavenly Rules for his own sake.

129
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,820
And that's what makes him so admirable.

130
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,620
Got it.

131
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:13,740
That stoic guy is like a god to you.

132
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,040
But even I don't usually get to savor this kind of food.

133
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,540
Are you sure you don't want to try some?

134
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,340
If both of us don't say anything, no one will know that you broke the rules.

135
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:26,020
Come on. Hurry.

136
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,160
Sit. Try some.

137
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,640
It smells divine.

138
00:08:39,420 --> 00:08:42,100
Here. Smell it.

139
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,620
Doesn't it smell wonderful?

140
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,420
Sister-in-law...

141
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,333
Is it good?

142
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:13,800
My eldest brother wasn't always like this.

143
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,920
He used to be kind.

144
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,220
He knew I was playful and often took me out to have fun.

145
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,520
He sure treats you very well.

146
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,840
Here. A toast to him.

147
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,500
But when did he give up his humanity and become such an unlikable man?

148
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:42,960
Ever since he was ordered to repair the Guixu,

149
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:49,540
he went into seclusion, separated himself from his heart and desires, and cultivated for a thousand years.

150
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:53,640
And that's how he became so cold and aloof?

151
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,040
<i>So this is Heartless Shaodian's weakness.</i>

152
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,700
<i>He must've had it tough last night.</i>

153
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:04,160
It has not been easy for my eldest brother.

154
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,140
Please don't say things like that anymore, Sister-in-law.

155
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:10,880
Fine, I promise.

156
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,960
<i>[Qingheng]</i>

157
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:54,900
If the guard finds out that the token belongs to Qingheng, he'll definitely stop us.

158
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,100
You stall him, and I'll open the gate.

159
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,700
Got it.

160
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,900
Guess who I am.

161
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:06,400
What are you doing, Princess Qingkui?

162
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,800
No, you're wrong. Guess again.

163
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,100
But I can see you.

164
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Deity Erlang?

165
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,300
Man Man!

166
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,900
The Heavenly Realm that's said to be heavily guarded isn't that hard to deal with.

167
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,100
Have you forgotten that we're in the Nine Heavens?

168
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
That gave me a scare. Perfect timing.

169
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,300
I'll take you down.

170
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
Let's go.

171
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Sir, a message from Sushui.

172
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,000
Princess Qingkui has left the city on the pretext of purchasing medicine.

173
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,500
Where is she headed?

174
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Wangliang City.

175
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,100
Tell Sushui to keep a close eye on her.

176
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,800
Once she enters the city, she must not be allowed to leave.

177
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,300
Yes.

178
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,900
<i>It was not your fault for mistakenly consuming the Jianmu Fruit and falling under its influence.</i>

179
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:44,600
<i>Never have I felt so tired in my thousands of years of cultivation.</i>

180
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,900
<i>Princess Qingkui... I'll see to it that you receive even more severe discipline from now on.</i>

181
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,700
Your Highness!

182
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,100
Haven't I told you?

183
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,300
Do not disturb me when I am purging my mind.

184
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes, I apologize.

185
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,200
But...

186
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,000
But Crane-Riding Deity asks... asks that you proceed to Penglai Hall to discuss matters.

187
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
What matters?

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,200
I think you had better see it for yourself.

189
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,700
- Where is His Highness?
- Where is His Highness?

190
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,100
Where is His Highness?

191
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,400
- We want to see His Highness!
- We demand to see His Highness!

192
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,800
- You can't.
- Why can't we?

193
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,800
His Highness is cultivating. He won't accept any visitors.

194
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,500
My cranes only lay eggs once in a thousand years!

195
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:29,100
I recently collected a few eggs that I was going to hatch and present to the Heavenly Emperor.

196
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,300
But Princess Qingkui took them!

197
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
Do you know what she did to them?

198
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,000
She turned them... She turned them into tea eggs!

199
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,900
- Listen to me!
- I will report this to him!

200
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,900
My new tea from Yunshan was stolen!

201
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:43,200
My ten-thousand-year-old tea tree was chopped down for firewood!

202
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,200
Where is His Highness? Please give us justice, Your Highness!

203
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,000
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

204
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,000
<i>Where is His Highness? Let us see His Highness!</i>

205
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,700
<i>- Your Highness! </i>
- His Highness is cultivating in seclusion.

206
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
- He is cultivating...
<i> - Your Highness!</i>

207
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,000
<i>- We demand to see His Highness!
- Why won't he see us?
[Penglai Hall]</i>

208
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,500
Let us see His Highness!

209
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:59,800
Qingkui. It's her again.

210
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:01,900
In less than half a day, she has caused so much trouble.

211
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,000
Half a day?

212
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,400
What did she do last night?

213
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,500
<i>Let us see His Highness!</i>

214
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:11,100
Take the two of them to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

215
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:13,300
Have Thunder Deity deal with this according to the Heavenly Rules.

216
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:15,100
Yes...

217
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:19,200
But... They aren't the only victims.

218
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:21,000
You were affected too.

219
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:26,200
- Your divine bull was eaten... by Princess Qingkui.
- What did you say?!

220
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,900
Your Highness!

221
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,100
Your Highness!

222
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,300
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

223
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,100
Your Highness! You've finally returned!

224
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:39,100
- Your Highness! Your Highness!
- Please calm down. Please be civil.

225
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,500
- I...
- Out of our way!

226
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,400
- Your Highness!
- You must seek justice for us!

227
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:47,400
- Because of Princess Qingkui's status as Empyrean Consort...
- That's right.

228
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:52,200
The Heavenly Ministry of Justice couldn't deal with her and sent us to Penglai Hall.

229
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,900
You must seek justice for us!

230
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,200
Your Highness!

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,200
You must seek justice for us, Your Highness!

232
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Princess Qingkui used someone's token and left the realm!

233
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:05,200
She had a strange bird with her that wounded my eye too!

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,500
She left the realm?

235
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,800
She left this for you.

236
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,000
<i>I know last night was a mistake.</i>

237
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,100
<i>For a pedantic deity like yourself to lose your purity, you must be suffering now.</i>

238
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,400
<i>But considering that you're an adult, I'm sure you'll be able to let it go maturely as I did.</i>

239
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,800
<i>Fret not, Heartless Shaodian.</i>

240
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,700
<i>I will not tell another soul about what happened.</i>

241
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,400
<i>If you still can't let this go...</i>

242
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:46,000
<i>This Heavenly Glazed Lamp...</i>

243
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
<i>Too valuable.</i>

244
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,500
<i>The intricate light shadow fan...</i>

245
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,500
<i>No, too good for him.</i>

246
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:06,500
<i>I've left you a silver moon cypress branch to make up for the inconvenience I caused.</i>

247
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,300
<i>Consider this as compensation.</i>

248
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,300
Was His Highness so infuriated?

249
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:34,300
Immortals. Deity Erlang. Please calm down.

250
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,000
His Highness will give all of you an explanation.

251
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,900
He...

252
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:42,000
He already flew off. What explanation can we expect?

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
- Right.
- That's right.

254
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,600
<i>Princess Qingkui, you'll have to suffer now.</i>

255
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,000
<i>[Wangliang City]</i>

256
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,200
Make way!

257
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,400
<i>I wonder if Tan'er made it to Wangliang City.</i>

258
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,100
Your Highness. We've arrived at the pharmacy.

259
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,500
The voidwalkers have always been avoiding seeking medical care.

260
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,100
It is an honor to have the Void Crown Princess grace my shop.

261
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,700
Please.

262
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,100
- It smells.
- Indeed.

263
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,800
Please.

264
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,000
Please. Please feel free to browse.

265
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,700
Take a look around.

266
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:14,300
If none of these interests Your Highness, I have a private collection of rare treasures.

267
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:18,500
Would Your Highness be interested in taking a look?

268
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,220
<i>I'll wait for you at the back door.</i>

269
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,300
Please show me the way.

270
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,800
This way, please.

271
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,500
Sister!

272
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,900
Come here!

273
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:52,900
Sister, we can't stay here. Let's leave now.

274
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,700
Tan'er, did you have a hard time in the Heavenly Realm?

275
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,100
Did anyone hurt you?

276
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,500
The laws of the Heavenly Realm are strict. You hate being restrained.

277
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,200
It must've been difficult for you.

278
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,400
Sister, I'm fine.

279
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,500
But you... You look dreadful.

280
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,000
You must've had a hard time.

281
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,300
Don't say that.

282
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:12,000
You just got caught up in the Void's succession war.

283
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,300
It's Dingyun's fault. He shouldn't have tried to assassinate the First Prince.

284
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,200
Don't worry, Tan'er.

285
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:22,300
I've written a letter to Imperial Father explaining the mistake in the marriage and asked him to save us.
<i>[Imperial Father]</i>

286
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,600
The Void's succession war?

287
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Didn't we end up marrying the wrong men because of Di Lanjue?

288
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,600
Di Lanjue?

289
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,300
- The Prince of the Beast Realm that you're close to?
- Yes.

290
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,300
I was worried you would lose your freedom after marrying an immortal.

291
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:39,400
<i>So I had him snatch you away on the day of your wedding.</i>

292
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,000
<i>But that guy was unreliable. He wasn't good at spells.</i>

293
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,100
He mixed up the sedans.

294
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,900
If it was indeed the fault of Di Lanjue, why did the Third Prince lie to me?

295
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:52,300
Tan'er, think about it again.

296
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,900
Did you get involved in the feud of the voidwalkers before you were wedded?

297
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,500
The feud of the voidwalkers...

298
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
The assassination of Wu Dai! I remember now! I did come across that.

299
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,100
But how did you know that, Sister?

300
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:18,600
Sir, Her Highness and Yetan made an arrangement to convene in Wangliang City

301
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,100
and send a letter to the human emperor.

302
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:23,300
They are meeting there right now.

303
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,500
Why do you laugh, Sir?

304
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:31,400
I told you Princess Qingkui isn't that easy to fool.

305
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:37,300
Now that the two of them have reunited, your plans have failed.

306
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,500
I underestimated that human princess.

307
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,100
I was going to spare her life to have her assist me in seizing the throne.

308
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,400
But she's an unsettled one.

309
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Yetan and Qingkui. Leave neither of them alive.

310
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:54,400
So, Chaofeng, the least favored Third Prince, was the one who saved you

311
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,500
and told you all about Dingyun's assassination?

312
00:20:56,500 --> 00:21:01,200
Yes. The Third Prince has never met us before. Yet he was willing to help us. That's very kind of him.

313
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,500
Don't be so gullible!

314
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:03,800
There is no one in the Void that is kind!

315
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,600
That's right.

316
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,600
But he did protect me.

317
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,700
The situation in the Void is complex.

318
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:13,300
Perhaps he didn't want to see two innocent girls get caught up in the chaos.

319
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:15,100
I don't know what Chaofeng is up to.

320
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,900
But he definitely has hidden agendas.

321
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,200
What we should do now is return to the palace at once.

322
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,900
Let's go.

323
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,460
- Did you have a death wish?
- I didn't want you to get hurt!

324
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,900
You... You're Dingyun?

325
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,400
Doesn't matter who he is. Let's get out of here first.

326
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,380
Run!

327
00:21:55,270 --> 00:21:56,593
Let's go!

328
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:20,520
Tan'er! Tan'er...

329
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,840
This isn't going to work.

330
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,300
If he catches both of us, he'll kill us both.

331
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,680
Let's split up. He won't be able to catch up to both of us.

332
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,140
One of us will make it out somehow and deliver the letter to Father.

333
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:31,080
Sister, you have no cultivation. You won't be able to protect yourself.

334
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,520
You deliver the letter. I'll handle him.

335
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,753
No! What about you?

336
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:39,181
As long as one of us gets away, he'll have reservations, and he won't kill the other recklessly.

337
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,340
Take this and go.

338
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:48,780
Keep yourself safe. Go!

339
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:52,400
- Be careful.
- I'll be fine. Trust me. Go now!

340
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,353
Go now! Hurry!

341
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,990
Divine Fire Shield!

342
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,813
Binding Silk!

343
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,920
I just got this.

344
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:28,960
I can't believe I have to use it on scum like you!

345
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,640
Demon-Vanquishing Vajra!

346
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,733
Jade Ruyi!

347
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,033
Linglong Pagoda!

348
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:06,330
Demon-Vanquishing Umbrella!

349
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,350
Five Thunder Beads!

350
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:54,460
If you kill me here, my sister will expose the false marriage no matter what!

351
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:57,260
Your plan will be exposed when that happens, and your life will be at risk too!

352
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,920
Do you think I would spare your sister after I kill you?

353
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,820
I've sealed the entire Wangliang City.

354
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,260
Qingkui is trapped.

355
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:08,540
Once I kill you, your sister will join you.

356
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,020
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

357
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:17,980
♫ <i>The silhouette of our embrace</i> ♫

358
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:25,260
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

359
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,620
<i>Shaodian Youqin!</i>

360
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,170
<i>It's him again!</i>

361
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:30,400
<i>It looks like I won't be able to kill this girl.</i>

362
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,721
<i>But seeing him protecting her tells me that he doesn't know about the mix-up yet.</i>

363
00:25:34,721 --> 00:25:39,120
<i>It's better to make the best of this mistake than fight him forcibly.</i>

364
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,800
Why are you glaring at me?

365
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,180
Kill him! Don't you know that he...

366
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,380
He was the one who tried to kill Wu Dai in Wangliang City.

367
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,540
How did you know?

368
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,580
It's easy to tell from his moves.

369
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:59,030
Why aren't you going after him, then?

370
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,720
What does the feud of the princes of the Void have to do with me?

371
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,060
You, on the other hand, if you hadn't escaped to the Human Realm,

372
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:06,501
you wouldn't have given them a chance to come after you.

373
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,140
<i>Oh, Your Highness, where in the world are you?</i>

374
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:14,560
<i>Don't worry, Tan Tan. I'll save you!</i>

375
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,860
Your Highness!

376
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,593
Man Man!

377
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:23,280
You're the Empyrean Consort. But you came to the Human Realm without permission,

378
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:26,100
and you're entangled in the matters of both the Beast Realm and the Void. How troublesome.

379
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,660
Man Man and I have been through thick and thin!

380
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:29,660
How dare you capture her! I'll fight you!

381
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,213
Impudent!

382
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,993
Leave.

383
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,893
Third Prince...

384
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,153
Come on.

385
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:59,920
Even if you wanted to play the hero, you didn't have to go that far!

386
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,360
- Over there.
- Yes.

387
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,773
Let's go!

388
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,640
They were Dingyun's men as expected.

389
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,840
Are you all right?

390
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,720
You were right.

391
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,660
Dingyun does intend to kill my sister.

392
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:44,040
Please save her!

393
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,880
There's no need to do this, Your Highness.

394
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,440
Empyrean Xuanshang has rescued Princess Yetan.

395
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,900
As long as she stays in the Heavenly Realm, she'll be safe.

396
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,100
Rest assured, Your Highness.

397
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,900
It's all my fault. I almost got her killed.

398
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,740
But Dingyun intends to kill me now.

399
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,000
I'm afraid...

400
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,840
What matters is that you're safe, Princess Yetan.

401
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,720
Dingyun failed this time.

402
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,660
He won't dare to try to do anything to you again.

403
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,750
Besides, it is in his favor to continue this mistake.

404
00:29:13,750 --> 00:29:19,450
As long as you stay in the Void from now on, I'll do everything I can to protect you.

405
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:30,290
<i>Since it has come to this, I'll have to make the most out of things.</i>

406
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,733
Your Highness.

407
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,180
Your Highness.

408
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:44,180
We're a family now, so don't make things difficult for Man Man.

409
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:48,430
If you continue to behave recklessly, I'll make you regret it.

410
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:52,060
Hey! It's because you're always so rude.

411
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,240
Silence!

412
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,773
You...

413
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:59,040
I don't want to see you.

414
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:03,260
Feichi, take her to face her punishment at the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

415
00:30:03,260 --> 00:30:04,580
I'm not going anywhere. I didn't do anything wrong.

416
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,000
You still refuse to admit your mistakes?

417
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,300
Feichi, tell her the offenses she committed.

418
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,180
Killing sacred animals, destroying the immortal realm,

419
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,560
escaping to the Human Realm, and being acquainted with the Beast Realm.

420
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:21,400
Given all the above offenses, you are punishable by five strikes of the divine thunder.

421
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,580
All I did was satisfy my hunger and visit relatives.

422
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:25,840
Is this necessary?

423
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,100
Do you take an Empyrean Consort just to make her a prisoner?

424
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,850
- You...
- What? What do you want?

425
00:30:31,850 --> 00:30:33,573
Wait right here.

426
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,900
<i>Give us justice, Your Highness!</i>

427
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,220
<i>- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!</i>

428
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:56,160
Your Highness has been in a clear state of mind for over a thousand years.

429
00:30:56,160 --> 00:31:01,120
Now, because of Princess Qingkui, you have to purge your mind twice a day.

430
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,560
One must reflect upon oneself if one fails to behave properly.

431
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:07,060
It is my fault for acting rashly.

432
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,000
To be able to sway your heart and mind that are as firm and solid as a rock to this extent,

433
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:16,420
Princess Qingkui is Your Highness' fated one indeed.

434
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,200
Are you mocking me?

435
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,980
It seems Your Highness is no longer upset now.

436
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:25,060
What do you plan to do next?

437
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:29,400
You can't actually send her to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

438
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:40,520
<i>That Heartless Shaodian is strict and dogmatic.</i>

439
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,720
<i>Who knows how he is going to deal with me?</i>

440
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,180
<i>I can't just sit around and do nothing.</i>

441
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,600
<i>Thankfully, Di Lanjue taught me some basic spells.</i>

442
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,570
Your Highness!

443
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,600
Princess Qingkui.

444
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,430
Your movements have been sealed. Listen here.

445
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,560
I'm going to escape right under your nose.

446
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,480
No... I... How can you still move?

447
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,000
I have over a thousand years of cultivation.

448
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,160
How could I be stopped by such a petty spell?

449
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,020
No... What's this?

450
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,480
Iridescent Eyes.

451
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,920
If you behave yourself, they will not hinder you.

452
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:32,913
- If not...
- If not, what?

453
00:32:33,881 --> 00:32:36,600
- That hurts!
- I'm sure you've felt it.

454
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,800
Heartless Shaodian!

455
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,740
You darned...

456
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,040
Now that you know what they're capable of,

457
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:47,740
you should mind your behavior from now on.

458
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,313
Mo.

459
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,020
- Take Princess Qingkui back to Tianpa Hall.
- Yes.

460
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:54,660
Heartless Shaodian!

461
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,800
You! You darned...

462
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:02,873
- You darned...
- Please.

463
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:11,280
Your Highness, the beast is awake.

464
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,030
What should we do with her?

465
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,900
Where am I? Where's my mistress?

466
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,680
Is she being punished?

467
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,700
Your Highness!

468
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:22,800
Your Highness, please don't be hard on Princess Qingkui.

469
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,380
She left for the realm because her older sister...

470
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:28,380
Because... Because an older sister wanted to see her little sister.

471
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,140
Her wedding day was chaotic.

472
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,160
Since coming to the Heavenly Realm, Her Highness has been worried about her little sister.

473
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,440
She loves and cares too much about her.

474
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:37,580
Why else would she risk her life and escape to the Human Realm?

475
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,780
Your Highness, please don't... Please don't blame Princess Qingkui.

476
00:33:40,780 --> 00:33:41,850
I'm begging you. Please...

477
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:44,640
Love and desire are burdens on the path of cultivation.

478
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:48,040
She has joined the immortals, so she should obey our rules.

479
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,660
Your... Your Highness is right.

480
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:52,320
She hasn't been here for long.

481
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,310
I... I'll teach her. Rest assured.

482
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,390
Forget it.

483
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,360
She acted out because of love.

484
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:01,110
That is understandable.

485
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:03,400
I'll let you stay by her side.

486
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,540
You're dismissed.

487
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:06,300
Your mistress is fine.

488
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:08,680
Thank you, Your Highness. Thank you, Sir.

489
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:15,260
<i>She went to the Human Realm because she was worried about her sister.</i>

490
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:19,200
<i>Was the punishment earlier too harsh?</i>

491
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,020
<i>Never mind.</i>

492
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,140
<i>I really don't want to be near her.</i>

493
00:34:24,140 --> 00:34:27,520
<i>I'll let the Iridescent Eyes keep her in check.</i>

494
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:34,000
The Void Empress sent you, Lord Zhulong, to the borders to assist the Second Prince

495
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,500
and even had us see you off.

496
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:40,700
This shows that the Void Empress holds you in high regard.

497
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:46,273
- Is that so?
- Yes.

498
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:50,520
Go back and get a drink.

499
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,253
Thank you, Sir.

500
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:04,473
Chaofeng?

501
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>Why is he in Zhuoxin Hall with Princess Yetan?</i>

502
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:20,280
You were willing to return to the Void for your little sister's sake.

503
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,620
Your love for her is precious.

504
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:26,600
The mix-up in the marriage concerns the succession war in the Void.

505
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,333
It is perilous.

506
00:35:28,333 --> 00:35:30,770
But I promise you, Your Highness,

507
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:33,650
so long as you remain in the Void,

508
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:36,580
I'll do everything to protect you.

509
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,940
Thank you, Third Prince.

510
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,740
It's your first time in the Void.

511
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:48,190
It is natural for you to be reserved.

512
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,940
You've saved me several times.

513
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:06,040
I am grateful, but... I was reckless in going to Wangliang City.

514
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:08,410
I've alerted the Second Prince.

515
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,180
I'm sure I've invoked his wrath.

516
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,920
I do not wish to burden you any further.

517
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,840
Not at all, Your Highness. Rest assured.

518
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,513
I won't let Second Brother make things difficult for you.

519
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:25,200
That's bold of you to say, Lord of Void Patrol.

520
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,930
He works for Second Brother.

521
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:31,960
To think all of the Void were deceived by you,

522
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,420
Princess Qingkui.

523
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,540
Don't worry.

524
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,720
Zhu Jiuyin.

525
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,980
It looks like I can't let you leave Zhuoxin Hall.

526
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:47,820
You think you can protect her? You're just a Void Patrol.

527
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:50,420
Come with me to see the Second Prince.

528
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:34,980
Third Prince!

529
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,880
Your Highness, be careful!

530
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:16,400
I killed someone...

531
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,850
You did it to defense yourself.

532
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,633
Sir!

533
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,780
Sir. Your Highness.

534
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,020
Please look at this.

535
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:57,620
He is the one who tried to kill Princess Yetan in Wangliang City.

536
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,560
I'm sure he hasn't informed the Second Prince.

537
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:03,600
We just need to get rid of his body, and the Second Prince will never know.

538
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:04,600
Yes.

539
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,760
This man is ruthless, but he is extremely loyal.

540
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:12,160
If the Second Prince knows that he is dead, he will pursue this matter.

541
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,500
Rather than let that happen,

542
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:19,400
it's better that I take responsibility for my own actions so as not to implicate Your Highness and Tan'er.

543
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,560
Your Highness... Are you saying you want to turn yourself in?

544
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,090
You're just a weak woman.

545
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:37,140
No one in the Void would believe that you killed him.

546
00:39:37,140 --> 00:39:38,500
The weapon is right here.

547
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:40,550
They'll have to believe it.

548
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,120
It happened all too suddenly.

549
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,970
I must take sole responsibility for this.

550
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,580
This princess is in an adverse situation herself, yet she still wants to protect others.

551
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,460
She is the complete opposite of my master.

552
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,820
But you can't possibly own up to your every mistake,

553
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,470
Princess Qingkui.

554
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:10,400
You're good at scheming and making decisions.

555
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:12,980
You came up with this scheme to drag her down.

556
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,580
You've certainly had it all planned.

557
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,970
What do you know?

558
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:20,680
If I didn't let her experience it herself, she would never believe me.

559
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,890
And she would never stay and be a crown princess. Go away.

560
00:40:23,890 --> 00:40:25,960
Even so, you didn't have to kill Zhu Jiuyin.

561
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,920
Second Prince lost a trusted subordinate. He won't let this matter go.

562
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,980
Sir, you're inviting trouble.

563
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,220
I have my plans.

564
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,493
Your Highness.

565
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,913
Your Highness.

566
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:48,480
Your Highness must've had a nightmare.

567
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,340
Please have some tea to calm your nerves.

568
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:52,340
Where is the Third Prince?

569
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,500
Well,

570
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,720
His Highness has gone to the Cave of Haunted Souls to receive his punishment.

571
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,480
He said he killed the Second Prince's subordinate, Zhu Jiuyin.

572
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,540
He asked for a punishment?

573
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,440
Normally, it isn't a big deal for a prince to kill.

574
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,360
But His Highness was born of a lower status. He isn't favored either.

575
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,860
And the guy that died was one of the Second Prince's men.

576
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,060
I heard the enforcers in the Cave of Haunted Souls are ruthless and vicious.

577
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,320
They take pleasure in torture.

578
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,360
Those who enter the cave go through great pain and suffering.

579
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:22,620
His Highness is in for a rough time.

580
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,740
Who allowed you to gossip? Get out of here!

581
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,913
- Yes.
- Yes.

582
00:41:26,913 --> 00:41:28,773
Let's go.

583
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,240
Don't worry, Your Highness.

584
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,870
His Highness has asked someone to tell...

585
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,280
I killed Zhu Jiuyin!

586
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,020
How could His Highness suffer in my stead?

587
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,280
I must tell them the truth.

588
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:40,170
Your Highness.

589
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:43,920
His Highness must've thought of everything before he entered the cave.

590
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,940
If you bring this matter up now, it'll only mean the suffering of another.

591
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,770
It won't do any good.

592
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,420
His Highness cautioned me countless times.

593
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,580
But I doubted his intentions.

594
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:58,440
Now, he is being punished because of me, and I can't do anything.

595
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:01,720
Sushui, can you take me to him?

596
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,020
The Cave of Haunted Souls is surrounded by vicious beasts.

597
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:04,600
It is a dangerous place.

598
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,620
You cannot risk putting yourself in danger.

599
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,000
Please wait here for his return.

600
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:25,440
Princess Qingkui.
