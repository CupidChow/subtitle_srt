Both of you and the soul shard's injuries aren't serious.

It's just that the Void Patrol Battalion has always been well-informed.

00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:11,600
He usually comes up with a lot of ideas.

165
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:13,600
Where did Di Lanjue and Ziwu go?

166
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,000
I heard the Beast King had captured them back.

167
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,300
The Beast King is still furious. So he forbids him from leaving or having contacts outside of the realm.

168
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,800
This jerk. Doesn't that mean he had implicated my sister?

169
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,000
You're the jerk here!

170
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,900
Keep quiet.

171
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:30,600
Good and bad luck come together.

172
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,500
Beast King locking up Di Lanjue may have unintentionally helped us.

173
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,500
How so?

174
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:41,200
The Prince's Mansion of the Beast Realm is heavily guarded.

175
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:45,500
If Di Lanjue can't leave, Chaofeng naturally can't penetrate the defense as well.

176
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:49,000
When the time comes, we can take Fiery with us and seek refuge there.

177
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,200
That's great!

178
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,200
I can go home now!

179
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,200
This is awesome!

180
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,100
<i>A'Cai?</i>

181
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:31,900
<i>With this diaper, we won't have to worry about you making a mess anymore.</i>

182
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,500
Why did I turn into A'Cai in front of her?

183
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,400
I've lost my self-respect to ever see her again in this life.

184
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,900
I'll never see Princess Ziwu.

185
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,600
Stop irritating me about this matter already!

186
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,000
Your Highness, I'm here to deliver your meal.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,400
Leave it there and go.

188
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,300
Yes, Your Highness.

189
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:22,700
Beast Queen told me to take care of you.

190
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:25,100
Are you feeling better now?

191
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,200
I've not recovered yet. So I still need to recuperate.

192
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,400
Why... Why don't you leave?

193
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,600
I brought you food.

194
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,800
I even used the method of the Beast Tribe to prepare the soup.

195
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,300
Do you want to try some?

196
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,800
I... It's all right. I'm not hungry.

197
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,300
Please leave now.

198
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,100
You...

199
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,800
Don't cry.

200
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,900
Don't cry.

201
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:04,500
That day, I went to the Heavenly Realm to look for Qingkui and was pursued by the Heavenly Soldier.

202
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:07,100
You were the one who mistook me for a dog.

203
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:12,700
If you are upset because I pretended to be a dog out of bad intentions, you...

204
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,200
You didn't have to see me again.

205
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,000
I wasn't crying because of that.

206
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,800
Then... Then why are you upset?

207
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,700
If you had any bad intentions, you wouldn't have extracted your internal elixir and hurt your vitality for me.

208
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:28,700
Besides, we've been looking for Eldest Brother's soul shards together in the Mortal Realm for a year.

209
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,000
You have been with us through thick and thin, and you have helped us a lot along the way.

210
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,800
I can't even thank you enough.

211
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,400
Why would I be mad at you?

212
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,600
I was crying

213
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:43,000
because you knew I missed A'Cai.

214
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,900
Yet you kept hiding it from me.

215
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,500
I... I'm sorry.

216
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,300
I... I apologize.

217
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,800
I always thought I lost A'Cai because I was careless.

218
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,000
Every day, I was worried if it had enough food and clothing.

219
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:59,400
I wondered if anyone punished it for being naughty.

220
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,600
It was only this small.

221
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:06,700
I hid it from you because...

222
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,800
Because I didn't want to lose face.

223
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,300
Think about it.

224
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:16,500
I'm the dignified Prince of the Beast Tribe who was treated as a dog running around fetching balls in a diaper.

225
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,800
If this gets out, how can I...

226
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,900
You laughed.

227
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,500
That means you're no longer mad at me.

228
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:38,400
You prepared this soup.

229
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,000
I'll drink it.

230
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,500
What kind of soup is this?

231
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:56,000
I prepared the soup according to the way of the Beast Tribe,

232
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,600
called Wild Canine Nourishing Soup.
<i>(cruel or lacks empathy)</i>

233
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Is it bad?

234
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
It tastes great.

235
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,000
See? I've finished it.

236
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,000
What happened to your hand?

237
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,700
Did you burn yourself when preparing the soup?

238
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:32,000
As long as your injuries can heal, these are nothing.

239
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,300
Back in the Heavenly Realm, I was the one taking care of you.

240
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:40,700
Now you're the Prince of the Beast Tribe, this is all I can do for you.

241
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:06,300
Thank you for making the soup for me.

242
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,700
Actually, I've recovered from my injuries during this period.

243
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,600
I wonder how things are going in Yuewo Village now.

244
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
We should hurry up and help your eldest brother.

245
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,300
Y-Y-You're right.

246
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,600
We must hurry back now.

247
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Let's go.

248
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Let me out!

249
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:31,100
Royal Father! How long are you going to keep me here?

250
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:40,300
<i>His Majesty has ordered Your Highness and Princess Ziwu not to leave the mansion and must stay together!</i>

251
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,100
<i>What do you mean together?</i>

252
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,100
<i>Let me out!</i>

253
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:58,500
<i>His Majesty said the honor of the Beast Tribe depends on you now.</i>

254
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,500
<i>Your Highness should seize the moment to build a relationship with the princess.</i>

255
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,800
<i>Even pestering her is also worth a try.</i>

256
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,600
<i>What?</i>

257
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,200
<i>No! Absolutely not.</i>

258
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,200
These loathsome cubs!

259
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,200
What did they say?

260
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,800
They said royal father is not letting us out.

261
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,800
He even wants us...

262
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,300
What does he want us to do?

263
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:22,300
N-Nothing.

264
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,900
Tell me.

265
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,400
It's nothing.

266
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,500
Man Man?

267
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,000
Your Highness, we have returned.

268
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,800
We?

269
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,200
Sister-in-law!

270
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,800
Ziwu!

271
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:01,900
So Eldest Brother Fiery has been watching the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

272
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,800
Shaodian Youqin wasn't a smart guy.

273
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,300
Even his soul shard is stubborn.

274
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,600
If you ask me, we can't make him smarter no matter what we do.

275
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,700
I don't even know Tan...

276
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,200
What Kui Kui likes about him?

277
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,800
Can you keep it down?

278
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,600
Eldest Brother Fiery is resting in the next room.

279
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
Don't let him hear you.

280
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,600
When we arrived, I saw Beast King was very strict with you.

281
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,800
If Beast King finds out Fiery is staying here, I'm sure it'll give you trouble.

282
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,300
That won't happen.

283
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:35,300
I practically raised the bodyguards in the Prince's Mansion.

284
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,400
They won't leak your arrivals here to anyone.

285
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,600
Wait!

286
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,100
What's going on?

287
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,000
Who's staying here?

288
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,600
Of course, it's Eldest Brother Fiery.

289
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,400
He'll stay here to avoid trouble.

290
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,600
No!

291
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,200
I can't stand seeing him.

292
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,000
Why should I take the risk and take him in?

293
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,600
I won't do it.

294
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,000
Just sit down.

295
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,600
Sit.

296
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,600
But if you don't take him in, Eldest Brother Fiery's soul shard...

297
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:05,600
My eldest brother's soul shard will have nowhere to go.

298
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
What if...

299
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,800
What if someone picks on his soul shard?

300
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,100
Di Lanjue.

301
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,400
If you don't take my brother's soul shard in,

302
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,700
I'll tell everyone that you're...

303
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,600
What?

304
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,200
He's...

305
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Fine! I'll do it.

306
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,300
I'll definitely protect him.

307
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,000
Don't worry.

308
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:36,400
What kind of method did you use just now?

309
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,400
It actually made His Highness change his mind so quickly.

310
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,900
I...

311
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Everyone! It's been a long time since we met.

312
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,800
Please enjoy the food.

313
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,800
<i>Drink all you want, too.</i>

314
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,200
Let's enjoy the food and drinks.

315
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,400
Eat more.

316
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,300
Yes, eat more.

317
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:09,020
You're so adorable.

318
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,453
Here.

319
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,273
Is it good?

320
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,113
Dear, the fire is out.

321
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,680
I'm no longer angry.

322
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,400
I feel calm, too.

323
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:32,880
Don't worry. From now on, no one will call you a fire demon anymore.

324
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,680
I remember you like to drink.

325
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,340
This is a fine wine from the Beast Realm.

326
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:38,840
You can drink as much as you want.

327
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:46,820
What was I thinking? How could I forget that you can't
drink wine because you're injured?

328
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:53,400
Back then, I drank because no one understood me.

329
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,320
Now, I don't need it anymore.

330
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,313
Fiery,

331
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,740
I have to tell you something.

332
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,100
I'll be away for a while.

333
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:10,480
Dear, you don't want me anymore?

334
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,600
Why would I don't want you?

335
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:13,940
I have an important task to do.

336
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:16,060
After I finish the task, I'll return.

337
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:17,500
You're still injured.

338
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,420
This Prince's Mansion is the most heavily guarded place in the Beast Realm.

339
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:22,140
So stay here without any worries.

340
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,340
No one will hurt you here.

341
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:30,540
No matter how long it takes, I'll wait for you.

342
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,853
Wait for me.

343
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,713
Sister.

344
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,900
Are you still decocting medicine?

345
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,020
I've treated most of your injuries for the past two days.

346
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,360
It takes a longer time to treat the root of the problem.

347
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:15,200
You still need to keep taking medicine.

348
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:18,220
This tonic will help you restore your vitality.

349
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,120
Come. This is a ten-day dosage.

350
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,740
Remember to bring them with you and you must take them.

351
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,100
Don't do what you always did.

352
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,620
You stopped taking your medicine after your injuries ceased hurting.

353
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:32,960
You knew I'm leaving?

354
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,420
You have always been like this.

355
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,300
No one can stop you after you set your mind to do it.

356
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:41,040
Besides, reviving Empyrean Xuanshang is the goal of all four realms.

357
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:44,900
As your sister, I'm touched by your courage and righteousness.

358
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:46,700
I didn't think so much about it.

359
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,780
I only did it so I could remove the Iridescent Eyes.

360
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:51,360
Iridescent Eyes?

361
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,060
That's the ultimate item Heartless Shaodian planted in my body.

362
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,500
With this thing restricting me, there are so many things I can't do.

363
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:01,080
If I don't remove the Iridescent Eyes, my ambition to become the Devil of Void will come to nothing.

364
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,940
For heaven's sake, you've always said you want to be the greatest evil in the world since childhood.

365
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,740
But whenever you see injustice, you always stand up for justice.

366
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:11,620
Otherwise, how could you have made so many friends in the Beast Realm

367
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:13,680
and had such patience with the soul shard?

368
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:17,460
I... I just find them agreeable.

369
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,980
I've always taken things personally.

370
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:23,520
Fine, you take things personally.

371
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,480
Now, Princess Ziwu and Di Lanjue can't leave.

372
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,880
Only Man Man and Qingheng will travel with you.

373
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:32,320
Remember to be careful during your journey.

374
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,853
Also,

375
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,730
take this with you.

376
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,780
You had it?

377
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,660
I thought I lost it.

378
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,760
You clumsy girl.

379
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:48,400
Now, the medicine should have cooled down a little.

380
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:51,413
Drink it.

381
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:04,660
Good girl.

382
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,380
You had such a hard life in the Void.

383
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,740
It wasn't easy for you to return to the mortal world.

384
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:13,600
But I got you involved in the matters of soul shard.

385
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,820
I protect the soul shard not just to revive Empyrean Xuanshang and return your freedom.

386
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:21,740
But it is also for my sake.

387
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,060
I'm in a relationship with Chaofeng.

388
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:29,180
I can't bear to see him make a mistake and kill the soul shard.

389
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:32,740
I also cannot bear to let our relationship end this way.

390
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:35,720
I told you so many times not to trust anyone so easily.

391
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,120
Look how deeply attached you're to him now.

392
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,500
I don't know what is so great about Chaofeng that he can be compared to me and imperial father.

393
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:51,480
Tan'er, you and imperial father are the closest and dearest people to me.

394
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:52,720
Did you know?

395
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,340
He made me feel like I have nothing to fear even in a place as scary as the Void.

396
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,660
You know what? When I just arrived in the Void,

397
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:03,580
I killed someone General Zhulong, Zhu Jiuyin accidentally.

398
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:09,060
When I just arrived in the Heavenly Realm, I slaughtered Shaodian Youqin's mount.

399
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:11,080
Did you know what his mount was? It was a bull.

400
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:14,500
I threw it into the hot pot and ate it together with Qingheng.

401
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,060
I can't believe you did that. Empyrean Xuanshang must be livid.

402
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:20,001
I don't care what he thought about it. I was starving at the time.

403
00:27:20,001 --> 00:27:23,480
<i>You know what? When I first entered the Void...</i>

404
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:45,500
This has been the happiest thing for me since I got married to the wrong person by mistake.

405
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:49,700
Do you think it would be nice if I only become your sister

406
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,453
in this life instead of the Empyrean Consort or the Devil?

407
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,900
<i>I forgot she has the habit of taking care of her body.</i>

408
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,720
<i>She can't stay up late at night.</i>

409
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,760
<i>How I hope the dawn never comes.</i>

410
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,180
The princess was too ruthless with her attack.

411
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:16,830
Why do my eyes still hurt after applying the antidote?

412
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,567
She sure is decisive toward us.

413
00:28:20,567 --> 00:28:24,860
She treats Yetan and the soul shard more warmly than she treats me.

414
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:26,940
Sir, don't be confused.

415
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:30,340
Yetan and Empyrean Xuanshang are her birth sister and brother-in-law.

416
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,720
If we want to make it clear, we're the outsiders.

417
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,340
So what if she's her younger sister?

418
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,220
Once her sister is married, she's no longer part of her family.

419
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,440
She's the Void Crown Princess now.

420
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,080
There was no wedding ceremony yet.

421
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,460
How can you say she's not part of her family? Sir, you sure are funny.

422
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,293
Su Shui,

423
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,230
whose sides are you on?

424
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:50,320
Oh, dear Shui'er. This is what you did wrong.

425
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,420
How could you say something so honest in front of him?

426
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,920
How hurt he must have felt. You knew, right?

427
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:59,640
He always has this wishful thinking about the princess, and he has always been delusional.

428
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:04,620
You also knew that he feels guilty toward both of them.

429
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,480
You also know his long-waited dream of marrying her

430
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,160
would be shattered in the hands of the princess.

431
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,660
So how could you be so inconsiderate of him?

432
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,160
You're so insensible.

433
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,160
My apologies, Sir. Forgive me for my mistake.

434
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,060
It's all right now, Sir. She has learned from her mistake.

435
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,200
No matter what, love and title are two different matters.

436
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,580
I must not miss my chance to kill the soul shard because of Kui anymore.

437
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,840
Deliver my order. We must find the soul shard at all costs.

438
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,493
Yes, Sir.

439
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:47,920
<i>[Missing Person]</i>

440
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,380
Have you seen this person?

441
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:51,500
No.

442
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:56,100
Qingheng is searching for the soul shard in the Mortal Realm.

443
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,250
I wonder if there's any progress.

444
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:01,840
We've been searching for days, and my legs are giving out.

445
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,880
You, silly bird. Why didn't you fly me for a bit longer?

446
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,740
When we're on the road, we don't even know how long it'll take for us to find it.

447
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,980
It's better to save some energy.

448
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,320
What are you saying?

449
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,660
Was I wrong?

450
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:16,360
We have the immortals and the voidwalkers to be scared of. We can only search in secret.

451
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,860
When it comes to finding a needle in a haystack, it'll take at least

452
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:22,300
three to five years or six to seven years...

453
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,040
Quiet! If it's as you said, all my good years would have gone to waste.

454
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,880
How dare you, silly bird. I'm going to beat you to death! Don't run!

455
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,800
- You can't hit me! I'll get you!
- No, you can't!

456
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:32,400
Come back here!

457
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:37,480
<i>I'll clip your wings! Stay right there!</i>

458
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,293
Stop running!

459
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,220
Come and get me!

460
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:43,170
Stop right there!

461
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,353
This is...

462
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:18,540
Sir, spare me. Please show mercy, Sir.

463
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:19,900
This person seems difficult to deal with.

464
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,433
Get lost!

465
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,660
He must be mad from poverty. He picked up something that a beggar didn't want.

466
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:46,100
Isn't this the second soul shard?

467
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:48,500
We spent so long looking for him,

468
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,150
but it turned out that he had been picking up trash on the street.

469
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:55,660
This is the second soul shard of the Empyrean Xuanshang.

470
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,560
Impressive.

471
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,300
Why aren't you rushing to meet him this time?

472
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:11,680
When we met Fiery, I appeared in front of him abruptly, which caused me to take so many detours.

473
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,560
There's a saying about understanding yourself and your opponent to achieve success.

474
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:20,240
This time, I must first investigate his background and find out how he became like this.

475
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:23,120
Scented pouch! Trinkets for sale!

476
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,500
Come and take a look!

477
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:42,040
Fine wine!

478
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:43,940
Fresh brewed wine!

479
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,180
Fine wine!

480
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,230
Fragrant fine wine!

481
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:51,380
What is this place?

482
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:53,600
There's no sign at all.

483
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,540
Why does this place look so familiar? It seems I've seen it somewhere.

484
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,700
Don't spout nonsense when you're inside.

485
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,060
All right.

486
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,420
I remember it now.

487
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,340
This is the legendary... That... That's Assassin Fragrance Hall.

488
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:10,540
What Fragrance Hall?

489
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,380
When I returned to the Prince's Mansion this time,

490
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:14,620
I read in the gazette that a legendary figure had emerged in the Beast Realm.

491
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,220
In a short time, he established Assassin Fragrance Hall.

492
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,480
It's said this person is ruthless and kills without hesitation.

493
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,540
Other than money, he shows no interest in anything.

494
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,800
He's known by the nickname "Heartless."

495
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:31,720
Do you think the soul shard would be in danger by coming to such a dreadful place?

496
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:33,053
We must go.

497
00:34:33,053 --> 00:34:34,340
We'll go and check it out.

498
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,773
Let's go.

499
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,600
- I...
- Are you here to see Hall Master?

500
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,880
Come in.

501
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,280
Come on.

502
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:57,013
I... Go inside.

503
00:34:57,013 --> 00:34:58,100
Sit here.

504
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,700
Wait for a moment.

505
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,060
After the Hall Master takes care of that guy, he'll come to attend to you.

506
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:05,173
All right.

507
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:37,220
This is... What...

508
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,420
I can't believe the ruthless assassin is actually...

509
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,820
Heartless Shaodian's second soul shard.

510
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:51,560
I need to wash my clothes again.

511
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:53,193
Yes.

512
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,100
Sorry to keep you waiting.

513
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:02,140
Have you signed it?

514
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:07,280
Not yet. I have some doubts about the instructions on this commission.

515
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,420
Tell me.

516
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:16,041
During the mission, the assassin's food, clothing, and daily expenses are the responsibility of the client,

517
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:18,820
which is understandable. But how should I measure the wear and tear of weapons,

518
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:22,160
including the wear and tear of the soles of shoes?

519
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:28,270
We are experienced in this matter, we'll take care of the measurement.

520
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,840
All right. All right.

521
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:34,620
But if your clothes are stained with blood, we'll be charged between 50 and 100 liang.

522
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:37,321
Your clothes are stained with so much blood, didn't you say you would wash them yourself?

523
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,600
So do I still have to pay this much?

524
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,613
Fine.

525
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:43,880
You don't have to pay for the clothes.

526
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:48,150
But you still have to pay for the time to wash these clothes, right?

527
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,580
Then I also want to...

528
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:59,520
Mister, it seems you have a lot of questions about our trade.

529
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,400
Oh, I dare not. I dare not.

530
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,480
After all, it is only natural

531
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,480
for the top Assassin Fragrant Hall to have strict rules.

532
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,550
<i>[Assassin Fragrant Hall]</i>

533
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,700
All right. This inquiry fee and tea expense amount to a total of 10 liang.

534
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:24,900
Don't forget to make him pay for it.

535
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:26,600
But I only had a sip.

536
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:28,420
You can keep drinking.

537
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:29,960
You only need to pay another 10 liang.

538
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,980
You can refill.

539
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,340
Drink another cup.

540
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,220
Listen.

541
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,700
This assassin hall looks like a shady business.

542
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,340
Let's leave. Let's go to a safe place.

543
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:42,540
Come on.

544
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:44,840
You're next.

545
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:47,380
<i>We're at the wrong place. Wrong place. Sorry about this.</i>

546
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:49,133
My apologies.

547
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,900
We came to the wrong place.

548
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:53,220
We'll close the door for you. We'll close it for you.

549
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:59,820
I have never seen someone so ruthless and stingy before.

550
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,620
I've spent so much money because of Fiery before this.

551
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:05,400
Now, this is the legendary money lover, I'll probably end up spending all the money I'll make in my next life.

552
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,740
Worry not. My sister has provided a lot of financial support for travel expenses.

553
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:11,320
What do you plan to commission him later?

554
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,600
Commission?

555
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:16,980
I must be out of my mind to pay him for all the nonsense fees he came up with.

556
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,140
It's better if we save this money and use it to get a gift to buy him over.

557
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,380
Hero Mei, are you in?

558
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,833
Who's there?

559
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,980
I've admired you for a long time.

560
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,460
So I specially brought a generous gift for you.

561
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,210
<i>This person clearly followed me home.</i>

562
00:38:59,210 --> 00:39:01,280
<i>Could it be that she's eyeing my money?</i>

563
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
<i>I must ignore her.</i>

564
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:05,400
You got the wrong person.

565
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,960
I brought a generous gift for you. I was afraid someone might covet it.

566
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,260
So I dared not send it directly.

567
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,600
That's why I came to your doorstep when you were alone.

568
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:20,773
Here.

569
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:23,560
Can you let me in?

570
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:27,700
I've had a tiring journey.

571
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,840
Hero Mei, can you let me in to take a rest inside?

572
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,680
There are rocks outside. You can sit anywhere you want.

573
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,200
I've come to make your acquaintance, Hero Mei.

574
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,900
I never make acquaintance with anyone.

575
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:42,380
I'm busy. So please leave.

576
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:46,820
Is his heart made of stone?

577
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:50,300
I knew he would turn his back on me once he got the money.

578
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,550
That's why I kept some tricks up my sleeve.

579
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:05,380
You won't believe this. Come in now. See what I've discovered.

580
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,793
Come in.

581
00:40:19,793 --> 00:40:21,360
What do you think?

582
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,020
I knew he was rich.

583
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,520
But I didn't know he was this rich.

584
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:38,520
I now realize what it means to have a leaf obstructing one's vision.

585
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,853
Don't pull it.

586
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,753
Watch out!

587
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,793
Man Man!

588
00:41:31,793 --> 00:41:33,193
