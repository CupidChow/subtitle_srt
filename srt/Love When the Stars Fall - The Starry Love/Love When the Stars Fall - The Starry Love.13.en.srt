If you can't combine those soul shards, no one can.

21
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,820
So I need to make three soul shards fall in love with me to revive him?

22
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,400
So I need to make three soul shards fall in love with me to revive him?

23
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
- Yes.
- That's right.

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,000
How is that right?

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,940
Who do you think our princess is?

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:11,280
She may be a bit unreasonable at times. But dating three men at the same time? She will never do that.

<i>I will hire you!</i>

00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Are you out of your mind?

32
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,160
In that case, we will leave the resurrection of His Highness to Your Highness.

33
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,140
We're counting on you, Your Highness.

34
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,040
Let's get working, Your Highness. We should descend now.

35
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:51,100
Husui, we are violating the rules again.

36
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:52,840
The punishment will be severe.

37
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:56,580
You've worked hard to become a deity. You should not come with us.

38
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,980
Qingheng is in the palace.
<i>[Yang Jian]</i>

Halt, Your Highness.

00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,080
General Guangtian.

45
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,200
Qingheng has always been frail.

46
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,700
He just survived the battle at Guixu, so he must regain his strength.

47
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:46,020
Celestial Mother wants me to send him some tonics.

48
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,460
Please do me a favor and look the other way, General Guangtian.

49
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,400
Your Highness.

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,580
His Majesty orders us not to let anyone visit Immortal Qingheng.

51
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,080
As for the tonics, I may pass them to him.

52
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,800
Please go back.

53
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Well...

54
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:05,300
I leave the rest to you, General Guangtian.

55
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,400
Prince Qingheng?

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,120
- Prince Qingheng?
- What is it?

57
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,600
Her Highness sent you some tonics.

58

<i>General Guangtian is guarding Qingheng.</i>

59
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,180
<i>He has always been unyielding and only follows Celestial Father's order.</i>

60
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:37,280
<i>I guess it's impossible to get Qingheng out.</i>

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,520
Princess Ziwu!

62
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,420
Xiao Husui, what are you doing here?

63
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,480
Princess Qingkui sent me to get Prince Qingheng out.

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:49,360
That's great.

65
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,380
Qingheng is inside. I'll take you to him.

66
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,540
Yes.

67
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:55,120
- We'll use the back door.
- Yes.

68
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,960
Prince Qingheng. Tonics from Her Highness.

69
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:02,640
You're heartless, Guangtian.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,660
My brother took great care of you when he commanded the Heavenly Army.

71
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,920
Now he needs my help, but you're keeping me here!

72
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,200
I'm merely following orders.

73
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,880
Prince Qingheng!

74
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,700
Xiao Husui.

75
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,680
Princess Qingkui is waiting at Wangliang City.

76
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,400
You must go with Princess Ziwu now.

Sir.

79

You've suffered in the Cave of Haunted Souls.

80
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,440
I prepared some delicacies for you.

81
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,880
I hope you like them.

82
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,460
Thank you, Your Highness.

83
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,680
Haichao.

84
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,740
Bring us some thicker clothes.

85
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,180
Her Highness might feel cold.

86
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,720
Certainly, Sir.

87
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,820
Come on.

88
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,060
Your Highness!

89
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,580
- Your Highness!
- What's the matter?

90
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,140
- Please save my father!
- Your father?

91
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,840
Please get up.

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,300
My father was drafted for the campaign.

93
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,200
But his hands were hit by Empyrean Xuanshang's array.

94
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,680
He is losing more qi than he can replenish.

95
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:29,320
I can't help him. You are my only hope.

96
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,040
Where is your father now?

97
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,480
He is just outside.

98
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:35,000
Bring him inside now.

99
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,980
Qingkui is too merciful.

100
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,640
Whether it's friend or foe, she will always help those in need.

101
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
There are wounded soldiers everywhere.

102
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,440
I don't mind helping Sushui's family,

103
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,080
but if everyone else comes for help and draw too much attention, things might get out of hand.

104
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:18,340
Sir, don't worry.

105
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:21,400
Only six people will ever know that Her Highness knows medicine.

106
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,020
Great.

107
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,020
Who are those six people?

108
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,800
You, me, Her Highness, Sushui, Sushui's dad, and Wu Dai.

109
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,520
Good. Only six people can know. Not another more.

110
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,340
Understood.

111
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,060
Your Highness!

112
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,100
Your Highness!

113
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,700
Please save my brother!

114
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,080
- What happened to him?
- He was wounded in battle,

115
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,960
then he and the First Prince were punished at the cave.

116
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,840
He couldn't take it and passed out.

117
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,160
Help him sit down.

118
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,360
- Yes.
- Come here.

119
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,060
He is the First Prince's right-hand man. He already knew.

120
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,460
But don't worry.

121
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:01,860
Only eight people can know that Her Highness knows medicine.

122
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,600
Good.

123
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:06,140
Is he all right?

124
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,320
You need not worry.

125
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,460
He is strong.

126
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,960
This was caused by exhaustion. He will be fine.

127
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:14,440
Thank you, Princess. You are a kind healer.

128
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,060
With all due respect, please tend to my subordinate's friend.

129
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,760
He was wounded in the battle of Guixu.

130
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,060
Bring him here now. I won't let him die.

131
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:23,340
Calm down.

132
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,460
Thank you so much!

133
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,420
Sir, calm down. Calm.

134
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,200
Calm down.

135
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,300
Don't worry.

136
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:36,140
Only nine people will ever know that Her Highness knows medicine.

137
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,380
Your Highness!

138
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,080
Your Highness!

139
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,620
Your Highness!

140
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,660
- Your Highness, please save him!
- Sushui!

141
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,760
Your Highness! Your Highness!

142
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,260
Your Highness! Save him!

143
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,820
- Sushui!
- Coming!

144
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,220
How... How many of them are there?

145
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,860
Well... Don't worry, sir.

146
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,300
Only this many people

147
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,600
will know...

148
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:24,820
- Sir! Hurts!
- One plus one, and there are five more!

149
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,200
Sushui! Sushui!

150
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,960
We paid and bribed those people.

151
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:53,900
Who knows if that could keep their mouths shut?

152
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:58,500
Sir, why can't you tell Her Highness the pros and cons of doing so?

153
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:03,160
If she is not as merciful, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble.

154
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:07,220
Asking her to let them die is probably harder than mending Guixu.

155
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,100
Besides, I promised her I would let her do what she deems fit.

156
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,220
If I stopped her from treating those patients, how would she see me?

157
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,720
There are more downs than ups in life.

158
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,120
No one can be willful their entire life.

159
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:25,720
If I must get hurt to let her follow her heart, so be it.

160
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,600
Your Highness!

161
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,100
Your Highness.

162
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,920
What is it? How is the situation?

163
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:36,240
There are too many wounded in the Void Realm.

164
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,940
Her Highness displayed her prowess and now everyone is going to her.

165
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:44,260
The number of patients we have now is more than double before.

166
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:47,120
- I beg your pardon.
- Double.

167
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,720
Words are spreading fast.

168
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,640
How am I supposed to keep all of them silent?

169
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,740
You might as well end me here.

170
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:56,360
Come on, hit as hard as you can.

171
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,700
If we can't contain the situation, we might as well fan the flame and let everything burn.

172
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,000
A lot of noble lords were wounded during the battle, am I right?

173
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,300
You're right.

174
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:14,200
Find a way to make them ask for the Princess' help.

175
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,600
My dear prince, are you shooting yourself in the foot?

176
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,400
If the Void Empress gets wind of this, even the Princess will be in danger.

177
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:27,900
If we don't give her freedom, Qingkui will forever live in fear of offending everyone and causing trouble.

178
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,500
It's now or never.

179
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,500
Perhaps this is the way to secure her influence in this realm.

180
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:49,000
Our sister-in-law says she's waiting for us in Wangliang City?

181
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,900
- What...
- Take a look!

182
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:58,900
Did Youqin's soul shards fall to this filthy place?

183
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,500
I wonder how his soul shards look like.

184
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:08,400
What if that is one of his soul shards?

185
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
Hello there.

186
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,800
Care to try a goat head?

187
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,800
<i>No. It's all right.</i>

188
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,300
Yes. Split it open.

189
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,200
Slice the ears and the tongue.

190
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
All right, wait there.

191
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
- Sister-in-law.
- Sister-in-law.

192
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,700
You fools. Your brother isn't getting reincarnated.

193
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,700
His soul shards descended. His look won't change.

194
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:29,400
They will only look like him.

195
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Jade Deity told me that I should...

196
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,500
<i>What did he say?</i>

197
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,100
We'll talk inside.

198
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:56,200
The Jade Deity told me to resurrect your brother,

199
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,100
I must make his three soul shards

200
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,400
fall in love with me.

201
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,000
- All at once?
- All at once?

202
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,900
Impossible!

203
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,800
You must never say yes to this.

204
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,400
Come here.

205
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,000
But...

206
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,300
Sorry.

207
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,800
I forgot you.

208
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,600
How did you get here? How did you find us?

209
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,000
No thanks to you for leaving me in the Heavenly Realm.

210
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,400
I almost got killed while fleeing from the soldiers.

211
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,900
I heard you came to the Human Realm to find the soul shards.

212
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,400
I knew you'd set out from here. So I came looking for you.

213
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:34,200
Thank you...

214
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,900
Sister-in-law. Do you know him?

215
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,000
I am the Prince of the B-Beast Realm, Di Lanjue.

216
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,000
I'm Kui Kui's friend.

217
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,100
Nice to meet you.

218
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,200
Pleasure.

219
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,500
So you are the greatest magic item expert, Di Lanjue!

220
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,700
Yes.

221
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,700
This is weird.

222
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,400
We've never met before.

223
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:15,500
But why do you look so familiar to me?

224
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:20,700
Especially those eyes...

225
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,000
And...

226
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,200
What did you mean by she mustn't do it?

227
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:35,200
He meant we mustn't fail this task.

228
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,900
Right?

229
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,900
I mean, the three realms are huge and vast.

230
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:47,500
Finding all three soul shards is probably impossible.

231
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,600
Don't be silly.

232
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,700
You are the princes and princess of the Heavenly Realm and the Beast Realm.

233
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,400
You know tons of spells and magic.

234
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,700
Those should come in handy.

235
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:00,900
You haven't been made aware, but we fled here.

236
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,600
If we used any form of magic, celestial father might sense it.

237
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,700
And when he finds out, we will be brought back there.

238
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:12,600
My celestial mother may help cover us, but let's save magic as a last resort.

239
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,100
I can't believe this.

240
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,600
Buddy. We will have to rely on your power and influence in the Beast Realm.

241
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,400
My father has made me a wanted fugitive in the four realms.

242
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,800
It's best not to use magic.

243
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,400
You're telling me the deities before me

244
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:37,500
are pretty much as helpless as a mortal?

245
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,200
We're in for some real trouble.

246
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:48,500
Sister-in-law, the Iridescent Eyes inside you is my brother's ultimate item.

247
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:52,200
We can track down the soul shards with it.

248
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,000
Heartless Shaodian!

249
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,900
If you're watching us from above, let this magic item guide us.

250
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,500
Tell me where the three soul shards are!

251
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,800
Watch over me.

252
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,025
<i>[South]</i>

253
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,100
It's south.

254
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,300
Saintess. This is Zhuoxin Hall.

255
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,800
It's said that Princess Yetan is a great healer.

256
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,600
She's saved countless people in the past year.

257
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,100
The people here are grateful for her.

258
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,800
Some even said Princess Yetan has done more than Her Majesty.

259
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,600
Silence. Her practice is against the law.

260
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,800
I wouldn't have come here if I had another...

261
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,300
Don't be afraid.

262
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:00,500
Even the Chief Wizard Xiangliu has come here to seek medical help.

263
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,200
Princess Yetan never told anyone about his identity.

264
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:08,600
Besides, Princess Yetan has the Third Prince's protection.

265
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:12,600
The Third Prince worked with the Princess to set up this clinic for the people.

266
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:13,900
How honorable.

267
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,900
I know, right?

268
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,600
If he becomes the Crown Prince, the voidwalkers shall become great again.

269
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,300
You're right.

270
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
The Third Prince...

271
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:32,000
<i>[Zhuoxin Hall]</i>

272
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Princess Yetan.

273
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,700
Princess Yetan.

274
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:38,800
Your Highness. You are getting more popular by the day.

275
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,200
- How so?
- Look.

276
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,700
Even the Chief Wizard has sent a gift to thank you.

277
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,100
It's said that he got it from the Void Tyrant when they went hunting.

278
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:49,600
He is sending them to you as a token of gratitude.

279
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,100
Your Highness! This is the head of the most fearsome beast in the entire Void Realm.

280
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,000
Only the strongest in our realm can have it.

281
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,100
I thank the Chief Wizard for this gift.

282
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
I appreciate it.

283
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,000
But I practice medicine to save people, not to earn any rewards.

284
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,800
It's not about the value, but the thought.

285
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
There aren't many flowers in this realm.

286
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,700
Where did you get these?

287
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,300
The warriors want to thank you for saving their lives.

288
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
I know you prefer something special.

289
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:31,000
So I asked them to pick some flowers.

290
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,500
How thoughtful of you.

291
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,500
Your Highness.

292
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,900
I am Saintess of the Snake clan, Jialouluo.

293
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,000
Greetings.

294
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,100
Please come in.

295
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,700
Sir, you are really playing with fire here.

296
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
The Void Empress is from the Snake clan.

297
00:18:57,700 --> 00:19:00,500
How could you let their saintess come here for treatment?

298
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,600
It's been a year.

299
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,500
Qingkui has managed to earn the people's trust.

300
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:11,700
But to become a flame that reshapes the realm and lift the ban on medicine, we still need some help.

301
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,000
That scar...

302
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:34,000
It's the rule of our clan that the Saintess must molt 49 layers of skin after she's awarded the title.

303
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It could have cost me my life.

304
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,200
I survived.

305
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:40,200
But my face...

306
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,400
It's scarred for good.

307
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,000
People judge others by their looks.

308
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,300
I carry this scar while awaiting my marriage,

309
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:54,000
but I became

310
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,800
the disgrace of my clan.

311
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,800
Do not be sad, Saintess.

312
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:03,600
I can tell you were originally a great beauty.

313
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,200
After I heal the wound for you,

314
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,300
there will be a long line of nobles asking to marry you.

315
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,800
Can you really heal me?

316
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,500
Sir, I'll get a steamed bun.

317
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,500
Sure. Take this.

318
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,400
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

319
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,400
Have a nice day.

320
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,700
Come on.

321
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,800
Give it to me.

322
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:40,500
Come on.

323
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:50,000
Deities like you are all used to your high and righteous life up there.

324
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:55,700
Without nourishment from the pure air, you need food like normal humans.

325
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:58,200
But Tan...

326
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,700
I mean, Kui Kui.

327
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,600
She carries a great duty but still has to keep us fed.

328
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
Are you starving?

329
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,200
It must be tough.

330
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,400
You ate the most!

331
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,500
You were wolfing down everything.

332
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,900
You were like a hungry wolf. You fit the descriptions perfectly.

333
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:27,000
How dare you make fun of us.

334
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,100
One more thing.

335
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,600
Be mindful of where you place your paws.

336
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:37,100
If you ever do anything inappropriate to my sister-in-law, I'll chop those hands off!

337
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,400
Come on.

338
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,600
You can do it now.

339
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,600
Come on. Show me how you do it.

340
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:42,600
- I...
- Come on.

341
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:43,400
I'd like to see it!

342
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:46,900
Brother! Don't be so mean to him.

343
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,700
Don't worry. I'm here for you.

344
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,400
He won't hurt you.

345
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,300
What?

346
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:56,500
Ziwu, why are you always defending him?

347
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,600
Maybe it's because I lost A'Cai.

348
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,100
I've missed him ever since.

349
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:09,600
And somehow, Prince Di Lanjue gives off this faint scent

350
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,700
that reminds me of A'Cai.

351
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
Everyone, quiet down.

352
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,300
My stomach was already empty.

353
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,500
Now I feel even more hungry.

354
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,800
I should steal some steamed buns from...

355
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,100
What's wrong?

356
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,400
And who are you to punish me?

357
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,500
Ultimate item? You're useless.

358
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:36,200
We couldn't find the shards.

359
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,000
Instead, we find suffering.

360
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,200
Fine, hurt me all you want.

361
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,700
At this rate, we'll all starve to death.

362
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:51,200
Eldest Brother! If your soul is out there, please guide us.

363
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,700
Please...

364
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
I don't know if he's watching over us,

365
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:21,500
but I know where we can find some food!

366
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,700
<i>[Temple of Xuanshang]</i>

367
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,700
This temple sure gets a lot of visitors.

368
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,500
My legs went numb from the waiting.

369
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,600
My brother saved the world.

370
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
He deserves these tributes.

371
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Indeed. He is worthy of worship.

372
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:08,700
Are you sure this is a Temple of Xuanshang?

373
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:22,500
This statue of him looks too kind and friendly!

374
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:25,200
I bet he'd laugh so hard if he ever saw this.

375
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Look at the lips! Those lips!

376
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,600
Stop laughing!

377
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
This is the work of mortals.

378
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,600
They sculpted it based on the image in their minds.

379
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,500
This sculpture...

380
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:38,500
It...

381
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:45,300
It shows that my brother is dressed in ornament sand cares for the people.

382
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,000
Not bad.

383
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:51,400
The brother's love for him can outshine even the wife's.

384
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,300
Enough. Start eating.

385
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
Let's go.

386
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,600
Sister-in-law.

387
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,400
I don't think it's a good idea.

388
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:05,200
What's wrong? We came here to save him. We are starving.

389
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,900
Why can't we have some fruit?

390
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:09,000
I...

391
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,900
- I'm not eating these.
- Just eat up.

392
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:14,000
- No.
- Eat up.

393
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Finish yours.

394
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,600
No.

395
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,600
I'm not eating these.

396
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,900
Stop laughing.

397
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,600
I want to say something.

398
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
Empyrean Xuanshang.

399
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,100
If you are as kind and merciful as Qingheng claims to be,

400
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:35,500
show us where your soul shards are and put an end to this.

401
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,180
I am standing in your temple.

402
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,900
If you don't help me, I'll burn this place down and smash this statue.

403
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,100
<i>Sir.</i>

404
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,000
<i>Look.</i>

405
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,700
<i>There's a temple here.</i>

406
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,400
Quick, go inside.

407
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,800
Let me in!

408
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,100
Move aside. Ziwu, this way.

409
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,300
- But...
- Come on.

410
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,200
<i>Let's go inside.</i>

411
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
<i>Come on.</i>

412
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,800
It's full in here!

413
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,800
Silly bird, you can fly!

414
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,800
<i>Let's go.</i>

415
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,800
<i>I hope there is food in there.</i>

416
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,000
<i>Let's check it out.</i>

417
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,000
<i>Let's go, Sir.</i>

418
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,700
Is anyone here?

419
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,500
Is anyone here?

420
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000
Who would be in this rundown temple?

421
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,400
Let's go.

422
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,400
That is my last coin!

423
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,300
Cursed thieves!

424
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,500
It's just one coin.

425
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:38,000
You are overreacting.

426
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,900
<i>You fool. I walked into this coin.</i>

427
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:40,700
<i>Don't forget.</i>

428
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:41,900
<i>It's a good omen.</i>

429
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:42,800
We are thieves.

430
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,900
<i>- Our quest to slay the fire demon...
- Let go.</i>

431
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,100
<i>will definitely be a success, sir.</i>

432
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,900
Sir, the people from Yuewo Village spent a fortune to have the fire demon slain.

433
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,500
But the fire demon is too violent.

434
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,800
It burns anyone it sees.

435
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,600
<i>Everyone who tried was burned to a crisp.</i>

436
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,300
<i>We are here as frauds.</i>

437
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,800
We shouldn't get ourselves killed.

438
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,600
Don't be disheartened.

439
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:08,200
The villagers have been tormented by the fire demon for so long.

440
00:27:08,200 --> 00:27:12,200
These people are getting desperate.

441
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:17,400
Even if we can't slay the fire demon and can't get the 500-tael bounty,

442
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:24,100
at least we can swindle those simpletons and make some good money.

443
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,900
It's getting dark. We'll spend the night here.

444
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:31,400
We have an early start tomorrow.

445
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,000
This way.

446
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,600
There is a room, quick.

447
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,000
Let's go.

448
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,900
Just say it.

449
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,500
What's the plan here?

450
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:45,800
Did you anticipate that I'd make a move?

451
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,200
It's too obvious.

452
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:52,600
When you heard about the bounty, you started drooling all over the place.

453
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:56,000
He said 500 taels. Is that a lot of money?

454
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,600
Remember the steamed buns stall outside?

455
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,800
You can have 500 stalls with that money.

456
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,900
I want more steamed buns.

457
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,500
Sister-in-law. Isn't it a bit inadequate to get involved with those thieves?

458
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,000
Even they can become demon slayers.

459
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,100
We have deities and the Prince of the Beast Realm here.

460
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:18,000
Why should we let them have the bounty?

461
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,500
Besides, if all of us are starving and helpless, how can we save your brother?

462
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:26,400
Has Shaodian Youqin taught you nothing useful?

463
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,600
I...

464
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,100
Pull yourselves together.

465
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,500
Tomorrow, we work as one and take down the fire demon.

466
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:34,200
Slay it.

467
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,400
Don't touch my sister-in-law.

468
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:45,800
Don't touch my sister.

469
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,800
You...

470
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,400
<i>What was that for?</i>

471
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,000
<i>Get poked!</i>

472
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,400
I'll ask the kid.

473
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,600
Go on.

474
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,700
Kiddo. Is the village chief here?

475
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:16,200
Help us out. Bring the chief here.

476
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,700
Sure.

477
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,600
Wait here. He'll be back.

478
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,600
Look. Who are those people?

479
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,300
Chief. These are the people I mentioned.

480
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:49,800
Chief. If we take down the fire demon for you, do we get the 500 taels as a reward?

481
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,100
Can they beat the demon?

482
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,800
You don't look like demon slayers.

483
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,100
<i>No way.</i>

484
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,000
<i>You don't look fit for the job.</i>

485
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
A true expert strikes with stillness.

486
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,500
We don't use fancy and flamboyant moves.

487
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:11,500
Ladies and gentlemen, we are not doubting your skills, but the fire demon is simply too strong.

488
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:14,800
I fear you might have come here for nothing.

489
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,600
That's right.

490
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,500
It's too powerful.

491
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:17,600
How powerful is it?

492
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,800
How powerful is it?

493
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:21,200
The fire demon is very violent and aggressive.

494
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:22,600
If you go near the stone hut,

495
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,200
<i>it will get furious!</i>

496
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,800
<i>By the way, earlier today, this morning</i>

497
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:31,500
<i>a few mighty warriors were defeated by the demon.</i>

498
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,400
<i>Charge!</i>

499
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:52,900
<i>Run for your life!</i>

500
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,100
<i>Sir!</i>

501
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,600
<i>Sir!</i>

502
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,800
<i>Wait for me!</i>

503
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:07,800
By the way, the fire demon also killed villagers.

504
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,900
Sister-in-law, he fire demon is fearsome.

505
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,000
Are we really going to confront it?

506
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,400
We're already here. We can't leave empty-handed.

507
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,800
We will move out when we're ready.

508
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,700
You can't be serious!

509
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,200
This stone hut is spitting flame.

510
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,800
What creature can live here?

511
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,800
Sister-in-law. Is this fire demon made from stones?

512
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:52,000
Don't be afraid.

513
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:56,600
After we defeat this fire demon, you can have as many steamed buns as you want.

514
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,400
Everyone, do not fear it.

515
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:06,300
We will beat this fire demon to a pulp!

516
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,500
What...

517
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,400
Are you all right?

518
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,280
It seems we underestimated the demon.

519
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,020
Thankfully, I brought my ice grenade.

520
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,360
This should take care of it.

521
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:34,500
Hurry up before it comes out.

522
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:11,960
What...

523
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:13,960
<i>Don't tell me he is...</i>

524
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:20,240
♫ <i>Heaven and Earth resonates with the mountains and rivers</i> ♫

525
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,520
♫ <i>The world is untamed and unbridled</i> ♫

526
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,820
That was close.

527
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,420
It's... I-I-It's...

528
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:31,820
It's quite fearsome.

529
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:34,940
Eldest... Eldest Brother?

530
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,260
- Shaodian Youqin?
- Shaodian Youqin?

531
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:39,780
♫ <i>In the next lifetime, I'd still sacrifice my soul for you</i> ♫

532
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:41,600
Scram!

533
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:48,340
Hear us out!

534
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:52,320
<i>Has Heartless Shaodian become a demon as the rumor in the Heavenly Realm says?</i>

535
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,720
Eldest Brother, let us explain.

536
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:03,360
Eldest Brother! I am Ziwu!

537
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:04,820
Don't you recognize me?

538
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,680
We've looked everywhere for you!

539
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
<i>Ziwu! It's your sister!</i>

540
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,200
- Right.
- You drew my portrait!

541
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,180
Eldest Brother! The drawing...

542
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,220
Ziwu!

543
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,180
He doesn't recognize us! Run!

544
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,540
- Run!
- Ziwu! Curse you, Shaodian Youqin!

545
00:34:18,540 --> 00:34:20,460
How dare you spit fire at us! Watch out.

546
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:22,480
Run! Run!

547
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:26,140
Quick.

548
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,080
But... Why isn't anyone saying anything?

549
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,880
We found one of the shards.

550
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,500
This fiery Youqin is somewhat different.

551
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:46,220
But we can figure this out.

552
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:47,940
Fiery...

553
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:50,900
Sister-in-law, it's still a soul shard.

554
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,740
Let's not call it names.

555
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:56,900
We finally found one of his soul shards...

556
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:00,440
But we can't even go anywhere near him.

557
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:05,540
Sister-in-law, how are we supposed to make him fall for you?

558
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:11,980
The hero of the four realms has become the fire demon everyone loathes and hates.

559
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,180
Such is fate.

560
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,980
Celestial Father was right.

561
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:18,520
The shards are manifestations of his desires.

562
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,940
They become evils in the Mortal Realm.

563
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,880
We must figure out a way to evacuate the villagers.

564
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:27,920
Otherwise, if the fire demon harms anyone, Eldest Brother's reputation will be tarnished.

565
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:31,580
The villagers have put up with it because they have settled down here.

566
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,040
It will take more than words to ask them to leave.

567
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,420
What do we do, then?

568
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:36,660
It's your brother.

569
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,320
- I...
- Stop arguing.

570
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,460
We have found one of the shards.

571
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,740
We need a place to stay and make our plans.

572
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,300
- Don't be afraid.
- Don't be afraid.

573
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:56,200
Why should I be afraid? Don't be afraid.

574
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:09,600
We can stay here.

575
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,980
Let's clean it up. We spend the night here.

576
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,340
So, what's the plan?

577
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:24,020
We pique its interest.

578
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,480
How?

579
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,020
Fiery Youqin wants to be the overlord of Yuewo Village.

580
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,180
I'll give him a hand.

581
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:35,400
We'll join hands with the evil-doer. That's my field of expertise.

582
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,300
I've been shackled by the Heavenly Rules for too long!

583
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,820
I can finally do as I please!

584
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:45,200
However, Qingheng and Ziwu could be a liability to our plan.

585
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,700
Tomorrow, you and I...

586
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:57,080
You and Qingheng will search for the other shards.

587
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,980
- But...
- You!

588
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:02,360
We are meeting the shard we found.

589
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,380
No.

590
00:37:07,720 --> 00:37:09,740
Hey, what's going on? Our clothes were burned.

591
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:11,560
Why aren't yours burned?

592
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,300
I used the Holy Fabric you gave me to forge this Armor of Protection.

593
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,860
The Holy Fabric impervious to heat?

594
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:23,400
- What?
- I am taking your clothes.

595
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,960
You can't take back what's given!

596
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,840
No! Stop it. You can't take it back.

597
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,960
- Give it here.
- No.
- Hand it over.
- No way!

598
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,400
Say, I should go with you tomorrow.

599
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:34,360
The fire demon recognizes none of us. It's dangerous.

600
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,120
Stop calling him a fire demon.

601
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,200
- Hand it over.
- Stop messing around!

602
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,240
You were calling him that a while ago.

603
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:42,420
She said to stop calling him that, so stop it.

604
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,860
Don't mess with me.

605
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:46,560
My bite can hurt a lot.

606
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,000
Give it here!

607
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,060
- Hey...
- Hand it here!

608
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:01,140
Just give it to me. I can't go near Fiery Youqin without this armor.

609
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,860
Don't cry. It just got better.

610
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,780
I told you so.

611
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:04,460
Your saintess is a lady of unmatched beauty.

612
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,000
Please don't.

613
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:13,620
How can I ever repay this kindness?

614
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,260
I've heard about your amazing healing skills.

615
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:19,600
Now I get to see it for myself.

616
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:20,960
I can do more than heal scars and swelling.

617
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:24,620
I have some ointment that makes the skin fairer.

618
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:28,060
This is a book of medicine I wrote.
<i>[Book of Medicine]</i>

619
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:32,500
It contains many ways for the voidwalkers to live a long and healthy life.

620
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,820
Your visit reminds me of something.

621
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:38,300
I should write these cosmetic techniques into the book!

622
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:40,700
That is a great idea!

623
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,820
You should write down some slimming and skincare recipes.

624
00:39:43,820 --> 00:39:45,700
I can publish it.

625
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,260
What do you think?

626
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,180
That sounds wonderful!

627
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,010
Stay still or get eaten.

628
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,910
Not bad.

629
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,410
Good.

630
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:32,270
No. Mad.
