If that's the case, why did you need to battle the Void Empress for my sake?

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,450
For your sake?

24
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:02,940
I came to Assassin Assembly Hall just to kill the second soul shard.

25
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,220
She has never been this heartbroken before.

It's all your fault! I'm going to take your life!

Stop!

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,570
He was the one who caused you to nearly lose your life in the Void Realm!

29
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:40,010
- I will never forgive him!
- Tan'er!

30
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,530
So, everything in the past was just a lie.

- We're here to protect you, not to inspire you.

Don't include me in your story.

Let's talk this over.

47
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,290
So you've...

48
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,780
come back.

49
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:35,130
You did do something silly, didn't you?

50
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,300
You still showed him mercy even though he used you like that.

51
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,480
He swapped the carriages. You almost died because of him.

52
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,360
How could you forgive him? What gives you the right to forgive him on my behalf?

53
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,810
Wait. I thought Dingyun was the one who swapped the carriages. Why is it Chaofeng now?

54
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:49,910
Tan'er, it's not that I forgave him just because I didn't kill him. It's...

55
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:53,980
What is it then? Old feelings die hard?

56
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,480
Sister Qingkui, don't be upset. She's that kind of person.

57
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,800
I'll talk to her. Wait here, okay?

58
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,140
Your Highness?

59
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:10,650
- Your Highness.
- What's wrong with her? Man Man?

60
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,950
What's wrong with her? Who offended her again?

61
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:15,970
It's a long story.

62
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,730
What are you staring at?

63
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,410
Your sister was deceived by Chaofeng.

64
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:27,270
She got married to the wrong person, and had her feelings cheated.

65
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,520
Do you think she feels great about it?

66
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,880
You only cared about yourself. How could you talk to her like that?

67
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,830
Are you even human?

68
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,280
Sister,

69
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,410
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,510
Don't cry.

71
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:09,690
I didn't say all those on purpose.

72
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,070
I just can't get over the fact that you let Chaofeng go.

73
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:16,650
Don't worry. I'll surely uphold justice for you.

74
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:20,680
If Father can't do anything about the Void Realm, we'll head to the Heavenly Realm then.

75
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,320
I'll come to Thunder Deity.

76
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,250
We'll ask him to kill Chaofeng with thunder strikes.

77
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,870
Tan'er, the empyrean hasn't been revived yet.

78
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:31,940
You must never mention the wrong instances of marriage.

79
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:36,370
If the Void Tyrant and Dingyun use it to disturb the peace of the four realms,

80
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,890
the third soul shard will be in danger.

81
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:44,630
Sister, when will you care for yourself?

82
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:48,840
Sister, you and Chaofeng...

83
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,220
Sister.

84
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,740
His longing and gentleness for me are fake.

85
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,920
However, as for all those near-death experiences, how could he fake them?

86
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,970
Tan'er, I'm sorry!

87
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,480
I've let you down again.

88
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:25,010
No, Sister. Not at all.

89
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:33,050
<i>So, deceiving one's feelings can actually hurt so much.</i>

90
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,560
<i>If the soul shards found out why I was protecting them,</i>

91
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:42,970
<i>would they also be heartbroken, just like sister?</i>

92
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,060
Sister, don't worry.

93
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:06,150
I'll surely do my best to revive Shaodian Youqin and end this as soon as possible.

94
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:14,000
Tell Di Lanjue to take sister to the Prince's Mansion after she wakes up.

95
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,740
Heartless is talkative. Sister has a pure heart.

96
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,980
It'll be troublesome if she found out why we came here.

97
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,920
- When should we depart then?
- Tomorrow.

98
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,240
Qingheng and us will split up and locate the last soul shard as soon as possible.

99
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,930
What should we do about Heartless then?

100
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:29,280
He just said that he was going to show you the new script.

101
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:32,240
I'll talk to him later.

102
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,430
I'm sure Money will like this.

103
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,420
Read it for me.

104
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,440
Money, come here. Hurry.

105
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:57,500
I've already written the love story between Heartless and Money.

106
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,570
- You made up a story already?
- It's not made up.

107
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:03,970
I just wrote down what happened between us. That's the best story.

108
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:09,230
You know what? I've already read this story to the troupe leader of the shadow play troupe.

109
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:11,490
He praised it non-stop after listening to my story.

110
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:14,000
He's also willing to spend a huge sum to buy the story.

111
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:18,420
After we get rich, we'll write new stories.

112
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,420
- One will come after the other.
- Heartless.

113
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,150
I need to be away for a moment due to certain issues.

114
00:09:24,150 --> 00:09:27,250
I'm afraid I cannot create new stories together with you.

115
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,580
H-How long will you be away?

116
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:34,010
Maybe for a short time. Maybe for a long time.

117
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,430
Don't be sad. I'll come back once I'm done.

118
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:57,640
Here.

119
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:08,560
Although I don't know the details, I know you will never let me down.

120
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,260
This is how much I've earned from writing scripts.

121
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,710
We can be thrifty at home, but you need money for your trip.

122
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:16,160
You can take them.

123
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,020
Do you truly believe me?

124
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:21,020
Of course. Don't worry.

125
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,600
After you leave, I'll stay here to write scripts.

126
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:28,100
The previous wedding had made you upset, right? I promise you this.

127
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:31,790
When you come back, I'll definitely hold a sincere wedding for you.

128
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:34,820
What do you think?

129
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,290
Come.

130
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,950
Promise me. Return soon.

131
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:57,860
He still has a fever.

132
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:07,010
Sir. Sir.

133
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,510
Be careful. Be careful.

134
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,120
You... What's wrong?

135
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,230
Why are you resting outside Tan'er's room when you're injured?

136
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:30,320
Actually, that princess wasn't Yetan.

137
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,220
It was Qingkui.

138
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,260
This...

139
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,620
Due to my selfish desires, I swapped their carriages.

140
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,920
That's how everything happened.

141
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,350
You!

142
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:52,980
It's no wonder I thought she looked elegant and was different from what I'd heard.

143
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,520
Great.

144
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:02,650
Now, I can't even kill a soul shard, not to mention going against Yingzhao.

145
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:04,920
If Kui'er follows me, she'll only be implicated.

146
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,850
She won't need to endure all of this once Shaodian Youqin is revived.

147
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,370
I'm afraid they won't be able to revive Shaodian Youqin.

148
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:18,520
The Void Empress and Dingyun had recruited every man they could find to search the Beast Realm for the soul shard.

149
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:23,700
I'm afraid Her Highness, Di Lanjue, and the rest won't be able to stop them.

150
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,160
Aren't you eating?

151
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:44,330
Of course, I'm eating.

152
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:46,030
I'm a human.

153
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:48,310
I don't have powers like you all.

154
00:12:48,310 --> 00:12:50,160
I'm starving to death.

155
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,270
But I don't feel like walking at all.

156
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,720
You, go and buy some food for me.

157
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,030
For two or three?

158
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,640
Of course, it's for three.

159
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,840
There's Qingheng as well.

160
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,540
Wait.

161
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:04,810
Where's Qingheng?

162
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,890
Didn't he say he would regroup with us after searching the eastern city?

163
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:11,600
You're right. Logically speaking, he should've returned by now.

164
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,920
Don't tell me that fool got lost.

165
00:13:15,650 --> 00:13:18,312
Mister, pick one.

166
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:28,070
Ladies, a new batch of calligraphy and paintings will arrive soon.

167
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,950
You can come and choose them by then.

168
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:32,050
Sure. I'll come back next time.
<i>[House of Colors]</i>

169
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:33,150
All right.

170
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,600
I'll see you guys off.

171
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:36,290
Okay.

172
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,990
Miss, your painting.

173
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,040
Okay. Thank you.

174
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,620
Take care.

175
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,590
Sir!

176
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,470
Waiter, get me a bowl of noodles.

177
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:49,670
All right, sir. Please wait a moment.

178
00:13:49,670 --> 00:13:52,390
This place is known as the House of Colors.

179
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:54,250
It isn't an ordinary restaurant.

180
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,820
Usually, we sell more than just food.

181
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,340
We also sell calligraphy and paintings.

182
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:01,290
Literati also hold their gatherings here.

183
00:14:01,290 --> 00:14:05,150
You can take a look at them if you're interested.

184
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,860
Please take a look.

185
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:22,010
<i>Wait, isn't that lady holding the Silver Moon Cypress Branch, a magic item from the Heavenly Realm?</i>

186
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:25,340
<i>This back also resembles Sister-in-law greatly.</i>

187
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,100
Who created this painting?

188
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,420
This painting was created by my young master.

189
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,610
Sir, do you intend to buy it?

190
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:35,320
I'll take it. Besides that, I need you to do me another favor.

191
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:38,550
I thought you said you ran out of energy.

192
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:41,200
Why are you trying to find Qingheng?

193
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:44,050
He hasn't returned even though time's up.

194
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:45,640
Maybe the voidwalkers are targeting him.

195
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,150
- Sister-in-law!
- I'm worried about him.

196
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,820
- He's fine.
- Sister-in-law!

197
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:51,210
- You're back?
- Sister-in-law!

198
00:14:51,210 --> 00:14:53,140
We were so worried about you.

199
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,260
So you actually came back late just to buy this painting?

200
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:57,070
Sister-in-law, calm down.

201
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,370
Look at this.

202
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,990
That back resembles you greatly!

203
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:06,110
And the cypress stick.

204
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,760
Wasn't this the one you gave to the empyrean after that night?

205
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,110
Where did you find this painting?

206
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:12,120
Who drew it? And where is he?

207
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,790
Sister-in-law, calm down.

208
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,370
The one who drew this painting is called Wen Ren.

209
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:16,670
He's a painter.

210
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,860
He owns the House of Colors, where he sells calligraphy and paintings.

211
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,470
However, he wasn't in the shop today.

212
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:24,250
According to the waiter, he'll head to Mount Linglong tomorrow to draw paintings.

213
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,820
Okay.

214
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:27,900
Only a few people knew about the story of the cypress stick.

215
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:30,030
Could he be the third soul shard?

216
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,100
Rest early.

217
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,870
We'll head to Mount Linglong first thing in the morning tomorrow.

218
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:35,240
We mustn't miss out on him.

219
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,460
That's him!

220
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:22,240
We found the third soul shard!

221
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,480
My Iridescent Eyes can finally be removed soon!

222
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,780
Hurry. Tell them to ready themselves.

223
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,370
I never expected the third soul shard to be a gentleman.

224
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:39,960
Qingkui, you should go and meet him.

225
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,120
Look at him.

226
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,140
He's great at drawing, and he's good-looking too.

227
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:47,680
I assume he cares a lot about a woman's appearance.

228
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,130
You see, my face is injured.

229
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:54,480
Why don't I doll myself up and meet him after my injury has recovered?

230
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,300
Sister-in-law...

231
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:11,700
Miss, you...

232
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:18,380
Mister, you look graceful.

233
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,940
I couldn't help but notice you.

234
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,740
Sorry for the interruption.

235
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,860
<i>This is our first encounter.</i>

236
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,680
<i>I mustn't scare him away because of my face injury.</i>

237
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,500
Miss.

238
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,010
Don't move.

239
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,150
All done.

240
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,440
Look.

241
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:37,960
From now on, miss, you don't need to hide away.

242
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:42,470
<i>Both Fiery and Heartless were hard to approach in the beginning.</i>

243
00:18:42,470 --> 00:18:46,760
<i>However, the last soul shard is so gentle and considerate.</i>

244
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,490
Mister, why are you staring at me?

245
00:18:50,490 --> 00:18:52,870
Sorry about that.

246
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,190
I thought...

247
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:58,890
Forget it.

248
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:04,380
If I tell you about it, you may think that I'm an impetuous person.

249
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,810
Mister, why don't you tell me about it?

250
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,540
All this while, I was plagued by a dream.

251
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:14,070
In my dream, there was a lady whom I fell for.

252
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,700
She felt ephemeral to me.

253
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:19,200
However, I could never reach her.

254
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:25,730
Miss, when I saw you, I felt like you resembled the lady in my dream greatly.

255
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:29,050
That's why I couldn't help but stare at you.

256
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:32,790
<i>So, his dream contains shards of Heartless Shaodian's memories.</i>

257
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,870
<i>It's no wonder he drew that painting.</i>

258
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,310
<i>If I'm truly the lover in his dream, it'll be a piece of cake to win his heart.</i>

259
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:42,500
Miss, do you not believe me?

260
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:44,190
I do.

261
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,970
I am Wen Ren.

262
00:19:47,970 --> 00:19:51,200
I established a restaurant called the House of Colors in the Beast Realm.

263
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,940
It's a place for literati to gather.

264
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,610
Miss, may I know your name?

265
00:19:57,910 --> 00:20:00,080
My name is pretty boorish.

266
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,480
Mister, why don't you give me a name?

267
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,130
Miss, you flatter me.

268
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:06,260
If that's the case,

269
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:10,320
what do you think about the name Yuexia?

270
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,740
Yuexia?

271
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,400
Precisely.

272
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,450
"Rowing on the West Lake under the moonlight,

273
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:20,710
getting drunk restlessly among the sea of flowers."

274
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:24,910
Since ancient times, many poems were born due to one's appreciation for the moon.

275
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:29,620
And I draw inspiration from the moon for most of my paintings.

276
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:32,700
<i>So, Heartless Shaodian has an artistic side to him too.</i>

277
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,430
That name sounds great. You can call me that then.

278
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:36,820
All right.

279
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:41,970
Miss Yuexia, are you willing to admire the moon together with me tonight?

280
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:06,675
<i>[House of Colors]</i>

281
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,500
Yuexia, I'm done.

282
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,590
You're done?

283
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:24,290
Take a look.

284
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,440
<i>I never knew Heartless Shaodian could draw so well.</i>

285
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,730
It looks gorgeous.

286
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:33,070
Aren't you going to recite a poem?

287
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,010
Naturally, I must.

288
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:41,960
"Staring at the flower tree, a child, sleeping under the moonlight with glee.

289
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:48,720
As one abandons his conscience, the sun sets beside the rabbit."

290
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:52,690
What kind of weird poem is that?

291
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,750
Each line corresponds to a single word.

292
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:00,680
Here, hold this.

293
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:15,190
<i>Staring at the flower tree, a child, sleeping under the moonlight with glee.</i>

294
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:21,740
<i>As one abandons his conscience, the sun sets beside the rabbit.</i>

295
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,100
<i>[If Only We Met Earlier]</i>

296
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:45,300
Here.

297
00:22:47,950 --> 00:22:55,270
People bestow willow branches to others during farewells as a symbol of longing.

298
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:03,010
Today, the cypress stick I've given to you represents a different meaning.

299
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:04,260
Cypress tree is evergreen.

300
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,730
Yuexia, I hope you can stay by my side for long.

301
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:09,660
We have already encountered each other late.

302
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:13,060
May we never part with each other again.

303
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,230
<i>Heartless Shaodan, which side of you is this?</i>

304
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:23,300
<i>You're so good at stirring my heart.</i>

305
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:30,290
You must've been exhausted. You stood for a long time.

306
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:32,500
Sit down and take a break.

307
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,780
Yuexia.

308
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,450
You're very good-looking.

309
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,090
<i>Why does that sound so familiar?</i>

310
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:21,120
<i>The heavenly guards only acknowledge the owners of the token.</i>

311
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,160
<i>It cannot be used by people other than their owners.</i>

312
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,670
<i>Look at you.</i>

313
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:31,830
<i>Look at you. How could</i>

314
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:37,350
<i>you look so handsome?</i>

315
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:41,990
<i>So, he's the soul shard Heartless Shaodian had fragmented on the night I consumed the fruit of taboo.</i>

316

00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:19,890
He attempted something indecent tonight. I turned him into a walnut.

00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,600
you haven't taken dinner yet.

478
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:30,900
Rock, finish it soon.

479
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,700
When will my wife return?

480
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,800
I'm sure she's busy with her tasks.

481
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
She'll definitely come back for you once she's done.

482
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:46,600
I miss her.

483
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,600
I know.

484
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,700
Even if you try not to think about it,

485
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:01,200
he'll appear in your mind automatically.

486
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,100
You have someone you long for too?

487
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,000
Here.

488
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:31,400
Carve a flower for him.

489
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,700
You're the sister of my wife.

490
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:38,200
I will help you.

491
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,800
Thank you.

492
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,900
But one is enough.

493
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,400
I'll ask you for more after I master this, okay?

494
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,600
Let's take dinner then.

495
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,500
If not, your wife will be worried.

496
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,800
The number of voidwalkers is rising in the Beast Realm.

497
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,000
Even the Void Empress is here.

498
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,400
Yeah. His Highness told us to report their movements in Void to him.

499
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,100
But we don't even know where he is.

500
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,200
Fiery, you must eat up.

501
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,400
Your wife will be happy if she knows.

502
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,200
I don't know how that unlucky guy offended the voidwalkers.

503
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,400
Right now, they've sealed off the entire Assassin Assembly Hall.

504
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,800
Even the Beast King is pretending to be ignorant.

505
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,600
He allowed the Void Empress to get her way.

506
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:35,300
I wonder why His Highness is paying great attention to this matter.

507
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,400
Since when have we been able to figure His Highness out?

508
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,500
Forget it.

509
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,100
Let's just do our duty and protect His Highness's friend.

510
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:43,100
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

511
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:49,900
<i>If they keep this up, the Void Empress will locate Heartless soon.</i>

512
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,100
<i>I have to notify Tan'er.</i>

513
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,100
<i>However, Tan'er is trying her best to locate the last soul shard.</i>

514
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,900
<i>I mustn't distract her.</i>

515
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:04,100
<i>I need to come up with a way to protect Heartless on her behalf.</i>

516
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,400
We only lack one more soul shard.

517
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,700
The empyrean will be revived soon.

518
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,800
Two heads are better than one.

519
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,400
You all should try to come up with something.

520
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:14,400
This is the last soul shard.

521
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,200
I don't believe that we cannot subdue him.

522
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,100
Although this soul shard is a womanizer, he doesn't breathe fire or spend our money.

523
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:26,500
We just need to find a way to make him fall for you.

524
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,600
We can learn from the books.
<i>[How to Train Your Husband]</i>

525
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:36,300
We can also observe the couples in the market and learn from them.

526
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,800
Read books?

527
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,700
Learn from them?

528
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,800
I need to see him tomorrow. You think I can apply what I've learned immediately?

529
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:51,100
Di Lanjue, do you have any good ideas?

530
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:57,400
If I must say, you should just smash him with my mace until he says yes.

531
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,600
What are you doing?

532
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
Let go. I'll punch you.

533
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,000
Give it to me!

534
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,200
- Silly bird!
- Don't move!

535
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,100
Your Highness, you brought so many things here.

536
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,300
I'm sure one of them will come in handy.

537
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,200
This?

538
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Be gentle with them!

539
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,000
What about this one?

540
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,000
Four people will definitely come up with more ideas compared to one person.

541
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,400
Here, cheers.

542
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,600
Come.

543
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,200
All right.

544
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,500
Since you insist on doing it, tomorrow, I'll apply everything that I've learned before.

545
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,600
Cheers.

546
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Here, cheers.

547
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:11,900
Wish me luck.

548
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,300
Yuexia.

549
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:28,600
I prepared these for you.

550
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,000
Do you like them?

551
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,600
I do.

552
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,100
Have you ever played tug of war?

553
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:46,200
Tug of what?

554
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,800
You've never played tug of war before?

555
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,100
Each of us will pull one side.

556
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,500
The one who tears the leaf loses.

557
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,800
That leaf won't do.

558
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,600
You need to pick a withered one.

559
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:03,800
Di Lanjue taught me to put this leaf into my shoes and ferment it with my sweat for some hours.

560
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,400
This way, I'll win every game.

561
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,800
What did she say again?

562
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,400
What did she say?

563
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,900
Sweat?

564
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:21,500
What have you been teaching her all this while?

565
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:24,400
How should I know that she's trying to flirt with him with her usual demeanor?

566
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:25,300
Enough.

567
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,000
Let's stick with the original plan.

568
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,700
Man Man, it's your turn.

569
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,700
Look at me.

570
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,800
When I'm happy, I get ahead of myself.

571
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm a lady too.

572
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,000
How could I play with such a thing?

573
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,000
Miss Yuexia, are you sick?

574
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,500
Mister.

575
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:05,800
Mister,

576
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,000
I have a sore waist.

577
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:21,800
Where did he learn all this nonsense from?

578
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,400
Go away.

579
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,200
<i>What exactly are they doing?</i>

580
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,400
Di Lanjue!

581
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,600
This won't work.

582
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,400
- That was so inappropriate.
- I...

583
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,200
At this rate, she will never win his heart.

584
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,100
Let's try someone else, okay?

585
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,900
Eldest Brother wouldn't be attracted by a person like you.

586
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,800
Let me do it.

587
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,000
Eldest Brother.

588
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,200
Yuexia.

589
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,800
What did you call me just now?

590
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,100
How could you call him Eldest Brother?

591
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:57,500
You need to call him, "Sweetie."

592
00:41:58,800 --> 00:41:59,800
Sweetie.

593
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:01,100
Sweetie.

594
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,100
You have to act cuter.

595
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,700
Do it like this.

596
00:42:09,600 --> 00:42:10,400
Sweetie.

597
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,100
Sweetie.

598
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:14,100
- That's not right.
- That's not right.

599
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,600
- Sweetie.
- Sweetie.

600
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:19,400
- Sweetie.
- Sweetie.

601
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,600
Sweetie...

602
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,400
Sweetie.

603
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:26,300
Yuexia, I've never seen a lady as unique as you before.

604
00:42:26,300 --> 00:42:29,500
<i>Wait. What trick are they playing?</i>

605
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:34,300
Brother Wen Ren, I agreed to meet you today just so I could ask you this question.

606
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:38,400
How much feeling do you have for me?
