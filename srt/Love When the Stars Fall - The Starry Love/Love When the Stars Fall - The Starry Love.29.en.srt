20
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:02,140
Everything is set. Imperial Qingheng, you could have let the immortal servants send them here.

21
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:04,590
There is no need to come in person.

22
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,470
I need your advice on certain matters.

23
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,720
Do tell.

24
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,930
After my brother mended Guixu, will there never be any anomaly again?

25
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:20,660
Given Empyrean Xuanshang's power, after Guixu was sealed off,

26
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:23,920
there shouldn't be any anomaly.

27
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:27,010
You need not be concerned.

28
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,623
What if...

29
00:02:30,770 --> 00:02:34,420
What if the people of Dongqiu appear?

30
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,880
What... What made you say that?

31
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,110
The Dongqiu used the power of the Ganoderma Vein to wreak havoc.

32
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,610
They were eliminated by the four realms.

33
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:44,990
It's impossible there are any of them left.

34
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:49,560
But I... I heard rumors from some old deities.

35
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,480
Dongqiu and the Ganoderma Vein never sought to destroy the world.

36
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,330
They were eliminated because the four realms feared them.

37
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:01,770
In that case, shouldn't the four realms clear Dongqiu's name?

38
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:05,620
If there is a survivor, she deserves kindness from the four realms.

39
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,140
Who told you that?

40
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,490
I went through some old scrolls and came up with this theory.

41
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:15,000
I've been wondering.

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,190
If celestial father knows about this, will he agree with me?

43
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,820
You are right.

44
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:25,310
The four realms' kings of yore owe Dongqiu an apology.

45
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,490
I wish I didn't have to do it back then.

46
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,200
But the story with Dongqiu has been decided.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,690
If any of its survivors show up, His Majesty will hunt them down.

48
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:39,680
He will not clear their name.

49
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:45,000
Immortal Qingheng. Do not mention this matter to His Majesty.

50
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,290
You are right.

51
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:49,070
I should've thought it through.

52
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,260
<i>If so, I'll reward you with a gentler Yetan</i>

53
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,440
<i>for breaking through ordeals fearlessly for me.</i>

54
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,973
<i>Sure.</i>

55
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:35,973
Your Highness? Your Highness?

56
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:38,100
Your Highness!

57
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,530
- What brings you here?
- I've been calling your name, but you never answered.

58
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:44,300
I doubt I could have got your attention with the delicious snacks.

59
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:49,690
Judging by the look of it, are you thinking about Empyrean Xuanshang?

60
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:55,820
The servant from Tianpa Hall told me he came here every day to spend some time with you.

61
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:01,610
I only hope that your love for him doesn't go unanswered.

62
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,690
Don't worry. I won't let him get away.

63
00:05:04,690 --> 00:05:10,470
<i>Perhaps keeping you in the dark is what's best for you.</i>

64
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,580
What is this snack made of?

65
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,290
It's different from before.

66
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:17,050
I asked the immortal servant who casts rains on the Mortal Realm to get these for me.

67
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,610
I wanted you to try them out.

68
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,730
That's very nice of you.

69
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,660
I'm only returning the kindness.

70
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:25,000
Without you, I wouldn't have made it this far.

71
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,633
So...

72
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:31,320
Whatever may come, I will always stand by you.

73
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,840
This is delicious. Try it out.

74
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,963
Do you like it?

75
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:59,040
Your Highness. Immortal Yunlong says the Honey Fruits that only bear fruit every 3,000 years are ripe.

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,540
Penglai Hall was assigned 20 fruits.

77
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,080
He asked us to get them.

78
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,000
The fruits that only bear fruit every 3,000 years?

79
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,900
Can the fruits increase one's power?

80
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,640
- This fruit looks unique.
- Right. Honey Fruits.

81
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,830
<i>Honey Fruits!</i>

82
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,100
It is!

83
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,840
Like so.

84
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,340
<i>It smells so good.</i>

85
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:20,073
It's the same.

86
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:28,143
Ziwu.

87
00:06:28,143 --> 00:06:30,130
Are those Honey Fruits?

88
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,130
Yes.

89
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:33,490
I thought the fruit was rare and precious.

90
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,340
Why does everyone have one?

91
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,610
My brother was kind enough to give every student one.

92
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,860
Sister-in-law.

93
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,980
Maybe we got rewarded thanks to you.

94
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,860
<i>That day, I didn't really mean it when I asked.</i>

95
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,150
<i>But he took it to heart.</i>

96
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:50,470
Help yourself with it, then.

97
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,980
Where is yours?

98
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,640
I got too excited and finished mine in one go.

99
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,420
I barely tasted its flavor.

100
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:01,793
Your Highness.

101
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:04,000
You can have my Honey Fruit.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,833
Do you mean it?

103
00:07:05,833 --> 00:07:10,840
If you are willing to be my friend, I'm willing to give you my Honey Fruit.

104
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,330
- Thank you.
- Get lost!

105
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:14,820
Who cares about your Honey Fruits?

106
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,080
- What is wrong with him?
- What was that about?

107
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,520
What's wrong with you?

108
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,600
Was a Honey Fruit enough to please you?

109
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,930
They wanted to give me their fruits, what's wrong with that?

110
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:26,900
How could you not tell?

111
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:30,200
These people only approached you because you are the princess of the immortals.

112
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,560
They have an ulterior motive.

113
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,080
Who are you to decide whether they meant well or not?

114
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,700
See? She disregarded my kindness.

115
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,300
I bet you're the kind who gets deceived and still defends the bad guy.

116
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,940
You...

117
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,940
Sister-in-law. Is he always so rude when he talks to you?

118
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,600
No way.

119
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,940
He doesn't care who tries to approach me.

120
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,340
He doesn't want anyone else to be too close to you.

121
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,800
Heed my advice.

122
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,080
Go for it if you love it.

123
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,300
Being jealous doesn't do any good.

124
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,920
I'm going to collect my Honey Fruit!

125
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,953
Sister-in-law!

126
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,393
So...

127
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:13,940
Don't take her words to heart.

128
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:17,060
I know it's not what you mean.

129
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:26,133
What if she is right?

130
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,940
Reverend Master Tuiyun. I'm here to get my fruit.

131
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:40,340
Princess Qingkui.

132
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,973
Well...

133
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,440
Sorry.

134
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,860
We ran out of the Honey Fruits.

135
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:49,360
There's nothing left?

136
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,440
I thought every student of Shangshu Academy gets one.

137
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,820
Well... I didn't decide how many Honey Fruits we could get.

138
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,180
How should I know?

139
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,600
Reverend Master, we are here to collect our fruits.

140
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,480
Train hard.

141
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,600
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

142
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,960
You said there were no fruits left.

143
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,220
Hear me out.

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:23,760
These two were reserved for students who are beginners.

145
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,200
It's for them to hone their powers.

146
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,020
Princess Qingkui. You will soon become the Empyrean Consort. Right?

147
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:34,300
You must learn to be tolerant.

148
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,820
Reverend Master, we are here for our fruits.

149
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,480
One for each of you.

150
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,900
Train well.

151
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,920
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

152
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,900
What was that about?

153
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:50,180
They got outstanding results. See?

154
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,420
With the fruits to bolster their strength, they might even become

155
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,840
the future pillars of the Heavenly Realm.

156
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,400
I am good at studying, too.

157
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:00,320
Last time, I almost got a Tier One result in the evaluation test of Shangshu Academy.

158
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,920
You almost got it, but you never got it. Right?

159
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,000
The path of training is full of obstacles.

160
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,540
To have any notable accomplishment, you need more than talking back at your teacher with witty words.

161
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,060
Isn't... Isn't that right?

162
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,900
<i>I'll make you suffer today.</i>

163
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,080
<i>If you dare use violence on a teacher, the whole realm will know.</i>

164
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,581
<i>You will never become the Empyrean Consort.</i>

165
00:10:25,581 --> 00:10:27,353
How about this?

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:32,050
We don't have any Honey Fruit left for you.

167
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,560
Perhaps I could make it up to you in another way.

168
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,993
What is it?

169
00:10:36,993 --> 00:10:38,660
I was told you were diligent at learning.

170
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,880
You have extra lessons with His Highness after school.

171
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:45,160
As the deputy dean of Shangshu Academy,

172
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:48,201
even though I do not possess His Highness' power,

173
00:10:48,201 --> 00:10:54,240
I can still show you a trick or two.

174
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,740
- Sister-in-law!
- Sister-in-law!

175
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:07,840
<i>Stay calm. Do not start a fight.</i>

176
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,880
<i>Nothing is more important than being with Youqin.</i>

177
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,800
- Sister-in-law.
- Are you hurt?

178
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,080
This is the Incitant Spell.

179
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,420
It's an offensive spell of the wind attribute.

180
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:22,540
It can bewitch an enemy and make them follow any order.

181
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:25,320
Princess. Did you learn anything?

182
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,200
That spell requires years of training.

183
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,980
You are much older and more powerful.

184
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,300
How dare you bully her!

185
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,600
He's right.

186
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,440
The human princess lacks training and basic skills.

187
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,320
She lacks the affinity to become a deity.

188
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,720
I was giving her guidance.

189
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,920
How was that bullying?

190
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,653
You...

191
00:11:42,653 --> 00:11:44,200
I lack the strength to resist it.

192
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,500
It's not Reverend Master Tuiyun's fault.

193
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,900
<i>She would have lost her temper.</i>

194
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,440
<i>What's wrong with her today?</i>

195
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,080
Thank you, Reverend Master Tuiyun.

196
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,980
I will heed your advice.

197
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:00,850
I'll cast away my arrogance and study hard to hone my skills.

198
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:02,233
Let's go.

199
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,360
Please wait.

200
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,890
I am going to teach you the entire mastery of the Incitant Spell.

201
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,920
I haven't finished it.

202
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,420
Why are you leaving?

203
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,193
Behold!

204
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,533
Sister-in-law.

205
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:52,980
<i>Oh no. What is he doing here?</i>

206
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,700
I'm all right.

207
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,670
Reverend Master Tuiyun was teaching me a spell.

208
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,100
Yes.

209
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:15,320
I was merely teaching Princess Qingkui the essential steps.

210
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,510
Send Her Highness back.

211
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,980
Let's go, Sister-in-law.

212
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,760
Shangshu Academy is the greatest institution of learning for our kind.

213
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,460
Your kinsman, Tuiyun had the honor

214
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,400
of being accepted into Shangshu Academy and acting as the deputy dean.

215
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,460
He made the Xia clan proud.

216
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,720
Today, I take both of you here to have your training.

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:10,040
Witness Tuiyun's glory.

218
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:13,720
You shall stay here and learn from him.

219
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,453
Yes.

220
00:14:15,453 --> 00:14:17,660
- Yes.
- Let's go.

221
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:30,800
Thank you for looking after Her Highness while I was away.

222
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,110
Thank you for the lesson.

223
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:39,480
Your Highness... You... You don't have to be so polite.

224
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,760
You are the pride of the Xia clan.

225
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,130
I have high expectations for you.

226
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,050
I have some time to kill today.

227
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:52,300
I could teach you a lesson about spells.

228
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:58,013
So... What is the lesson about?

229
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:02,020
I learned a few informal techniques in the Mortal Realm.

230
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:04,140
I find them interesting.

231
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,500
Cousin, have mercy!

232
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:22,400
<i>Oh no. It's all over.</i>

233
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,040
Brother.

234
00:15:27,673 --> 00:15:29,213
I'm all right.

235
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:51,480
Kui'er. You brought Wu Dai and Jia Louluo to the place where we first opened up to each other.

236
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,950
Do you want to fix him up with her?

237
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:56,940
You call that opening up to each other?

238
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,720
I thought it was full of nonsense.

239
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,000
Can't you be quiet for once?

240
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,480
We can all see how the Saintess feels.

241
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,340
It's all up to the First Prince.

242
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,880
Tan Tan! Tan Tan!

243
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,513
Tan Tan!

244
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,873
Where is Tan Tan?

245
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,580
She will be here in a moment.

246
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,620
Please wait, Your Highness.

247
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,053
Good.

248
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:28,800
Tan Tan asked to meet me at the Star Observatory when she came back.

249
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,980
I bet she has come to her senses and sees my worth.

250
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:41,020
<i>I was told that he fell for Tan'er because of her knowledge of medicine.</i>

251
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,420
<i>To make him understand how I feel for him, </i>

252
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,760
<i>I must...</i>

253
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:55,220
- Your Highness. I...
- Why isn't Tan Tan...

254
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,320
I... I...

255
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,960
Why did you jab my Yun Meridian?

256
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:11,940
- Your Yun Meridian?
- That's right.

257
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,220
This is the Yun Meridian.

258
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,440
This is the Conceptual Vassal Meridian.

259
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,920
This is the Qihai Meridian.

260
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:21,440
The Yun Meridian is used to treat coughing, asthma, stuffed chest, and back pain.

261
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,320
But I don't have these symptoms.

262
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,070
Why did you jab me there?

263
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,320
I...

264
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:30,960
I get it. Do you like acupuncture as well?

265
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,360
Yes. Of course.

266
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,560
That is great.

267
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:38,460
After Tan Tan and I get married, I'll ask her to teach you.

268
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:42,060
According to Tan Tan, acupuncture requires precise control

269
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,040
of the acupuncture points... And the art of acupuncture...

270
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,760
The First Prince is dense beyond reason.

271
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:49,760
- He remembers acupuncture points, so why can't he think?
- And not all needles are the same.

272
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,860
There is a reason why Wu Dai hasn't been intimate with any woman over the millennia.

273
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:58,140
According to Tan Tan, the insertion depths of the needles have different effects.

274
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:02,680
For some points... Tan Tan also told me that the same acupuncture points

275
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,560
yield different effects for different body sizes and insertion depths.

276
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:08,300
- Tan Tan also said...
- Enough about Tan Tan!

277
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,040
Can't you talk about something else?

278
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,200
I'll tell you the truth.

279
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:14,520
I like you! I like you.

280
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,780
What did you say?

281
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,560
We are both from the Void.

282
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,031
I won't keep it a secret anymore.

283
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:34,740
I am telling you... that I like you!

284
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,880
♫ <i>Maybe our superstitious of love is sweet</i> ♫

285
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,160
♫ <i>Maybe our superstitious of love is sweet</i> ♫

286
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,080
We can either die together or grow old together.

287
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,300
♫ <i>I sink into your tender gaze like a river of love</i> ♫

288
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,880
Your Highness, what is your answer?

289
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:47,160
But... Stop... Stay away.

290
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,580
Stay away. Stay away.

291
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:53,920
- Is that a confession? She is clearly...
- She's threatening him.

292
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,840
It's such an eye-opener for me.

293
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,420
Women of the Void are so brave in their pursuit of love.

294
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,440
- I...
- I am the daughter of the Devil of Void.

295
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,460
Unlike Tan Tan, I don't know medicine or people.

296
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,660
I've made it very clear.

297
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,633
Life or death, let fate decide!

298
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,680
♫ <i>The pair of flowers in the starry sky is like you and me</i> ♫
♫ <i>They light up the whole sky</i> ♫

299
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:19,840
♫ <i>As our faces get closer, this parting becomes harder</i> ♫

300
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,140
♫ <i>We'll be each other's brightest stars</i> ♫

301
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,040
♫ <i>I'm on an adventure to find you in the sky</i> ♫

302
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,220
♫ <i>It's only worth it if I take the risk</i> ♫

303
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:27,920
♫ <i>We're at the edge of the sky</i> ♫

304
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,300
♫ <i>In this ocean of stars</i> ♫

305
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:31,340
♫ <i>I'll hold your hand in mine and we'll never fall</i> ♫

306
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:33,360
Meteor!

307
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:38,260
♫ <i>This brilliance of the pair of flowers is the promise of this night sky</i> ♫

308
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,693
He got scared.

309
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:53,300
The First Prince is a real man, indeed.

310
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,673
Sister.

311
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,813
In the end,

312
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,860
he still rejected me.

313
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,580
It's all right, Sister.

314
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,680
We can get him back for you.

315
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,633
No.

316
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,200
I'll do it myself.

317
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,573
Today, I must get an answer from him.

318
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:27,293
Sister...

319
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,393
Be gentle.

320
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,660
Princess Qingkui! Princess Qingkui!

321
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,530
Princess Qingkui!

322
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:52,480
Oh, my God. That looks awful.

323
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:58,080
Princess Qingkui. It was foolish of me to pick on you.

324
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,080
Could you... Could you forgive me?

325
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,860
You admit you did it on purpose?

326
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:04,100
Yes.

327
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,520
I will tell you the truth.

328
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:10,680
When we were giving out Honey Fruits, it was my idea not to save any for you.

329
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,460
A-And the Incitant Spell was meant to provoke you.

330
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,980
Why would you do that to me?

331
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:21,700
I... I wanted to take revenge on you for my sister.

332
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,000
Please be merciful.

333
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Please forgive me.

334
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:28,280
Forgive you? I am still bleeding!

335
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,660
Why would I forgive you? Fat chance!

336
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:35,220
His Highness says if I can't get your forgiveness, I'll...

337
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:38,460
I'll have to keep kneeling until you forgive me.

338
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,820
Immortal Yuanxia from my clan also made it clear.

339
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:44,000
If I don't get your forgiveness, I'll...

340
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,060
I'll be banished from the Xia clan!

341
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:51,340
Your Highness. How can I make it up to you?

342
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,090
Your Highness. Perhaps...

343
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:57,580
Please accept my kowtow as apologies!

344
00:21:57,580 --> 00:21:58,900
Your Highness!

345
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,600
Get up! Stop it.

346
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
Stop it. Stop!

347
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,380
- Stop this man.
- Let him be.

348
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,980
- Please forgive me.
- Keep it up.

349
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,880
Come on.

350
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:19,780
Your Highness. With all due respect, your action was a bit unacceptable.

351
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:23,560
- That spy Guangtian must be snitching on you to His Majesty.
- So be it!

352
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,440
Tuiyun was clearly giving her a hard time!

353
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,560
If his action goes unpunished, Her Highness will keep getting bullied!

354
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:32,860
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

355
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,320
The Xia clan plays an important role among our kind.

356
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,760
Youqin should know that.

357
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,300
How could he be so reckless?

358
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,810
How could he embarrass the Xia clan?

359
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:47,280
You've followed him for some time.

360
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:48,460
What do you think?

361
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,860
Until earlier today, I wasn't very sure.

362
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:54,480
But His Highness' behavior today was different from before.

363
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,380
Summon him.

364
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,760
I'll question him myself.

365
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,293
Yes.

366
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,393
Celestial Father.

367
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:28,160
Did you summon me because of what I did to Tuiyun?

368
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:32,800
Ever since you regained your original form and returned to the Heavenly Realm,

369
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:37,020
I always feel that you are different now.

370
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:49,080
I had cast away my desires to refine my Celestial Body and pacify Guixu.

371
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,880
Guixu has been sealed.

372
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,160
The four realms have peace.

373
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,280
I am no longer bound by duty.

374
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,280
Hence, I am different now.

375
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,300
Are you saying, since your work at Guixu is done,

376
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:04,110
you get to do whatever you please here?

377
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,120
Remember that you are my son.

378
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,840
You have a duty as the Empyrean.

379
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:14,660
There is peace and order in the Heavenly Realm because of your stern authority.

380
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:19,340
Our kind has the glory we have today because of your wholehearted devotion to public duty.

381
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:23,980
If you do as you please, there will be chaos in this realm.

382
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,900
I do wish you could live as your heart tells you.

383
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:43,100
But the Heavenly Realm needs its Empyrean Xuanshang.

384
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,700
Implant this Stake of Oblivion on you.

385
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:49,200
Forget your bizarre adventure as the soul shards.

386
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,700
Return to your former self.

387
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:56,233
In the future, I need you to succeed to the throne.

388
00:24:56,233 --> 00:25:02,320
You still refuse to believe that my memories as the soul shards don't hinder me from carrying out my duties.

389
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,460
Forgive my concerns.

390
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,260
This is for your own good.

391
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,873
For my own good?

392
00:25:12,873 --> 00:25:15,340
When have you ever cared about me?

393
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:18,120
When I was sent to Guixu?

394
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,840
When I cast away my desires?

395
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,820
Or at this moment?

396
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,920
You only smiled at me when you wanted something from me.

397
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:30,000
You want only the glory of the Heavenly Realm and to conquer the four realms.

398
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,700
Those are my duties as the Heavenly Emperor!

399
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,900
You shall do as I did!

400
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,260
I'd rather forsake the throne!

401
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,093
Insolence!

402
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,960
Youqin, do you know what you just said?

403
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,640
You are not thinking straight!

404
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,080
Implant this Stake of Oblivion.

405
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,080
Our argument today

406
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
shall be overlooked.

407
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,960
I want to retain my memories!

408
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,160
You want your memories so that you and Princess Qingkui

409
00:25:55,601 --> 00:25:58,240
can be together and continue to love each other.

410
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,073
Yes!

411
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:07,620
Celestial Father, you lecture me over my duties.

412
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:09,853
I understand.

413
00:26:09,853 --> 00:26:14,010
But after I was resurrected with my desires, I had an ulterior motive.

414
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:19,850
I am asking for your permission to resign from the position of Empyrean Xuanshang.

415
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:22,820
That is a serious matter!

416
00:26:22,820 --> 00:26:24,140
Celestial Father.

417
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:26,540
I've made up my mind.

418
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,860
I went to Guixu for an inspection.

419
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,920
The seal showed no sign of deteriorating.

420
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:35,380
Qingheng is an adult. He can hold his own.

421
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,320
You may make Qingheng the next Empyrean.

422
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,880
I may not be an Empyrean anymore, but the blood of the immortals runs in me.

423
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,840
I will defend the Heavenly Realm with my life.

424
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,580
Please grant me permission.

425
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,480
Outrageous!

426
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,773
Guangtian.

427
00:26:50,773 --> 00:26:52,100
Yes.

428
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,600
Detain Empyrean Xuanshang in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice until he comes to his senses!

429
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,380
Your Majesty. Please reconsider.

430
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,680
Are you disobeying me too?

431
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,773
I wouldn't dare.

432
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,860
I know the way!

433
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:33,300
Your Majesty. Yetan conspired with the immortals and got Dingyun killed.
<i>[Memorial of Dingyun]</i>

434
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,660
They are living a high life in the Void, unpunished.

435
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:40,140
What do we do?

436
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,600
Chaofeng...

437
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,213
Yetan...

438
00:27:43,213 --> 00:27:44,673
Qingkui...

439
00:27:44,673 --> 00:27:46,980
Shaodian Youqin...

440
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:50,110
They will all pay for my son's death.

441
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:54,880
Chaofeng is without his powers. I'll order to have him killed now.

442
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:59,873
Killing him won't be enough to quench my hatred.

443
00:27:59,873 --> 00:28:02,500
Your Majesty has other plans?

444
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,440
Yetan is the crown princess.

445
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,020
Of course, she must marry the crown prince.

446
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,320
If I help Wu Dai become the crown prince,

447
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,380
Chaofeng will turn the realm upside-down for his lover.

448
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,650
His Majesty will have to execute this brat whether he wants it

449
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:29,320
or not.

450
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,040
Wu Dai, show yourself!

451
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:35,400
Wu Dai, did you hear me?

452
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,693
Show yourself!

453
00:28:36,693 --> 00:28:38,593
Wu Dai!

454
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,940
Your Highness. Your Highness?

455
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:43,573
Over here.

456
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:46,960
- Well? Has Jia Louluo left?
- No.

457
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,840
If you don't talk to her now, she will tear this tent apart.

458
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,560
What should I tell her?

459
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,720
She can try, but I'm going nowhere.

460
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,480
She is terrifying.

461
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,460
Wu Dai! Come out!

462
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,400
- Wu Dai!
- I'm not going out!

463
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,200
I'm a man of my word!

464
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,300
I won't go out no matter what!

465
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,540
She only wants to marry you. What's wrong with you?

466
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:09,120
We've been to countless battles. Were we ever scared?

467
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,820
What do you know?

468
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:13,540
Dealing with a woman in love is harder than fighting the Heavenly Army!

469
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,780
It's written in the book.

470
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:17,520
The best plan is to escape.
<i>[Art of War, Book of Womanly Piety]</i>

471
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,360
Book? Stop reading these human books.

472
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:21,593
Wu Dai!

473
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:23,400
Wu Dai! Come out!

474
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,760
Wu Dai! Come out!

475
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:30,973
Your Majesty.

476
00:29:36,707 --> 00:29:38,241
Judging by the decor...

477
00:29:38,241 --> 00:29:41,720
- Your Majesty.
- You really are head over heels for Yetan.

478
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,560
Wu Dai!

479
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,580
Do you want to marry me or fight me?

480
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,760
I must get your answer today!

481
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,960
You... Your Majesty. You are the Tribe Mother of the Snake clan.

482
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,780
Are you here to save me from this predicament?

483
00:29:56,780 --> 00:30:02,360
If you work with me, I guarantee you get to marry Tan Tan.

484
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:06,560
Then, Jia Louluo will give up on you.

485
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,640
Do you mean it?

486
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,273
Of course.

487
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,600
Empyrean Xuanshang, was it necessary?

488
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,800
You could have just agreed with His Majesty.

489
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,100
I leave the rest to you.

490
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,400
Why must you ruffle His Majesty's feather over something so trivial?

491
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,900
I am the cause. I can talk to His Majesty.

492
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,900
I can apologize to Tuiyun or kowtow to him.

493
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,800
I'll ask him to release Youqin.

494
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,900
Your Highness. His Highness ordered us not to let you do anything reckless.
<i>[Heavenly Ministry of Justice]</i>

495
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,200
He will talk to you after his release.

496
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,800
How long is it going to take?

497
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:43,200
If you go to His Majesty, it will only infuriate him even more.

498
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,200
Only someone who can persuade His Majesty.

499
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,800
- The Heavenly Empress!
- The Heavenly Empress!

500
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,000
I bet Her Majesty is even more worried than we are.

501
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,000
It's her son in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice. She won't just sit by and do nothing.

502
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:02,200
The only thing we can do now is to wait for her to convince His Majesty.

503
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:08,600
However, things could be complicated if His Highness insists on resigning.

504
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,700
He even sorted out all the official documents and asked me to pass them to Immortal Qingheng.

505
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,500
He made up his mind a long time ago.

506
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,400
But...

507
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,900
But I don't get it.

508
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:23,800
Why would he go to this extent for his memories as the soul shards?

509
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,500
Fine.

510
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,400
All of you are disobeying me.

511
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:47,600
All right. I didn't detain him in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice

512
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,700
because he wouldn't get rid of the memories.

513
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:57,600
It's because he insisted on resigning from his duties as Empyrean Xuanshang

514
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,800
and resurrected from his desires.

515
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,000
I am worried that he is no longer the Empyrean Xuanshang we all knew.

516
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,800
Guangtian has been keeping an eye on him.

517
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:15,000
He hasn't noticed any unusual behavior.

518
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,300
It was a relief to know that.

519
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,800
But today, he beat up Tuiyun in front of the elder of the Xia clan.

520
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,200
If that was enough to make him lose his mind,

521
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,000
I thought...

522
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:33,100
I could give him a lesson and keep him in check.

523
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:34,700
But what did he do?

524
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,800
He was wayward beyond reason!

525
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,600
If this goes on, people won't obey him, he will fail in his duties.

526
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,100
I'd rather see him this way.

527
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,000
What makes you say that?

528
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:49,500
He cast away his desires for the sake of training.

529
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,100
He felt distant even to me.

530
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,400
Do you know how much that hurt me?

531
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:56,200
Now he finally shows some emotions.

532
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,500
He no longer suppresses them.

533
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,400
He's not as distant as before.

534
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,700
But you are pushing him away once again!

535
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Fine, I get it.

536
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:17,200
I'll keep him detained for seven days until he reflects on his mistake.

537
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:20,600
I won't force him to wipe his memories.

538
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
However, I need a favor from you.

539
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,700
I need you to convince him not to speak out of spite again.

540
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,000
This realm needs Empyrean Xuanshang.

541
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,400
If he ever brings up his resignation, I won't forgive him as easily.

542
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,500
The same goes for you, do not speak out of spite again.

543
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,700
Youqin!

544
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,700
Youqin!

545
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,500
Did that fool you?

546
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,200
How are you in the mood to play here?

547
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:16,400
Did His Majesty say anything?

548
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,500
Celestial Mother came by.

549
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,700
Celestial Father eventually gave in.

550
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,600
I can leave in seven days.

551
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,400
Your father is crueler than mine.

552
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,100
How could he lock you in this freezing cage?

553
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,900
Celestial Father keeps me here as a small lesson.

554
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,100
But you should not stay here.

555
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,600
I'm not done talking to you. And you're asking me to leave?

556
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:03,000
Do you still feel cold?

557
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,700
Tell me something.

558
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,600
What is it?

559
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,900
You must be honest.

560
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:14,200
If you tell even the smallest lie, you will stay single forever.

561
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,700
That's a bit harsh.

562
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,700
What is it?

563
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:19,500
Why did you resign?

564
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,200
As you said, you wanted me to stop hurting myself.

565
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,800
I suffered the pain from my training to cast away my desires.

566
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,600
I was tortured by Guixu's destruction.

567
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,100
But compared to not remembering you, these are insignificant.

568
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,000
That's all?

569
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,500
Isn't that enough?

570
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:46,100
You're worried they might learn the truth about the wedding.

571
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:51,100
If you weren't the Heavenly Emperor or Empyrean Xuanshang, there is still hope for us.

572
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Otherwise, it's the end of the road.

573
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,600
You did it for me, am I right?

574
00:36:56,600 --> 00:37:00,700
What? Are you coveting the position of the Empyrean Consort?

575
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,700
You're right. It'd be a shame not to be one.

576
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:09,100
I remember someone who tried to escape when she came to this realm.

577
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,200
Since I can't get away, I'll never leave you again whether we're in the Heavenly Realm or the Void Realm.

578
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,500
You won't get away either.

579
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:19,200
Fine.

580
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Come on.

581
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,800
Look.

582
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,000
A fiery firework show just for you.

583
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,700
Do you remember that?

584
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:51,600
Sit.

585
00:37:57,300 --> 00:38:01,200
Let all disputes be water under the bridge.

586
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,300
We should direct our hate to our enemies.

587
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,800
The lack of a crown prince has taken a toll on the Void realm.

588
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,200
The immortals seized the opportunity to become the head of the realms.

589
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,600
I even lost my son, Dingyun.

590
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:23,380
After much thought, I've decided to select a crown prince.

591
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,700
That shall appease the people.

592
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,600
We can focus our effort on fighting the immortals.

593
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:33,700
Wu Dai, the First Prince is the firstborn of the Void Tyrant.

594
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:36,800
He has more accomplishments in battle than anyone.

595
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,000
He deserves to be the crown prince more than anyone.

596
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,400
- Indeed.
- Agreed.

597
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,600
It should have been Wu Dai all along.

598
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:45,100
It should be the First Prince.

599
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,400
- Yes!
- Agreed.

600
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,500
- Yes.
- That's right.

601
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:54,000
<i>Oh no.</i>

602
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,500
<i>Your Majesty, please don't be mad at me.</i>

603
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,000
<i>Over the past few days, I've been recovering in seclusion.</i>

604
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,800
<i>I recalled the days when Yun'er had to fight his brothers</i>

605
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:14,000
<i>over the chance to be the next crown prince.</i>

606
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,800
<i>I felt very regretful.</i>

607
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,300
<i>It's in the past now.</i>

608
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,900
<i>Until we have a crown prince, the Void shall not have peace.</i>

609
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,800
<i>Wu Dai has many great feats in battles.</i>

610
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,600
<i>Why not make him the crown prince?</i>

611
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:37,500
<i>That should unite the people of the Void.</i>

612
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:43,100
<i>I'm surprised you've thought that far ahead for me.</i>

613
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:47,000
<i>It's time to select a crown prince.</i>

614
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,800
His Majesty and I have discussed the matter.

615
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,100
Now that we have a crown prince, Wudai's wedding with Princess Yetan should be prepared.

616
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:06,600
It seems Chaofeng and Jia Louluo do seem like a great match.

617
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:11,000
Let's set a date for both princes to have their weddings.

618
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,500
How does that sound, Your Majesty?

619
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,500
<i>Yes.</i>

620
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,900
<i>Well said.</i>

621
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,000
<i>Yes!</i>

622
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,300
<i>Terrific.</i>

623
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,300
A double delight.

624
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:22,100
- Royal Father!
- Your Majesty!

625
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,900
Your Majesty!

626
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:27,800
Your Majesty. I don't like Chaofeng.

627
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,300
I know.

628
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,600
Chaofeng is the son of a sinner.

629
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,700
I feel sorry for you.

630
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,900
But Chaofeng is still the Third Prince of Void.

631
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:38,800
He has courage and wits.

632
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,100
He is sharp.

633
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,200
He has a promising future.

634
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:44,100
You are the Saintess of the Snake clan.

635
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:48,600
You shall lead your clan and assist Chaofeng in his duties.

636
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,400
Chaofeng.

637
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:55,400
The Empress betrothed the Saintess to you for your own good.

638
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,600
You should be grateful.

639
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:02,000
Chaofeng and I had our differences.

640
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,800
I've arranged their marriage so we can let bygone be bygone.

641
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,000
That should take some burden off Your Majesty's shoulder.

642
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,200
Your Majesty!

643
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,700
Enough.

644
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,700
The future of our realm is at stake.

645
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:18,400
Do not let your relationships get in the way.

646
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,900
Your Majesty.

647
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,900
How thoughtful of you.

648
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,600
Chaofeng.

649
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:30,400
The Empress did her best to save your face.

650
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,400
Yetan is to be the crown prince's wife.

651
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:37,100
Are you coveting her?

652
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,800
I know someone already has your heart.

653
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,200
But the crown princess must marry the crown prince.

654
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,600
Everyone agrees with this decision.

655
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,200
You should see the big picture.

656
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,800
Your Majesty.

657
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,600
I am a mere mortal.

658
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,600
I'm not worthy to be the crown princess.

659
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:08,600
The honor should go to someone else.

660
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:11,400
You are too humble.

661
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,700
You've saved so many of our kind.

662
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:16,000
You've earned the people's trust.

663
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:20,000
You will be the First Prince's capable aide.

664
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,500
Your Highness.

665
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,800
You know who I love.
