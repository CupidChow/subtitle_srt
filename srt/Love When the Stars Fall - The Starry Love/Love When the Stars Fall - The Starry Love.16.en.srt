- Buy a sword.
- Grab a bite. Go for a show.

It's rare for us to visit the Mortal Realm. We want to take a stroll.

Great.

00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,980
Although I'm a princess, I've lived in the palace for most of my life.

- I...
- It's rare for you guys to come here.

00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,720
I should be a good host to you all. Don't mention it.

- I don't think I'll follow.

- Don't be courteous. It's my treat.
- Your Highness.

- I have a date with Sushui. Why don't you two go?

However, I've never seen you in such a good mood before.

What about you?

00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,600
You've spent the entire day shopping around with me. You must be exhausted.

<i>I never expected her to try to deceive me now.</i>

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,980
Kui'er, ever since we arrived at the Mortal Realm, you've become gentler and more considerate.

120
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,000
Now, you're even serving me tea.

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,460
You only served me tea when I was hurt in the past.

If you like the days we spend in the Mortal Realm,

I'll make tea for you every day in the future.

Forget it.

00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:52,560
The Mortal Realm is huge. I'm exhausted from all the fun.

I still have official affairs to complete.

I'll gather intelligence about our enemy later.

There's no rush.

00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
I don't want to leave, either.

130
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,120
However, drinking tea is the only thing we do here.

131
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,100
It's no fun.

132
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:20,160
I'll stay if we have something fun to do.

133
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:23,720
What do you mean by that?

134
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,973
Sir.

135
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,350
Here's your liquor.

136
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:51,300
Time to have some fun!

137
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:57,420
I told you to look after your body when we were in the Void Realm. I'm sure it was tough on you.

138
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,370
Since we have some fine liquor today, I shall drink with you.

139
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,933
Here.

140
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:12,273
Cheers.

141
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,530
This liquor is excellent, indeed.

142
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:26,960
I'll have another cup.

143
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,653
Cheers.

144
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:39,473
It's so good.

145
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,190
Let's have another cup.

146
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:44,140
Drink up.

147
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,960
Here. You should drink up.

148
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:20,453
We finally got Princess Qingkui drunk.

149
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,360
Kui'er wanted to get us drunk.

150
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,840
You're the worst at deceiving people.

151
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:31,600
I would've continued to act with you if it wasn't an emergency.

152
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,360
We should drop the act. Let's get down to business.

153
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,080
We need to head to Yuewo Village and kill Shaodian Youqin.

154
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:42,740
Kui'er is caught in between the two clans.

155
00:10:42,740 --> 00:10:45,420
That's why she tried to hide his tracks from me.

156
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,800
But according to royal father, the one who kills Shaodian Youqin will be the next crown prince.

157
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,180
This is my best opportunity.

158
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:54,150
I cannot give up now.

159
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,153
Kui'er,

160
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,170
I have no choice but to let you down.

161
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,593
Sir, I thought you were going to let her down.

162
00:11:11,593 --> 00:11:14,480
Why are you carrying her? Are you heading to Yuewo Village with her?

163
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,520
I'll send her back to the inn first.

164
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,020
She's finally passed out.

165
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,480
We mustn't waste this opportunity.

166
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:20,940
Speed is of the essence here.

167
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,950
Sir, we should be quick!

168
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,333
Dear, Wang Ergou helped us out when we were young.

169
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,380
Now, he's in trouble. How could we not help him out?

170
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,300
I already tried my best to be as thrifty as possible.

171
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,260
Do you think we don't need to pay for our child's education?

172
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,000
Don't tell me you want me to get back the money from him.

173
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,120
- Go and get the money right now.
- No, I won't.

174
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,000
- Are you going or not?
- I said I'm not going.

175
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,440
You're not going? Forget it, then.

176
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,833
I'll leave.

177
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:50,333
Yuehong!

178
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,113
What?

179
00:11:52,113 --> 00:11:54,200
I-I'm sorry.

180
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,980
Dear, are you no longer angry at me?

181
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,653
Let's go.

182
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,220
Right now, the villagers of Yuewo Village are out to get him.

183
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,500
The voidwalkers have been involved. Qingkui has been involved, too.

184
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,340
This is getting worse and worse.

185
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,700
Heartless Shaodian, why is it so difficult to save you?

186
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,300
If so, what do you plan to do with the voidwalkers?

187
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,233
The voidwalkers?

188
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,481
Void Third Prince already found out that we'd descended to this realm.

189
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:30,080
They've sent their scouts here.

190
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,460
I almost bumped into them today.

191
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:35,620
Right now, we have to persuade Fiery to leave this place.

192
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,920
And then we should find the other two soul shards and revive the Empyrean soon.

193
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,433
I'm afraid we can't keep a low profile.

194
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:56,975
<i>[Missing Person]</i>

195
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:01,740
You guys were the ones who put up this notice?

196
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,500
We were just thinking that since we'd already found Fiery,

197
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:07,340
we should retrieve the other two soul shards as soon as possible.

198
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:11,020
Thus, we put up notices with his portrait all along the way.

199
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:16,021
We used bounty to lure those who sought soul shards before.

200
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:19,000
We wanted them to provide leads to us.

201
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,520
The voidwalkers are in the Mortal Realm now.

202
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,100
If they discover this portrait, they'll find out that your brother is in trouble.

203
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,140
How many of them did you guys put up?

204
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,140
How many?

205
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,900
We spent the entire night putting them up.

206
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,140
There are at least hundreds of them.

207
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:36,140
What? We've posted them on all of the main paths in the Mortal and Beast Realms.

208
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:38,480
Hurry then. Go and remove them!

209
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,780
Hurry up! Split up!

210
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:43,500
- I...
- Just go already! Go!

211
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,433
You...

212
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:48,060
Sister-in-law, leave this to us.

213
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:51,280
You should stay here and persuade Fiery.

214
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,340
I'll join him.

215
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,300
That's right, Sister-in-law.

216
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:57,260
Youqin became strange after you left.

217
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,080
At first, he just locked himself in the room.

218
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,240
He was making something in the room.

219
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:06,960
Just now, when I passed by Yuewo Village, I saw him watching an argument between a couple.

220
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:09,440
You should check on him.

221
00:14:12,875 --> 00:14:14,425

- Here you go.
- All right.

224
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,940
I'm starving.

225
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,260
- Bring some tea!
- Got it!

226
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:39,840
Shaodian Youqin, not only did you steal Tan Tan from me, but you're also the reason I have to run around.

227
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,500
I'll beat you up. I'll beat you up.

228
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,660
Beat you up!

229
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:46,960
Beat you up!

230
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,993
Di Lanjue?

231
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,140
Can you do me a favor?

232
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:12,970
That hateful Qingheng, why did he put it up so high?

233
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,680
Higher.

234
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,430
Do I need to go higher?

I won't be okay if you don't get up soon.

I'm not prepared.

What are you preparing for?

253
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,813
An apology.

An apology?

255
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:48,241
So, you carved this flower just to apologize to me?

256
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,173
An apology.

257
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:57,273
I'm...

258
00:16:57,273 --> 00:16:58,773
I'm...

00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,013
I'm...

I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm... I'm...

00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,060
I cannot.

265

I'm... I'm sorry.

266
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,013
I made that.

267
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,900
You were taking a break.

268
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,760
Before this, I threw a tantrum.

269
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,180
I'm sorry.

270
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,813
Forgive me.

271
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,240
What if I don't forgive you?

272
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,080
You don't forgive me?

273
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,980
You don't forgive me.

274
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,200
You don't forgive me.

275
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,830
You don't forgive me.

276
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,460
Like this. Forgive me?

277
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,340
Where did you learn it from?

278
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:51,473
The villagers.

279
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:54,300
You scared me. I was wondering how you became enlightened.

280
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,260
But they're a married couple.

281
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,920
Aren't we? We...

282
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,393
Be my wife.

283
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,780
When you leave, I'm sad.

284
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:12,913
I miss you.

285
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:16,000
I... I like you.

286
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,740
Be my wife.

287
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,940
I'm sorry. I said the wrong thing.

288
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,420
Silly guy!

289
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:27,333
I'm happy.

290
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,153
Happy?

291
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,353
Are you willing?

292
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,420
You're willing!

293
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:42,720
This isn't a hug.

294
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:48,620
This is a hug.

295
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,173
Dear.

296
00:19:51,173 --> 00:19:54,433
Dear. Dear.

297
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,100
Royal Father.

298
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
I don't have a son like you.

299
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,700
You escaped from our realm without permission and spent your time with those female demons.

300
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:26,000
You useless fool!

301
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
I didn't!

302
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,600
You still want to find excuses?

303
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,600
General Tiger saw that himself.

304
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,800
You and this demon were doing something indecent on the streets!

305
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:35,800
She's not a demon.

306
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:37,100
She's not a demon?

307
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,700
Don't tell me she's a fairy then?

308
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,900
That's right. I am...

309
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,600
If you tell him your identity, they'll find out

310
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:52,300
that your sister-in-law is trying to save the Empyrean without permission.

311
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,900
How dare you?

312
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:56,200
How dare you do that in front of me?

313
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,000
You!

314
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,200
Guards!

315
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,300
Take this rebel to the Prince's Mansion!

316
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:04,200
Send this demon to the cell!

317
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,800
Let go of me!

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,300
Royal Father, if you want to send her to the cell, you should send me there, too.

319
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:12,400
You!

320
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,300
You!

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,400
Y-Y-You!

322
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,100
Don't think that I can't deal with you just because your mother isn't here!

323
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Guards! Send both of them to the cell!

324
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,600
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

325
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,700
I... You!

326
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,000
I... You'll be in trouble when mother comes back.

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,400
Come.

328
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,600
Didn't you say you prepared a gift for me?

329
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
Where's the gift?

330
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:48,400
♫ <i>I see a light in your starry eyes</i> ♫

331
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,100
♫ <i>The sound of the zither ringing</i> ♫

332
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,400
♫ <i>As I sing softly, you and I look at each other</i> ♫

333
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,300
♫ <i>There is an azure blue ocean over there</i> ♫

334
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,000
♫ <i>With a sparkling wave of light</i> ♫

335
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:07,400
♫ <i>You said, "Let's hold hand and not let go"</i> ♫

336
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,000
♫ <i>You are a fragment of the brightest star in the sky</i> ♫

337
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,800
♫ <i>You are a fragment of the brightest star in the sky</i> ♫

338
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,300
♫ <i>Piece by piece</i> ♫

339
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,600
Fireworks.

340
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,400
I learned how to make it from the villagers.

341
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,000
♫ <i>Gently flickering, illuminating the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

342
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
♫ <i>Gently flickering, illuminating the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

343
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,800
Fiery Fireworks, only for you.

344
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,600
Do you like it?

345
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,300
I do.

346
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:36,200
♫ <i>Gorgeous flowers and fire bloom momentarily</i> ♫

347
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,200
♫ <i>It all turned into sweetness</i> ♫

348
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:43,000
♫ <i>I am you, and you are me</i> ♫

349
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

350
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,900
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

351
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:55,200
♫ <i>Smiles blooming into happiness that can't be melt away</i> ♫

352
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,700
♫ <i>It was you</i> ♫
♫ <i>Who sweetened my parched heart</i> ♫

353
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,200
You fool! You lit too many of them! Run!

354
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,400
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

355
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,400
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

356
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,200
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

357
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,400
♫ <i>Smiles blooming into happiness that can't be melt away</i> ♫

358
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:25,400
♫ <i>It was you</i> ♫
♫ <i>Who sweetened my parched heart</i> ♫

359
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:31,600
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

360
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,500
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

361
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,600
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

362
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:44,200
♫ <i>The passion, between you and I will never be forgotten</i> ♫

363
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,500
The moon looks gorgeous.

364
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:03,800
<i>Heartless Shaodian, </i>

365
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:09,100
<i>you're good-looking, indeed.</i>

366
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,800
You stared at me.

367
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,300
Why?

368
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,200
Because you're good-looking.

369
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,800
You're better looking than the moon.

370
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,200
They hate me.

371
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,600
You trust me.

372
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Why?

373
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,000
You're different.

374
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,600
It's because under your ferocious appearance lies one of the purest hearts I've ever seen.

375
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,300
That's why I'm willing to trust you.

376
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,900
The world is vast.

377
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:51,800
There are always outstanding loners out there.

378
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:57,100
However, arrogant people love to measure things in the world with their standards.

379
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,400
They detest and expel those who are different from them.

380
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,800
But that isn't our fault, right?

381
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:12,000
The only thing we can do is not accept one's hate and let it go.

382
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,700
You were the one who...

383
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,900
A friend of mine told me that.

384
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:28,500
He even said that he hoped that I could be like the rooftop swallow, which was seen as a jinx.

385
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:34,700
Although people misunderstood it, it could still soar through the sky and be itself.

386
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:39,800
Your friend was right.

387
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,600
So what should we do?

388
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,900
We'll leave this unfair village and head to somewhere that can accept us.

389
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,600
I'm not leaving.

390
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,500
You're doing this again.

391
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,400
Why do you love this village that's full of malicious words so much?

392
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,600
Do you have something you need to achieve here?

393
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
I'll help you out.

394
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:57,400
You cannot.

395
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,800
How would you know when you're not telling me anything?

396
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,500
Are you angry?

397
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,600
I'm sorry.

398
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,400
Don't be angry.

399
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,700
I'm begging you.

400
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:12,100
Don't leave, okay?

401
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,800
I'm sorry.

402
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,800
This is bad. Time's up.

403
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:30,200
I have to head back.

404
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,200
What do you mean?

405
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,700
Fiery!

406
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
Fiery!

407
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,400
Fiery!

408
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,000
Fiery!

409
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,400
Fiery!

410
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,900
Southern Brightness Sacred Fire?

411
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,600
Fiery!

412
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:04,300
You... You can see it?

413
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,200
So you're not leaving Yuewo Village because of it?

414
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,000
I'll tell you why.

415
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,500
One year ago, this thing and I appeared at the same time.

416
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,400
That's why people call me the fire demon.

417
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:30,400
I wasn't the one who set the village on fire.

418
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,700
Trust me.

419
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,200
Of course, I trust you.

420
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,100
This is the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

421
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:37,400
The Heavenly Realm uses it to refine immortal pills and light up.

422
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,400
Jade Deity once said that this flame is very powerful.

423
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:44,200
Once it's lit, all beings within 1,000 li will perish.

424
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,500
There's no way you can create it.

425
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,800
But why didn't you tell me about it before?

426
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:52,400
Were you afraid that I wouldn't trust you?

427
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,300
Yes.

428
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:57,500
After that, I was afraid it might harm you.

429
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,300
Harm me?

430
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,800
In my memory,

431
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:08,800
<i>I didn't know where I came from and where I should go.</i>

432
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,900
<i>But he appeared.</i>

433
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:15,700
<i>He taught me things. We became friends.</i>

434
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,100
He and I discovered the flame.

435
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,300
<i>I was fine.</i>

436
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,800
<i>But he...</i>

437
00:29:24,800 --> 00:29:26,400
<i>He...</i>

438
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:34,500
<i>I told the people to stay away from the flame.</i>

439
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,400
<i>They said I brought the flame.</i>

440
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,000
<i>They beat me up and cursed me.</i>

441
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,700
<i>I was afraid.</i>

442
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:50,300
<i>I burned their money and things.</i>

443
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:56,400
That's why they called me the fire demon.

444
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,300
The flame is ferocious.

445
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,200
My friend is dead.

446
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,000
But I can absorb fire.

447
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,400
That's why I don't want other people to die anymore.

448
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:15,100
So you protected the villagers by absorbing the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

449
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:18,600
Even so, the villagers saw you as the fire demon.

450
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,500
Before this, you rejected me whenever I wanted to take you away.

451
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,400
It was because you were worried about the villagers and wanted to protect them.

452
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:35,400
Initially, I thought your fire-absorbing constitution was just like my jinxed constellation.

453
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,600
I thought you were born with it.

454
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,500
I never expected you to shoulder all the blame and misunderstandings

455
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:45,600
while protecting the villagers with a pure heart.

456
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,000
I'm not good.

457
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,400
I don't want people to die.

458
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,200
<i>Heartless Shaodian's memories within the Shard of Desire dissipated long ago.</i>

459
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,400
<i>Although his personality changed a lot, he's still trying to protect the Mortal Realm.</i>

460
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,700
<i>How could someone as kind as he exists in this world?</i>

461
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,800
Don't worry.

462
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,800
I won't let this happen again.

463
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:21,100
I will come up with a way to deal with the flame.

464
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:35,000
I need to teach you brats at the Prince's Mansion a lesson!

465
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:42,900
You brats always instigate Lan to stir up trouble!

466
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:47,200
Today, I will surely...

467
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,200
It's late now.

468
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,700
My dear, what are you doing here?

469
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,900
I heard that you captured Lan'er and sent him to the cell!

470
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,700
He was too stubborn for his own good.

471
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:16,300
And he ran away from home because of the second human princess, which was already married!

472
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:18,000
He vanished for quite some time.

473
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,000
When I captured him, he was doing something indecent with an unknown demon!

474
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:33,300
As the Beast King, I had to teach him a lesson.

475
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:36,400
If so, you can teach him a lesson!

476
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
Why did you have to send your son to the cell?

477
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,200
Didn't you always say that he became like this because I spoiled him?

478
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,500
That's not true.

479
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,200
Why don't you send me to the cell with him?

480
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,800
My dear, calm down.

481
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,600
I love you so much.

482
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:52,000
How could I bear to lock you up?

483
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,000
Fine then.

484
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:55,800
Go and release Lan'er immediately!

485
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,000
I just taught these brats a lesson.

486
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,200
But now, you want me to revoke my order?

487
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,800
What about my dignity?

488
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,300
Fine.

489
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,000
Since you don't intend to care for Lan'er, I'll care for him!

490
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,800
- That's not it.
- I'll get him out of the cell right now.

491
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,100
If something happens to Lan'er, I won't let you off!

492
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,600
You don't need to return to our chamber tonight.

493
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:28,900
You can stay here.

494
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:32,600
You can spend the night with your so-called dignity!

495
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:47,300
Your Majesty, lately, we will prepare pillows and blankets for you

496
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,000
just in case the empress throws you out of the room.

497
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,200
Just in case?

498
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,400
It's all your fault!

499
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,600
It's all your fault!

500
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,800
It's all because of you fools!

501
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,400
You brats!

502
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,700
Di Lanjue, will we be trapped here for a long time?

503
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,000
Don't worry.

504
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,000
Royal Father is just scaring us.

505
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,600
He'll release us soon.

506
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:20,900
But...

507
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:26,000
I keep feeling like something is staring at me.

508
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,300
You're right.

509
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:40,000
All these prisoners are crazed beasts who murdered their peers,

510
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:45,000
stole beast pills, and dreamt about being immortals.

511
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,300
Are they ferocious?

512
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,800
They're extremely ferocious.

513
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:00,400
<i>When we were in the Heavenly Realm, although she mistook me for a dog, </i>

514
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
<i>at least she took good care of me.</i>

515
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,800
<i>Now, she's trapped here because of me.</i>

516
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:11,500
<i>If I don't stand up for her, I don't deserve to be the beast prince.</i>

517
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,400
Don't worry.

518
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,300
These ferocious beasts are locked behind the innermost part of the cell.

519
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,600
They'll never get to see the day of light.

520
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,000
You won't be in danger.

521
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,400
Besides, the beast prince is here.

522
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:26,000
I will never let you be in danger.

523
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,200
Everything will be fine.

524
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,900
But...

525
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:35,800
What's the matter?

526
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,100
I'm fine.

527
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:40,600
I was just pricked by the thorns on the cage.

528
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,400
What smell is that?

529
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,100
You! Didn't you say that we wouldn't be in danger?

530
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,400
Didn't you say that we wouldn't be in danger?

531
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,800
You said we would be fine!

532
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,400
Oh no.

533
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,600
I'm fine.

534
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,100
I was just pricked.

535
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:13,900
You should deal with them first.

536
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:19,000
The beasts went crazy because they smell the blood of an immortal.

537
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,600
What should we do then?

538
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:22,600
We'll be fine.

539
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:26,800
We just need to get out before they escape from their cages.

540
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,800
Which scoundrel locked our cage?

541
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,400
Stand back.

542
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:27,700
Let's go!

543
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,000
Over here, hurry!

544
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:09,200
Ziwu, be careful!

545
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,700
Watch out!

546
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,800
Di Lanjue!

547
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,800
Let's go!

548
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,700
Di Lanjue!

549
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:54,400
Di Lanjue. There are too many beasts here. We can't escape!

550
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,800
<i>If I want to help her escape from here, </i>

551
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,500
<i>I can only extract my internal elixir and scare off the beasts with its Beast King Aura.</i>

552
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,300
<i>However, if I extract my internal elixir, I'll reveal my true self to her.</i>

553
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,900
<i>If she finds out that I'm...</i>

554
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,100
<i>Forget it!</i>

555
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,700
<i>I'll save her before anything else.</i>

556
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,800
- I got it!
- Take this.

557
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,200
What is this?

558
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:29,400
This lamp is called the Pathfinder.

559
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Jade Deity made me this magic item when I was born.

560
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,000
It can dispel all evil. With it, we can leave this place without any trouble!

561
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,100
Why didn't you take it out earlier?

562
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,700
Di Lanjue?

563
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,400
A'Cai?

564
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,600
You're seriously wounded.

565
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,900
I'll definitely bring you out.

566
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

567
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,200
Where is the prince?

568
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,300
His Highness and the demon are kept in Cell 66.

569
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:18,800
Di Lanjue! Hang in there! Wake up!

570
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,900
I'll definitely bring you outside!

571
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,000
Lan'er?

572
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:43,100
Your Majesty, please save Di Lanjue.

573
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:48,400
You brat! How dare you extract my son's internal elixir?

574
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,300
I'm sorry. I didn't know that it was his internal elixir.

575
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,000
Lan'er.

576
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm sorry.

577
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,000
Where did you come from? How dare you bewitch my son?

578
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,900
I will...

579
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:04,000
<i>An immortal magic item?</i>

580
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,700
Guards, take this demon out.

581
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,800
Your Majesty.

582
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,000
I... Listen to me.

583
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,600
Here.

584
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:24,300
Eat up.

585
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,000
Sister-in-law, did you bring me here for supper

586
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,100
so that I could come up with a way to put out the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire?

587
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:37,000
That's right.

588
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,800
Only immortals can use the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

589
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,000
You're an immortal. I'm sure you know how to put it out.

590
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,600
Eat up.

591
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
Let's put out the flame after our supper.

592
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,400
The flame cannot be extinguished.

593
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:54,800
Even if I was as powerful as Youqin, I could not do anything about it.

594
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,100
That's nonsense.

595
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,000
It's forged by the Grand Empyrean.

596
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,100
The Grand Empyrean always creates things that can cancel each other out.

597
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:03,400
Why would the Grand Empyrean forge such a flame?

598
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,000
It's not that it cannot be extinguished.

599
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,300
It's just that it's beyond our league.

600
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,600
You see, I love to do things that are beyond my league.

601
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:14,800
Tell me. What's the reason behind your rejection?

602
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:18,400
If you want to extinguish it, you need to acquire a magic item from the Rain Deity.

603
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,200
It's called the Purifying Vial.

604
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:23,600
It contains the Dew of the Sun and Moon, and it's connected to the Jade Pool.

605
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,900
Every year, the Rain Deity will pray for the human clan.

606
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:33,400
I heard that it's the only thing that can extinguish the flame.
