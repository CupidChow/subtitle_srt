21
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,500
Sister. What's on your mind?

22
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:56,300
Nothing.

23
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,710
It's all my fault.

24
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,510
I landed you guys in this plight because I was flustered.

25
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,950
Don't say that.

26
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,640
Right now, we're a family.

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,270
I wonder what Father is doing right now.

28
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,420
Once news of this gets out, the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant will definitely put him on the spot.

29
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,350
Imperial Father has a soft personality.

30
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:22,510
I'm afraid he will succumb to them.

31
00:02:22,510 --> 00:02:27,530
Sister, Imperial Father will definitely not harm us.

32
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,480
If you don't kill them, they'll kill us.

33
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:44,530
They're my tribesmen. How could I kill them?

34
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:46,150
Let's go.

35
00:02:47,230 --> 00:02:48,950
We have to go.

36
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:03,850
So, you let them escape?

37
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,510
They escaped by themselves.

38
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:08,020
Xuanshang and Chaofeng are very powerful.

39
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,070
They won't escape from weaklings like you all.

40
00:03:11,690 --> 00:03:13,260
Say no more.

41
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,030
If the voidwalkers are that capable, you guys can capture them yourselves.

42
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:18,380
There's no need to follow us.

43
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,880
- Continue your search.
- Yes, sir!

<i>[Wangliang City]</i>

45

No one is after us. Let's head to Siqu Pavilion.

46
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:31,370
Let's go.

47
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:07,130
Wait!

48
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,100
Who was the one who said we shouldn't be soft-hearted just now?

49
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,420
They're my buddies from the Void Patrol Battalion.

50
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:18,560
Sir, we had no choice.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,630
No one dares to defy the Void Tyrant's order.

52
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:23,510
I cannot let you guys go.

53
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:24,990
You guys will report our whereabouts.

54
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,340
Since we're brothers, I'll give you guys a quick death.

55
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:31,690
Sir, please allow me to thank Princess Qingkui before you kill me.

56
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:33,140
Why?

57
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:36,120
Your Highness once treated me and my mother.

58
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,920
I always remember your kindness.

59
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,850
It's just that I didn't have the chance to thank you.

60
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:41,920
Your Highness, you were the one who saved my life.

61
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,580
Today, I'm willing to return it to you.

62
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,910
Chaofeng, let them off.

63
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:56,110
Leave.

64
00:04:56,110 --> 00:04:57,900
Don't let me see you guys again.

65
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:00,220
Next time, I won't show any mercy.

66
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,650
Sir, Your Highness, please take care.

67
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,990
Suzhi?

68
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,550
Suzhi!

69
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,780
We cannot afford to take the risk.

70
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,550
You guys will be in danger if Her Highness's location is revealed.

71
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:27,670
Your Highness is kind.

72
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:32,070
Immortal Xuanshang and Prince Chaofeng cannot attack their tribesmen.

73
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:36,620
Just leave this to me.

74
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,050
Generals, have you guys found the flower spirits?

75
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:49,650
Your Majesty, we haven't found them yet.

76
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,360
What about the Void Army?

77
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,970
We found nothing too.

78
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:56,510
The Beast Tribe had found nothing too.

79
00:05:56,510 --> 00:05:58,900
Immortal Xuanshang is immensely powerful.

80
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:01,430
And Chaofeng is excellent at doing reconnaissance measures.

81
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:05,310
I'm afraid we have to continue the search for some days.

82
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:07,020
Generals.

83
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,750
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

84
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:14,310
Announce to the world that if Yetan and Qingkui aren't willing to receive their execution

85
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:16,890
I will lay waste to the human's imperial city.

86
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,380
<i>Yes, Your Majesty!</i>

87
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:30,720
Heavenly Emperor, you're acting like the Void Tyrant now.

88
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,600
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

89
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,700
Good. The Void will assist you with our troops as well.

90
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,580
It's just a tiny imperial city.

91
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,750
Void Tyrant, spare yourself from the trouble.

92
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,550
It's our common responsibility to get rid of the flower spirits.

93
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:50,900
Since both the immortals and voidwalkers are dispatching their troops together,

94
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,890
the four realms can rest at ease now.

95
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:58,450
The Beast Tribe will be on standby just in case anything happens.

96
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,990
The owner of Siqu Pavilion is an old friend of mine.

97
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,900
He won't betray us.

98
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,410
Kui'er, let's rest here for now.

99
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:15,720
Have you guys seen this person around?

100
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:18,310
What's inside your sack?

101
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,210
We shouldn't stay here for long.

102
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:24,000
Although I've increased the strength of my barrier, they'll still discover us easily.

103
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,220
If this continues, things will get only harder for you two.

104
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:29,110
There's nothing hard about it.

105
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,550
If they attack us, we'll retaliate.

106
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,380
However, our current enemies are your brethren and brothers.

107
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,900
They belong to the same tribe as you.

108
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:40,460
If you guys attack each other, Tan'er and I will become heinous sinners.

109
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,490
If so, I'll absorb their impurity.

110
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,950
I finally have the power to do so.

111
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,190
You mustn't do so!

112
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:47,830
If you do so, you'll give people a subject for ridicule.

113
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:49,530
Then, we'll truly end up as the heretics who try to end the world.

114
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:51,050
Sister, do you even know the situation we're in?

115
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:52,950
You can't afford to be merciful anymore.

116
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,510
So, you want Youqin, Chaofeng, and me to not retaliate?

117
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,760
Do you want us to wait for our demise?

118
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:00,020
Tan'er, listen to me.

119
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:02,510
The four realms treat us as the flower spirits of doom.

120
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,310
But we know clearly that it isn't true.

121
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,700
I know they're wrong. But must we follow in their footsteps?

122
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,340
You were never influenced by other people's opinions.

123
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,430
I learned that from you.

124
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:16,540
No matter what kind of sticky situation we got ourselves into, we must pursue the life we want.

125
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,160
Can you stop being so naive?

126
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,510
You've always been saving the injured and helping the weak. But can you stop them from killing you?

127
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,900
It's a dog-eat-dog world out here.

128
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,460
Do you truly think one good turn deserves another?

129
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,670
I didn't practice medicine so that I could be rewarded.

130
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,650
I was just following my nature. That's why I lead a carefree life.

131
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,630
Fine, I'm narrow-minded. Okay?

132
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:34,250
- Carefree girl.
- Tan'er, you!

133
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,290
It's fine.

134
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:48,120
Your Highness.

135
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:55,970
This is the owner of Siqu Pavilion.

136
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:57,520
He's an ally.

137
00:08:58,430 --> 00:08:59,930
Your Highness, this is bad.

138
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:03,690
I heard that the immortals and voidwalkers have surrounded the imperial palace.

139
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,460
The Heavenly Emperor has set a three-day limit for the two princesses to return to the imperial palace.

140
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:12,070
If not, he will lay waste to the imperial city.

141
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,120
The Heavenly Emperor is actually using my father as a hostage?

142
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,030
My consort mother is still in the palace.

143
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,620
He's despicable.

144
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,810
You mustn't go!

145
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:24,820
That's what the Heavenly Emperor wanted you to do.

146
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,150
At most, we can perish together!

147
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:27,960
I'll charge into the palace with my powers.

148
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,190
Your Highness, don't fall for their trick.

149
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:33,910
You two came from Dongqiu and have no ties with the human race.

150
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,740
There's no need for you to get implicated because of Emperor Tun.

151
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,810
Emperor Tun is their foster father after all.

152
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,620
They must repay his kindness.

153
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:43,700
Back then, you and the tribesmen of Dongqiu died to protect the Ganoderma Vein, right?

154
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,600
Suzhi has a point.

155
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,270
If you two head back, it'll make the situation worse.

156
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,330
Don't tell me you want us to sit by and do nothing

157
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,560
as the Void Tyrant and Heavenly Emperor lay waste to the imperial city?

158
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:03,460
Do we have any other solutions?

159
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,300
What's the situation?

160
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,000
The palace has been surrounded.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,400
General Tortoise and Chief Wizard Xiangliu are standing guard personally.

162
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:37,700
Seems like the four realms are bent on killing the sisters.

163
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,700
Feng'er will never just stand idly by.

164
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,400
But with Immortal Xuanshang around, they might still stand a chance.

165
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,900
No matter how powerful he is, they're still outnumbered.

166
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,300
How could they win against the elite forces of the two tribes?

167
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,400
Consort Xue, don't worry.

168
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,500
If they do come back, we'll fight to the death.

169
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,300
The immortals and voidwalkers have surrounded the palace and cast a barrier around it.

170
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,700
Even a bird can't fly outside now.

171
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:00,800
What should we do?

172
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,700
We can only pray that they don't return.

173
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
<i>Heavenly Emperor.</i>

174
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,800
<i>Void Tyrant!
[Liguang Palace]</i>

175
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,000
We can talk this over.

176
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,700
There's no need to do this.

177
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,800
<i>Why don't you guys come inside?</i>

178
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Let's have a chat!

179
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,500
Why don't you guys come inside?

180
00:11:45,500 --> 00:11:48,000
<i>Let's sit down and have a chat!</i>

181
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,100
They're too much.

182
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,200
- Your Majesty!
- Don't stop me!

183
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,300
Your Majesty!

184
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,700
Your Majesty!

185
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:12,000
You guys have gone too far!

186
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,600
Emperor Tun, sorry for the trouble.

187
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,900
We have to do this to capture the flower spirits of doom.

188
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:21,000
There's no need to explain yourself to a mortal.

189
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,700
The immortals and voidwalkers are mighty indeed, huh?

190
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
I know the human race is weak.

191
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:29,200
For millenniums, we worshipped the immortals and feared the voidwalkers.

192
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
That's why I married my daughters off to both of the tribes respectively.

193
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,200
I hoped that we could form a bond.

194
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,100
In the end, you guys are surrounding us with your armies.

195
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,100
Just shut up and wait.

196
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,600
If you say one more word, I'll demolish your palace immediately!

197
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,100
I have something to say!

198
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,500
- You!
- Void Tyrant!

199
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,300
The twin flowers aren't here yet. Do not act recklessly.

200
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:59,600
You guys surrounded my palace for three days just to make Tan'er and Kui'er show themselves.

201
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,000
What has the human race got to do with this?

202
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
I know the voidwalkers are rude.

203
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,800
But now, even the immortals are forsaking their integrity?

204
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:17,100
You guys declared that my daughters are the flower spirits of doom.

205
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:22,300
However, what exactly did they do wrong for you all to condemn them like this?

206
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,900
They didn't have a choice when they were born flower spirits.

207
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,600
They're your daughters-in-law!

208
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,300
However, you guys have no compassion at all.

209
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,700
You guys are actually trying to kill my daughters in front of me!

210
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,400
You guys have no conscience!

211
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:50,800
Although the human race is weak, we can't just allow anyone to trample on us.

212
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,900
If I can't even protect my daughters today, how can I protect my people?

213
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:04,200
If you guys dare to lay a finger on my daughters,

214
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,800
the human race will declare war upon you two

215
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:14,400
and fight to the death!

216
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,600
<i>They still came back.</i>

217
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,200
Your Majesty, Immortal Xuanshang has brought the twin flowers to the Heavenly Realm.

218
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,940
What? They're in the Heavenly Realm?

219
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,000
Yes. Yetan also has a message for Your Majesty and the Void Tyrant.

220
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,300
- Speak.
- She said both of you don't need to hold the human kingdom hostage to capture them.

221
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:59,800
She and Princess Qingkui are waiting for you two in Ninth Heaven Hall.

222
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,200
If you two don't head back...

223
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,200
What will they do?

224
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
They will destroy Ninth Heaven Hall.

225
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,300
They're running amok in Ninth Heaven Hall, huh?

226
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,500
They're too bold for their own good.

227
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:17,800
My army and I will follow you to the Heavenly Realm to hunt down the twin flowers.

228
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,000
Ninth Heaven Hall isn't a place for bloodshed.

229
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,200
Void Tyrant, you don't need to bring your army with you. Just you alone will suffice.

230
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:30,500
Since they're already in the Heavenly Realm, I won't let them escape.

231
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,700
Fine.

232
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,600
<i>They're doing a demonstration in Ninth Heaven Hall.</i>

233
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>The Heavenly Emperor will never let them off.</i>

234
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,800
Youqin, you should come to your senses.

235
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,200
Celestial Father.

236
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,800
I should've killed you long ago!

237
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,300
Back then, for the sake of this fake Heavenly Consort, you barged into the Heavenly Ministry of Justice,

238
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:28,800
forsook your position as the empyrean and your fellow immortals to be together with her.

239
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,100
I've tolerated you time and time again.

240
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,800
I was hoping that you might come to your senses one day.

241
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:37,400
I never expected you to do something this ridiculous.

242
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,300
You brought the flower spirits of doom here to destroy your own home!

243
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,500
Celestial Father, you forced us to do so.

244
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,400
She's the flower spirit of doom!

245
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,200
Are you going to risk offending the world to assist an evildoer like her?

246
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,400
I didn't come here to reason with you all.

247
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,600
I'm here to negotiate a deal.

248
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,300
First, rescind your order of destroying the Ganoderma Vein and do not send your army after us.

249
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:10,000
Second, announce to the world that the Dongqiu Tribe had no intention of destroying the world.

250
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,500
Heavenly Emperor, please return the Soul-Gathering Lamp to us

251
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:17,200
so that the souls of the dead Dongqiu people can be reborn.

252
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,900
What gives you guys the right to negotiate a deal with us?

253
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,300
We can absorb both purity and impurity.

254
00:17:55,300 --> 00:18:01,700
If you guys insist on forcing us into a dead corner, we can fight you guys with our flower spirit powers.

255
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,400
Heavenly Emperor, Void Tyrant, if you guys can make a pact with us and let us off,

256
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,400
we'll promise we'll never use our flower spirit powers again.

257
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:23,200
The five of you intruded upon Ninth Heaven Hall by yourselves.

258
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,100
Do you guys think you can get out of this place?

259
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:31,200
What if the army of the Xia clan is with them?

260
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,900
Heavenly Emperor, if you refuse, the Xia clan will cease to be part of the immortals.

261
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,600
What did you say?

262
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Heavenly Emperor, seems like you can't even keep your harem in check.

263
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,500
Celestial Father, you should stop.

264
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,100
The Ganoderma Vein can co-exist peacefully with the four realms.

265
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,700
Celestial Father, your initial goal was to preserve the peace of the four realms.

266
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:19,500
The two princesses are kind at heart.

267
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,800
Celestial Father, there's no need to instigate hate.

268
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,600
Back then, I couldn't sleep in peace after the massacre of Dongqiu.

269
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,200
Now, the three masters can't just stand idly by.

270
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:33,400
Heavenly Emperor, it's time to wake up.

271
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,600
It's time for you to stop.

272
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:44,400
Celestial Father, must you push yourself into a spot where all your kins forsake you?

273
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,200
Today,

274
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:59,300
I have to accept her proposal no matter if I like it or not.

275
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,600
There's no benefit in perishing together.

276
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,100
You guys are threatening me here!

277
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,600
Fine.

278
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,900
I will give you my promise.

279
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,800
For this son of mine.

280
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,200
For the sake of my favorite son, Shaodian Youqin.

281
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,100
I will give you guys my promise.

282
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,900
This concerns the safety of the four realms.

283
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,000
How could you compromise with them?

284
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,900
It's precisely because of the safety of the four realms that I have to compromise with them.

285
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,400
Void Tyrant,

286
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,300
sometimes, a little impatience spoils great plans.

287
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:08,700
Fine. I will give you guys my promise too.

288
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:44,000
I never expected to get away scot-free after barging into the Ninth Heaven Hall.

289
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,900
Don't you think this is an unprecedented record?

290
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,300
You're getting ahead of yourself, huh?

291
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
I was so nervous just now.

292
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:53,000
It's all thanks to Ziwu and Celestial Mother.

293
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:57,200
I'm afraid things wouldn't go so well without your help.

294
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,400
Thank you, Celestial Mother.

295
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Celestial Mother, what you've done today had humiliated Celestial Father.

296
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,500
- I'm afraid...
- Don't worry.

297
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,700
The Xia clan has my back.

298
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,600
He wouldn't dare do anything to me.

299
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,210
Although Celestial Father is overbearing, he still cares about Celestial Mother.

300
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:16,950
It's a good sign that he's willing to back down.

301
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:21,790
Maybe you guys can convince him to let you guys return here in due time.

302
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:27,740
When you miss us, we and Ziwu will come back and visit you.

303
00:22:28,330 --> 00:22:30,090
Why did you include me?

304
00:22:30,090 --> 00:22:32,830
I'm afraid you and Di Lanjue would already have three children in the Beast Realm

305
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:35,620
by the time the Heavenly Emperor is willing to accept our return.

306
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,400
Sister-in-law!

307
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,270
Mother, this is a complicated matter.

308
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:42,770
I haven't got the chance to explain it to you yet.

309
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:51,520
I was wondering why Ziwu didn't fall for any other immortals.

310
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:54,780
So, she fell for the Prince of the Beast Realm.

311
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,540
After we left, Qingheng was the only one here.

312
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,660
He and Husui went to retrieve the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

313
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:01,720
Why haven't they returned yet?

314
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:13,490
Masters, I know what you guys are curious about.

315
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:16,100
My actual name is Suzhi.

316
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:20,130
I was a clan member of Dongqiu who was fortunate enough to survive the massacre.

317
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:25,800
If I'm not mistaken, you guys were there when the massacre happened.

318
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,570
I wasn't there. I wasn't there.

319
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:30,080
We weren't experienced enough back then.

320
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,950
However, a certain individual was.

321
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,360
I have sinned.

322
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,690
I know you still bear a grudge against us.

323
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,940
I will apologize for what I've done.

324
00:23:39,870 --> 00:23:41,870
Thank you, Jade Deity.

325
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:47,500
If you didn't keep the Soul-Gathering Lamp, I would have no reason to live.

326
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,790
I barely survived to retrieve the Soul-Gathering Lamp

327
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:55,410
and revive my people so that Dongqiu can make a comeback.

328
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,260
And now, my wish has finally been granted.

329
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:01,740
Please get up. Please get up.

330
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:10,880
Immortal Qingheng, judging from your expression, could it be that you knew about this long ago?

331
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,900
I remember now.

332
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,990
You mentioned the topic of Dongqiu when you came to me.

333
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,030
I...

334
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:20,270
Immortal Qingheng didn't reveal my true identity back then.

335
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,580
He covered up for me instead.

336
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,400
I will never forget your kindness.

337
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,160
What took you so long to get the lamp?

338
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,590
Thank you, Masters.

339
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,870
Farewell.

340
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,860
Immortal Qingheng, you don't need to see me off.

341
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:02,770
I guess

342
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:06,820
you won't return to the Heavenly Realm in the future.

343
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:10,000
In the future, I'll remain in Dongqiu

344
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,430
to keep watch over the revival process and do all I can to revive Dongqiu.

345
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:20,360
Masters, I hope you three and Immortal Qingheng can visit Dongqiu in the future.

346
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,480
It's a promise.

347
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:45,140
- Imperial Father!
- They're back.

348
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:46,520
They're back.

349
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,460
Consort Mother.

350
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:49,290
- Imperial Father!
- Tan'er!

351
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,020
Sir!

352
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,780
Kui'er!

353
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:56,870
So, are you guys hurt?

354
00:25:56,870 --> 00:25:58,980
Did the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant make things difficult for you guys?

355
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,870
We aren't hurt at all.

356
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:03,110
We're perfectly fine.

357
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,490
Imperial Father, don't worry.

358
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:07,130
The Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant decided to give up and make a pact with us

359
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,970
after they saw Xuanshang and Chaofeng siding with us.

360
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:14,290
They feared our powers, and the Heavenly Empress was also willing to help us out.

361
00:26:14,290 --> 00:26:17,690
We won't get into a conflict with them again.

362
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:23,400
You guys actually escaped unscathed from such a dire situation?

363
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,850
This is truly fortunate.

364
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,840
This is truly fortunate!

365
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:34,740
Thank you guys for protecting them.

366
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,260
Emperor Tun,

367
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:40,070
I made a promise to you, didn't I?

368
00:26:40,070 --> 00:26:41,640
Emperor Tun,

369
00:26:42,230 --> 00:26:45,990
I won't let Kui'er get in harm's way when I'm around.

370
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:54,430
What did you guys call me just now?

371
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:57,390
Father-in-law.

372
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,570
Father-in-law.

373
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,710
Good boy.

374
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,470
You too.

375
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:09,200
Well...

376
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,460
it must've been a long trip.

377
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:17,830
I shall prepare a lavish banquet to celebrate your narrow escape!

378
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:19,940
Imperial Father, no need for the trouble.

379
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,780
We're just here to check in with you.

380
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,500
We'll depart for Dongqiu after this.

381
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:26,690
Why are you guys heading to Dongqiu?

382
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,950
It's a dangerous place.

383
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:29,290
My child, you mustn't go there!

384
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:33,790
Emperor Tun, you were tough when you confronted the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant.

385
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,640
Why are you suddenly so timid now?

386
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,790
You see, it's a long story.

387
00:27:40,790 --> 00:27:44,200
You guys have to listen to my tale.

388
00:27:54,290 --> 00:27:56,500
So, this is the place where we were born?

389
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,970
The last time I came here was the time Youqin attempted to repair Guixu.

390
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,270
Yeah.

391
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:03,100
I still remember the time I first met you.

392
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,130
You said I was 2,700 years old and that I was courting someone much younger than me.

393
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:08,950
Now that I think about it, I think our roles were reversed.

394
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:10,710
You do hold a grudge for a long time, don't you?

395
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:11,590
My goodness.

396
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:14,460
I guess you guys are respecting the old and cherishing the young, huh?

397
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,260
Just shut up.

398
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:17,870
It's been 10,000 years.

399
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,640
Dongqiu finally has its name cleared.

400
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,540
And now, I've finally obtained the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

401
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:23,300
The flower spirits are also accepted by the four realms now.

402
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,570
These are achievements that I didn't even dare to dream of.

403
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:27,770
Suzhi, don't worry.

404
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:29,810
Now, there are more than the three of us.

405
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:32,530
We have Immortal Xuanshang and Chaofeng with us too.

406
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:35,270
I'm sure Dongqiu can return to its former glory.

407
00:28:35,270 --> 00:28:37,080
To be honest,

408
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:42,920
I once worried that your husbands might part ways with you two when we were in deep trouble.

409
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:46,130
However, Immortal Xuanshang and Prince Chaofeng were sincere with you two.

410
00:28:46,130 --> 00:28:48,610
You guys weren't wrong about them.

411
00:28:50,540 --> 00:28:51,540
What are you waiting for?

412
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,920
Hurry and use the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

413
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:03,370
Father, Mother, I've finally done it.

414
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:07,500
The souls of the dead Dongqiu people that were bound for 10,000 years, they could finally be revived.

415
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:44,300
Hurry, run!

416
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,820
Youqin!

417
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:04,100
Chaofeng!

418
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,770
These aren't the souls of the dead Dongqiu people!

419
00:30:17,770 --> 00:30:20,080
It's the Heart-Devouring Array. It's an ancient spell known to the immortals.

420
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,130
Once you're caught by it, you cannot use your powers.

421
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,890
Hurry and think of something!

422
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:27,330
Why would there be a magic array within the Soul-Gathering Lamp?

423
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,810
Don't tell me it was a fake?

424
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:45,350
How could the Heavenly Emperor and I let you guys off this easily?

425
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:50,540
- Kui'er!
- Sister!

426
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,130
- Tan'er!
- Kui'er!

427
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,880
I only possess purity.

428
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,580
Your flower spirit power won't work on me.

429
00:31:06,890 --> 00:31:08,470
Tan'er!

430
00:31:15,810 --> 00:31:17,520
Tan'er!

431
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,970
You guys went back on your word like a scoundrel would!

432
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:23,230
Aren't you afraid that the beings of the four realms might laugh at you?

433
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,250
The beings of the four realms only knew that you two barged into the Ninth Heaven Hall

434
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:31,780
and forced me and the Void Tyrant into signing a pact with you two with the flower spirit power.

435
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,210
And now, you guys are attempting to break the seal of Guixu again.

436
00:31:35,210 --> 00:31:38,940
The immortals and voidwalkers have no choice but to eliminate you two to protect the four realms.

437
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:42,770
Therefore, the four realms will only be grateful to me.

438
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,410
Celestial Father!

439
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:47,520
Since young, you taught me to be an upright person!

440
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,440
But now, you've resorted to such underhand means!

441
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,010
Aren't you ashamed of yourself?

442
00:31:51,010 --> 00:31:53,310
I'm ridding the four realms of evil.

443
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:54,700
Why should I be ashamed?

444
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,840
The Soul-Devouring Array is an ancient spell known to the immortals.

445
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:00,580
Even the three masters cannot escape it unscathed.

446
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:03,670
Youqin, stop being willful.

447
00:32:03,670 --> 00:32:05,030
Royal Father,

448
00:32:05,030 --> 00:32:07,070
are you truly going to join hands with them?

449
00:32:07,070 --> 00:32:09,110
The twin flowers have powers that rival even the heavens themselves.

450
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,380
How could I tolerate their presence?

451
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,240
Get rid of the flower spirits.

452
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,170
Let's get this over with.

453
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,820
- Kui'er!
- No, Celestial Father!

454
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:42,080
I have one last thing to say about the seal of Guixu!

455
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:54,650
Speak!

456
00:32:59,370 --> 00:33:01,940
According to the legend, the gates of Guixu will open when the Twin Flower is present.

457
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:05,730
Since unlocking the seal of Guixu requires both of us,

458
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,090
if I die,

459
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:12,110
my younger sister won't be a threat to the four realms, right?

460
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,880
Princess Qingkui, you mustn't!

461
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,540
Kui'er, what nonsense are you talking about?

462
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:22,280
You fool! What are you saying?

463
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,790
Even if someone is supposed to die here, it should be me!

464
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,480
Don't pretend to be a heroine!

465
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,590
Put me down!

466
00:33:27,590 --> 00:33:30,370
Right now, we have no way out.

467
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,980
Instead of letting them wipe us out, I should be the sole sacrifice.

468
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:37,380
- Kui'er!
- Liguang Yetan can absorb impurity.

469
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:41,710
If I let her off, I'll be risking my own life.

470
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:44,410
Tan'er and I are flowers born from the same roots.

471
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:50,250
If I die, Ta'ern will lose her impurity-absorbing ability.

472
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:52,570
If you don't believe me,

473
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,260
you can ask Suzhi.

474
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,830
<i>Your flower spirit power will only dissipate</i>

475
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:03,600
<i>if one of you dies and the root is damaged.</i>

476
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:10,620
You fool! What are you saying?

477
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,500
What are you saying?

478
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:24,400
Suzhi, if you don't tell them, we'll all die here.

479
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:32,630
Put me down! Put me down!

480
00:34:49,310 --> 00:34:52,610
Suzhi was the sole survivor of the Dongqiu clan 10,000 years ago.

481
00:34:52,610 --> 00:34:56,260
She's the only one who knows flower spirits the best.

482
00:34:56,260 --> 00:35:00,560
Heavenly Emperor, Void Tyrant, if you two agree to let them go,

483
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,290
I will take my own life to resolve your doubts.

484
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,620
Once I'm dead, the flower spirit power will vanish.

485
00:35:07,620 --> 00:35:10,240
Yetan will turn into a mere mortal.

486
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:12,600
Guixu will forever be sealed away.

487
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,720
Heavenly Emperor, Void Tyrant, to the beings of the four realms,

488
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,090
not only will you guys protect the four realms, but you guys are also benevolent and generous.

489
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,440
Sister! Sister!

490
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,310
Heavenly Emperor just broke his promise! How could you trust him?

491
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:32,340
Even if you do die here, we'll be wiped out too!

492
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:36,980
Put me down! Put me down!

493
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:38,180
Sister!

494
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,850
Kui'er! I'm sure we can get out of here!

495
00:35:40,850 --> 00:35:42,970
Don't do anything silly!

496
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:49,290
Even if we do avoid their pursuit today, we'll never be able to live in peace.

497
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,790
This is the best ending for all of us.

498
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:04,610
Qingkui,

499
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,630
I promise you.

500
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:14,110
You fool! What nonsense are you saying?

501
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,050
Sister!

502
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,850
Sister, don't do it! Sister!

503
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:34,810
If you're willing to take your own life, I will let Liguang Yetan off.

504
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:38,210
Thank you, Heavenly Emperor, Void Tyrant.

505
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:44,140
Don't do it!

506
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:47,300
Kui'er!

507
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:52,000
- Don't do it!
- Sister, don't do it!

508
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:56,690
Your Highness!

509
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:07,870
Today, both the immortals and the voidwalkers will be our witness!

510
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:10,480
If the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant break their promise,

511
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,540
I hope all of you will reveal the truth to the four realms!

512
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:27,860
Put down the sword!

513
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,580
Tan'er,

514
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,390
let's be sisters again in our next life.

515
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,480
What nonsense are you saying?

516
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,430
Forget about the next life!

517
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:40,250
Put down the sword!

518
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,330
Kui'er!

519
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:49,040
In my this life,

520
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:52,060
I spent time with you.

521
00:37:52,790 --> 00:37:57,390
I'm already content with the joy I've had.

522
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:04,430
I've already seen the herbs you grew for me.

523
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:06,310
Thank you.

524
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,430
Chaofeng.

525
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,160
Kui'er!

526
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:28,930
- Kui'er!
- Sister!

527
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,390
Kui'er!

528
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:44,210
No!

529
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,740
Your Highness!

530
00:39:25,290 --> 00:39:27,620
Sister!

531
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:34,350
Sister!

532
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,160
Sister!

533
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:46,720
Kui'er!

534
00:41:22,730 --> 00:41:23,840
Tan'er!

535
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,900
Your Highness! Your Highness!

536
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,200
Your Highness! Your Highness!

537
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:35,470
Heavenly Emperor, do we really let Liguang Yetan go?

538
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:38,950
I will only bring Shaodian Youqin back to the Heavenly Realm.

539
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:01,320
Tan'er! Tan'er!

540
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,890
Tan'er!

541
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,340
What else do you guys want?

542
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,080
Are you going to kill all of us?

543
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,230
Your Highness! Your Highness!

544
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:47,710
Guards! Guards!

545
00:42:47,710 --> 00:42:50,410
Guards!
