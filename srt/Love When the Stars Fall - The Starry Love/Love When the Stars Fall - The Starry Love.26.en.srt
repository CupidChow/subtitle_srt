Are you still the fearsome Yanfang that I know?

21
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,460
Fine.

22
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,520
You won't attack them? I will!

23
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,190
Come forth.

24
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,080
Gather the army.

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,670
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

26
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,410
Back off, all of you!

27
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,980
- Noted.
- Noted.

28
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:11,570
Yingzhao, are you mad?

29
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:13,320
Yes, I'm mad.

30
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:15,490
I can't let Yun'er die in vain!

31
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,840
Of course, I won't let Yun'er die in vain.

32
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,160
When the time is right, I'll definitely give you an answer.

33
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,970
What about Chaofeng?

34
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:26,690
And Yetan? Xue Qingxin?

35
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:30,330
They deserve to die for associating with the immortals!

36
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,640
- Guards!
<i>- Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,760
Capture Chaofeng and his men back here now.

38
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,140
Detain all the soldiers under Chaofeng's command and execute them on a chosen day!

39
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,550
<i>Yes, Your Majesty.</i>

40
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,390
I have something to verify with you, Jade Deity.

41
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:04,380
You were the one who secretly planned and told Princess Qingkui the method of reviving Youqin.

42
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,640
Is that correct?

43
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,090
At that time, I was soft-hearted for a moment.

44
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:13,920
But I thought you already accepted His Highness just now.

45
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,520
If I wanted to hold them accountable,

46
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,550
I would have apprehended and brought the three of them back to the Heavenly Realm.

47
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,650
It was because I'm aware of how important Youqin is

48
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:28,270
to the Heavenly Realm and the immortals.

49
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:31,940
That's why I turned a blind eye to their actions.

50
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:33,100
Your Majesty is wise.

51
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,540
But I'm still concerned.

52
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:42,670
Would using the Shards of Desire to revive Youqin really not turn him into a threat to the Heavenly Realm?

53
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,140
There is no precedent for such an incident.

54
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:49,760
However, the behavior of Empyrean Xuanshang today is no different from before.

55
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,080
In my opinion, you don't have to worry.

56
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:59,980
It is because Youqin is the pillar of the Heavenly Realm that I must be more cautious.

57
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,300
We still need to observe further.

58
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,980
Guangtian.

59
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,790
Yes, Your Majesty.

60
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,670
There are many important tasks to manage in the Heavenly Realm.

61
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:15,410
Tomorrow, go to Penglai Hall and learn how to manage official duties with Youqin.

62
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,760
Youqin has just been revived and shouldn't be overworked.

63
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,390
Learn quickly, so you can share Empyrean Xuanshang's burden.

64
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

65
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,560
Come back.

66
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,910
Do you understand what I'm implying?

67
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,910
Yes, Your Majesty.

68
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,390
Now, go.

69
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:43,860
I have to worry about everything in the Heavenly Realm, even the most trifle things.

70
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,880
<i>Fiery, Wen Ren, Heartless...</i>

71
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,280
<i>So are you just going to disappear without a trace like this?</i>

72
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,720
Tan Tan, don't be sad.

73
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,680
The soul shards may be gone.

74
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,240
But Empyrean Xuanshang has been revived, and your Iridescent Eyes have been removed.

75
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,540
If you truly care for him, you should be happy for him.

76
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,560
But he has become that Heartless Shaodian again.

77
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,430
I did so much for him, but he doesn't remember anything.

78
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,330
Man Man, you may go back first.

79
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,740
I want to be alone for a while.

80
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:26,620
Is it you guys, Heartless, Fiery, and Wen Ren?

81
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:30,880
Are you trying to tell me that you're all still here?

82
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,980
Princess.

83
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:46,220
Your Highness.

84
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:49,500
I'm Shaodian Youqin.

85
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:56,280
I'm also your Fiery, Wen Ren, and Heartless.

86
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:03,340
No way. At the Ninth Heaven Hall, you said you didn't remember anything.

87
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,680
If I didn't say those things back then, the memories of the soul shards would really have been lost.

88
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,980
You know Celestial Father opposed using the Shards of Desire to revive me.

89
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:18,690
If he knew the memories of the three Shards of Desire were still there, he would really try to obliterate them.

90
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:22,090
Then our past would be gone, too.

91
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,370
That's why I lied.

92
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:27,180
So you remember us back then?

93
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:31,560
I remember every word and every moment.

94
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,470
I remember the fireworks I set off for you.

95
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>I remember spending all my money on you.</i>

96
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,120
<i>And the painting you made for me.</i>

97
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:48,720
I also remember every time you risked your life for me

98
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,950
and the letters you wrote to me, hoping I wouldn't be so hard on myself.

99
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,780
You're such a liar.

100
00:07:58,780 --> 00:08:03,360
I thought you had forgotten everything, and it made me sad for half a day.

101
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,130
I'm sorry.

102
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,250
I love you.

103
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:30,780
What did you say?

104
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,540
I love you.

105
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:39,900
Looking back, even before restoring the Guixu, I already had feelings for you.

106
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,240
I never really faced my own feelings because of my cultivation.

107
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:49,440
But everything we experienced together in the human world made me realize how important you are to me.

108
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,920
So from now on, I don't want to miss any more chances.

109
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,120
But if you remember all of this...

110
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,900
<i>I'm the second daughter of the human race's Emperor Tun.</i>

111
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:11,980
<i>By accident, I married into the Heavenly Realm and that was how I met Shaodian Youqin.</i>

112
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:14,610
Do you also remember that I'm not...

113
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,920
That you're not Liguang Qingkui, but Liguang Yetan?

114
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,210
Why does it matter?

115
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:21,590
It doesn't matter who you are.

116
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,520
What matters is you.

117
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:25,440
♫ <i>It all turned into sweetness</i> ♫

118
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,630
♫ <i>I am you, and you are me</i> ♫

119
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,680
Why? Do you still not believe me?

120
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:34,830
I believe you.

121
00:09:34,830 --> 00:09:36,530
It's just that I'm afraid to think about it...

122
00:09:36,530 --> 00:09:38,700
Then don't think about anything.

123
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:43,960
No matter what happens from now on, I'll stay by your side.

124
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,040
♫ <i>Who sweetened my parched heart</i> ♫

125
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,900
♫ <i>Who sweetened my parched heart</i> ♫

126
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:57,780
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

127
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,630
<i>That you're not Liguang Qingkui, but Liguang Yetan?</i>

128
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,920
<i>Why does it matter?</i>

129
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,313
<i>It doesn't matter who you are.</i>

130
00:10:17,313 --> 00:10:19,693
<i>What matters is you.</i>

131
00:10:20,990 --> 00:10:22,850
<i>I love you.</i>

132
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,810
Look at you being smitten.

133
00:10:25,810 --> 00:10:28,540
Why are you different from your despairing look yesterday?

134
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,510
It's a secret.

135
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:37,540
If you don't tell me, I won't give you this Rainbow Whisperer.

136
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,130
What's so special about this thing? Let me take a look.

137
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,950
You see...

138
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,610
So Empyrean Xuanshang remembers...

139
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:55,970
Keep your voice down. Someone could hear you.

140
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,980
If the Heavenly Emperor finds out, he'll get rid of all three soul shards.

141
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,660
Then my Youqin will not remember anything.

142
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:04,970
All right. I understand.

143
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,560
Where did you get this magic tool?

144
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,300
It's called Rainbow Whisperer.

145
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,410
Prince Di Lanjue specially told me to bring it for you.

146
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,703
He knew that after you ascended to the heavens, you would be worried about your sister's safety.

147
00:11:13,703 --> 00:11:17,000
So he made this magic tool for you to contact your sister anytime.

148
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,900
So you don't have to carve letters on your arms anymore.

149
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,120
He knows you're afraid of pain.

150
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,300
He also said, now that you have found your true love,

151
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,980
he's willing to give up and asked me to convey his best wishes to you.

152
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,840
And he'll be your lifelong best friend.

153
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,260
Of course, there's me too.

154
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,960
In a critical moment, my best friend is still reliable.

155
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,940
Fortunately, I have you too, my bird.

156
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:51,970
Your sister is calling you.

157
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,160
<i>Are you there?</i>

158
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,340
Yes, just talk into it like this.

159
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:00,230
Sister, are you safe?

160
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,440
I'm safe.

161
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,740
Did you get hurt?

162
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:06,380
No, I didn't. I'm lucky, and I'm doing well.

163
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,700
That's great.

164
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,080
<i>Then I can go to White Bamboo Valley with Chaofeng without worries.</i>

165
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:14,030
- I'll leave you two to it. I'll keep watch at the door.
- All right.

166
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,640
Sister.

167
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,590
Man Man.

168
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:27,080
Immortal Qingheng! Why are you here?

169
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,050
Where's sister-in-law? I came to check on her health.

170
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,420
Your sister-in-law is doing well.

171
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,030
Immortal Qingheng! Please leave.

172
00:12:32,030 --> 00:12:33,700
Please go back.

173
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:36,050
Is she not willing to see me?

174
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,510
You were fuming with rage toward her in the human world. Now you're coming to her again?

175
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:40,890
Haven't you had enough?

176
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:44,000
I behaved that way in the human world because I was eager to save eldest brother.

177
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,930
I want both of you not to be mad at me anymore.

178
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,580
I know sister-in-law is still resentful.

179
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,680
But now that eldest brother has returned. Everything is already resolved.

180
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,440
Please help me persuade sister-in-law.

181
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:58,210
It's all good. It's not a serious matter. I'm no longer angry.

182
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,270
Sister-in-law...

183
00:13:01,270 --> 00:13:04,760
I mean, whether he's Empyrean Xuanshang or the soul shards, it's still him.

184
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,410
I've come around now. So I won't dwell on it anymore.

185
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,460
You came just in time. I wanted to ask you something.

186
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:14,980
Do you know where Fairy Husui was sent to clean?

187
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,130
Isn't she here?

188
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,080
Maybe we've stayed in the human realm too long that she might be assigned to someone else.

189
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,880
She clashed with General Guangtian so I could go to the human realm. Could it be...

190
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,450
What's wrong?

191
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,560
Oh, nothing. It's all because of me.

192
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,610
I'll go and find out where she is.

193
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:38,900
<i>What's wrong with him?</i>

194
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,760
Since Empyrean Xuanshang woke up with the memories of his soul shards,

195
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,580
are you going to stay in the Heavenly Realm now?

196
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:50,050
Of course. Youqin will come over later. I need to go bathe and get changed.

197
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:51,130
What are you doing?

198
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:54,130
We'll enjoy a romantic moment together, of course.

199
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:08,370
Kui'er,

200
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,150
Feng'er said you just talked to your sister.

201
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:16,550
So, how's Princess Yetan doing in the Heavenly Realm?

202
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:17,620
Tan'er is doing well.

203
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:21,320
She has decided to stay in the Heavenly Realm as Empyrean Xuanshang's Empyrean Consort.

204
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,180
She had been treated coldly in the human world for 18 years. Only the immortals have treated her kindly.

205
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:28,880
It's a relief to know that she has a place she feels belongs now.

206
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,700
You and your sister share a deep bond.

207
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:34,730
I hope she'll behave herself in the future. So she won't implicate you by causing trouble or getting hurt.

208
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,040
How is that implicating me?

209
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,810
We should hurry and head to White Bamboo Valley.

210
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:43,760
I've packed everything up.

211
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:47,250
Kui'er, you grew up in the Human Realm since childhood.

212
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:50,390
It'll be really hard for you to travel with us.

213
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,000
Let's stay in the Human Realm for a bit longer.

214
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,660
If there's anything you want to eat or play with, just let Feng'er buy it.

215
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:01,240
Thank you, Consort Xue.

216
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,710
Don't you think it's time to stop addressing me as Consort Xue?

217
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:07,610
Call her Consort Mother.

218
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,680
Consort Mother.

219
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:21,840
Have you decided to wear this?

220
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,080
No. This is not as good as the previous one.

221
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,650
Is there a difference between this and the last one?

222
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:34,560
The lines on the clothes are completely different.

223
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:46,300
What about this one?

224
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:53,640
The new pair of shoes you're wearing is the finishing touch to perfectly set off your heroic posture.

225
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:56,110
The only thing I haven't changed is my shoes.

226
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,090
Then do you...

227
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,540
It's all right. You can stop looking.

228
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:14,800
Which one do you think matches my robe better, this silver-white sash or this moon-white sash on me?

229
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:23,390
I can't tell the difference.

230
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,800
If you can't tell the difference, she won't even tell.

231
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,840
Why are all my clothes so plain?

232
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,210
I'll inform the Heavenly Attire Bureau right away to customize new clothes for you.

233
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,720
No need.

234
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:36,650
I don't trust your judgment.

235
00:16:36,650 --> 00:16:38,630
I should go in person.

236
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,060
<i>You were the one who always liked the refined and elegant style and wanted me to keep up with you.</i>

237
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:46,820
<i>Why are you blaming me for having poor taste now?</i>

238
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:52,580
Your Highness,

239
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:56,560
you told the Heavenly Emperor earlier that you don't remember what happened in the Human Realm.

240
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,840
But in fact, you do remember them, don't you?

241
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:09,770
How did you know?

242
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,760
I've been serving you for thousands of years.

243
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,360
How could I not tell?

244
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:17,790
You're right.

245
00:17:18,450 --> 00:17:21,730
But this matter must not get out.

246
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,920
However, it's not just me who has changed.

247
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:31,590
Empyrean Consort also treats me differently from before.

248
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:37,340
Feichi, do you think my black hair looks dull?

249
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:39,010
Why don't I use magic to turn it red?

250
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:40,610
Your Highness,

251
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,460
it's not necessary.

252
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:44,520
If you were delayed because of the hair color,

253
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:46,160
aren't you afraid that Her Highness will get anxious from waiting?

254
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,750
You have a point.

255
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,060
A love-struck immortal sure is scary.

256
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,080
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

257
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,250
Your Highness.

258
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:12,360
General Guangtian, what brings you to Penglai Hall?

259
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,870
I'm learning about managing Heavenly Realm's official affairs

260
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:17,300
from Your Highness under the Heavenly Emperor's order.

261
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:21,200
<i>As expected, celestial father will not let this matter go that easily.</i>

262
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,480
Now that the four realms are peaceful, there are only some trivial matters.

263
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,930
When I do need some assistance, I'll invite you over.

264
00:18:28,930 --> 00:18:33,060
Your Highness, as a military officer, I'm not very familiar with documents.

265
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:35,900
In case of an emergency, I'm afraid it'll delay important matters.

266
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,590
So I should come over early.

267
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:42,350
I'll always accompany Your Highness in the future.

268
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:45,030
If that's the case, then do as you please.

269
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:47,410
Thank you, Your Highness.

270
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,660
Your Highness, so what are the tasks for today...

271
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:52,940
Your Highness.

272
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:55,180
Your Highness, wait for me.

273
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,780
<i>[Tianpa Hall]</i>

274
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,180
♫ <i>I have this sudden yearning to hear you say, "I like you"</i> ♫

275
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:25,460
♫ <i>How do I put this feeling into words and foreshadow my little excitements?</i> ♫

276
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,820
♫ <i>Maybe our superstitious of love is sweet</i> ♫

277
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,180
♫ <i>I sink into your tender gaze like a river of love</i> ♫

278
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,860
♫ <i>Cherishing each other and just talk about anything</i> ♫

279
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,820
♫ <i>You say we should stargaze together</i> ♫

280
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:51,980
When a man and a woman meet, the woman should be waiting for the man to pick her up.

281
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,690
Why were you so impatient and jumped into my arms?

282
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,530
That was an accident.

283
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:01,500
Besides, men and women are equal.

284
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:04,870
Who says women have to stay at home and wait for someone to come?

285
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,430
My habit is to...

286
00:20:06,430 --> 00:20:07,980
To throw yourself at me.

287
00:20:07,990 --> 00:20:09,410
I know that.

288
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:10,810
Why? You're not used to it?

289
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,370
If you're not used to it, we can forget about it.

290
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:18,810
When you appeared, I'm becoming less like an immortal.

291
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:23,200
Then what are you like?

292
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,120
Like your husband, silly.

293
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,770
Don't forget.

294
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:30,600
You were chasing me to be your husband when I was in Human Realm.

295
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,060
I remember it very well.

296
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,140
You!

297
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:35,840
All right. I'm sorry.

298
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:40,750
So since it's our first official date, how are you going to make it up to me?

299
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,170
Whatever you want, Dear.

300
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:47,110
Let's go.

301
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,960
Your Highness! Your...

302
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,970
Your Highness, you walked too fast. I almost couldn't catch up.

303
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:59,780
Greetings, Princess Qingkui.

304
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,570
Didn't you say you're going to make it up to me? Why is he here?

305
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:08,110
Celestial Father's "gift" to keep watch on me.

306
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,180
But if he keeps following us...

307
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,390
Worry not.

308
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:16,330
As long as I make him think I'm still the same Empyrean Xuanshang, I can send him off.

309
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:19,560
I'll take you to a place. So play along with me.

310
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:37,730
Do you still remember this place?

311
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:38,950
It does look familiar.

312
00:21:38,950 --> 00:21:42,570
When you first arrived in Heavenly Realm, you stole Crane-Riding Deity's Mystical Crane Eggs.

313
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:45,080
You've violated the Heavenly Rules and angered the immortals.

314
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,840
I brought you here to reflect upon your mistakes.

315
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,560
Do not commit such deeds in the future.

316
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:55,070
<i>His Highness is the same meticulous Empyrean Xuanshang as before.</i>

317
00:21:55,070 --> 00:21:56,700
<i>Could His Majesty overthink?</i>

318
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,510
I've never practiced Abstinence Techniques.

319
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:00,180
What if I'm hungry?

320
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:02,340
Speaking of this, I'm hungry now.

321
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,900
We now have the Dining Hall.

322
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:07,500
You must refrain from doing such underhanded means.

323
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,600
General Guangtian.

324
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:09,900
Yes, Your Highness.

325
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,900
Princess Qingkui is hungry.

326
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,200
What do you mean?

327
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Go to the Dining Hall and prepare some dishes from the Human Realm.

328
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:24,000
Me? Your Highness, I'm here to learn from you, not to run errands.

329
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,600
I wanted to send Feichi. But when he saw you coming, he didn't follow.

330
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:31,000
So please go, General Guangtian.

331
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,400
But I... Your Highness...

332
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,600
Any problems?

333
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,100
Yes, Your Highness.

334
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,900
Now that he's gone, did you really bring me here to reflect on my mistake?

335
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,400
About the Mystical Crane Egg incident back then, I scolded you.

336
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,400
Today, I'm here to make it up to you.

337
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
What kind of compensation is a kiss?

338
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:59,700
Then does it count if we steal some Mystical Crane Eggs?

339
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,200
Yes.

340
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
Let's go.

341
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,200
Your Highness, you must speak up for me.

342
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,200
Crane-Riding Deity, please get up.

343
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,200
What's the matter?

344
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,800
I apologize to bother you again, Your Highness.

345
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:26,800
It's just that someone stole my Mystical Crane Eggs again!

346
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,600
Crane-Riding Deity, do you know who did it?

347
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:33,200
I've been thinking about it, and there is only one person who has stolen my eggs.

348
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,400
But I don't have any evidence.

349
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:40,200
I'm just guessing if it was Princess Qingkui's doing it again.

350
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,500
Your Highness, you've always been fair.

351
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,900
You must handle this fairly.

352
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,700
Crane-Riding Deity, how can you just rely on guesses...

353
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,500
Youqin, the tea eggs are ready!

354
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,600
What? Tea eggs?

355
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,600
My eggs...

356
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,500
Oh, my eggs...

357
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,400
Crane-Riding Deity...

358
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:13,200
Your Highness! Your Highness!

359
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,100
My Millennia Tea Shrub was...

360
00:24:16,100 --> 00:24:17,800
What?

361
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,500
Your Highness, everything in this world belongs to the immortals.

362
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:29,000
We're only taking care of them under orders.

363
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:36,300
Your Highness, if you want to eat these Mystical Crane Eggs again, just let us know.

364
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:42,000
We'll send the tea leaves and the eggs to you.

365
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,700
Yes, that's right.

366
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,900
You see, they belong to everyone. So don't be shy.

367
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,000
These tea eggs...

368
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,500
No, it's not what you think.

369
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:54,800
I thought as... as the Empyrean Consort,

370
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:58,200
I thought there was no harm in eating two eggs.

371
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,900
I even planned to invite His Highness to taste them with me.

372
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:08,500
It's indeed as His Highness said that both of you play favorites.

373
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,600
It's all my fault.

374
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,600
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

375
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
But His Highness punished me to copy the Heavenly Rules 800 times.

376
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
It was such a heavy punishment.

377
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,000
- Did she say 800 times?
- It was too much for me.

378
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,000
You're utterly ridiculous!

379
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,000
You will copy the Heavenly Rules 800 times in front of these tea eggs!

380
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,700
I just want you to see them without having them, and torment your mind. So you'll remember today's lesson!

381
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,600
Understand?

382
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,700
Yes, I understand.

383
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:43,900
All right. So that's what happened.

384
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,500
It's merely a Mystical Crane Egg.

385
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,000
The punishment is too harsh.

386
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,300
- Yes, that's right.
- It's too harsh.

387
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:51,300
No! It's not harsh at all.

388
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:53,400
You two should not defend her.

389
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
She must be punished severely today.

390
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:59,400
If you're partial to her again in the future, I will not tolerate it.

391
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,400
By then, I will have her copy the Heavenly Rules 1,000 times and that's even not enough!

392
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,600
<i>No. We won't do that.</i>

393
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:11,700
We will definitely remember to abide by the Heavenly Rules and never neglect our duties.

394
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,500
Yes.

395
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:18,200
All right. You two can go now.

396
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,200
All right.

397
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:25,500
Let's go.

398
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,000
- My eggs...
- Come on.

399
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
Let's go.

400
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,700
Hurry now.

401
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
I was wondering why you were so confident and unapologetic.

402
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,300
Look how you scared those two deities.

403
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,200
It's all right.

404
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:44,400
I can just compensate them more for their annual salary next year.

405
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,000
You're such a dishonest immortal.

406
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,500
- Time to eat.
- Come on.

407
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,500
The abstinence from food in the Heavenly Realm really needs to be changed.

408
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:07,200
If I had eaten food earlier, perhaps I could have improved my cultivation and not perished in Guixu.

409
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,000
Don't you immortals only consume pure air?

410
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,200
The Force of Chaos is actually the undifferentiated mixture of purity and impurity.

411
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,500
In the past, immortals believed that pure air was good.

412
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:21,300
So they only consume pure air and focused on cultivating with pure air.

413
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:25,500
But they didn't know that turbid air was also indispensable in the world.

414
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,700
It's not a bad thing.

415
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,800
So that's what the Force of Chaos is.

416
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:34,100
However, no one has ever come out alive from Guixu.

417
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,000
So nobody knows its secrets.

418
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,600
There's one more left. You can have it.

419
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,800
I'm too full.

420
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
- It's for you.
- You eat it.

421
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
- No, you eat it.
- Your Highness!

422
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,200
Your Highness.

423
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,300
Your Highness, Princess Qingkui.

424
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,700
It smells good here.

425
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:04,300
What is this smell?

426
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't smell anything. General Guangtian, you must be mistaken.

427
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,400
Am I? That couldn't be.

428
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:15,400
General Guangtian, what brings you here?

429
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,900
Didn't you tell me to make preparations at the Dining Hall?

430
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,000
Yes, I did. So is the meal prepared?

431
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
No.

432
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,200
I wanted to. But I ran into Fairy Biqiong on my way there.

433
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,200
She invited Your Highness to her birthday banquet tonight.

434
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,200
So I assumed Princess Qingkui would accompany you.

435
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:38,700
So I didn't have the Dining Hall to prepare anything and rush over here to report to both of you.

436
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,400
General Guangtian! General Guangtian.

437
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,900
These are the official documents you need to study.

438
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,600
All of them have been approved by His Highness.

439
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,000
Look through them and then come to me for more.

440
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,200
The Library of Scriptures has over ten thousand volumes.

441
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,600
More than ten thousand volumes?

442
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,000
General, studying is important. You should go quickly.

443
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,700
This is too much. This...

444
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,400
Tan'er, should I attend Fairy Biqiong's birthday banquet?

445
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:27,400
You're her cousin. It won't be appropriate if you don't go.

446
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,800
I just want to be with you every moment now.

447
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,280
If you're not going, I'm not going.

448
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,400
It doesn't matter to me.

449
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:39,800
But since it's a birthday banquet, shouldn't we bring some gifts?

450
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:43,500
Why don't we pick some from your treasure hall?

451
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,000
No, absolutely not. No way!

452
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,200
Why does this action look so familiar?

453
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
Why don't

454
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,000
we give her this?

455
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,200
Tea egg?

456
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,800
Do you want the whole Heavenly Realm to know we stole eggs?

457
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,800
I meant the soup.

458
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,800
You're really stingy.

459
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
We'll give her this then.

460
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,000
<i>- Quickly now.
- Come on.</i>

461
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,000
<i>Fairy Biqiong, happy birthday.</i>

462
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,400
- <i>This is my gift.</i>
- <i>This is mine.</i>

463
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,600
Biqiong.

464
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,800
Brother, you're here.
<i>[Nongqing Pavilion]</i>

465
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:21,000
I heard you're going to be the Deputy Instructor at Shangshu Academy.

466
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:23,300
Shangshu Academy is known for its strict selection process.

467
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:26,300
For you to be selected is a true honor for our Xia clan.

468
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,100
In the future, both of us can take care of each other in the Heavenly Realm.

469
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,600
Today is your birthday.

470
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:36,500
So I brought something you've always wanted, the Danxia Cloud Brocade.

471
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,700
You're the best to me.

472
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,800
Here, take it.

473
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:41,300
Thank you, Brother.

474
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:43,600
Biqiong, happy birthday.

475
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,300
Auntie, you're here.

476
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:48,600
Auntie, thank you for coming to celebrate Biqiong's birthday.

477
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,800
I heard Knowledge Star Deity elevated you to be an instructor at Shangshu Academy.

478
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:55,300
It's not worth mentioning.

479
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:58,800
Everyone is giving her valuable gifts.

480
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:02,400
Is it inappropriate for us to just give her this?

481
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,500
Why?

482
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,400
A birthday banquet is meant to receive the blessings of all the immortals.

483
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,200
If she thinks our gift is not good enough, she might as well not hold this birthday banquet.

484
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,600
If she finds out that you're so stingy, she'll be livid.

485
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,800
This is a treasure.

486
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,000
All right. Whatever you say.

487
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,400
Cousin.

488
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm very happy that you can attend my birthday banquet.

489
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:30,400
Fairy Biqiong, you're too kind.

490
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:32,000
This is...

491
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,900
A gift.

492
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:43,200
I'll surely cherish the gift you give me.

493
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,400
Please forgive me for my ignorance.

494
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:57,600
May I know what kind of rare treasure you have gifted me?

495
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,100
This is soup.

496
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,800
It's a tea-based soup from the Human Realm.

497
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,300
His Highness enjoyed this earthly delicacy very much when he was in the Human Realm.

498
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,900
So he asked me to make some for you to taste.

499
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,800
He said that you're pure and simple, not interested in exotic treasures.

500
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,000
So we must send a gift that represents our own thoughts.

501
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes, that's right.

502
00:32:20,500 --> 00:32:24,400
Thank you, Cousin. You sure know me well.

503
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,400
Fairy Biqiong looks more beautiful than ever.
<i>[Nongqing Pavilion</i>

504
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:32,000
Thank you for the compliment, Auntie.

505
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,300
Later, I'll perform a song for everyone.

506
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:36,600
All right, you may go ahead.

507
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,060
This is really delicious.

508
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,380
Today is my birthday.

509
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,910
To thank everyone for coming to celebrate with me,

510
00:32:45,910 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm willing to perform a song to liven up the atmosphere.

511
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,820
- Sure.
- All right.

512
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,530
I still remember the times when my cousin and I played the zither and flute together.

513
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:07,610
I wonder if you're willing to play with me today.

514
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:11,400
You can consider it fulfilling my birthday wish.

515
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:18,420
It's just playing a song. Go ahead.

516
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,910
In that case, let's begin.

517
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:43,660
Empyrean Xuanshang's zither and Fairy Biqiong's flute are truly unique in the Heavenly Realm.

518
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:50,280
The two playing together is like flowing water, smooth jades, and shining pearls.

519
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,310
It's truly an honor to listen to it today.

520
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:56,460
- Yes.
- That's right.

521
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,960
Exactly.

522
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:31,290
<i>[Nongqing Pavilion]</i>

523
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:56,980
Sister-in-law, I heard that you are proficient in music, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

524
00:34:56,980 --> 00:35:00,300
Why not play a song today?

525
00:35:01,290 --> 00:35:05,050
It's Fairy Biqiong's birthday banquet. I don't need to play anything.

526
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:05,940
Sister-in-law.

527
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,520
It's all right. There's no need to.

528
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,860
<i>Sister-in-law is so modest. But Biqiong is full of plots.</i>

529
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,560
<i>She knows sister-in-law and eldest brother are the perfect match.</i>

530
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,640
<i>Yet she's still not giving up and keeps suppressing sister-in-law.</i>

531
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,820
<i>It's surprising sister-in-law can endure this.</i>

532
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:28,440
- Very good.
- Splendid.

533
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,700
Melodious.

534
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,580
A heavenly masterpiece, indeed.

535
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:34,280
Thank you, Fairy Biqiong, for your performance.

536
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:37,120
I enjoyed it very much.

537
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,960
<i>No. I must not let Biqiong surpass sister-in-law anymore.</i>

538
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,340
I've heard Princess Qingkui's skill in zither is unparalleled in the Human Realm.

539
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:51,140
Would you all like to hear her play?

540
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:53,760
- Yes!
- Yes!

541
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,080
<i>Yes, we would love to.</i>

542
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,940
<i>I finally had the opportunity to perform together with cousin and show everyone how well-matched we are.</i>

543
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,380
<i>Why does Qingkui have to upstage me?</i>

544
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:04,240
I'll have to decline.

545
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,080
Ziwu, if Princess Qingkui doesn't want to, don't force her.

546
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,120
Eldest Brother, can't you tell?

547
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,160
Sister-in-law is just being modest.

548
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,180
Sister-in-law, don't be modest.

549
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:16,020
Everyone is waiting.

550
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,080
Come on.

551
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,800
Play.

552
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,280
<i>It must be this key.</i>

553
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,000
<i>I'm sure of it.</i>

554
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:10,000
Eldest Brother, is sister-in-law doing this on purpose?

555
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,480
Yes, she did it on purpose.

556
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,980
She's being jealous.

557
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:22,820
<i>This... Princess Qingkui of the Liguang Clan, how can she be not skilled in music?</i>

558
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,260
Eldest Brother, what do you think about Princess Qingkui's skills in zither?

559
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,800
Good!

560
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:52,560
I meant Princess Qingkui

561
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,920
played it...

562
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,340
She played...

563
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,720
Played...

564
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,660
Played it loud enough!

565
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,540
- Well done.
- Nicely played.

566
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:32,840
<i>I'm dead.</i>

567
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:34,280
<i>I spoke without thinking.</i>

568
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:37,660
<i>She must be upset when I said she played loudly.</i>

569
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:44,160
Heartless Shaodian, you're really...

570
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,720
I really didn't do that on purpose. Listen to my deceit.

571
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,240
I mean, my explanation.

572
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,080
It's not what you think.

573
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,280
I was...

574
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,780
At that time, I...

575
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,580
You're pretty clever.

576
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,180
Clever? Am I clever?

577
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:01,940
Yes, you're very clever.

578
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:04,660
I thought I was going to get caught for playing like that today.

579
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,700
But you saved me with a convincing excuse.

580
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,180
Don't... Don't you care how others see you?

581
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,320
I don't care.

582
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:14,660
If one person in the family can do one thing, isn't that enough?

583
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:17,160
That's great. That's a relief. It really is.

584
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,860
But I was worried when I saw Biqiong's reaction.

585
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,600
Why?

586
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,340
The gap between my sister and me is just too big.

587
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:35,080
If I want to stay in the Heavenly Realm for a long time, I'm afraid I'll have to be more cautious.

588
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,140
It won't be you anymore.

589
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,180
Your Highness!

590
00:39:40,180 --> 00:39:41,700
Your...

591
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,880
General Guangtian has something important to discuss.

592
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,680
So...

593
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:55,440
I'll go back to Penglai Hall first and come back to you later.

594
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,200
Go.

595
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,900
- Wait for me.
- All right.

596
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:19,260
Madam, Miss, check out this fine textile. Come and have a look.

597
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,620
Let's go and take a look.

598
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,400
We can't buy any more.

599
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,620
Let's not get this one. We already bought a lot.

600
00:40:24,620 --> 00:40:26,400
You don't like this one, right?

601
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,160
Then we won't get this one.

602
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,780
We'll take everything else.

603
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,120
Help me pack them up.

604
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,880
- Consort Mother, it's too much.
- Let's go.

605
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,460
That stall over there looks good, too. Let's see what they have.

606
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:35,660
What are you doing?

607
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,140
We're in the street here.

608
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:38,280
- Give it to me.
- Behave yourself.

609
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,500
- Hey, watch your manners.
- Give it to me.

610
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:41,960
Haichao, come and help me.

611
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,880
All right.

612
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:45,780
What's wrong? Did anything happen?

613
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:48,740
- Sir, the Void Patrol Battalion—
- Shui'er,

614
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,580
carry the stuff.

615
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,500
Are you hiding something from me?

616
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:05,120
Sir, we've been with you for so many years, not for power or fame.

617
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,800
We just want you and Consort Xue to live a good life.

618
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:10,080
You may have lost your magic power.

619
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,680
But you can finally marry Princess Qingkui.

620
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,780
We're genuinely happy for you.

621
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:17,280
Let's put aside what happens in the Void.

622
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,120
Come, give me that.

623
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,100
Shui'er,

624
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,740
my money bag is with you.

625
00:41:28,740 --> 00:41:30,520
Remember to haggle the prices.

626
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:39,580
<i>Detain all of Chaofeng's troops and execute them on a chosen date.</i>

627
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:49,500
<i>[Jufu Inn]</i>

628
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:55,440
Consort Mother is too kind.

629
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,440
She took care of everything for me.

630
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,780
When we arrive in White Bamboo Valley, we won't lack anything anymore.

631
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,200
What's wrong?

632
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,780
You were quiet all the way.

633
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:15,460
Nothing.

634
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:20,520
I was just thinking about what we can do after we arrive in White Bamboo Valley.

635
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:24,800
As long as we reach there, no matter what we do,

636
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:28,680
it would be best to plant a grove of Schima superb trees in front of the courtyard.

637
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,900
Then we can stroll among the flowers and gaze at the stars.

638
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,580
What do you think?

639
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,660
It's a great idea.

640
00:42:37,660 --> 00:42:39,520
I'll plant them for you.
