00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,110
Today is the sixth day of the tenth month.

22
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,740
I've returned to face the world again.

23
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,290
My reputation and luck are worse than before.

24
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:17,160
But it doesn't matter how this life will turn out.

25
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,810
I'll make it a brilliant one.

26
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,120
Why are you staring at me like that?

27
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:34,180
I was thinking, besides the Rooftop Swallow Mansion, you resemble something else too.

28
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,320
What is it?

29
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,320
The Herb of Nine Lives.

30
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,620
What... What is this thing?

31
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,860
The name sounds terrible.

32
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,150
It's a type of plant.

33
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,470
It has an incredibly tenacious life force.

34
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:48,240
Even if you don't water it for half a year, it won't die.

35
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:54,080
Even if it withers, it'll revive after it encounters a rain shower.

36
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,260
You're just the same.

37
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:59,920
After experiencing so much, you were able to move on so quickly.

38
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
Then I'm the Herb of Nine Lives.

39
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
I've also endured so much suffering but still have people who love me.

40
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,670
All of you are my rain shower.

41
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,340
With all of you by my side, I won't be afraid even if there are countless adversities.

42
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,550
I'll do everything I can to keep you safe.

43
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:22,370
What do you mean by keeping me safe?

44
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:23,770
Are you looking down on me?

45
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:27,290
With my current power, me protecting you is more like it.

46
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,020
All right, everything you say.

47
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,590
Why? Don't you believe me?

48
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,310
Why don't we give it a test?

49
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,970
All right, I know you're strong.

50
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,940
Sister, you're watching me from above now, aren't you?

51
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:48,460
You sacrificed your life so I could live my remaining years.

52
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:49,840
Don't worry.

53
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,370
I'll live well.

54
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,560
Where do the fireworks come from?

55
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:11,020
- That's beautiful.
- Look at that.

56
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:16,980
Consort Xue. Emperor Tun.

57
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:19,180
Our guards from the Void Patrol Battalion came

58
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:22,930
to report that Immortal Xuanshang was setting off fireworks for Princess Yetan.

59
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:26,200
My sister-in-law now has the mood to watch fireworks.

60
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,310
Does this mean she has moved on?

61
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:31,810
If that's the case, Tan'er is all right now.

62
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:33,530
- I'll go and see her now.
- Emperor Tun.

63
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:36,470
Emperor Tun, you're overjoyed that you're being unmindful.

64
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,220
At this moment, Tan'er and Immortal Xuanshang are being affectionate with each other.

65
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,880
Why would you want to disturb them?

66
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,230
Consort Xue, you're right.

67
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:47,050
I'm so happy that I forget.

68
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,580
I noticed Tan'er lost a lot of weight from trouble sleeping and eating lately.

69
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:04,290
How about we prepare her favorite hotpot tomorrow?

70
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,310
Sure.

71
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:07,590
Will it be beef or lamb hotpot?

72
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,850
<i>- Sister-in-law?</i>
- Tan Tan.

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,180
Tan'er.

74
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,360
Thank you for everything you've done for me.

75
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm truly grateful.

76
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,180
Imperial Father.

77
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:45,030
My dear child, you don't have to thank me.

78
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:47,430
I've owed you too much for the past 18 years.

79
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:52,830
I should have done everything that I'm doing now sooner.

80
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,620
Imperial Father, you're also grieving the loss of your daughter.

81
00:05:57,620 --> 00:06:00,730
And you're still putting a lot of effort into doing all these for me.

82
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:04,000
Sister may be gone.

83
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,920
But I'll live well for her sake.

84
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,360
She sacrificed her life to protect mine.

85
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:17,020
I'll do what she wanted to do and love the people she loved.

86
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:23,030
Imperial Father, I'm both Yetan and Qingkui.

87
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:27,600
Both of your daughters are here.

88
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:56,880
So, is it lamb or beef hotpot?

89
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,960
We'll have beef.

90
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,480
Bring a few jars of good wine.

91
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,740
Let's get drunk and enjoy the moment.

92
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,470
We'll drink and enjoy the moment!

93
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:19,140
Has he been waiting the whole night again?

94
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:26,170
I never expected Shaodian Xiaoyi, that heartless old man, to have two sons who are loyal and righteous.

95
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,540
When will I ever meet such a good man?

96
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:36,680
Some people are just too blind to see what's close to them.

97
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:39,150
What does that mean?

98
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,990
Forget about it, then.

99
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:48,010
Gu Haichao, be clear with your words. Can you finish your sentence?

100
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,120
You're... You're back.

101
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,600
Have you been waiting for me?

102
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,050
Yes.

103
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm worried about you since you look quite down.

104
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,780
So I came to find you.

105
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,180
Would you like to take a walk with me?

106
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:17,660
Of course. Where are we going?

107
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,420
Come with me.

108
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,130
Tonight, the stars are shining brightly.

109
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:41,760
So I would like to invite you, Qingheng, to come stargazing with me and have a conversation.

110
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,020
What did you just call me?

111
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,390
I called you by your name.

112
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,430
Is that improper?

113
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,600
Not at all.

114
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,600
I like it when you call me by my name.

115
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,460
Before this, I asked you to call me that. But you always refused.

116
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,890
You either called me Second Prince or Immortal Qingheng.

117
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:01,690
It felt too distant.

118
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:08,370
Tonight, you're not the Second Prince of the Heavenly Realm or an immortal.

119
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,560
I'm also not the fairy of Dongqiu who lurked in the Heavenly Realm.

120
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:17,090
We're just Suzhi and Qingheng having an honest conversation.

121
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:21,990
There are countless living beings under this vast sky.

122
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:25,580
Every wish they make is like a drop in the ocean.

123
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:30,000
The chance of being heard by the immortals must be extremely slim, right?

124
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,570
Yes.

125
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,010
But you heard the wish I made back then and you even took care of me.

126
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:42,020
It was such a great fortune.

127
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:43,400
You...

128
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:46,880
Thank you, Qingheng.

129
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:51,700
You finally admit that you were the coriander plant from back then.

130
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,480
Since I met you,

131
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:01,830
I often thought about how great it would be if I were not

132
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,980
from the Dongqiu tribe but just that coriander plant.

133
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:08,660
The little fairy from the Five Spice clan ascended to the Heavenly Realm by herself

134
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,280
and suffered from mistreatment.

135
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,990
But she was fortunate enough to have the Second Prince of the immortals' earnest protection,

136
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:17,750
friendship despite social status, and his company.

137
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:22,700
Such a story will surely become a great tale.

138
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,900
I...

139
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:27,130
I know the blood feud between the immortals and Dongqiu can never be settled.

140
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:31,960
But if you're willing, I'll protect you forever and never let you down.

141
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,400
If we could erase everything,

142
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,310
there wouldn't be resentment in this world.

143
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,730
I can only thank you on behalf of that little coriander plant.

144
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:54,780
Thank you for giving her scriptures and teaching her magic.

145
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,700
Thank you for giving her a warm cloak and for all your care and sincerity.

146
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:04,830
Thank you for everything.

147
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,260
She has no way to repay you.

148
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,520
But she'll always remember it in her heart.

149
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:41,370
Su...

150
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:19,060
Do you really not need us to stay here with you?

151
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:22,310
We were supposed to have a hotpot with Di Lanjue.

152
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:25,230
The three masters sent someone early this morning to inform us

153
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:29,220
that the Heavenly Emperor can't handle official duties after he lost his cultivation.

154
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:33,460
Besides, Suzhi suffered a huge blow because of the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

155
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:37,000
It wouldn't be helpful for her recovery if you all stayed here.

156
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Why don't you go back first?

157
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,000
We can enjoy hotpot another day.

158
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,740
All right.

159
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,910
After I help Qingheng take care of the affairs of the immortals, I'll come back to you.

160
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:52,710
Then we'll go and live the ordinary life you spoke of.

161
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,220
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

162
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,140
What's wrong?

163
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:01,930
He's worried about Suzhi.

164
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:04,180
She hasn't been willing to leave her chamber these past few days.

165
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:08,490
So he's been guarding outside of the door for several nights, afraid that something might happen to her.

166
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,070
I saw her last night.

167
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:12,430
She returned everything I gave her.

168
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:13,940
I'm getting more worried about her.

169
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,880
I saw her last night too.

170
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,430
She still has resentment.

171
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,980
If you stay here, you will only remind her of those painful memories.

172
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,810
It's better for you all to go back first.

173
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,610
Then I'll leave her to you.

174
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,910
Then, we're leaving.

175
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,610
All right.

176
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,090
- Look.
- Not bad.

177
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,210
Your Highness.

178
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

179
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,400
Your Highness, it's been a few days since we last saw you, but you look much better now.

180
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:56,190
As soon as you've recovered, your beauty and grace are back too.

181
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,320
What were you talking about earlier that made you so happy?

182
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,450
Feng'er is finally having an appetite.

183
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:01,540
He started eating.

184
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,040
Indeed, he's no longer picky and even had five bowls of rice.

185
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,220
Is he feeling a lot better now?

186
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,510
His physical health has improved.

187
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:10,420
But he's been acting even stranger lately.

188
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,030
He hasn't slept for several days and nights.

189
00:14:13,030 --> 00:14:15,000
What happened to him?

190
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,180
As for what specifically happened, maybe you want to go inside and see for yourself.

191
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,700
What are you doing?

192
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,430
Reading.

193
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,090
You're right on time.

194
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:44,200
How do you read this character?

195
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,050
You can't even read all of the words.

196
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:48,120
How are you supposed to read all these?

197
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,480
Where did you get all these?

198
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,430
I've been thinking about this for the past few days.

199
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:58,000
If the Ganoderma Vein was really that powerful, how could it just disappear like that?

200
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,780
I want to see if there's any way to bring Kui'er back to life.

201
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:06,030
But the Void Realm has always been focused on martial arts and doesn't have many books.

202
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,940
So I asked the brothers of the Void Patrol Battalion to search for these ancient texts.

203
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:13,420
Thank you for being willing to go to such lengths for my sister.

204
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:18,730
But if there really was a way, would the four realms let my sister and I off so easily?

205
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:23,100
You didn't come here to thank me for this, did you?

206
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:27,320
I wanted to tell you that Wu Dai is still locked up in the Cave of Haunted Souls.

207
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,930
Please release him.

208
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,490
I don't want to be the leader of the Void anymore.

209
00:15:31,490 --> 00:15:33,940
It's time to return it to the Crown Prince of the Void.

210
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,930
You don't want the position anymore?

211
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:37,340
I don't.

212
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,850
I don't want revenge anymore.

213
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:44,030
I thought you would blame me for not killing the Heavenly Emperor.

214
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:49,920
Actually, when I witnessed my royal father's death, I was upset too.

215
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:55,870
Now that the Heavenly Emperor has been punished, I think Kui'er would also understand.

216
00:15:55,870 --> 00:16:02,510
Now that your heart is at ease, Kui'er's flower spirit is also at peace now.

217
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:07,050
I'll leave you to do what you're doing, then.

218
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:08,730
Where are you going?

219
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:12,030
I'm going to see if Suzhi is feeling better.

220
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:19,060
If you see her, ask her to think carefully if there are any legends or secrets which can bring Kui'er back to life.

221
00:16:19,060 --> 00:16:23,330
With you guarding my sister, I can be at ease.

222
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:27,250
By the way, I heard you started eating.

223
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:30,980
Remember to eat more so that my sister doesn't worry about you.

224
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,350
Your Highness, are you hungry?

225
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,950
I made some coriander pancakes just now.

226
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:50,960
Come and have a taste.

227
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,420
Your Highness, I spoke a lot of nonsense at the Ninth Heaven Hall that day.

228
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:00,360
Please don't take it to heart.

229
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,010
And consider this delicious meal as my apology to you.

230
00:17:04,010 --> 00:17:05,560
I never blamed you.

231
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,260
Have you truly let it go?

232
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:14,080
Since you forgave them and the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant had also received their punishment,

233
00:17:14,080 --> 00:17:16,030
I should let go as well.

234
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,120
As you've said, fate may be destined.

235
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,550
But it's up to us to live our lives.

236
00:17:21,550 --> 00:17:22,940
I've made up my mind.

237
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,800
I want to live well in the future.

238
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,030
Qingheng was still worried about you before he left.

239
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:31,500
If he knew you had moved on, I'm sure he would be overjoyed.

240
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,810
I'll send someone to deliver a letter to him later.

241
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:35,860
No need, Your Highness.

242
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,220
I'll make sure Immortal Qingheng understands my intentions.

243
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:42,960
There's something I want to tell you.

244
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,400
I'm leaving.

245
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
Where do you want to go?

246
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,020
You've already...

247
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,240
How about this?

248
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,110
Youqin and I are planning to travel and engage in some trades.

249
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,440
Why don't you become our shopkeeper and manage the business for us?

250
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,350
We can take care of each other this way.

251
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:05,620
Your Highness, I've been away from home for too long.

252
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,540
I want to go home.

253
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:09,800
Do you want to go back to Dongqiu?

254
00:18:10,410 --> 00:18:11,750
You'll be all alone...

255
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,770
This...

256
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:16,290
The four realms still have prejudices against Dongqiu.

257
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,460
So I want to go back and live in seclusion in a familiar place.

258
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:23,240
You don't need to talk me out of this anymore.

259
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,250
All right.

260
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,300
I'll personally send you back.

261
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,500
My imperial father brought several warm clothes, cotton boots, and hand warmers from the palace.

262
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,380
Wait here. I'll bring them for you.

263
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,790
All right.

264
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:42,240
Kui'er, are you feeling better?

265
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,970
I didn't know how to take care of a flower spirit.

266
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,420
I don't know what to do either.

267
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,740
I heard Miss Suzhi has been in a bad mood these days.

268
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:55,420
When she feels a little better, I'll go and ask her to teach me how to take care of the flower spirit.

269
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,890
By the way, Yetan came to visit you just now.

270
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,170
She looks so much better.

271
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:05,010
I guess she has let go of her hatred, and her heart is healing.

272
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,660
Everything is getting better now,

273
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,970
but you're the only one who couldn't make it back.

274
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:16,970
Sir, Miss Suzhi is here.

275
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,570
Greetings, Prince Chaofeng.

276
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:21,960
Why did you want to see me, Miss Suzhi?

277
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,670
I will be returning to Dongqiu today.

278
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,500
Before I leave, I want to visit Princess Qingkui.

279
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,510
After all, Princess Qingkui is the flower spirit of the Ganoderma Vein.

280
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:34,430
She has a deep connection and shared roots with the Dongqiu tribe.

281
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,590
After I leave, it's unlikely that I'll see her again soon.

282
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,230
Why so sudden?

283
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:41,760
I wanted to ask you about the way of taking care of the flower spirit.

284
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,870
Your Highness, don't worry.

285
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:45,510
I'll write down the method for taking care of the flower spirit.

286
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,260
However, this method is a bit complicated and may be difficult to remember.

287
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,840
Your Highness, may I borrow a brush and a piece of paper?

288
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,430
Sure.

289
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:55,110
Haichao, prepare the writing materials.

290
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,900
- Hurry up.
- Yes, Sir.

291
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:02,210
Miss Suzhi, please wait for a moment.

292
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,930
Haichao!

293
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,970
I'll go and get them myself.

294
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:21,420
Sir! Sir, here are the brush and paper.

295
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,940
Miss Suzhi, where is His Highness?

296
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:25,890
He went to look for you.

297
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:28,200
You can give me the brush and paper.

298
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:46,200
I've finished writing them.

299
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,150
Please give it to His Highness, Officer Gu.

300
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:50,640
I'm meeting Princess Yetan. So I'll take my leave now.

301
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,120
Sure.

302
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,190
<i>Chaofeng, help!</i>

303
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:13,110
<i>Chaofeng! Help!</i>

304
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:14,840
Kui'er!

305
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,230
Kui'er.

306
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:26,770
Kui'er!

307
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,360
Haichao!

308
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,440
Yes, Sir?

309
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,990
What's the matter?

310
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,390
What happened?

311
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,880
I...

312
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,620
I have no idea.

313
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,070
Did anyone touch the flower spirit?

314
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:42,980
Besides you, no one gets near the flower spirit.

315
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,190
Wait a minute.

316
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:47,220
It was Suzhi.

317
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,590
When I came in earlier, I saw Miss Suzhi standing close to the flower spirit.

318
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,540
<i>I thought she was grieving for Princess Qingkui.</i>

319
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:57,070
Miss Suzhi, where is His Highness?

320
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:00,100
It was Suzhi.

321
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,800
Suzhi swapped Kui's flower spirit.

322
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,740
Find her now!

323
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,360
Yes, Sir.

324
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:13,330
No one's here.

325
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:16,320
Sir, Miss Suzhi said she was meeting Princess Yetan.

326
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,780
Why don't we go and check at Yetan's place?

327
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:21,020
All right.

328
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,670
No one's here.

329
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,490
- Greetings, Prince Chaofeng.
- Have you seen Princess Yetan?

330
00:22:38,490 --> 00:22:40,600
The Princess and Miss Suzhi had left.

331
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,710
Did they say where they were going?

332
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:43,430
No.

333
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,950
Yes.

334
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,590
Sir, calm down.

335
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:50,080
It's possible that Princess Yetan entrusted Miss Suzhi

336
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,960
to take Princess Qingkui's flower spirit to offer sacrifices.

337
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,680
Don't be a fool!

338
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,220
Yetan came to see me this morning.

339
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:58,360
If she wanted Kui'er's flower spirit, she would have asked me directly.

340
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,730
But this Suzhi is strange.

341
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:02,870
She has been urging Yetan to seek revenge since Kui'er's death.

342
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,220
There must be more to this than meets the eye.

343
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,830
Sir, what should we do now?

344
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:09,080
Suzhi said she would return to Dongqiu.

345
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,490
I'll go to Dongqiu.

346
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:12,590
Inform Shaodian Youqin about this matter.

347
00:23:12,590 --> 00:23:13,990
All right.

348
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,150
The last time we came here, we were in a hurry.

349
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,730
I didn't expect it to be so vast.

350
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:34,060
In the past, the Dongqiu tribe was thriving with fertile lands under the protection of the Sacred Tree.

351
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,960
There were hundreds of households on this piece of land here alone.

352
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,520
The chief's house is over there.

353
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,130
There's a large flower field in front of her house.

354
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:44,010
I would play with my friends in her flower field.

355
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:47,680
Where was the Ganoderma Vein?

356
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,600
It was over there.

357
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,670
When I was young, I could see you both when I opened the window.

358
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:58,670
Everyone would bring their harvest for the year and gather under the Ganoderma Vein tree.

359
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,390
They would set up a market and trade goods.

360
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:07,020
When night came, they would slaughter cattle and sheep and prepare a huge feast.

361
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:09,990
Before we started the feast,

362
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:15,030
everyone would kneel and pray around Ganoderma Vein,

363
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,070
praying for safety and a smooth year for our fellow tribespeople.

364
00:24:19,070 --> 00:24:21,540
After the feast,

365
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:28,240
everyone would sing and dance around the Ganoderma Vein.

366
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:37,620
Immortal Xuanshang, something bad had happened.

367
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,260
Miss Suzhi stole Princess Qingkui's flower spirit and took Princess Yetan with her.

368
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,630
Do you know where they went?

369
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,870
This morning, she said she was returning to Dongqiu.

370
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:46,880
Prince Chaofeng headed to Guixu first.

371
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,960
This is bad. Let's go.

372
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:58,880
There, there. You already said you would live well after this.

373
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,110
Yes, you're right.

374
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,190
Where do you plan to build your house?

375
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:09,170
Over there.

376
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:12,750
Whenever I faced troubles when I was young,

377
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:18,420
I would be there, looking out at the Guixu sea until my mother came looking for me to go home.

378
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:26,270
The view here is really good.

379
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,340
I'm sure it feels great to open the window to this view every day.

380
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,290
Let's stop here.

381
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,110
Please let me address you as Your Highness one more time.

382
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:39,720
Thank you for taking care of Husui in the Heavenly Realm.

383
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,490
Why do you make it as if this is a farewell?

384
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:46,250
Don't worry.

385
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:49,320
I'll always come and visit you in the future.

386
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:07,230
I'm afraid there won't be a future.

387
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,600
What is this?

388
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:31,260
This place is very close to Guixu.

389
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:39,470
With the Twin Flower here, it's only natural for the Force of Chaos to become turbulent.

390
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:45,050
Twin Flower?

391
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:48,430
You... You stole my sister's flower spirit from Chaofeng!

392
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:50,830
There's no point in struggling.

393
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:53,890
I've planted the remaining root of the Ganoderma Vein into your body.

394
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:56,180
No matter how hard you struggle, it won't help.

395
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:58,840
Why are you doing this to me?

396
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,980
The four realms have been so cruel to me.

397
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:03,490
They won't even let the spirits of my people rest.

398
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:07,010
I'll make them pay with their lives!

399
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:15,470
Yetan, take one last look at this world.

400
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,400
Remember the world as it was in its final moments.

401
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,590
Suzhi!

402
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:23,870
Tan'er!

403
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,990
Tan'er! Tan'er!

404
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:27,540
Tan'er!

405
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:30,360
- Old Fifth!
- Chaofeng.

406
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,050
I just searched Dongqiu thoroughly. But I couldn't find them.

407
00:28:48,870 --> 00:28:50,570
Why is there an anomaly in Guixu?

408
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,900
This is impossible.

409
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,370
Didn't you use your Perfect Celestial Body to repair the seal of Guixu completely?

410
00:28:55,370 --> 00:28:58,580
The reunion of the Twin Flowers triggered the Force of Chaos.

411
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,590
Could it be...

412
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:02,340
Yetan and Kui's flower spirits must be inside the depths of Guixu.

413
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,500
I'll go and save them.

414
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:04,640
I'm coming with you.

415
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,900
Sir, be prudent. You haven't attained Perfect Celestial Body.

416
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,700
Going into the vortex of the Force of Chaos means certain death.

417
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,260
Chaofeng, no one knows Guixu better than me.

418
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:16,520
I'll go save them. You stay here and set up a barrier to stop the Force of Chaos from spreading.

419
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:25,850
Hopefully, Old Fifth can rescue them.

420
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:26,900
Come on, cast the spell.

421
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,590
All right, Sir.

422
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,990
Suzhi!

423
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:59,160
Sister. Suzhi!

424
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,530
Suzhi!

425
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,340
Suzhi!

426
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,970
Stop struggling.

427
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,110
The four realms will return to chaos.

428
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:31,550
You can't stop this catastrophe.

429
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:33,070
Have you gone mad?

430
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,800
You know you can't resist the destruction of the Force of Chaos.

431
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,670
But you still want to undo the seal of Guixu.

432
00:31:37,670 --> 00:31:39,580
I'm not afraid of death.

433
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,730
I want revenge.

434
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:45,630
I want the four realms to be buried with Dongqiu tribespeople!

435
00:31:45,630 --> 00:31:51,860
I thought when the four realms considered me an enemy, you would take my side and support me.

436
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,740
When my sister died, you were the one who stayed by my side.

437
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,470
I trusted you and relied on you.

438
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:02,530
I didn't expect you to deceive me.

439
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:06,170
I also trusted and relied on you.

440
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,210
Before we attacked the Heavenly Realm,

441
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:12,300
you promised to clear Dongqiu's name and make the Heavenly Emperor pay with his life.

442
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,360
But what happened?

443
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,160
You kept compromising, and you forgot all the hatred!

444
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,910
The four realms made me lose everything.

445
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:22,400
So I want them to have a taste of despair!

446
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,030
Is there nothing in this world that you cherish at all?

447
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,880
Qingheng has always been sincere with you.

448
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,600
Even after knowing you're from the Dongqiu tribe,

449
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,760
his love and care for you have not diminished in the slightest.

450
00:32:36,250 --> 00:32:39,330
<i>The little fairy from the Five Spice clan ascended to the Heavenly Realm by herself</i>

451
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,900
<i>and suffered from mistreatment.</i>

452
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:44,730
<i>But she was fortunate enough to have the Second Prince of the immortals' earnest protection,</i>

453
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:48,390
<i>friendship despite social status, and his company.</i>

454
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:53,370
<i>Such a story will surely become a great tale.</i>

455
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:58,600
<i>I know the blood feud between the immortals and Dongqiu can never be settled.</i>

456
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,200
<i>But if you're willing, I'll protect you forever and never let you down.</i>

457
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,330
You're right.

458
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:10,370
If it weren't for Qingheng,

459
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:14,710
I wouldn't even be able to transform into Husui.

460
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:19,240
I've let him down.

461
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,470
Suzhi. Suzhi, the Guixu seal has not yet been shattered.

462
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:25,330
So long as you can quickly remove this root from my body, we still have a chance.

463
00:33:25,330 --> 00:33:28,060
You and I will die here today.

464
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:30,450
Everything started because of Guixu.

465
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:33,550
So let Guixu end it all.

466
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,990
Suzhi.

467
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:38,740
Suzhi!

468
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,890
Father!

469
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,090
Mother!

470
00:33:51,090 --> 00:33:55,760
I've finally comforted the spirits of you all!

471
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,630
Suzhi!

472
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,780
Suzhi!

473
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:21,140
Suzhi!

474
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,240
Sister!

475
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:53,120
<i>[Yongle Gate]</i>

476
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,880
Look at that.

477
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,960
It's Guixu.

478
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,090
But it can't be.

479
00:36:16,690 --> 00:36:20,480
How is this happening?

480
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,220
<i>Could it be Suzhi's doing?</i>

481
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,530
Empyrean Xuanshang just went to Guixu.

482
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:26,820
Immortal Qingheng, let's go and support him.

483
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,780
You stay here. I'll go check things out.

484
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:59,340
- Hurry!
- Quickly!

485
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,520
This is bad. This time the upheaval of Guixu has shaken the foundation of the Beast Tribe.

486
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
The destruction this time is more severe than before.

487
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,090
I'm afraid something disastrous is happening.

488
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:11,020
Should we write another letter to the Heavenly Emperor?

489
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:15,340
But now the Heavenly Realm is without a ruler. So writing a letter may be pointless.

490
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,880
Lan'er is still in the Void Realm.

491
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,900
What... What should we do now?

492
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:23,850
Hurry!

493
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,820
- Go that way!
- All right.

494
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,170
- Be careful.
- Emperor Tun, be careful.

495
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,640
Emperor Tun!

496
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,910
- Be careful!
- Emperor Tun.

497
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,970
Consort Xue, what's going on?

498
00:37:37,970 --> 00:37:41,540
Suzhi stole Kui's flower spirit and tricked Yetan into going to Guixu.

499
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:44,340
This anomaly may indicate something has happened in Guixu.

500
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,450
What? Have you informed Xuanshang about this?

501
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:49,110
Prince Chaofeng, Immortal Xuanshang, and Haichao have already rushed to Guixu.

502
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:50,980
We didn't expect something like this to happen.

503
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:52,920
My daughters... I have to go to Guixu!

504
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,190
- No, Emperor Tun!
- Emperor Tun!
- Emperor Tun.

505
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:56,270
Emperor Tun, how about this? Calm down.

506
00:37:56,270 --> 00:37:58,700
Ziwu and I will go and check the situation in Guixu.

507
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,660
Sushui! Watch Emperor Tun and Consort Xue.

508
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,620
All right.

509
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,930
Let's go.

510
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:05,590
Emperor Tun.

511
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,260
- Emperor Tun.
- Emperor Tun.

512
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,540
Sir!

513
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,670
Guixu's seal is broken!

514
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,250
Old Fifth hasn't come out with Yetan and Kui's flower spirit.

515
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:22,670
We must not let the Force of Chaos endanger the four realms.

516
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,190
Or else the sisters will become the apocalypse of the world for real!

517
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,050
I can't hold it any longer.

518
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,750
We rushed over as soon as we received the news.

519
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:45,820
Where's Tan Tan?

520
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,050
Old Fifth went to rescue her.

521
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,790
I didn't expect Guixu's seal to be completely broken.

522
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:50,480
Youqin will definitely save Yetan.

523
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,120
We should secure this barrier.
