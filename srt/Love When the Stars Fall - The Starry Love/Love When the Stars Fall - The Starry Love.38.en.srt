<i>[Episode 38]</i>

21
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:55,900
When Youqin fought against Yetan, did he remember anything?

22
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,000
The Stake of Oblivion is an ancient divine object.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,400
Yetan may have disrupted Empyrean Xuanshang's mental state.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:02,200
But he did not recall the past.

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,000
Only...

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
What?

27
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,300
His Highness could have cut Yetan's throat with his sword in the Void.

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:12,400
But he showed mercy at the last moment.

29
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,600
It seems he's still entangled by worldly ties.

30
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,200
Liguang Yetan has many supporters around her.

31
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,600
She inevitably has the intention of attacking the Heavenly Realm.

32
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:24,600
We must not let Youqin remember her at this time.

33
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,400
Go and follow him closely.

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:33,200
If anyone wants to reveal the truth to Youqin, capture and kill them immediately.

35
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,000
I shall obey your command.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,400
His Highness has returned!

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,600
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

38
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,100
Did the battle go smoothly?

39
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,400
I almost had her, but I failed.

40
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,500
- That's a relief.
- I'm glad to hear that.

41
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,000
I returned with a defeat.

42
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,300
Why are you happy about it?

43
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,800
Could it be that you know Liguang Yetan too?

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,900
I hope you don't blame me for being nosy.

45
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,600
Since it has come to this point, I have to tell you the truth.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:12,800
- Did you know...
- Your Highness.

47
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,800
Under the command of the Heavenly Emperor,

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
I have come to discuss things about the Heavenly Army with Your Highness.

49
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,700
I ask that Feichi and Hanmo wait outside the hall.

50
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,800
Yes, Sir.

51
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,000
Yes, Sir.

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,800
If you may, Your Highness.

53
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,600
This matter has come to this point.

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
What else do we have to be concerned about?

55
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
Let's tell His Highness the truth quickly.
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

56
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,600
Can't you see Guangtian is following His Highness closely?

57
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:48,100
He's definitely here under His Majesty's command to prevent us from talking.

58
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:54,300
We don't know how many other spies like him are secretly watching us constantly in the Heavenly Realm.

59
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,700
What are you doing?

60
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,200
What should we do, then?

61
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:09,100
We may have failed to capture Liguang Yetan in our expedition to the Void.

62
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,200
But fortunately, the Heavenly Army didn't suffer many casualties.

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,700
<i>What did you just say?</i>

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,800
<i>Who did you say you're going to kill?</i>

65
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,200
<i>I volunteered to eliminate the demoness Liguang Yetan of Dongqiu.</i>

66
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,700
<i>You cannot!</i>

67
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
<i>Qingheng? Ziwu?</i>

68
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,800
<i>Why... Why are you...</i>

69
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,800
<i>- Eldest Brother, did you also notice my new hair accessory?
- Eldest Brother.</i>

70
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>Do you also think it's very special?</i>

71
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
<i>- I returned with a defeat.
- That's a relief.</i>

72
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,800
<i>Why are you happy about it?</i>

73
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,200
<i>Could it be that you know Liguang Yetan too?</i>

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,100
<i>Mother, Qingheng, Ziwu, and Feichi.</i>

75
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,700
<i>They seem to be acquainted with Liguang Yetan.</i>

76
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,300
<i>Who is she exactly?</i>

77
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:50,800
<i>Liguang Yetan is a member of the crazed Dongqiu Tribe.</i>

78
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,400
<i>She's the human form of the Ganoderma Vein's flower spirit.</i>

79
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,200
<i>She has no connection with the immortals.</i>

80
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:01,400
<i>Why did Father try to hide it and not let me know her true identity?</i>

81
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:23,200
<i>Youqin, I'm your wife, your Money, and your Yuexia.</i>

82
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,900
My wife.

83
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,900
Your Highness.

84
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,100
Your Highness, what did you say?

85
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,600
Nothing.

86
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,700
Your Highness, it's time to lay out the constellations.

87
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:45,200
Please head to the Star Observatory.

88
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,800
General, please wait for a moment.

89
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,000
I'll be back in a moment.

90
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,600
General.

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,800
You know why I'm here.

92
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,200
His Majesty commands that no one is allowed to delude His Highness.

93
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,600
Violators shall be executed!

94
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,800
Sir, Princess Yetan and Emperor Tun are here.

95
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,900
Father-in-law.

96
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,600
Is this Kui'er?

97
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,200
Kui'er...

98
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,400
Yetan, I heard what happened to Shaodian Youqin.

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,000
If you have any concerns, I can lead the army to attack the Heavenly Realm.

100
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,400
It's all right.

101
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:53,000
I'd rather take a preemptive measure and strike first than let the Heavenly Emperor use Youqin.

102
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,600
Besides, you haven't recovered yet.

103
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,400
My imperial father needs someone to take care of him too.

104
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,800
I've always been a worrisome daughter to him.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,800
Going to this battle,

106
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,100
I don't know if I will have the chance to perform my filial duties.

107
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,800
I forbid you from saying that.

108
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
I want you to go

109
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,300
and return in one piece.

110
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,600
Please rest assured.

111
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:22,600
He's not only your imperial father but also my father-in-law.

112
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,100
I'll take good care of him.

113
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,400
I owe my life to my sister.

114
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,600
I must not lose in this battle.

115
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,500
Tan'er!

116
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Make sure you stay safe.

117
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,200
- Father-in-law.
- Emperor Tun.

118
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:06,000
Please sit and take a rest for a moment.

119
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,100
Emperor Tun, are you all right?

120
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,900
Emperor Tun, Chaofeng will take care of Kui'er's flower spirit.

121
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,000
You should get some rest in Void Tyrant's chamber.

122
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,200
For Tan'er's sake, you must take care of your health.

123
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,100
Kui'er,

124
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,900
please watch over your little sister so she can return safely.

When did the Rooftop Swallow Mansion disappear from the tail of the Black Tortoise?

126
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,700
<i>On this night, I grant you the Rooftop Swallow Mansion.</i>

127

<i>May you earn respect and admiration and be able to withstand ordinariness.</i>

129

This woman is...

130
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,400
I thought we had overcome the hurdle of the wrong marriage

131
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,200
and that we could have long-lasting love.

132
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,400
But the world is full of uncertainties.

133
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,600
It has pushed us to the opposite sides of good and evil.

134
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,400
Even if you've forgotten me, I can't forget our love.

Your Majesty, Liguang Yetan has invaded the Heavenly Realm!

168
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,800
The demoness of doom.

169
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:08,200
Summon the Heavenly Soldiers immediately.

Protect the Heavenly Realm.

171

The Heavenly Realm is heavily guarded.

172
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,700
But you managed to reach the Ninth Heaven Hall so quickly.

173
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,800
I really underestimated you.

174

Shaodian Xiaoyi, we'll settle old and new scores all together today.

Youqin, you're here just in time.

Help me capture and kill this woman.

177

Celestial Father,

178

even if the Force of Chaos starts and the four realms fall into ruin again, I will never point my sword at her.

Celestial Father, I secretly assisted eldest brother in contacting the Heavenly Army last night.

00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:10,400
If it weren't for the Rainbow Whisperer I made for you,

224
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
could you convey the message to Tan'er

and devise such a military strategy without bloodshed?

226

So I should get some credit for this victory too.

How dare you commit such a heinous act of disrespecting your father and betraying your ruler?

228
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,000
Such filial sons indeed.

229
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:28,400
Celestial Father, you planted the Stake of Oblivion in me

230
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,300
and made me draw my sword at my lover in battle!

231
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
Is this what a father should do?

232
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,900
You've defied me time and time again, and all you care about is that demoness of doom.

233
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,800
And what do you take the immortals and me for?

234
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:43,000
I don't want to be your enemy!

235
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,200
I did not sacrifice my desires, mend the seal in Guixu,

236
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,900
and risk my life to save the four realms for the sake of fame and righteousness.

237
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:50,600
I did it to protect my family!

238
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:52,200
For you!

239
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,900
And Celestial Mother.

240
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,400
Celestial Father, I don't want to see you continue making mistakes anymore.

241
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:02,800
I don't want to see my lover and my family hurt each other even more.

242
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,700
The immortals' long-standing fear of Dongqiu is just groundless.

243
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I humbly request that you hand over the Soul-Gathering Lamp

244
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,800
and issue a decree to clear Dongqiu's name!

245
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
Eldest Brother is right.

246
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,600
How could I, as a son, not have you in my heart?

247
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,000
We only hope that you can admit your mistakes and make amends.

248
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,300
This is the first lesson you taught me when I was young.

249
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,800
You are forcing me into a corner

250
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,600
by drawing your swords at me!

251
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:37,400
Even if I yield, would Yetan and that descendant of Dongqiu

252
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:42,900
be willing to forgive so easily?

253
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,700
I did not come to the Heavenly Realm to kill and vent my anger.

254
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:53,200
Besides, your death cannot make up for the life of my sister.

255
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:58,300
If you hand over the Soul-Gathering Lamp and clear Dongqiu's name, I will spare your life.

256
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:05,100
Did you really come to the Ninth Heaven Hall with an army just for a lamp?

257
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:06,500
Fine.

258
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,300
I will give it to you.

259
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,400
Father, Mother.

260
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,400
I've finally retrieved your souls and the souls of our people.

261
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,000
Why is this happening?

262
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,800
There is no flower spirit in the lamp.

263
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,600
What did you do to the flower spirits of Dongqiu?

264
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,400
You're too naive.

265
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,700
Did you really think the immortals would keep the flower spirits of Dongqiu for thousands of years?

266
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,400
<i>The late Heavenly Emperor was wise.</i>

267
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,600
<i>He had already seen through Jade Deity's hesitation</i>

268
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,600
<i>and saw him secretly keeping this lamp, the Soul-Gathering Lamp.</i>

269
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,700
Is this the Soul-Gathering Lamp of Dongqiu?

270
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,400
<i>The sinner tribe of Dongqiu thought</i>

271
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:01,300
<i>hiding their flower spirits in this lamp would give them a chance to be reborn.</i>

272
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,800
<i>How ridiculous.</i>

273
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:09,200
<i>Xiaoyi, I brought you here so you would understand the principle of exterminating all evil.</i>

274
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:13,000
<i>As a ruler, you must never be soft-hearted</i>

275
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,600
<i>as it would bring potential disasters.</i>

276
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,800
<i>I personally witnessed the former Heavenly Emperor</i>

277
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,100
<i>use the Supreme Divine Fire to burn all the flower spirits in the lamp.</i>

278
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>It was the first time I learned the way of a ruler.</i>

279
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:52,100
The flower spirits of young and old in the lamp were scorched to death by the Divine Fire

280
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,000
in an extremely tragic manner.

281
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,200
Back then, how could I not find the former Heavenly Emperor cruel?

282
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,500
But I understand if they don't die,

283
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,000
one day, it would be the immortals

284
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,600
and the people of the four realms who would die.

285
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:13,400
I endured hardships and difficulties for ten thousand years,

286
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,700
thinking I could reunite with my parents one day.

287
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,700
But I didn't expect

288
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,680
that their flower spirits had already dissipated.

289
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,580
You called that the way of a ruler?

290
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,630
My tribe only wanted a peaceful place to settle down at.

291
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,390
What was wrong with that?

292
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:34,850
The immortals enjoy prosperity throughout the four realms.

293
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,940
Why can't you let go of a small tribe?

294
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:44,160
Suzhi!

295
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,370
Suzhi.

296
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:51,000
- Yetan!
- Ziwu!

297
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,810
The Dongqiu tribe died because of their sacred tree.

298
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:29,430
Qingkui took her own life to protect you.

299
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:31,360
What gives you the right to kill me?

300
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,440
What gives you the right to desecrate the Ninth Heaven Hall?

301
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,500
You're the one responsible for everyone's death.

302
00:23:41,790 --> 00:23:45,430
Princess, don't listen to him. Kill him!

303
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:50,430
Since the news of you and Qingkui being the Twin Flowers of doom

304
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:55,980
had spread throughout the four realms, countless commoners have petitioned the heaven

305
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,540
for Void Tyrant and me to have you both killed to preserve the four realms!

306
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,180
So what if the people had petitioned?

307
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:04,510
The immortals stand at the pinnacle of power and knowledge to guide the world.

308
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:09,040
How can we let innocent people die in vain just because of a moment of people's violence and restlessness?

309
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:15,030
The world will never tolerate you as long as Yetan lives.

310
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:19,470
Princess, you promised to seek justice for Dongqiu.

311
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:25,580
Kill the Heavenly Emperor! Kill him to avenge the tribes people and Princess Qingkui!

312
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,680
Tan'er!

313
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,580
Your Majesty!

314
00:24:55,750 --> 00:24:58,330
I've always been regarded as the harbinger of disaster by the world.

315
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,610
It was so ten thousand years ago, and it's still so today.

316
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:03,700
I cannot change that just by killing one person.

317
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,610
Princess.

318
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:10,040
Suzhi, I've ruined his cultivation.

319
00:25:10,040 --> 00:25:15,030
Now that he has lost the support of his people and family, let's consider our enmity from the past as settled.

320
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,020
Princess!

321
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:19,400
Human emotions cannot be eradicated.

322
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,860
Tan'er.

323
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:33,200
Thank you for sparing him.

324
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,780
Get lost.

325
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:54,340
Get out!

326
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:08,200
Move!

327
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:11,740
Get lost, all of you!

328
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:23,050
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

329
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,010
You're back...

330
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,750
Emperor Tun.

331
00:26:30,830 --> 00:26:32,500
Emperor Tun.

332
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:41,690
Where's Tan'er?

333
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,070
Don't say anything.

334
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,910
Is she safe?

335
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:51,910
Emperor Tun, please rest assured.

336
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:54,460
The generals of the immortals secretly helped Youqin.

337
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,890
My sister-in-law is unharmed.

338
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,960
In the end, she showed mercy and spared my father's life.

339
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,950
Eldest Brother has also regained his memories.

340
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:04,630
Where are they now?

341
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,110
As soon as Sister-in-law returned, she went to mourn Qingkui at Luowei Grotto.

342
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:10,610
Eldest Brother went along with her.

343
00:27:19,250 --> 00:27:26,120
Sister, Void Tyrant's spirit had dissipated, and the Heavenly Emperor's cultivation has also been destroyed.

344
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:30,170
I've avenged you.

345
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:44,080
Is this Kui'er responding?

346
00:27:50,110 --> 00:27:51,960
She heard us?

347
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,100
She heard us.

348
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:06,530
Tan'er. Tan'er! Tan'er!

349
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,930
What's wrong?

350
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,210
Tan'er!

351
00:28:26,310 --> 00:28:28,730
Tan'er. Tan'er.

352
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,310
You're awake.

353
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:31,960
How do you feel?

354
00:28:32,590 --> 00:28:34,410
Are you all right?

355
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,350
I'm sorry.

356
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:46,030
When you needed me the most, I wasn't by your side.

357
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,980
Did you know?

358
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:05,130
When I suddenly lost sister and you after that,

359
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:10,380
I felt I was pushed deep into the abyss.

360
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,780
I'm sorry.

361
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,050
I was too careless.

362
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,920
I failed to protect you.

363
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,170
It was my fault. I'm sorry.

364
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:33,030
How did you manage to remember me?

365
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,640
Silly.

366
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,070
We've been through so many hardships along the way.

367
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:44,500
That Stake of Oblivion can never erase the memories.

368
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:47,230
Do you still remember Penglai Hall?

369
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:51,950
Our memories are everywhere in the vast galaxy.

370
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,860
They are unforgettable and can't be erased.

371
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,210
Father! Mother!

372
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:10,940
Father! Mother!

373
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:14,960
Father! Mother!

374
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:22,350
Father, Mother,

375
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:28,340
I will definitely avenge you!

376
00:31:38,350 --> 00:31:43,020
- Sister-in-law.
- Qingheng, were you here this whole time?

377
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,090
Yes.

378
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:45,830
Has she returned?

379
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:46,900
No.

380
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:49,970
When she returned from the Heavenly Realm that day, I could tell she was upset.

381
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:52,800
So I wanted to keep her company.

382
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,720
But she said she wanted to be alone.

383
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:58,710
I was worried. So I decided to wait for her here.

384
00:31:58,710 --> 00:32:00,700
Are you here to see Suzhi too?

385
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,360
She's also avoiding me now.

386
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:06,200
Perhaps she resents me for what happened at Ninth Heaven Hall.

387
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:09,270
The immortals were despicable in handling the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

388
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:11,830
She probably still harbors a lot of resentment toward them.

389
00:32:11,830 --> 00:32:15,500
I guess the distance between me and her is only getting wider.

390
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,290
I'll talk to her when she comes back.

391
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,940
Do you know what Di Lanjue and Ziwu are doing?

392
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:24,520
I haven't seen them ever since the last time they came to visit me with imperial father.

393
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,190
The four realms haven't been peaceful recently.

394
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:28,940
They may be busy with their clan's affairs.

395
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,840
Qingheng, you've been busy for so many days.

396
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:33,070
You should go back and rest.

397
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:36,460
If I have her news, I'll send someone to inform you immediately.

398
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:40,210
All right.

399
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,290
<i>Since the news of you and Qingkui being the Twin Flowers of doom had spread throughout the four realms,</i>

400
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:09,680
<i>countless commoners have petitioned the heaven</i>

401
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:14,670
<i>for Void Tyrant and me to have you both killed to preserve the four realms!</i>

402
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,300
Go away!

403
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,000
Leave us alone!

404
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,800
- Let me check on your injuries.
- Go away.

405
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,800
But... Your injuries will get infected.

406
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,000
- Go away!
- It's none of your business!

407
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:32,400
Help the warrior up.

408
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:35,800
- Leave!
- The priority is to treat your injuries.

409
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:37,000
Don't touch me!

410
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,700
Leave!

411
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,600
I won't let you treat me even if it kills me!

412
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,200
Leave!

413
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,400
Go away.

414
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,000
Leave me alone.

415
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,600
Dear all,

416
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,200
my daughter came to the Void for revenge

417
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,200
and harmed you by mistake in her grief for her deceased sister.

418
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
I sincerely apologize for her actions.

419
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,900
I've arranged for the best physicians to treat your injuries.

420
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,100
If any of you still harbor resentment, please direct it toward me.

421
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,500
I'll not run away.

422
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:13,500
However, I ask you to prioritize treating your injuries

423
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,900
and not delay your recovery.

424
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,200
How's your injury?

425
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,800
Don't move your hand.

426
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,400
I'll help you bandage it.

427
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,400
Does it hurt here?

428
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,000
Tan'er.

429
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,400
So you saw everything.

430
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,600
I was thinking there must be many people

431
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,600
in the Void Army who wanted to kill me for revenge.

432
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,500
Every time Di Lanjue and Ziwu came to visit me,

433
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,700
they were always in a hurry and looked tired.

434
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:57,500
Imperial Father has also become increasingly thin and has gray hair.

435
00:34:57,500 --> 00:35:03,900
It turns out they're working hard to calm the anger in people's hearts and secretly protecting me.

436
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,400
Yes.

437
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:11,700
Emperor Tun discovered several wounded soldiers hiding here and plotting to assassinate you for revenge.

438
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:16,400
He rushed back to the palace the same night to ask Physician Peng to bring a large amount of medicine

439
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,900
to treat the wounded and appease the angry soldiers.

440
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,700
When the four realms pursued us,

441
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,600
he also thought about fighting to the death with the immortals and the voidwalkers.

442
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:30,300
He tried every means to protect you to the best of his ability.

443
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,700
He didn't want me to tell you these things

444
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:36,300
because he was afraid you would overthink and cause you more distress.

445
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:41,900
The four realms don't accept me and killed my loved ones.

446
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,200
I seek revenge for my family.

447
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,800
But I have become their enemy in turn.

448
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,600
This cycle of good and evil and endless injustice and retribution continues.

449
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,200
And I've implicated my father and friends.

450
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,200
What is the purpose of my life?

451
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,300
Tan'er.

452
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,600
I want some time alone.

453
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Sister...

454
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,000
I miss you.

455
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:36,400
Now, I feel such torment in my heart.

456
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,600
If only you were here with me, I could talk to you.

457
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,500
You embroidered an image of me.

458
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,200
So I'll embroider an image of you too.

459
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,600
I'll pretend that you're still with me.

460
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:52,600
Sister,

461
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:58,000
I wanted to seek revenge on those who came after our lives.

462
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,800
I thought

463
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:04,200
I would become the cruelest person in the world.

464
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,800
<i>But I spared the Heavenly Emperor's life.</i>

465
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,800
<i>Suzhi resents me for it.</i>

466
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,400
Everything I just witnessed and heard has made me uncertain about what to do.

467
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,600
Sister.

468
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:32,100
<i>Tan'er, it's been days since we last met.</i>

469
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:33,800
<i>You look worn out now.</i>

470
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,300
Sister, I miss you.

471
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,000
<i>There, there, Tan'er.</i>

472
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,800
<i>You have been through a lot</i>

473
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
<i>these past few days.</i>

474
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,900
Sister,

475
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,100
I regret it so much.

476
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:55,000
I regret arguing with you in Wangliang City.

477
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:00,500
I regret not being able to stop you when we were in Guixu.

478
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>I never blamed you or left you.</i>

479
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,800
<i>I saw you being sad for me and also saw you stayed true to yourself in time,</i>

480
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
<i>not letting yourself fall into the abyss of revenge.</i>

481
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,200
<i>My little Tan'er, you did well.</i>

482
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,600
But the world's prejudice is hard to eliminate.

483
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,400
The stigma of being a Twin Flower is also hard to get rid of.

484
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:28,800
Does it not sadden you that we were forced into a dead end like this?

485
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,200
<i>Some things are predetermined by fate, and it's hard to change the human heart.</i>

486
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,400
<i>Since we were born of the Ganoderma Vein, we are destined to have this unfortunate fate.</i>

487
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,800
<i>Blaming others for our misfortunes will only harm your state of mind.</i>

488
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,800
<i>Resorting to violence will only harm others and yourself.</i>

489
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,200
<i>Do you still remember what we talked about in Wangliang City?</i>

490
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,400
<i>No matter how deep we fall into the mud,</i>

491
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,000
<i>we must be optimistic and live the life we want.</i>

492
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,100
You gave me my life.

493
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:05,100
In this life, I live not only for myself but also for you.

494
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:10,300
Qingkui, I'll let go if you let go.

495
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:12,000
<i>My dear Tan'er,</i>

496
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,400
<i>I'm really happy that you've come around.</i>

497
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,500
Don't worry.

498
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:24,400
With your protection, Youqin, Imperial Father,

499
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:29,500
and many of my friends by my side, I'll live well.

500
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,400
I was embroidering you. Can you teach me?

501
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
Sister.

502
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,600
Qingkui, were you here?

503
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,000
Sister?

504
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,300
Tan'er.

505
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:59,000
I know you were not in a good mood.

506
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:04,800
So I went to the Mortal Realm and got you your favorite wonton.

507
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,600
Here you go.

508
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,700
These are the side dishes.

509
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,200
W-What's the matter?

510
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,200
Don't you like it?

511
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,200
I'll get you something else.

512
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,200
What's wrong?

513
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,000
Sister and Man Man died protecting me.

514
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:45,100
People who love me are also protecting me with all their might.

515
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:49,700
I've avenged sister, and my heart is at peace.

516
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:55,700
For all of you, I'll eat well, sleep well, and live well.

517
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:04,000
You are the toughest girl I've ever seen.

518
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:09,200
Your toughest girl would like a gift.

519
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,300
What do you want?

520
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,900
Can you set off fireworks for me one more time?

521
