Wu Dai, Chaofeng.

24
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,300
Today is for both of your weddings.

25
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,500
Now that the Void has a Crown Prince and you brothers are in harmony,

26
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,100
in the future, the Void will have great achievements.

27
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,800
Royal Father, please rest assured. I won't disappoint you.

28
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,000
I'll always remember your teachings.

29
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,000
Princess Yetan has been in the Void for some time now.

30
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,200
With the Crown Prince already been decided, the wedding ceremony shouldn't be delayed any further.

31
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,700
Therefore, I've discussed with Void Tyrant to have the children marry as soon as possible.

32
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,000
So I invited you, Emperor Tun in a haste to witness the ceremony.

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,200
I hope you don't feel offended.

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
Thank you, Void Tyrant and Void Empress.

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,800
Tan'er has poor aptitudes and abilities.

36
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,000
I'm grateful that Your Majesties and His Highness do not find her unsatisfactory.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,800
His Highness is...

38
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:41,900
His Highness has an outstanding character.

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,400
He's the ideal son-in-law to me.

40
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:48,900
Tan'er is fortunate, and it's a blessing for the human race.

Princess Yetan and Saintess Jialouluo have arrived!

42
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:04,200
Emperor Tun, you and your daughter have not seen each other since your farewell at the wedding procession.

00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,200
What...

44

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,000
You?

46
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,200
Why are you here?

47
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,600
Imperial Father, perhaps it's been too long since you last saw me

48
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,800
that you're so happy to the point you don't know what you're saying.

49
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,900
Today is my wedding. Of course, I have to be here.

50
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,700
You're right.

51
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,800
Who else would be here, if not you?

52
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,300
Emperor Tun, you sent a wedding portrait as a gift the other day.

53
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:19,400
I've long heard that painters of the human race are extremely skilled.

54
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,300
How about you show it in front of everyone so we, the voidwalkers, can also appreciate it?

55
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,400
But...

56
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,200
Fear not, I'm here. I'll protect you.

63
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,400
who exactly is this girl?

64
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,700
Void Tyrant, let me explain.

65
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,000
This is...

66
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,300
Well, she's...

67
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,800
Stop pressuring my father.

68
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,000
I'm Liguang Qingkui.

69
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Tan, you're...

70
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,800
Chaofeng, you knew about this?

71
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,000
What exactly happened?

72
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,400
I switched her here.

73
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,300
I had my eyes on her for a long time.

74
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,700
Your Highness, it has already come to this.

75
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,600
Why won't you tell Void Tyrant the truth?

76
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,900
Void Tyrant, the day before the bridal procession, Second Prince Dingyun tried

77
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:23,900
to assassinate Prince Wudai in Wangliang City, and my sister, Yetan, happened to witness it.

78
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,600
Second Prince feared that his plot would be exposed.

79
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,900
So he lied about being away for official duty on the day of the bridal procession.

80
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,600
But the truth is, he blended into the wedding procession to swap both of us.

81
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:38,300
After that, he threatened to kill me. So I had no choice but to keep it a secret until now.

82
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,300
<i>When did Kui'er learn to lie?</i>

83
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:45,300
So he was the one who tried to assassinate me.

84
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Were you the one who instigated Dingyun to do it?

85
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,200
Why would I do that?

86
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
Emperor Tun, tell us the truth.

87
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,900
Did you really see Dingyun that day?

88
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,400
Someone did behave suspiciously around the wedding sedans that day.

89
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,100
Now that I think about it,

90
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,900
I think

91
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,600
it should be...

92
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,400
It was Dingyun.

93
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,500
Outright groundless slander!

94
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,300
Yun'er is no longer alive, and he can't speak for himself.

95
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,400
That's why you dare make such accusations.

96
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:31,200
Void Tyrant, you must not let them deceive you.

97
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,000
Void Tyrant, please listen.

98
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,500
It's because we knew of this matter that Her Majesty repeatedly pursued and tried to kill us.

99
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:46,200
Even to the extent of forcing Feng'er to swallow the poison

100
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:50,100
and lose all of his cultivation by threatening to take my life.

101
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:52,900
We didn't dare to compete with Her Majesty.

102
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:56,000
But Her Majesty was too overbearing.

103
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,900
You're lying!

104
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:02,000
You colluded with the immortals to kill my son!

105
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,600
I've been putting up with you for far too long!

106
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,000
So you admit that you still want to kill us even to this day?

107
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,600
Consort Mother!

108
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,300
Wu Dai, even you dare to go against me?

109
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,100
You lied to me first.

110
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,100
You said you would help me marry Tan Tan. But the truth is, you wanted to kill her!

111
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,100
She's Qingkui!

112
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,800
I don't care who she is!

113
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,200
All I know is that she's my favorite woman!

114
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,800
I don't care what's going on.

115
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,100
This woman is the Empyrean Consort, without a doubt.

116
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,600
Kill her!

117
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:55,000
Step back, all of you!

118
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:01,500
Royal Father, it doesn't matter which scoundrel swapped the sedans, it's not her fault.

119
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,800
She may not be my Crown Princess anymore.

120
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,200
But no matter what, I can't watch her die in the Void.

121
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,200
Please spare their lives for my sake.

122
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,500
You!

123
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,500
If you refuse, I don't want to live either!

124
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:35,200
So be it.

125
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:40,900
All of you, leave and never return to the Void again!

126

Void Tyrant.

127
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,700

- Kui'er, come.

128
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,900
Kui'er, come on.

<i>[Siqu Pavilion]</i>

00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,600
Look how severely wounded you are.

131
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,200
I can't believe you broke through the heavenly tribulation.

132
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,700
Are you really not afraid of death?

133
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:08,000
Don't worry. I'm fine now.

134
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,200
What were you thinking?

135
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:20,700
I was thinking that once I got out,

136
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,700
I would always have you by my side.

137
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,700
Have you heard about the big news that happened in the Void?

138
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:36,100
Do you mean Third Prince eloping?

139
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,800
<i>It's already spreading everywhere.</i>

140
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,600
<i>That's right.</i>

141
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,300
It's my sister. Sister eloped with Chaofeng.

142
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
I must tell her that we have left too.

143
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,900
All right.

144
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,400
Qingheng!

145
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,600
- Why are you only here now?
- I...

146
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,100
Ziwu. Qingheng.

147
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,000
- Celestial Mother.
- Celestial Mother.

148
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:11,800
I've prepared these medicinal pills and pure air pills.

149
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,400
Your brother is heavily wounded.

150
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,300
It'll be hard for him to heal without pure air.

151
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,400
When you go to the Mortal Realm, you must find him quickly and give these to him.

152
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,000
I will.

153
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,100
Celestial Mother, how's Celestial Father?

154
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:29,200
I went to persuade your celestial father just now. But he's still angry.

155
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,000
It seems it'll take some time for him and Youqin to reconcile.

156
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,500
I'll leave Youqin to both of you in the Mortal Realm.

157
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,600
Please rest assured, Celestial Mother.

158
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,500
Qingheng, why are you quiet?

159
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
The immortals feel like they've lost a pillar without Youqin.

160
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,000
Celestial Father and Celestial Mother also feel uneasy.

161
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,500
I want to stay to take care of them

162
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:56,600
and temporarily oversee daily affairs on Eldest Brother's behalf until they reconcile.

163
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,400
These are the medicinal pills and spirit beads I've been saving up.

164
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:07,100
Please help me pass them to Eldest Brother and ask him to take care of himself.

165
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:11,900
That's a good idea.

166
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:15,400
If Eldest Brother heard what you said, he would be happy for you.

167
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:19,700
Ever since you returned from the Mortal Realm, you've become more sensible.

168
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,200
Ziwu!

169
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,000
I've finally found you two.

170
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm Di Lanjue. Greetings, Your Majesty.

171
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:39,200
Di Lanjue, what are you...

172
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Well, the Heavenly Emperor banished me from the Heavenly Realm.

173
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:46,400
So I came here to bid farewell to you.

174
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,900
Are you returning to the Beast Realm?

175
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,300
No.

176
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:55,200
Immortal Xuanshang looked heavily injured. So I planned to go and find them to see if I could help them out.

177
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,900
That's great. Ziwu is also going to the Mortal Realm to search for her brother.

178
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,000
Since that's the case, why don't you travel together?

179
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,400
You can take care of each other.

180
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:05,900
Sure. That's a good idea.

181
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,900
So, how do you plan to find them?

182
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,900
Of course, I'll use my special skills.

183
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,800
Is it another powerful magic item?

184
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Show it to me quickly.

185
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,600
Are you sure you want to see it?

186
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,100
You're so disgusting.

187
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,800
Do you think I want to use this?

188
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,200
I just want to find a normal piece of clothing.

189
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,700
I can't do anything when Immortal Xuanshang is too clean.

190
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:39,200
I don't know how many times he used cleaning spells to wash each piece of clothing.

191
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,900
This is the only one with a bit of his scent.

192
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,400
Dear child, it must be hard on you.

193
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,000
Not at all.

194
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,600
Celestial Mother, why don't you head back first?

195
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,900
I'll send them to the Heavenly Southern Gate.

196
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,500
General, I'm indebted to Princess Yetan.

197
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,000
Now she's in trouble, I can't abandon her.

198
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,800
You were punished for violating the Heavenly Rules.

199
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Now you're trying to trespass the Heavenly Southern Gate.

200
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,600
If you repeatedly commit serious crimes, you'll be stripped of your immortal status.

201
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,900
My immortal status is indeed important to me.

202
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,200
But for Princess Yetan, I would rather give up my immortal status.

203
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,100
I didn't expect Husui to be so loyal to Sister-in-law.

204
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,200
Qingheng!

205
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Immortal Qingheng.

206
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,100
I entrusted Husui to deliver essential items for my eldest brother on this trip.

207
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,400
Go to the Mortal Realm.
<i>[Qingheng]</i>

208
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,000
I'd like to see who dares to stop you.

209
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,100
Thank you, Immortal Qingheng.

210
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,100
<i>Take care of yourself.</i>

211
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,900
<i>I'll leave eldest brother and sister-in-law in your hands.</i>

212
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,900
Stop!

213
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,500
- Where's your token?
- What token?

214
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,800
Heavenly Emperor kicked me out.

215
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:55,100
I don't want to stay in a lousy place like this.

216
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:56,300
Move aside!

217
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,400
Wait for me!

218
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,400
- Here.
- Thank you.

219
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,100
I'll go and get the door.

220
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Sister!

221
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Tan'er!

222
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,600
We finally meet after parting in Beast Realm.

223
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:34,300
Sister, how did the Void find out about the swap?

224
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,000
Could it be that the Void Empress has discovered our plan and is taking revenge?

225
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,100
Are you hurt?

226
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
Did they make things difficult for you?

227
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,600
How am I supposed to answer when you're asking so many questions all at once?

228
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,700
Don't worry. We've already escaped from danger and it's safe now.

229
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,700
Let's catch up later.

230
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,100
Look who I brought here.

231
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,900
Imperial Father?

232
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:32,600
Emperor Tun, it's my fault for not reporting to you about the wrong marriage earlier.

233
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,000
Immortal Xuanshang, you did nothing wrong.

234
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,700
If someone is to blame, it must be Devil of Void.

235
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,900
Imperial Father knows everything?

236
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,700
I told imperial father everything on our way here.

237
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:52,400
Father-in-law, it's all my fault.

238
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,300
Don't call me that.

239
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:58,600
Because of your selfishness, you caused such a disaster where both of my daughters married the wrong people.

240
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:02,100
Do you still have the face to call me your father-in-law?

241
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,100
Emperor Tun, you're right to scold him.

242
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:08,200
It was Chaofeng who committed such a grave mistake.

243
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:13,100
Why don't you be obedient and kneel and apologize to your father-in-law?

244
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,900
Everything is my fault.

245
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:20,100
Father-in-law, I'll accept any beating or punishment so long it makes you feel better.

246
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,400
You said so.

247
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
You can't use this.

248
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,700
Consort Mother, don't stop him.

249
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,600
I've promised my father-in-law that he can punish me.

250
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,700
I mean not to use the shoe.

251
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,300
Use this one.

252
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Yes, just use this and hit me, Father-in-law.

253
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,500
- I...
- Hit him.

254
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,800
- This...
- Hit him.

255
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,600
All right. I'll use this one then!

256
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,200
- Do it, Father-in-law!
- Wait, I'll do it right away.

257
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Don't wait. Just hit me.

258
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,100
What's the rush?

259
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,900
I'm not even in a hurry. Why are you being impatient?

260
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,400
If you don't do it, I'll do it myself.

261
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,600
Did I tell you to get up?

262
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
I...

263
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,600
The human race is weak.

264
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,700
My decision to marry off two daughters was to ensure that common people would be protected

265
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,900
by the immortals and the voidwalkers, and not be trampled upon.

266
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:33,200
But now, it has caused the anger of both tribes.

267
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,500
Since things have come to this, it's better to...

268
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:46,800
I should take my two daughters back to the palace and explain the situation,

269
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,700
and then ask both clans to break off the betrothals.

270
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:52,000
Imperial Father, I've already married Chaofeng.

271
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,200
We'll not be separated in life or death.

272
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,800
What?

273
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,300
You...

274
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:59,600
You are the most valued Empyrean Consort of the Liguang family.

275
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,200
You can't be married to this devil!

276
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,600
Our wrong marriages were indeed caused by someone's mistake.

277
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:08,200
But it is also because of this that we have both found the person to grow old with.

278
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:12,000
If you look at it, it seems to be fated.

279
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,500
I'll go wherever Youqin goes.

280
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:19,000
You troublemaker, you caused Empyrean Xuanshang to lose his position as the Empyrean.

281
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,500
How can you still be so willful?

282
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,600
Emperor Tun, you've mistaken.

283
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,200
If it weren't for Tan'er's sacrifice, I wouldn't be here today.

284
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:31,400
In any case, we'll decide on our own marriage.

285
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,400
I see.

286
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Since you sisters are not listening to me, I might just as well die!

287
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,100
- Imperial Father!
- Father-in-law!

288
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:41,800
You just escaped from the Void. You must be physically and mentally exhausted.

289
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,300
You should get some rest first.

290
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,200
We can deal with these matters after we return to the palace.

291
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,700
Emperor Tun, your premier room, fruit platter and foot bath are ready for you.

292
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,800
Please come this way.

293
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:51,800
Let me do it.

294
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,300
Father-in-law, you sprained your ankle.

295
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,600
Let me carry you back to your room.

296
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,600
Don't call me Father-in-law.

297
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,500
I don't need you to carry me.

298
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,000
- I'm not going.
- Come on.

299
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,200
What are you doing, Chaofeng?

300
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
You evil brat. You caused all of this today.

301
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,200
Father-in-law, you're right.

302
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,300
- Don't call me that!
- Let me carry you.

303
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:11,800
Chaofeng, I'll kill you. You immoral, shameless, wicked, evil brat!

304
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,100
You're a mad evil brat!

305
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,600
Father-in-law, you're right. I have a wicked heart.

306
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,700
Don't call me Father-in-law!

307
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,100
Father-in-law, you're absolutely right!

308
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,500
Father-in-law, we have arrived.

309
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,200
Don't call me that, you devil.

310
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,600
Imperial Father, you've been cursing Chaofeng all the way.

311
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:39,100
We're already almost home and your voice is already hoarse.

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,600
Why don't you stop for a while?

313
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,800
You...

314
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,300
It's all right.

315
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,800
You should vent all your anger.

316
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:49,900
Emperor Tun, just curse him some more.

317
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,500
That's right, Father-in-law. Curse me some more.

318
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,300
Don't call me that.

319
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,000
The wedding procession is still vivid in my mind and the palace gate remains the same.
<i>[Liguang Palace]</i>

320
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,600
But the four of us...

321
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,800
We stumbled upon a stroke of good fortune.

322
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,000
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

323
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,400
This is it.
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

324
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,100
Come in.

325
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,400
This place may not be as good as Penglai Hall.

326
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:48,100
But you'll have to bear with staying here for a few days.

327
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:52,500
Why aren't you saying anything?

328
00:24:54,700 --> 00:25:01,500
You told me about your past, but seeing it with my own eyes breaks my heart.

329
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,400
But it still looks...

330
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,700
<i>[Wu Dai]</i>

331
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,500
Isn't this Wu Dai?

332
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:13,900
Why did you hang his portrait on the wall?

333
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:20,900
I always wanted to be the Devil of Void in the past. So I used Wu Dai as my goal.

334
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,100
But I'm stronger than him, aren't I?

335
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,100
I didn't know you back then.

336
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,000
So, why did you want to be the Devil of Void?

337
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,700
Since I was young, everyone said I was an ill-fated person and wanted to kill me.

338
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,400
So I made up my mind that I wanted to be the strongest ill-fated person.

339
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,000
I wanted to go to the Void and be the most vicious devil.

340
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,400
If this painting makes you upset, I'll tear it down.

341
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
I wasn't upset.

342
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:56,300
I just regret not appearing by your side sooner.

343
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:57,600
What about your imperial father?

344
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,300
You were having such a difficult time. Why didn't he help you?

345
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,900
Oh, him?

346
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:04,600
He would only scold and blame me.

347
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,900
After suffering so many injustices, don't you have any resentment?

348
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,500
What's the use of resenting?

349
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,500
I'm already lucky enough to have survived with such a bad omen.

350
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,500
Besides, no one is trying to kill me now.

351
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,100
Everyone is minding their own business now. My life is pretty good now.

352
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:28,000
No matter what happens from now on, I'll protect you and make sure you'll never get hurt.

353
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,900
Well, you should focus on healing your injuries first.

354
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,800
But I'm still stronger than him.

355
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,200
Kui'er,

356
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,600
are these the Empyrean Consort studies you've been learning for the past 18 years?

357
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
To study all of these, I suppose you didn't even have time to eat or sleep.

358
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,600
These aren't everything.

359
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,200
Every now and then, the immortals would send thick scrolls

360
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,800
listing thousands of things that one must learn as an immortal.

361
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:10,100
I knew sister was lonely and wished to accompany her.

362
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,800
But I was always occupied by these complicated matters.

363
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:18,200
Looking back, the past 18 years seem dull as if it were just one day.

364
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:22,700
But after meeting you, those days seemed like a lifetime ago.

365
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:27,000
When you first entered the Void, you were very cautious and afraid of making mistakes.

366
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:30,600
But later on, you managed to subdue Wu Dai and helped to abolish the Medical Restraint Order.

367
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:34,200
Just several days ago, you even used Dingyun to resolve a crisis at Fenyuan Hall

368
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,900
without using a single soldier from the Void Patrol Battalion.

369
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,100
You have grown a lot in courage and wisdom, Kui'er.

370
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,500
The Void Empress deliberately planned her revenge. It was only natural that we retaliated.

371
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,900
After our escape, I did feel afraid.

372
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:51,000
But thankfully, I heard that Void Tyrant confined the Void Empress and currently has no power.

373
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,000
We can feel a little relieved now.

374
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:02,600
Kui'er, have you thought about where we should go after leaving the palace?

375
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:04,300
Home is where the heart is.

376
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,900
As long as I'm with you, I'm happy to go anywhere.

377
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:12,300
We'll find a safe place to settle down, have some children, and open a clinic.

378
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,600
At work, we'll treat the sick and injured.

379
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,400
After work, we'll enjoy our time as a family.

380
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,800
Now, that's a blessing in life.

381
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,000
Princess Qingkui.

382
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
What do you want?

383
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,700
Yetan said she left to take care of something. But she has been gone for half a day.

384
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,300
Do you know where she went?

385
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,800
Did she tell you why she went out?

386
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,000
No, she didn't. I'll go and look for her.

387
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,500
Immortal Xuanshang, you're injured.

388
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,900
Let me and Chaofeng go instead.

389
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:41,800
Chaofeng.

390
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,500
I don't want to run errands for the Fifth.

391
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,500
What do you mean by the Fifth?

392
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:48,500
With the soul shards, that makes you the fifth Shaodian Youqin.

393
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,400
You...

394
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,200
Stop talking nonsense. Come and find Tan'er with me.

395
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,400
- Let's go.
- You don't have to look for me.

396
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,800
- Tan'er.
- I'm back.

397
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:55,900
- Tan'er.
- My sister-in-law is back.

398
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,000
Where did you go?

399
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,500
I went up the mountain to collect some medicinal herbs.

400
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,600
This is Moon-gazing Grass.

401
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:00,800
They contain pure air.

402
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,600
It might be good for your injuries.

403
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
This medicinal herb is rare in the Mortal Realm. Where did you find these?

404
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:08,200
I just picked a few on the mountain.

405
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,500
Stop lying.

406
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,100
You clearly look exhausted.

407
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:13,600
You must have walked over ten li of mountain roads.

408
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,300
Who would have thought that our Tan'er has become so thoughtful now?

409
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,300
She even knows how to take care of her husband.

410
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,400
Sister.

411
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:23,100
Sister-in-law, you sure are thoughtful.

412
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:27,800
It's said livestock that often chews on Moon-gazing Grass can awaken their intelligence.

413
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:30,500
So the immortals often use it to feed their horses.

414
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,900
Congratulations, Your Highness.

415
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,300
You have become an animal.

416
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,800
I...

417
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:39,800
I didn't know it was for feeding horses.

418
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,400
Ignore him.

419
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:46,600
Since my birth, I've been waited upon by various stars.

420
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,000
You worked very hard to pick these for me.

421
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,400
It's much more precious than the pure air in the Heavenly Realm.

422
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,900
Moon-gazing Grass is bitter and difficult to take.

423
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,000
But it's the only thing that can help you recover at the moment.

424
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:04,200
Why don't we extract its juice and make it into green dumplings?

425
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,200
That's a great idea. Sister, teach me how to make it.

426
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,600
Immortal Xuanshang, His Majesty asked for your presence.

427
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,000
What about me?

428
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:20,100
His Majesty didn't summon for you.

429
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:21,600
Please come with me.

430
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,800
I'll go and see your father.

431
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,000
We're both his sons-in-law.

432
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,100
Why favor one over the other?

433
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,100
Sister, don't add any fillings.

434
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,000
He doesn't eat those.

435
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:45,600
Our Tan'er has become so attentive to Immortal Xuanshang now.

436
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
Of course.

437
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,800
Immortal Xuanshang told me that both of you won't be able to return to the Heavenly Realm anymore.

438
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,000
Do you feel sad about it?

439
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,000
Not really.

440
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:01,000
It's just that I won't be able to eat coriander flatbread made by Husui,

441
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:06,600
play mahjong with the three masters, or enjoy hotpot with Qingheng anymore.

442
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,300
Actually, the Heavenly Empress has been very nice to me.

443
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:13,600
Oh, well. At least, we don't have to be separated by two realms and unable to meet each other.

444
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,000
From now on, I'll stick to you every day.

445
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,800
As long as your Immortal Xuanshang doesn't mind, I couldn't be happier.

446
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,600
Why would he mind?

447
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:31,700
You're willing to do anything for Immortal Xuanshang now.

448
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,300
Look at how tired you've made yourself.

449
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,200
Go and rest. I'll do it for you.

450
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,900
No, I want him to eat something I make myself.

451
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:39,600
Something you make yourself?

452
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,200
Have you ever made food for me yourself?

453
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,700
I'll make one for you in a moment.

454
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,400
Imperial Father probably hasn't eaten yet.

455
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,700
Let's make more.

456
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:03,200
Tan'er, I've always felt that imperial father cares about you.

457
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:05,900
I was bullied and suffered a lot when I was young.

458
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,400
Did he ever stand up for me?

459
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,200
He even locked me up in the Zhaolu Hall.

460
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,800
How can I believe when you said he cares about me?

461
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,700
Then why has he been cherishing the Chinese chess set you carved for him?

462
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,000
Checkmate.

463
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:32,800
Immortal Xuanshang, you appear gentle and refined, but your chess skills are quite fierce.

464
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,600
I'm truly asking for trouble by challenging you to a chess game.

465
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,800
I have some concerns on my mind. So I made my moves a bit faster.

466
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,000
I hope you're not offended by it.

467
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,000
Immortal Xuanshang, please speak your mind.

468
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,600
You can count on me to help out in the Mortal Realm.

469
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,300
Today, I heard some rumors about Tan'er in the palace.

470
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:57,800
I'm very concerned that someone might send her to be eaten by a tiger again.

471
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:08,400
It seems you truly like Yetan.

472
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:12,700
Emperor Tun, why do you dislike Tan'er?

473
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,600
<i>[Memorial]</i>

474
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:23,300
Immortal Xuanshang, please take a look at what's written on the memorials.

475
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,600
<i>[Since Second Princess's birth, droughts started in the southwest, indicating an impending disaster.]</i>

476
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,200
<i>[I implore Your Majesty to make a painful decision.]</i>

477
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,080
<i>[I implore Your Majesty to make a painful decision]</i>

478
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,250
<i>[and execute Liguang Yetan to pacify the wrath of heaven.]</i>

479
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:52,840
These are all about requesting to execute Tan.

480
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,960
This talk of strange omens in the sky is completely groundless.

481
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,240
When I was a soul shard as Fiery, the villagers of Yuewo Village mistook me for a fire demon.

482
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,360
Good and evil reside in the heart and are seen in one's actions.

483
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,440
Even devils may have the wish to do good and accumulate virtue.

484
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,200
Even immortals cannot guarantee that they'll not harm others.

485
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:13,660
As the emperor of the human race, how could you not understand this?

486
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:15,900
Immortal Xuanshang, you can still prove yourself despite the false accusations.

487
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,360
But Yetan... is a mortal.

488
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,700
Once she is labeled with a bad reputation, she would not be accepted

489
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,560
by the immortals and human race who uphold standards of conduct and principles.

490
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:29,860
I'm powerless to go against the will of the people.

491
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,120
Immortal Xuanshang, do you dare?

492
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,780
I vow to be faithful to her for this lifetime.

493
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:42,000
From now on, whether facing the world collapsing or a fight in battle, Tan'er's life is my life.

494
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,680
Good!

495
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,520
Very good.

496
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,920
You're the only one who dares say such words.

497
00:34:55,920 --> 00:35:00,000
I've shouldered the destiny of Tan'er for 18 years.

498
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:04,120
Now, it's time for you to take over it.

499
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:07,340
Emperor Tun, what do you mean?

500
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:14,020
When Tan'er was born, the strange omen in the sky indicated that a great disaster would befall the human race.

501
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:20,180
Since then, everyone blames all disasters and calamities

502
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,060
on Yetan.

503
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,380
<i>I've observed the stars at night.</i>

504
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:34,940
<i>When Princess Yetan was born, there was a phenomenon of planetary standstill.</i>

505
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,980
<i>It's considered an ominous sign indicating that the country would face difficulties and disasters.</i>

506
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,640
<i>Your Majesty, please take heed.</i>

507
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:45,980
<i>Since her birth, the usually humid southwestern border has unexpectedly become dry.</i>

508
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,260
<i>This is an omen of impending disaster.</i>

509
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:54,680
<i>I implore Your Majesty to make a decisive and painful decision for the sake of our people and country.</i>

510
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:59,020
<i>Your Majesty, all the ministers are thinking of the human race.</i>

511
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,540
<i>Please don't hesitate any longer.</i>

512
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:10,520
But she's my daughter, after all. She was still in her infancy.

513
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:13,480
How could I bear to do such a thing?

514
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:16,020
<i>It's...</i>

515
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:19,760
<i>It's not that I'm not willing.</i>

516
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,360
<i>It's just that I've already promised to marry off my eldest daughter to the immortals.</i>

517
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:26,980
<i>When the Void Tyrant knew about this, he was very displeased,</i>

518
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:30,420
<i>thinking that we, the human race, were disregarding the Void.</i>

519
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:34,780
<i>Therefore, I was thinking of offering my second daughter to the Void,</i>

520
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:39,780
<i>to ensure long-term peace and stability for the human race.</i>

521
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,820
<i>What do all of you think about this?</i>

522
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:44,560
<i>Well...</i>

523
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,040
<i>- Your Majesty is wise!
- Your Majesty is wise!</i>

524
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,540
My idea may have protected her for a moment,

525
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:02,960
but it cannot stop people from seeing her in a bad light.

526
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:21,960
<i>Some even saw themselves as heroes,</i>

527
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:27,500
<i>thinking they can become saviors of the human race by killing her.</i>

528
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:50,160
<i>Tan knew that people see her as a harbinger of misfortune.</i>

529
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,800
So her heart gradually turned hard and cold.

530
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:57,300
She also learned how to retaliate.

531
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,760
<i>Born from the earth.</i>

532
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,060
<i>- There are plants and trees.
- There are plants and trees.</i>

533
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,960
<i>- The three lights.
- The three lights.</i>

534
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,640
<i>- The sun, moon, and stars.
- The sun, moon, and stars.</i>

535
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:14,120
<i>- The three bonds.
- The three bonds.</i>

536
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,620
<i>- The duty between ruler and subject.
- The duty between ruler and subject.</i>

537
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:18,620
<i>- Hey, Baozi.
- The affection between father and children.</i>

538
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,660
<i>The affection between father and children.</i>

539
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:23,800
<i>- The harmony between husband and wife.
- The harmony between husband and wife.</i>

540
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,680
<i>Spring and summer.</i>

541
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:27,960
<i>Autumn and winter.</i>

542
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:50,520
<i>Since that incident, she had been sleeping on the beam and wouldn't trust anyone anymore.</i>

543
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,340
<i>I may understand the pain in her heart.</i>

544
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:58,060
<i>But she had become increasingly rebellious, to the point where even I'm afraid of her.</i>

545
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,900
<i>I even suspect that she might really be the ominous person.</i>

546
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:09,980
So I had to lock her up in Zhaolu Hall and guard her strictly to prevent any trouble.

547
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:14,080
In reality, you've been protecting her all along.

548
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,260
I'm powerless.

549
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,020
The Grand Chancellor is a senior who has served three dynasties, is deeply rooted in the court, and highly respected.

550
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,720
I wanted to do more for her, but I lack the ability to do it.

551
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:29,340
Fortunately, she met you.

552
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:32,920
Since you're determined to protect her,

553
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:37,100
I no longer have to worry about her anymore.

554
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,880
Why are you only saying this now?

555
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,020
I was terrified.

556
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:04,200
I was terrified that you're an ill-fated person who will harm the human race.

557
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,760
I also feared you might lose your life.

558
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,400
You became more headstrong as you grew older.

559
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:17,960
I couldn't suppress the opposing voices in court, nor could I discipline you.

560
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,200
I really didn't know what is the right thing to do.

561
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,400
I was torn between two choices

562
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,760
and felt powerless.

563
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:30,340
I don't care how others treat me in the palace.

564
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:33,300
But you broke my heart the most.

565
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,240
You also saw me as an ill-fated person.

566
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:41,420
When I was deprived of food and education, despised by others, and went through a lot of suffering,

567
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:45,080
you didn't say anything to comfort me.

568
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,380
I dared not say it.

569
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:51,400
I was afraid if I show compassion only once, it would lead to suspicion and criticism from the ministers.

570
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,280
The truth is...

571
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:00,160
Every year on your and your sister's birthdays,

572
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:04,740
I would prepare two gifts for both of you.

573
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:07,560
I just didn't dare to give them to you.

574
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:13,880
I... could only hide them under your mother's memorial tablet

575
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,460
all these years.

576
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:25,260
What about now?

577
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:26,740
Why are you willing to say it now?

578
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:30,520
Aren't you afraid anymore, Imperial Father?
