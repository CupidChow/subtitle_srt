<i>[Episode 17]</i>

21
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:52,440
Tell me. What's the reason behind your rejection?

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,400
If you wish to extinguish the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire,

23
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,180
you need to acquire a magic item from the Rain Deity.

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,840
It's called the Purifying Vial.

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,400
It contains the Dew of the Sun and Moon, and it's connected to the Jade Pool.

26
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,720
Every year, the Rain Deity will pray for the human race.

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,920
I heard that it's the only thing that can extinguish the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

28
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:13,060
But we left the Heavenly Realm without permission.

29
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:15,680
If we return to the Heavenly Realm right now,

30
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,240
not only will we be punished, but we'll also lose our chance to come back and save Youqin.

31
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,280
You should continue eating. Come with me. Come on.

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,281
Are you trying to return to the Heavenly Realm again?

33
00:02:35,281 --> 00:02:37,680
The Heavenly Emperor is heartless.

34
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,960
If you go back now, you'll definitely be punished.

35
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:43,581
The Heavenly Thunder, the heavenly ordeals, your human body cannot withstand any of them.

36
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,340
Besides, didn't the Jade Deity tell us already?

37
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,060
You just need to make the soul shards fall in love with you.

38
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,781
After we retrieve the other two soul shards, we'll call Fiery and merge the soul shards with him.

39
00:02:51,781 --> 00:02:54,950
The Southern Brightness Sacred Fire has nothing to do with you.

40
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:58,821
Although that's the case, the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire is very important to Fiery.

41
00:02:58,821 --> 00:03:02,020
If I bring him away by force, both he nor I won't be able to rest at ease.

42
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:05,220
Shouldn't the Devil of Void resort to anything to achieve her goals?

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:08,060
Tan Tan, you've been going against the ways of the devil lately.

44
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,760
What's wrong with being a devil? Can't a devil make friends?

45
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,420
Can't a devil fulfill her friend's wish?

46
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:15,580
I will not let him suffer again.

47
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:18,960
I will fulfill his wish. I've made up my mind.

48
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,660
Then... What if you die in the Heavenly Realm then?

49
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,460
How can I face Young Master when he comes back?

50
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:27,700
What else can I do? Do you want me to wait for them to send me the vial?

51
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:29,093
I...

52
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,400
Isn't it easier if we ask the immortals to send someone down here?

53
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,640
You want the deities to send their magic item to you?

54
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,280
Is she out of her mind? Or am I out of my mind here?

55
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,900
Sister-in-law, since you're saying that, I assume you've come up with something.

56
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,633
Of course.

57
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:53,260
Ever since the wedding pact made 18 years ago, the immortals will send someone

58
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:58,120
to the Mortal Realm at this time of the year to pray for us.

59
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,900
I only remember that we used to sneak into the Imperial Kitchen

60
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:03,850
and steal the offerings that were meant for the deities.

61
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,620
I remember that too.

62
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,573
I...

63
00:04:11,573 --> 00:04:15,860
At this time of the year, immortals will pray for the human race.

64
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,200
The immortal emissary will bring them here.

65
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,920
However, it only happens on the tenth day of the ninth month.

66
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,870
Today's only the tenth day of the eighth month.

67
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:32,200
What if we make them realize that the human race is in trouble and that they have to come down to pray for us?

68
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,860
What's the situation? Lan'er is fine now.

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,420
- He's already asleep.
- Good.

70
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,580
This is the real deal.

71
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,861
Look, this is real.
<i>[Jade]</i>

72
00:04:48,861 --> 00:04:51,760
It's the mark of the Jade Deity.

73
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,920
No one in the four realms can copy this.

74
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:03,680
- The girl looks so young, and she's not powerful.
- That's right.

75
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,440
However, she owns the magic item created by the Jade Deity himself.

76
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,560
It's obvious that she has a noble identity among the immortals.

77
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,680
There's only one fairy that can fit the bill.

78
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,080
<i>- She's the Heavenly Princess.
- She's the Heavenly Princess.</i>

79
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:23,840
No wonder I thought she looked familiar.

80
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:27,180
I saw her in Guixu before.

81
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,440
Beast King, Beast Queen, can you listen to my explanation now?

82
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,940
Don't explain yourself!

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:35,300
- I...
- Before this, I thought she was a demoness.

84
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:39,170
It'll be embarrassing if we let her reveal her true identity now.

85
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:45,060
Why don't we pretend to be ignorant and set her up with Lan'er?

86
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,900
I believe that no one in the Beast Realm

87
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:56,880
can force Lan'er to extract his internal elixir, unless he did so willingly.

88
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,600
He sacrificed himself because of you.

89
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,620
We can see that you're very important to him.

90
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:13,206
Of course, we were too rude to send you both to prison.

91
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,206
Please forgive us, Miss.

92
00:06:17,206 --> 00:06:21,640
<i>They're pretty quick at changing their stances.</i>

93
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,480
- Beast King.
- Miss, you'll forgive us?

94
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,080
Thank you so much.

95
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,040
Although Lan'er has absorbed the internal elixir, he needs to rest and recuperate.

96
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,600
- But—
- Of course, miss, I'm sure you were shocked since you were just released from prison.

97
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,200
- I...
- What about this?

98
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:41,800
You can spend your days keeping Lan'er company at the Prince's Mansion.

99
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,080
You can rest and recuperate there.

100
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,290
- But...
- Servants!

101
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,020
You two, bring the lady to the side chamber.

102
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:49,440
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty. Do rest well.

103
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,353
Please.

104
00:06:51,353 --> 00:06:53,173
Please.

105
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,820
Do rest well.

106
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,700
The immortal princess has a noble identity.

107
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:06,740
If she does marry Lan'er, it'll be a joyous occasion for our tribe.

108
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,480
You're right.

109
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:12,820
However, the immortals of the Heavenly Realm are very prideful.

110
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:18,860
If he finds out that his precious daughter came to the Beast Realm without his permission,

111
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:20,680
he'll surely throw a thunderous fit.

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,380
That's why we should keep this a secret for now.

113
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,113
That's right.

114
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:29,680
Our son only has eyes for that jinx from the Liguang family.

115
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,491
Luckily, she has married off to the Void long ago.

116
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:37,700
Now that the immortal princess is here,

117
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:43,040
I don't need to worry about his relationship with that jinx.

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:45,860
You're right.

119
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:59,520
Sir, we only observe the stars once every six months.

120
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,960
Why have we increased its frequency?

121
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:07,410
Ever since the two princesses left, His Majesty has been feeling unwell and kept having headaches.

122
00:08:07,410 --> 00:08:09,520
Before this, anomalies were happening in Guixu.

123
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,500
After that, a theft broke out in the palace.

124
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:14,100
Lately, the human race has been experiencing misfortunes.

125
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,620
I increased its frequency as I was afraid that something else might happen.

126
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:20,000
At least we can take precautions if we discover any anomalies.

127
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,900
It's been over 30 years since the late Emperor gave me his final instruction.

128
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:27,760
Sir, you've always been assisting His Majesty ever since he ascended the throne.

129
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,360
You've done much for the people.

130
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,560
Sir, you've done everything you could for the human race.

131
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,400
I hope His Majesty can understand my intention.

132
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,760
Back then, I suggest His Majesty execute Yetan, the Second Princess, to ensure the human race's safety.

133
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:46,540
His Majesty might look like he respected my suggestion, but I think

134
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:51,060
that was the beginning of our estrangement.

135
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:55,580
Sir, your dedication to the human race is clear for all to see.

136
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,980
His Majesty will understand it eventually.

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:01,080
No matter how His Majesty thinks about me,

138
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,646
I'll have peace of mind as long as the human race is safe.

139
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:09,000
By the way, pass the star chart to me.

140
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,440
As long as the human race is safe, huh?

141
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,180
Today, I'll make sure this old fool and Liguang Yang have a hard time together.

142
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:34,090
This is the jinx star, Rooftop Swallow Mansion!

143
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:36,400
How did it appear all of a sudden?

144
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,401
It's an enormous omen! Yes!

145
00:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,501
- Report this to His Majesty immediately. Hurry!
- Yes.

146
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,920
Your Majesty, your headaches are getting worse.

147
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,920
In the future, you should stop tiring yourself out over state matters.

148
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,360
After the occurrence of the Guixu anomaly, the human race, which has no power, suffered the most losses.

149
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,740
I'm the ruler of the realm.

150
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,260
How could I slack off?

151
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,610
This headache is nothing.

152
00:10:04,610 --> 00:10:09,080
Your Majesty, you mentioned that you couldn't sleep well lately because you dreamed of the princesses.

153
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,993
Are you worried that they might not be doing well?

154
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:17,180
Lately, in my dreams, they had no place to go and no food to eat.

155
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:19,180
Your Majesty, dreams always show the opposite scenarios.

156
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:21,980
That means they're doing well now.

157
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,520
Yes. I guess I'm overthinking it.

158
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,660
Right now, they're protected by the two strongest races in the four realms.

159
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:31,400
It's much safer than staying with us.

160
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,111
I no longer need to worry about them.

161
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,860
Your Majesty, wait!

162
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:39,560
- Stop! Lower the carriage!
- Your Majesty, wait!

163
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,360
Your Majesty, I have pressing matters to report to you.

164
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,040
My loyal subject, what's the urgency?

165
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,880
When I was observing the stars, the jinx star, Rooftop Swallow Mansion, appeared out of nowhere.

166
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,280
It's an extremely ill omen.

167
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:55,300
Since the jinx star flew into the sky, it will descend eventually.

168
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,220
I was afraid that the public might be terrified.

169
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:59,980
That's why I came to report the issue.

170
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,540
No wonder misfortunes have been happening often lately.

171
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:05,920
Every year, the immortals will perform a ceremony for the human race

172
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,580
to dispel all misfortunes and enhance good fortunes.

173
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,280
For this year's ceremony, we must request the immortals to dispel our misfortunes for us.

174
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,920
There's one month left before the prayer ceremony.

175
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:19,520
However, the ill omen of the Rooftop Swallow Mansion will come true by tomorrow!

176
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:23,200
I'm afraid the one-month gap will bring disaster to the country!

177
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,960
Your Majesty, please write to the immortals immediately

178
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:30,420
and request them to come in advance to proceed with the prayer ceremony.

179
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,820
You do have a point.

180
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,040
I'll write to the immortals right now.

181
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,080
Your Majesty, be careful. Here.

182
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,240
Raise the carriage.

183
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,433
Qingheng?

184
00:11:55,433 --> 00:11:57,110
- Sister-in-law.
- Qingheng!

185
00:11:57,110 --> 00:11:59,760
Sister-in-law, how was it? Did they fall for it?

186
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,920
Of course. Just now, that old dog...

187
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,301
I mean, the Grand Chancellor, was shocked when he saw the Rooftop Swallow Mansion.

188
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:13,061
He rushed to my father and told him to hold the prayer ceremony in advance.

189
00:12:13,061 --> 00:12:15,070
Sister-in-law, you're a prophet indeed.

190
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,380
So, what should we do next?

191
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:20,980
I've already come up with a solution.

192
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:29,020
<i>During the prayer ceremony, my father will take a bath and get changed to show his sincerity.</i>

193
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:36,020
<i>By then, I can delay him with my tricks for at least an hour.</i>

194
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:45,440
Where's my ceremonial suit?

195
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,690
Where's my ceremonial suit?

196
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:52,500
Useless fools! You can't even do your job well?

197
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,580
The deities have been waiting for a long time.

198
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:57,200
All of you will be executed if the prayer ceremony is delayed!

199
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,100
I'll kill you all! I'll kill you all!

200
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,660
- Your Majesty, have mercy!
- Your Majesty, have mercy!

201
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,740
- <i>Your Majesty, have mercy!</i>
- <i>Your Majesty, have mercy!</i>

202
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:06,700
- Man Man, by then, you can impersonate my father.
- Me?

203
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,890
You will meet up with the immortal emissary first.

204
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,280
Welcome, Empyrean.

205
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,080
Welcome, Empyrean.

206
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:25,180
There was a sense of foreboding when we read the stars.

207
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:27,380
We had no choice but to hold the prayer ceremony in advance.

208
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,400
Empyrean, please forgive us.

209
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:31,573
It's nothing.

210
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,940
Please.

211
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,300
The prayer ceremony is held every year.

212
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,520
The Ministry of Immortal Rites has gotten everything ready in advance.

213
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,200
<i>I just had to depart a few days earlier.</i>

214
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:43,000
<i>Emperor Tun, are you still suffering from headaches?</i>

215
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,620
Empyrean, I was elated when I heard that you were coming.

216
00:13:45,620 --> 00:13:48,240
I feel much better now.

217
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,553
Laugh!

218
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,593
Laugh!

219
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,820
Empyrean, we'll have to depend on you for the prayer ceremony.

220
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,200
This is part of my duty.

221
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,050
Emperor Tun, you need not be courteous.

222
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:05,040
Empyrean, please.

223
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,840
Emperor Tun, please.

224
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,553
Empyrean, I've admired the immortals' tools of rites for a long time.

225
00:14:16,553 --> 00:14:18,640
May I have a look?

226
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,760
It's divine indeed.

227
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:34,540
Man Man will impersonate Father and meet up with the immortal emissary.

228
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:39,460
After that, we'll swap the real deal with a fake one.

229
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,160
You.

230
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:52,220
Bring the Empyrean to inspect the prayer altar.

231
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:54,100
- Empyrean, please.
- Empyrean, please.

232
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,513
Sure.

233
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,220
You're amazing!

234
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,560
What do you think about my plan?

235
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,260
Sister-in-law, you're amazing indeed.

236
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:37,820
You're truly resourceful and quick-witted. This is an excellent plan.

237
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,760
Excellent plan, my foot!

238
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,710
I'm not doing it.

239
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,600
It's not your first time impersonating my father anyway.

240
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,200
How could this be the same?

241
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,580
This time, it's the prayer ceremony.

242
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,040
Everyone will have their eyes on me.

243
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,480
It's way different from the previous situation.

244
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,130
Previous situation?

245
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,640
What? Did you guys impersonate Emperor Tun for fun?

246
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,300
Just do me this favor, okay?

247
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:01,980
If you help me out, I'll return the favor when you need my help.

248
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:06,420
If so, I need to consider it seriously and ask you to do me a big favor.

249
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,420
Qingheng, by then, you'll be our scout.

250
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:13,340
Man Man's call will be our signal.

251
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,260
Got it.

252
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:18,760
The prayer ceremony is held at noon.

253
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:23,700
When we come back, it should be around dusk.

254
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,960
By then, I'll bring the magic item that can extinguish the Southern Brightness Sacred Fire back.

255
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:32,151
I can fulfill Fiery's wish for him too.

256
00:16:32,151 --> 00:16:33,440
You two can go to sleep first.

257
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,273
I'm going to tell Fiery about this!

258
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:42,320
"I'm going to tell Fiery about this!"

259
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,060
So childish.

260
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,820
Welcome, Empyrean.

261
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,760
<i>- Welcome, Empyrean.
- Welcome, Empyrean.</i>

262
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,360
There was a sense of foreboding when we read the stars.

263
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:09,060
We had no choice but to hold the prayer ceremony in advance.

264
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:11,700
Empyrean, please forgive us.

265
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,900
It's nothing.

266
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:14,550
Empyrean, please.

267
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,460
Has Emperor Tun's headaches gotten any better?

268
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,320
His Majesty was elated when he found out that Empyrean was coming.

269
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:22,880
His Majesty is taking a bath now to greet you with all his heart.

270
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,740
Empyrean, please take your seat.

271
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,173
Sure.

272
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:29,090
Empyrean, please have a seat.

273
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,620
They're decorating the hall right now.

274
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:43,200
<i>[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

275
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,880
Your Majesty, the bathtub and ceremonial suit are ready.

276
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,460
Please take a bath and get changed.

277
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,053
Wait.

278
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:24,560
I expected the immortal emissary to arrive early.

279
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,940
I've already taken my bath this morning.

280
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,400
I only need to wash up and get changed.

281
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,620
Yes, Your Majesty.

282
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,320
<i>He's not taking a bath now?</i>

283
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
<i>But the signal isn't here yet.</i>

284
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,160
<i>That means Man Man hasn't reached the altar yet.</i>

285
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,633
Your Majesty!

286
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:44,833
Are you okay?

287
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:48,060
Why was that spot as slippery as ice?

288
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:51,293
This... This...

289
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,553
This...

290
00:18:53,553 --> 00:18:56,800
Your Majesty, the floor is normal.

291
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,620
Your Majesty, maybe you're blurry due to your headaches.

292
00:18:59,620 --> 00:19:01,340
Do you wish to rest?

293
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,940
The emissary has been waiting for a long time.

294
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,340
I need to wash my hands and get changed.

295
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,880
Yes, Your Majesty. Hurry!

296
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,653
<i>Hurry up!</i>

297
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,850
<i>[Wanshou Hall]</i>

298
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:23,430
Empyrean, please wait a moment.

299
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,293
Your Majesty.

300
00:19:31,293 --> 00:19:32,300
Your Majesty.

301
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:35,460
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.</i>

302
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,040
Stop that! Turn around!

303
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,580
<i>- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.</i>

304
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:52,080
Don't touch me!

305
00:19:55,830 --> 00:19:58,970
<i>This...</i>

306
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,630
Greetings, Emperor Tun.

307
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:12,920
Greetings, Empyrean.

308
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,760
Emperor Tun, you're here even though it isn't time yet.

309
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:25,593
Your dedication to the people is as clear as the day.

310
00:20:25,593 --> 00:20:27,740
That's right, I...

311
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:33,680
I've admired the immortals' tools of rites for a long time.

312
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,740
May I have a look?

313
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,473
Well...

314
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:38,753
Fine.

315
00:20:38,753 --> 00:20:42,840
Emperor Tun, since this is your order, I will oblige.

316
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,960
Thank you, Empyrean.

317
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,180
Shouldn't I pray calmly with the Purifying Vial in my hand?

318
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,080
Emperor Tun, did you forget?

319
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:03,820
You have to burn the incense before you could proceed with the prayers.

320
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,000
Of course, I didn't forget.

321
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,300
However, such troublesome rites can be removed.

322
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:13,740
How could this be considered a troublesome rite?

323
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,880
Ever since the ill omen appeared, I couldn't sleep in peace.

324
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,780
I was anxious about the immortals' blessing.

325
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,760
This is just a minor rite.

326
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,110
It's okay for me to remove it, right?

327
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:33,790
Great things take time.

328
00:21:33,790 --> 00:21:40,400
Emperor Tun, if you're this impatient, I assume you cannot pray with a calm heart.

329
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:45,060
<i>Calm down. I'll waste more time if I argue with them.</i>

330
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:47,620
<i>I'll just get it over with.</i>

331
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:11,440
This is okay now, right?

332
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,360
Humans and immortals both take the same path.

333
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,160
To represent the sincerity of the immortals' blessing,

334
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,860
the Heavenly Emperor had sent me here to recite the blessings.

335
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,020
According to the way of the immortals, offspring shall be produced.

336
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,860
One's soul has a long source.

337
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:51,580
- As for...
- Why is he reading the blessings now?

338
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:54,320
Uncertainty vanquishes one's holiness.

339
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,080
Why are you staring at me?

340
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,460
The immortal emissary is reciting the blessings.

341
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,780
Why are you staring at me instead of him?

342
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:01,713
Turn around.

343
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:09,260
As the immortal lamp provides intelligence, various immortals

344
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:14,520
will give the Mortal Realm their blessings.

345
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,700
The Heavenly Emperor and Empress pray for harmonious times

346
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,020
and plentiful rain.

347
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:25,980
<i>Oh, no. All the immortals have sent their blessings here.</i>

348
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,840
<i>I'm afraid it will take several hours for him to finish reading.</i>

349
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,520
<i>How did I forget about this?</i>

350
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,260
<i>No, I must notify my sister-in-law immediately.</i>

351
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,340
The Rain Deity prays that the Liguang family

352
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:38,540
will have many offspring.

353
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,800
Hurry up! The prayer ceremony mustn't be delayed!

354
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,633
Hurry up!

355
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,380
<i>Haste makes waste.</i>

356
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:55,600
<i>You should take your time.</i>

357
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:00,981
<i>Your Majesty, have mercy! It's our fault! Your Majesty, have mercy!</i>

358
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:02,680
All of you, shut up!

359
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,593
What's going on?

360
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,580
Please bless us.

361
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:10,340
I'm sure something's wrong with the ceremonial suit.

362
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:13,100
Get me a new set! I'll change it myself! Hurry!

363
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,440
<i>- Yes, Your Majesty!
- Yes, Your Majesty! Hurry!</i>

364
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:22,520
<i>[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

365
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,793
Sister-in-law.

366
00:24:28,793 --> 00:24:30,020
Has she gotten her hands on the Purifying Vial?

367
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,880
It won't work.

368
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,620
We're following the immortals' routine for the prayer ceremony.

369
00:24:32,620 --> 00:24:34,160
There are plenty of rites to perform.

370
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,360
Man Man has no chance to strike.

371
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,510
We still need to think of a way to delay Emperor Tun.

372
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,740
They'll reach the front court soon.

373
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,420
If we keep delaying it, people might find out.

374
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,900
What should we do then?

375
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,620
Do you know how to perform telekinesis?

376
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,780
Telekinesis?

377
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,660
I do. But what item are we moving?

378
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:55,080
Don't tell me you want me to move Emperor Tun out of the palace?

379
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,600
Right now, I only have 30% of my power left.

380
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,960
I'm afraid I can't sustain it for long.

381
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,180
30% is more than enough. Follow me. Let's go.

382
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:05,300
Erlang Deity prays

383
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:08,080
that the human race may lead healthy and peaceful lives.

384
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,820
How many deities have sent their blessings here?

385
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,200
Your Majesty, you're very anxious.

386
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,360
Do you feel any discomfort?

387
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,680
Do I look like so?

388
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,400
Do I look like I'm feeling any discomfort?

389
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,300
No.

390
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,820
Good, then.

391
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,840
The blessings of the deities are very meaningful.

392
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,340
Please be patient.

393
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:28,500
Yes. I know that.

394
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:30,560
But I can't wait any longer.

395
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,740
Please be patient.

396
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,820
Turn around.

397
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:37,720
General Divine Fire prays that the human race will experience peace for all four seasons.

398
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:01,740
General Divine Water prays that the land will maintain peace.

399
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:04,140
Auspicious spring.

400
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,140
It's so hot.

401
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:08,720
And shining radiance.

402
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,940
Why does this corridor feel so long today?

403
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:12,280
Why aren't we there yet?

404
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:14,020
How could the corridor extend itself?

405
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,700
Maybe the corridor wasn't short in the first place.

406
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,840
And we're in a hurry too.

407
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,940
That's why we're having illusions.

408
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:21,580
Sister-in-law, this is a great idea.

409
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,793
I'm sure we're buying more time for Man Man.

410
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,540
- Watch out!
<i>- I hope that imperial father won't realize that it was my doing.</i>

411
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,560
Your Majesty, calm down!

412
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,380
I think I'll get a headache soon.

413
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:35,800
Hold my arm. The prayer ceremony mustn't be delayed!

414
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,393
Hurry!

415
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,953
Hurry! Hurry!

416
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,560
- Your Majesty, you...
- May their carts be filled with grains.

417
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,920
Empyrean Jiuling...

418
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,780
<i>This is bad. The liquid of the fake bottle is leaking.</i>

419
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:12,200
<i>Don't tell me they found out that I'm an impostor?</i>

420
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:15,053
Your Majesty.

421
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,960
What's going on?

422
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:29,053
This is...

423
00:27:29,053 --> 00:27:31,830
Your Majesty, seems like you're truly in a hurry.

424
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,380
Didn't I tell you already?

425
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:41,940
I was in a hurry.

426
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:43,750
If that's the case...

427
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,120
the prayer ceremony is done.

428
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,610
Everything will surely be fine now. It'll be fine now.

429
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:55,000
Emperor Tun, please take the magic item, head to the altar,

430
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,900
and scatter the dew of the Purifying Vial.

431
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,880
<i>I got the Purifying Vial now.</i>

432
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,020
<i>But if I wish to swap it with a fake, the fake bottle must contain liquid so that they won't find out.</i>

433
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,400
Why are you all staring at me?

434
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,980
Is there something on my robe?

435
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,800
<i>No.</i>

436
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:45,253
Empyrean,

437
00:28:45,253 --> 00:28:48,980
I suddenly remember that I have an urgent matter to deal with.

438
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:52,040
May I return after leaving for a moment?

439
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,230
Emperor Tun, please go ahead.

440
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:55,990
Here's your vial.

441
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,500
Why are you staring at me?

442
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,033
Turn around!

443
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,460
My headaches are getting worse.

444
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,513
Your Majesty!

445
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:18,560
Ever since this ill omen appeared, I haven't been able to sleep at night.

446
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:22,810
And now, I can't even finish this stupid corridor.

447
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:25,900
The immortals have all kinds of stupid rites. It's been so long.

448
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,700
Why hasn't Man Man brought back the Purifying Vial yet?

449
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:32,160
Sister-in-law, I'm an immortal too.

450
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,970
Sorry about that.

451
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:40,600
Your Majesty, why don't we take a break?

452
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:42,200
No way.

453
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,610
The prayer ceremony mustn't be delayed!

454
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,273
All right!

455
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,533
Your Majesty!

456
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,080
Qingheng, dispel your spell.

457
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,713
Are you sure?

458
00:30:18,713 --> 00:30:20,553
Dispel it.

459
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:29,953
This is...

460
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:32,660
This is... Look!

461
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,510
We're finally here.

462
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,900
We just need to make one more turn.

463
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:38,640
Let's hurry!

464
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,560
We've finally arrived!

465
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:50,060
Sister-in-law, I assume you feel sorry for your father.

466
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,920
However, if we don't delay Emperor Tun, Man Man will be...

467
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:58,560
- Sister-in-law, I...
- I got it! Let's go!

468
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,840
<i>- Let's go!</i>
- Okay!

469
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:13,960
Are you sure you want to skip the front part and let me start by scattering the dew?

470
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,780
I've thought about it.

471
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,860
Emperor Tun, you were already plagued by the omen.

472
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,660
We shouldn't make things difficult for you by requiring you to go through all the rites.

473
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:26,100
We should make things simple.

474
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:29,320
I do pay great attention to the sign this time.

475
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,820
If so, Empyrean, we'll do as you wish.

476
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,420
<i>I guess I made it up to him for my previous mistake.</i>

477
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:42,380
<i>Could it be that the immortal emissary was unhappy because I was late?</i>

478
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,940
<i>I think I shouldn't make any objections.</i>

479
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:46,690
<i>We should skip all the rites.</i>

480
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:57,300
<i>This isn't the Purifying Vial.</i>

481
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,680
<i>And it doesn't contain the true dew.</i>

482
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:02,120
<i>Could it be that I brought the wrong vial?</i>

483
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,080
<i>The liquid was hot.</i>

484
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,160
<i>Could it be that the immortal emissary was unhappy because I was late?</i>

485
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,960
Empyrean, the dew you brought is pure indeed!

486
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:29,020
My headaches are gone!

487
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,600
Even my forehead is shining!

488
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,900
<i>Luckily he didn't fall out with me.</i>

489
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,060
The ceremony is done!

490
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,693
Wait!

491
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,860
Empyrean, although you've skipped most of the rites,

492
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:52,520
I still have a question.

493
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:54,520
Emperor Tun, ask away.

494
00:32:55,420 --> 00:32:57,420
I have two daughters.

495
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:01,180
Although they've been sent to the immortals and voidwalkers
respectively,

496
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:07,260
in my heart, they're still descendants of the Liguang family.

497
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:13,280
I'm worried that the ill omen might implicate them.

498
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:18,410
I wonder if they were included as recipients of the blessings too?

499
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,840
Emperor Tun, don't worry.

500
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:25,120
Since you're the one initiating the ceremony,

501
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,600
the blessings will be shared with the entire human race,

502
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,800
including the two princesses.

503
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,200
If so, I can rest at ease now.

504
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,760
<i>When the sun sets, </i>

505
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,580
<i>Dear will bring the Purifying Vial here to extinguish the flame.</i>

506
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:52,200
<i>By then, we can leave.</i>

507
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,380
Sir, it's my first time seeing you acting like this.

508
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,280
You wasted so much time because of Princess Qingkui.

509
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,960
Just when we finally got her drunk, you just had to carry her back to the inn.

510
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:14,520
You prepared some hangover soup for her as you were afraid that she might have a hangover.

511
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,920
And you even prepared a meal for her just in case she might be hungry.

512
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,880
"Oh, my dear Kui'er."

513
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,280
Sir!

514
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:25,660
It'll be too late for us to regret it if we waste our opportunity because of this.

515
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,640
Are you done nagging?

516
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:29,173
Shut up.

517
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,720
Sir, is that redhead guy Shaodian Youqin?

518
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,700
This redhead demon doesn't have the flair of an empyrean.

519
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,040
If I'm not mistaken, Shaodian Youqin lost all his power after mending Guixu.

520
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,210
And he was caught in a fight too. He's already a shadow of his former self.

521
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:14,420
He's not Shaodian Youqin.

522
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:16,960
He's just a soul shard.

523
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:24,220
Seems like Yetan came here to gather the soul shards to revive Shaodian Youqin.

524
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,600
No wonder Princess Qingkui was trying her best to hide this from us.

525
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,540
This soul shard is dumb and weak.

526
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:34,100
He's no match for you.

527
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,373
Go away!

528
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:55,020
I said, go away!

529
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,810
He's pretty grumpy.

530
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,070
Let's end this quickly.

531
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:24,540
Initially, I thought I would ascend the throne after killing Eldest and Second Brother.

532
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:29,760
I never expected Heaven to assign the hero of the four realms to be my last opponent.

533
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:39,440
It's your fate to die here.

534
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,800
Die.

535
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:56,220
Shaodian Youqin, don't blame me for kicking you when you're down.

536
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,540
You care for the world.

537
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,200
And all living beings are indebted to you.

538
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,600
However, I have someone who I need to protect even at the expense of my life!

539
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:06,340
For Consort Mother and Kui'er's sake, you have to die!

540
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,060
Chaofeng!

541
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,693
Your Highness!

542
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,380
- Su Shui!
- Chaofeng, you mustn't go!

543
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:41,460
I haven't settled the scores with you for taking the Princess to the Mortal Realm without permission.

544
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,140
- Let go!
- Why did you bring her here?
- No!

545
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,760
- Kui'er!
- She pressured me with Consort Xue right after you guys left.

546
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:49,100
She said... She said she wouldn't treat my family if I didn't let her come here.

547
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,820
- What can I do?
- You!

548
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:52,753
Let go!

549
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,200
If you wish to kill the soul shard, you have to kill me first!

550
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,620
- Don't go there!
- This is none of your business.

551
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,040
Royal Father has already issued an order.

552
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,660
The one who kills Shaodian Youqin will be the next crown prince.

553
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:03,680
This is my best opportunity.

554
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,580
Didn't you say that you were protecting me because you couldn't bear

555
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,520
to see me and Tan'er get implicated because of the power struggle?

556
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,160
You said you didn't care for power, but you cared about loyalty.

557
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,460
You said you were different from Wu Dai, Dingyun, and the rest.

558
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,020
But look at what you're doing right now.

559
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:19,760
Before this, I tried to delay your progress and protect the soul shard

560
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,099
because I didn't want you to be tempted by the crown prince's throne

561
00:38:22,099 --> 00:38:25,320
and become a sinner of the four realms for killing the soul shard!

562
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:29,160
The battle for the crown prince's throne concerns our survival.

563
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,900
Right now, there's an opportunity in front of me.

564
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,640
I can't just give it up.

565
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,400
Stay out of this.

566
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,880
- Get out of the way!
- Chaofeng! No!

567
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,980
I'll say yes to anything else.

568
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,480
But I can't just let you do the wrong thing.

569
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,420
If you kill the hero, the immortals will fall out with the voidwalkers

570
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,920
and plunge the four realms into chaos again!

571
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,320
You care about Yetan.

572
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,960
You care about the soul shard.

573
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,180
You care about the immortals and the humans, morality and justice.

574
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,960
What about me? Have you considered my feelings?

575
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,900
I'm persuading you to stop precisely because I care about you.

576
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,700
Once you kill the soul shard, you'll become the Crown Prince.

577
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:10,200
You'll become the next bloodthirsty Void Tyrant!

578
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:13,150
When that happens, there will be no turning back!

579
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,213
Chaofeng!

580
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,620
If you care about me too, stop now, please.

581
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,920
<i>Fiery, I promised you that I would bring back the Purifying Vial before the sun sets.</i>

582
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,080
<i>I'll keep my promise. Wait for me just a little longer.</i>

583
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,660
<i>You'll be free soon.</i>

584
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:42,100
<i>This is bad. I used too much power when I impersonated Emperor Tun.</i>

585
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,160
<i>I don't think I can maintain this form. You both should be careful.</i>

586
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,040
My back!

587
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,520
Are you okay?

588
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,270
I can't move anymore. You guys should go.

589
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,400
Go now.

590
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,860
Stay here, okay?

591
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,493
Let's go!

592
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,793
Chaofeng!

593
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,260
Soul shard!

594
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:02,280
Kui'er!

595
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,740
- Your Highness!
- Soul shard!

596
00:41:03,740 --> 00:41:05,580
This is the immortals' Southern Brightness Sacred Fire.

597
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,980
When it ignites, it'll burn the land even if it's thousands of li away.

598
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:10,100
- Let's go!
- No!

599
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,840
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Go and save the soul shard!

600
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:14,200
Let's go! Let's go!

601
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,200
If you want to burn someone, burn me!

602
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,060
Fire!

603
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,280
Fire! Hurry!

604
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,500
Run! Fire!

605
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:14,600
Run away! Hurry!

606
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:15,960
Hurry!

607
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,893
Fire!
