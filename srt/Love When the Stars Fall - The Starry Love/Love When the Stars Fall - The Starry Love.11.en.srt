20
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,860
Your Highness, the elders said the Queen had led the entire tribe to take refuge in the valley.

21
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:05,780
Beast King had also gone to Guixu to discuss the repair of the Guixu with the Third Lord.

22
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:09,020
I'm glad that the Beast Tribe is unharmed.

23
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:12,260
I heard Shaodian Youqin has obtained the Perfect Celestial Body.

24
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:16,620
It can ensure we never have to worry about the immortal seal that's suppressing the Force of Chaos.

25
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:20,320
But I'm afraid Empyrean Xuanshang may never return.

26
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:23,200
Perhaps this is the fate of a hero.

27
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,340
Your Highness.

28
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,660
- What's the matter?
- How did it go?

29
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,460
Heartless Shaodian has left for Guixu.

30
00:02:38,380 --> 00:02:39,900
The Iridescent Eyes are not glowing.

31
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,040
Did he dispel it for you?

32
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:44,140
What does that mean?

33
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:46,720
If he doesn't dispel it, is he expecting to bind you with this magic item forever?

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,540
Well, not likely. Jade Deity once said this.

35
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,860
The demise of Empyrean Xuanshang will also mean the loss of the ultimate item.

36
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:54,300
Heartless Shaodian is heartless for real.

37
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,620
He knew he would never return once he was gone.

38
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,660
Yet, he left me here without bidding farewell.

39
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,120
No. I have to go to Guixu and find him.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,660
Your Highness!

41
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,200
The Heavenly Rules are very strict. If you sneak away to the Human Realm again,

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,320
you'll be in trouble if the Heavenly Emperor finds out.

43
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:09,220
That's right.

44
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,900
Go and find him.

45
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,680
My good friend, thank you.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,660
When I return, I'll repay you graciously.

47
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:49,040
You used your favorite magic item to send your sweetheart to bid farewell to your rival.

48
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,020
Your brain is really getting more and more clever, isn't it?

49
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:57,800
After Shaodian Youqin's demise, Tan Tan will regain her freedom.

50
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:04,040
If she could feel my deep affection and loyalty, perhaps, she'll change her mind.

51
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,780
I may appear to be on your side.

52
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:15,080
But in my heart, I think Kui'er and Empyrean Xuanshang are more compatible.

53
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,860
Don't forget whose bird you belong to.

54
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:21,540
I was just saying. You're so childish.

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:45,440
- Greetings, Heavenly Emperor.
- We have kept you waiting, Beast King.

56
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,620
Not at all. I was worried about the danger of Guixu.

57
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:49,460
So I was early because I was anxious.

58
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:52,420
The restoration of Guixu's seal is not a trivial matter.

59
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,740
Everything needs to be ready.

60
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:58,200
I wonder if Empyrean Xuanshang is ready for this.

61
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,620
Worry not, Beast King.

62
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,800
My son has mastered the Perfect Celestial Body.

63
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,360
So he's able to carry his responsibility as the emissary of Guixu.

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,440
If the restoration is successful, Guixu will be permanently sealed and never caused destruction again.

65
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,420
So, the fate of countless lives now rests in the hands of Empyrean Xuanshang.

66
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,720
You have my gratitude, Empyrean Xuanshang.

67
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,000
Please rest assured.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,240
I'm fully aware of the great responsibility that has been entrusted to me.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,560
My thousands of years of cultivation were all for this moment.

70
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,020
I will live up to everyone's expectation.

71
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,940
Eldest Brother...

72
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:49,820
The Perfect Celestial Body can only protect Guixu and the glory of the immortals.

73
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,960
Yet, it can't restore your vitality.

74
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,980
From a young age, you took on the heavy responsibility of protecting the four realms

75
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,260
before finally returning after 1,500 years of cultivation in seclusion.

76
00:05:58,260 --> 00:06:01,300
I haven't had the chance to shower my love on you.

77
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,540
Yet I must watch you risk your life to enter the Guixu.

78
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,320
I owe you too much.

79
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,100
Celestial Mother, I'll do my best to stay safe.

80
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,800
But it's my destiny to fulfill this duty.

81
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,580
Even if I am to perish in Guixu, I have no regrets.

82
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,260
However,

83
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:27,920
I can only repay the debts of gratitude I owe celestial father and celestial mother in the next life.

84
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,420
These lights...

85
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:14,100
These are the soul shards of the previous emissaries

86
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,980
who perished while restoring Guixu.

87
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:19,580
They're here to see Youqin off.

88
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,740
Shaodian Youqin!

89
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,080
Shaodian Youqin! Shaodian Youqin!

90
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,020
Shaodian Youqin!

91
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,920
Heartless Shaodian!

92
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:17,940
It's a dangerous place. Why are you here, Your Highness?

93
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,560
I came to bid farewell to His Highness.

94
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,540
Your Highness, you can't do this. You're a mortal.

95
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:25,340
You can't withstand the Force of Chaos.

96
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,380
His Highness intentionally kept you in the Heavenly Realm to avoid worries.

97
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,620
- Your Highness, you should leave.
- Please leave.

98
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,100
Even if His Highness perishes, the Iridescent Eyes will stay with you as a remembrance.

99
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,520
What? On the day we gambled, didn't you say

100
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:42,300
as long as the owner perishes, the Iridescent Eyes will be gone as well?

101
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,780
That was just casual talk. We were not sure.

102
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,940
Later upon reading the texts, we found out it was only a legend and there was no evidence for it.

103
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:54,220
So does that mean the Iridescent Eyes will stay even if the owner is gone?

104
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,480
Please rest assured, Your Highness. The Iridescent Eyes is well-known for its loyalty.

105
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,200
It'll stay with you until the end, through life and death.

106
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,340
- Your Highness, please leave.
- Please leave.

107
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:07,040
Go on.

108
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:11,220
Heartless Shaodian! Wait!

109
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,060
<i>- Your Highness!
- Heartless Shaodian!</i>

110
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,740
Your Highness, you cannot go!

111
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,360
- Heartless Shaodian!
- Your Highness!

112
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,400
Heartless Shaodian!

113
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,800
Shaodian Youqin!

114
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,560
- Kui'er!
- Sister-in-law!

115
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,300
Kui'er!

116
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,800
Don't jump!

117
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,260
Kui'er!

118
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,900
I know you have deep feelings for Youqin.

119
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:29,140
But you can't just leap into Guixu.

120
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:37,080
The Iridescent Eyes is Youqin's ultimate item.

121
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,840
If the light does not disperse, his immortal spirit remains.

122
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,240
If it's fine, Youqin will be safe too.

123
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,500
Please pay close attention to it.

124
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:49,200
I wonder how's Youqin now.

125
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,780
The Force of Chaos will mix the seawater and mudstone,

126
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,260
creating a turbulent whirlpool that is difficult to break through.

127
00:10:56,260 --> 00:11:00,800
Even with the slightest misstep, he would be smashed into pieces if he fell into the whirlpool.

128
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,760
I hope Youqin can survive the perilous journey and make it to the seal.

129
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:10,480
<i>Heartless Shaodian, you jerk.</i>

130
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,000
<i>You must come back alive!</i>

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,340
<i>The immortal seal is right underneath the whirlpool.</i>

132
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:53,920
<i>I must break through as soon as possible.</i>

133
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,140
<i>I can't believe the seal has been weakened to this extent.</i>

134
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,180
I have kept everyone waiting!

135
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:16,000
<i>Oh, no. I can't let imperial father see me here.</i>

136
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,080
Oh! My chest hurts!

137
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,440
- Sister-in-law.
- Why does your chest hurt?

138
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,960
Is it because you're heartbroken?

139
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,760
Please help the Princess to rest on the side.

140
00:13:31,340 --> 00:13:32,860
Greetings, Your Majesties!

141
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,080
Sister-in-law, are you all right?

142
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:37,340
It's nothing serious. You should keep your celestial father and celestial mother company.

143
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:38,820
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, I'm all right.

144
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,500
You should go now.

145
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,100
The human race has no magic power.

146
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,720
I have to thank Your Majesty for sending your men to deliver the immortals' magic items to us.

147
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,340
Only then was I able to travel thousands of li in one day and reach here in time.

148
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,480
Emperor Tun, it must have been an arduous journey.

149
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,600
Not at all, Your Majesty.

150
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,400
Emperor Tun.

151
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,500
Your Majesty, where's Kui'er?

152
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,300
Is she all right?

153
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,820
Qingkui is heartbroken because she suddenly can't accept what happened.

154
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,960
She's now resting on the side.

155
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,120
Emperor Tun, please rest assured. Qingkui married into the Heavenly Realm for less than half a year.

156
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:16,120
Regardless of the outcome today, I'll do everything in my power to compensate her.

157
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,440
With your promise, I can put my mind at ease.

158
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,500
The fate of Empyrean Xuanshang is uncertain.

159
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:27,900
I hope this child can find the strength to persevere and not let her tears harm her health.

160
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,800
<i>Imperial Father is so concerned that Qingkui might be sad.</i>

161
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,340
<i>If the one restoring Guixu is the Void Prince, will he care if I'm sad?</i>

162
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,220
Your Majesties, please rest assured. Youqin has entered Guixu.

163
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:42,260
He'll definitely resolve this disaster and bring peace to all realms.

164
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:46,420
If Empyrean Xuanshang can completely seal the danger of Guixu this time,

165
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,780
the merits of the immortals are enough to shine through the ages.

166
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:53,440
Youqin is not the only one contributing to the matters of Guixu.

167
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:59,060
Beast King, Emperor Tun, and the Heavenly Realm work together and help each other.

168
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,240
I will remember this forever.

169
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,060
Your Majesty, you're too kind.

170
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:07,120
If you have any instructions in the future, please don't hesitate to ask.

171
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:10,220
The Beast Tribe will make every effort to help.

172
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,960
The immortals and the human race are related through a marriage alliance.

173
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:17,720
The human race will definitely support the immortals' efforts to defend the right path.

174
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,020
<i>The human race and the beast tribe sure are obedient slaves!</i>

175
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:43,920
Void Tyrant?

176
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,180
Yanfang, did you lead your troops to Guixu to oversee the battle or do you have other intentions?

177
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,040
The son is sending himself to his death while the father is flaunting his power.

178
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,960
Such a pretentious act, you should change it.

179
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,660
What did you say?

180
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:11,520
<i>Void Tyrant sure is majestic.</i>

181
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:14,160
<i>He doesn't even bother with the Heavenly Emperor.</i>

182
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,540
<i>He even brought the Void Army with him.</i>

183
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,280
<i>He has rallied such a large force.</i>

184
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,100
<i>I'm afraid it's not just to give Heartless Shaodian a grand send-off.</i>

185
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,040
<i>But he has other motives.</i>

186
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,580
I'll be honest with you all.

187
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:30,720
My Void Army has Guixu surrounded outside.

188
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,060
Today, I will slaughter the immortals to end our longstanding feud.

189
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:43,620
While my son is repairing Guixu, you take the chance to launch an attack.

190
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,680
You're indeed despicable!

191
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,260
It looks like there's going to be a war.

192
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,280
The human race and the Beast Tribe have always been weak.

193
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,980
If they start a war, we would be forced to join the battle.

194
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:00,740
The future will surely look bleak.

195
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,280
Why don't you go and mediate between them?

196
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,900
Why don't you go?

197
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,220
You're the father-in-law of both sides.

198
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:10,300
If they start fighting, you wouldn't be able to take sides.

199
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,160
Besides, your daughters are in their hands.

200
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,100
Why don't you go with me?

201
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:22,240
Your Majesty. Void Tyrant.

202
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,060
The immortals and voidwalkers have been at odds for nearly a thousand years.

203
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:28,100
There's currently an abnormality in Guixu.

204
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,580
I think we should prioritize the best interest of the overall situation.

205
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:35,660
The feud between the voidwalkers and the immortals must come to an end today!

206
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:38,180
This matter has nothing to do with the humans and beastfolk.

207
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,780
So I advise you not to interfere.

208
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:43,680
Or else, you'll be buried alongside the immortals.

209
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,060
The Void Army sure is formidable.

210
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:59,300
We can't fight against them head-on.

211
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,300
Your daughter will be safe under Their Majesties' protections. Let's go.

212
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,640
Then... We'll take our leave if you don't need us.

213
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,060
- Let's go.
- Heavenly Emperor.

214
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,620
- Come on. Let's get out of here.
- Void Tyrant.

215
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,220
Think of the overall situation!

216
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,060
Prioritize the common good!

217
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:16,180
<i>He said he cares about his daughter.</i>

218
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:19,120
<i>But in the face of death, he still left anyway.</i>

219
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,300
<i>He even did this to Qingkui.</i>

220
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,460
<i>If it was me...</i>

221
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,080
It looks like it's going to be a fierce battle.

222
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:32,420
I didn't expect we'd have the chance to fight side by side when we bicker every day.

223
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:35,340
After we win this battle, we'll continue bickering.

224
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,900
Deal.

225
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,300
Get help from the Heavenly Realm.

226
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,720
Immortal Qingheng, Erlang Deity.

227
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,360
We have trouble in Guixu. Please come to our aid.

228
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,100
Royal Father made a proper strategy to split the troops into two to attack from both sides

229
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,580
and made the immortals unable to resist.

230
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:20,120
It looks like the throne will be mine.

231
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,900
The battle is not over yet.

232
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,340
Don't be too confident in yourself.

233
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:29,280
Today will be the day that determines who's marrying Tan Tan!

234
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,420
Charge forward!

235
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,580
Attack!

236
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Attack!

237
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,000
The Heavenly Realm is vast. Someone needs to keep watch.

238
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,240
Chaofeng, I'll leave this wonderful opportunity to you.

239
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,760
So you better stay here and guard this place.

240
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,800
Is Second Prince trying to reach for the sky?

241
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,680
Wait, we're in the sky.

242
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
Sir, he's obviously trying to steal the credit.

243
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,620
Why did you let him?

244
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:21,980
Are you going to sit by and let others render meritorious service?

245
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,160
What's the hurry?

246
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
The immortals have reigned supreme for ten thousand years.

247
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,940
How could they be wiped out so quickly?

248
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,120
We will wait and see how the situation unfolds.

249
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
Let me go. I said, let me go!

250
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,760
I did it for your sake.

251
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,280
The human race can't be without a ruler.

252
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,360
I'm not buying your tricks!

253
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,780
Do you think I don't know?

254
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,920
You were only using me as a scapegoat.

255
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,820
You were scared when Void Tyrant arrived.

256
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:49,940
You had the nerve to tell the Heavenly Emperor that you'll do your best to help him.

257
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,140
Why don't you go and help then?

258
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:54,100
Didn't you say you'll give him your full support too?

259
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,300
Then why don't you go and support him?

260
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,660
Go!

261
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:59,720
You have no magic powers.

262
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:02,500
If you stayed back, you would only die in vain.

263
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,060
What should we do now?

264
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:07,240
We can't watch the voidwalkers annihilate the immortals, can we?

265
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,520
Besides, my daughter, Kui'er, is still there.

266
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,760
Beast King, think of something.

267
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,860
You can summon all of your Beast Tribe's reinforcements to come here.

268
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:19,500
You saw how Void Tyrant came aggressively.

269
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,840
And he has this place surrounded.

270
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,040
My Beast Army has weak magic power.

271
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,760
It's nearly impossible to rush in now.

272
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:30,700
Let alone rescue your daughter.

273
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,800
What should we do now?

274
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:38,360
It seems we can only rely on Empyrean Xuanshang now.

275
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,980
Shaodian Xiaoyi, I knew you would use this move.

276
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,720
The disturbance in the Guixu is not yet resolved.

277
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,260
If your Slaying Demons Formation exerts its full power,

278
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:31,740
I'm afraid the entire Guixu Island will sink to the bottom of the sea.

279
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,320
When that time comes, the four realms will suffer and all living beings will be plunged into misery!

280
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,720
Kui'er!

281
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,160
Attack!

282
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,420
Attack!

283
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,580
<i>The troops Void Tyrant sent are void walker's elite.</i>

284
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:23,160
<i>The immortals are too weak to fight them because of their inferior strengths.</i>

285
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,700
<i>If I admit I'm Void Crown Princess now,</i>

286
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:29,960
<i>Perhaps, Void Tyrant will spare my life.</i>

287
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,640
Kui'er, don't be afraid. I won't let anything happen to you.

288
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,660
- Celestial Mother...
- You and Youqin may not be married.

289
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:47,120
But I've already treated you as a member of the Shaodian family.

290
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,580
Even if I'm smashed into pieces, I'll make sure you leave Guixu safely.

291
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,680
Your Highness, you have no magic power.

292
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:57,100
We'll protect you.

293
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,940
Please rest assured. We'll protect you.

294
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,240
You'll be safe as long as we're here.

295
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,780
Sister-in-law, I'll protect you too.

296
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,020
<i>Even my own father left me.</i>

297
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:24,560
<i>Yet, you're risking your lives trying to protect me.</i>

298
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,280
<i>The immortals are willing to sacrifice themselves for me.</i>

299
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:29,500
<i>I can't believe I thought of fleeing to Void Tyrant to save myself.</i>

300
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,740
Celestial Mother!

301
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:40,320
Celestial Mother!

302
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,280
Celestial Mother!

303
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,920
Celestial Mother, are you all right?

304
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,380
Celestial Mother.

305
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,540
Celestial Father!

306
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,680
<i>Void Tyrant is even more brutal than in the book.</i>

307
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:28,140
<i>The sovereignty of the world? He's just a devil from hell!</i>

308
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,520
Why is a grown man like you using such a delicate magic item like a girl?

309
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,620
How ridiculous!

310
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:53,340
Get up and fight!

311
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,740
Formation?

312
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,780
It's Youqin's formation.

313
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:16,460
It's Shaodian Youqin's Demon-Vanquishing Formation.

314
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,820
This person can still set up various ambushes here

315
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:22,400
to protect the Heavenly Realm even though he has left to repair the Guixu.

316
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,980
This person is indeed impressive.

317
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:26,340
Sir, one barrier can't stop the Void Army.

318
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,260
We should attack.

319
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,020
No rush.

320
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,700
Let's wait and see.

321
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:52,820
Since my Void Army wants to take you down, we'll definitely go all out!

322
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,280
Forget about formations.

323
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:58,380
Even if Shaodian Youqin is here, you won't be able to escape death!

324
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:06,780
Get into formation!

325
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,420
Did Youqin leave any magic items or formations with us?

326
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,960
Magic items? Formation?

327
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,300
He didn't?

328
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:39,310
<i>The Void Emperor's three sons all have great cultivation and are assisted by the Void Army.</i>

329
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,280
<i>They're very difficult to deal with.</i>

330
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:44,140
<i>Our army may have Demon-Vanquishing Formation.</i>

331
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:46,160
<i>But we don't have a commander.</i>

332
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:51,100
<i>Apart from you, is there any other capable commander in the Heavenly Realm?</i>

333
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:01,240
<i>My brother, Qingheng.</i>

334
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,120
Yes.

335
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,125
<i>[Qingheng]</i>

336
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,660
Immortal Qingheng, you have always thought that you rely on Empyrean Xuanshang.

337
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,740
The truth is, you're Empyrean Xuanshang's source of confidence.

338
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:21,360
No matter what others think, Empyrean Xuanshang has always believed in you.

339
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,300
Because of you, Empyrean Xuanshang dared to sacrifice himself

340
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,880
without worrying about the safety of the immortals.

341
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,200
It's also because of you, Empyrean Xuanshang could set aside his worries

342
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,420
<i>to use his flesh and blood</i>

343
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:38,700
to forge a seal in the dark and desolate Guixu to defend all living beings.

This is what the Heavenly Army should look like.

361
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,600
Shaodian Youqin actually handed over the position of the commander

362
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,200
of the Heavenly Army to you, the weakling brother.

363

The immortals deserve to fall!

Oh, no.

373
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,800
Each and every formation Youqin laid down is targeting our army's weaknesses.

374
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:42,800
If we keep fighting like this, both sides will suffer great losses.

375
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,200
We must capture the leader to win.

376
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,900
As long as we capture the Heavenly Emperor, we still have a chance to turn the tables and achieve victory.

377
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,400
Come on, we're going to Guixu.

385
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,100

386
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:38,800
<i>would be vulnerable to attacks by despicable men after he left because the defenses had weakened.</i>

387
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:43,000
<i>So he instructed me to defend the Heavenly Southern Gate as planned.</i>

388
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,800
<i>Heartless Shaodian has prepared for the enemy's attack in advance.</i>

389
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:46,800
<i>The crisis at the Heavenly Southern Gate can definitely be resolved.</i>

<i>the immortals will have a chance to turn the tide.</i>

392
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:58,700
Shaodian Xiaoyi, there are no more immortals who can fight now.

393
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,900
So stop resisting already.

394
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:05,600
Even if you managed to escape, there's still the heavy siege of the Void Army outside.

395
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,200
For the sake of our friendship for thousands of years,

396
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,200
I can leave your body intact.

397
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,600
- Your Majesty!
- No!

398
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,800
Void Tyrant Yanfang!

399
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,100
You dare to call me by my name directly!

400
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,700
Who says there are no immortals who can fight?

401
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,300
So you're Qingkui?

402
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,600
A mortal dares to stop me.

403
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Such audacity!

404
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,400
Naturally, I can't stop the invincible Void Tyrant.

405
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:41,700
I just want to know if you still feel a dull pain in your old injury on your left arm on rainy days.

406
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,400
<i>Not even the Empress knows about the wound on my left arm.</i>

407
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,100
<i>How did this woman know?</i>

408
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,700
If I was not mistaken, you had this injury from slaughtering the rebels thousands of years ago.

409
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:56,400
At that time, it was 200,000 men against 50,000 men.

410
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,900
With this many soldiers, you were bound to win.

411
00:33:57,900 --> 00:34:00,800
But you fell into the rebels' trap because you were too eager to win.

412
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,600
You're brave, but not resourceful.

413
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,500
You rushed forward because you only cared about merits.

414
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:08,500
<i>How did this child know so much about the Void's history?</i>

415
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:12,800
<i>Those records of the Void I collected years ago have finally come in handy.</i>

416
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:17,400
I didn't expect that you haven't changed your old habits after so many years.

417
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:21,700
Today, you're repeating the same mistake and advancing rashly to Guixu because of your reckless ambition.

418
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,900
The Heavenly Emperor and the Empress have been defeated by me.

419
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:26,000
Tell me. How is this advancing rashly?

420
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,300
Do you think we're that careless to bring so few of us here?

421
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,200
Why didn't they show up if they were lying in an ambush?

422
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:36,900
What's more, the Void Army have besieged this place.

423
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,800
Why should we be afraid?

424
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:41,800
When it comes to wars, ambushes can be anywhere.

425
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:45,000
They can be either hiding or be visible.

426
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,500
Why don't you guess if our men have infiltrated the Void Army you led?

427
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,400
I don't care if they're hiding in the dark or out in the open. I'll kill you first.

428
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,600
-Your Highness!
- Kui'er!
- Sister-in-law!

429
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,000
Kui'er!

430
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,900
<i>Qingheng, I can't stall any longer.</i>

431
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,500
<i>Why are you still not here?</i>

432
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:15,000
What is the situation over there now?

433
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:20,400
Even if the Heavenly Emperor defeated Void Tyrant, the Void Army is massive.

434
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,200
How can we even break the siege?

435
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:26,400
If the immortals have no reinforcement coming,

436
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:29,900
I'm afraid they'll all die here.

437
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,300
What about my daughter, Kui'er?

438
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,600
Stop worrying about your daughter.

439
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,000
You should think about what to write in the surrender letter
to the Void.

440
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,900
What's this?

441
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,500
The Heavenly Army! The reinforcement of the Heavenly Army has arrived!

442
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:50,800
That means Kui'er is saved.

443
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,700
Yes.

444
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,400
The Heavenly Army is here!

445
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,500
What was that?

446
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,400
What else can it be?

447
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,700
I'm human. I don't have magic power.

448
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
You're the Beast King. You have magic power.

449
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:07,400
The reinforcement of the Void Army is also here.

450
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,400
Qingheng?

451
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,800
I'm sorry for arriving late to your rescue.

452
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,500
Your Highness, are you all right?

453
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,860
You fools. I can't believe you two were captured.

454
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,800
It was his fault.

455
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:51,000
It wasn't because of their foolishness. It was my brother who already saw this coming.

456
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:54,600
The desire of the voidwalkers to dominate the four realms has long been obvious.

457
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Before my brother left, he already predicted the voidwalkers will take the chance to attack.

458
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
So he has long been fully prepared.

459
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,800
At this moment, our reinforcement is currently fighting against the voidwalkers in the Stone Forest.

460
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,800
You call this fully prepared? We almost died here.

461
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:12,000
So you already knew. You were stalling for time earlier.

462
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,900
That's what I call shooting oneself in the foot.

463
