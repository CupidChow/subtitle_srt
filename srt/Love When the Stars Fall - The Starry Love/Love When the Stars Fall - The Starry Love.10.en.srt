Pour some chili oil on this.

23
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,200
I know you blame me for trying to seduce the Crown Princess.

24
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,300
But I was actually...

25
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,800
Actually what?

26
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,400
Even if she is not the Crown Princess,

27
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:25,100
she's still one of the best girls in the world for her knowledge and ambition.

28
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,400
Exactly.

29
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,500
So I wanted to make such a good girl your future daughter-in-law.

30
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,600
You?

31
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:33,200
- Me.
- You?

32
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,200
You don't deserve such a good girl.

33
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,300
I will beat you with this.

34
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,000
You...

35
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,500
Chaofeng, where are you going?

36
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,200
- She is murdering her son.
- Stop right there.

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,400
What's going on?

38
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,200
What is going on?

39
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,000
What's happening?

40
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,800
<i>Stop right there.</i>

41
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,300
Stop!

42
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,100
What's happening?

43
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,800
This is not good.

44
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,900
The princess is human. We must send someone to protect her.

45
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,000
Go to Zhuoxin Hall.

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,100
If anything happens to her,

47
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,000
- I won't forgive you.
- Yes.

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Be careful.

49
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,800
Don't worry.

50
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,200
Third Prince, be careful.

51
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,100
Third Prince.

52
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,600
Your Highness.

53
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,200
Your Highness.

54
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,300
Are you okay?

55
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,900
I'm okay. Don't worry.

56
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:06,400
Sir, you have no idea how dangerous the situation was.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
Thanks to the princess's calmness, we made it out in time.

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,400
By the way, we brought these medicines.

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,600
They are for Consort Xue.

60
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,400
Medicine isn't allowed in the Void.

61
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,900
So these medicines are very valuable.

62
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,300
I was worried that if we lost them, Consort Xue's recovery would be influenced.

63
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,000
The medicines are not important.

64
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,600
Not as important as your life.

65
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,500
Please remember never to take risks like this again.

66
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,100
Xingtian Void Token.

67
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:43,400
Sir, Void Tyrant is gathering the Void Army.

68
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,400
Gui...

69
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
Gui... Something is happening to Guixu.

70
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
That's impossible.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,700
Empyrean Xuanguang just fixed Guixu a thousand years ago.

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,400
Can they just leave me to my farm work?

73
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,000
Guards, come.

74
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,100
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty.

75
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,700
The Guixu anomaly this time is severer than it ever was before.

76
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,500
Hurry.

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,400
Send words to the Heavenly Realm.

78
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Report.

79
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,800
Report. Report.

80
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,600
Report.

81
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:28,200
Your Majesty, the anomaly heralds the rebirth of demons.

82
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,000
This is very urgent, Your Majesty.

83
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,600
Kui'er arrived at the Heavenly Realm less than six months ago.

84
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,200
In such a short time...

85
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,400
Your Majesty, Guixu anomaly will bring disasters to the world.

86
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
According to the old practice, Your Majesty,

87
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,300
please write to the Heavenly Realm and ask the immortals to protect us.

88
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,400
Your Majesty.

89
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,100
Do it.

90
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,600
Yes.

91
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Your Majesty, Guixu is at risk.

92
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,300
You are gathering the army now. I...

93
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:09,200
The immortals fixed Guixu, and because of that,

94
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,000
they have been the lead of four realms for over ten thousand years.

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,000
The Human and Beast Realms feel in debt to them as well.

96
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:21,000
In the war with Dongqiu, if it hadn't been for us,

97
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
how could the immortals have won so easily?

98
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,300
If we continue letting them be the lead of us,

99
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,200
the Void will fall before Guixu falls.

100
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:34,000
I have thought about it.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Instead of being a coward for the sake of Guixu,

102
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,500
we might as well take the chance to make achievements.

103
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,600
While Shaodian Youqin is fixing Guixu, let's attack the Heavenly Realm.

104
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Wizard Chief, I want you to watch the Heavenly Realm closely and get things ready.

105
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,800
The glory of the Void lies in this.

106
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,400
Yes.

107
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:01,800
Princess.

108
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,400
The whole Heavenly Realm is looking for Heartless Shaodian.

109
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,600
Is he still practicing?

110
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,600
Princess, you may not know this, but to cultivate the Perfect Celestial Body,

111
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,800
His Highness has to spend hours in the Land of Mystery every day.

112
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,200
The Guixu anomaly came suddenly.

113
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,200
I also don't know what to do.

114
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,600
Why would you not know? Go get him.

115
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,100
Princess, you may not know this,

116
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,800
but the enchantment of the Land of Mystery can only be opened by His Highness.

117
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,500
It seems that we have to wait for him to come out.

118
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,800
Only then can we inform him about Guixu.

119
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,300
Guixu anomaly showed up.

120
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,800
Heavenly Emperor and Empress will want to see him soon.

121
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:30,000
Go to Ninth Heaven Hall and tell them that Heartless Shaodian will be there soon.

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,500
Yes.

123
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:43,200
Heartless Shaodian! Heartless Shaodian!

124
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,400
What's this?

125
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,700
Heartless Shaodian!

126
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:38,500
Heartless Shaodian, are you all right?

127
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,000
Heartless Shaodian!

128
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,900
Heartless Shaodian, watch out.

129
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,000
- Are you okay?
- Are you okay?

130
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,900
What are you doing here?

131
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,700
I'm here to inform you that the Guixu anomaly showed up again.

132
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,300
So soon?

133
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,800
I guess I won't be able to cultivate the Perfect Celestial Body.

134
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,800
Are you insane?

135
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,600
Perfect Celestial Body is just a mystery.

136
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,800
Do you have a death wish?

137
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
What is that black thing?

138
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
It seems to be obsessed with you.

139
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
It is my obsession.

140
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,000
Your obsession?

141
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,700
What is going on?

142
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,400
Qingkui! Qingkui!

143
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,000
Qingkui!

144
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,500
Qingkui! Qingkui!

145
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,400
I am here.

146
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,800
Why are we at the Shangshu Academy?

147
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:10,500
Where is that black thing?

148
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:14,200
It was it. It is who brought us here.

149
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,000
You meant the black thing?

150
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,300
Didn't you say that it was your obsession?

151
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,100
Why is your obsession outside of your body?

152
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,700
I was right? You are empty inside?

153
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,400
As an Empyrean, I must not be distracted.

154
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:33,100
Thus, I got rid of my feelings.

155
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:36,100
But it looks like that black thing doesn't want to be gotten rid of.

156
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,600
It wants to control my thinking again.

157
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,200
No wonder it doesn't hurt us.

158
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,000
It just wants to return to your body.

159
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,600
If it doesn't want to leave, why don't you just let it stay in you?

160
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,300
I can't.

161
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,700
What is the obsession that you want to get rid of so much?

162
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,100
<i>Youqin.</i>

163
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,700
<i>Master.</i>

164
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,600
<i>Master, look.</i>

165
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,000
<i>I got a good grade again.</i>

166
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,600
<i>Good.</i>

167
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,000
<i>I believe that one day, Youqin will become a hero who cares about the whole world.</i>

168
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,700
Your master was Empyrean Xuanguang?

169
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:17,900
You know him?

170
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,500
Of course, I do.

171
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,500
Empyrean Xuanguang sacrificed his life to fix Guixu and save the world.

172
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:25,800
Storytellers have made it into a story and told it everywhere.

173
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:30,700
If you give them some money, you can even get a picture book of Empyrean Xuanguang.

174
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,000
My master made a great contribution.

175
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,300
He should be remembered by the world.

176
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:40,300
Ever since I could remember a thing, he was there teaching me spells.

177
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:44,500
He taught me to do the right thing and to protect the world.

178
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:47,400
No wonder you seem ready to save the world with your life at any moment.

179
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,100
You had a saint as your teacher.

180
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
This is Guixu.

181
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,700
Don't be afraid. This is just an anomaly of Guixu from a thousand years ago.

182
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:12,000
I used to think that being an Empyrean was a glorious thing.

183
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,000
I didn't know you have to suffer such things.

184
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,100
I wanted to be someone like my master.

185
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,300
I wanted to save the world and uphold justice.

186
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:28,600
But after seeing my master die, I couldn't help but feel terrified.

187
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:36,100
Later, for the peace of four realms, Father made me the next one to fix Guixu.

188
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,500
But that fear has never disappeared ever since.

189
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:59,900
I couldn't forget how my master died in Guixu.

190
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:03,400
I became overcautious because of that.

191
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,000
I even started doubting whether I could be a hero.

192
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,400
But you were just a kid.

193
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,400
I am also the Immortal Crown Prince.

194
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:17,500
So you just got rid of your fear.

195
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:41,800
After I got rid of my feelings, I destroyed that fear and buried it under a tree in Land of Mystery.

196
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,100
Maybe it sensed the Guixu anomaly, so it came back to life.

197
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:52,400
As an Empyrean, I can't quit.

198
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,600
Only when my feelings are gone can I move forward without fear.

199
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,300
Don't kill it.

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:07,100
It's just the helplessness that the child felt after seeing his master die.

201
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:10,200
If you destroy it because you can't face it, you'd just be running away.

202
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,900
You don't understand.

203
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,200
- Move.
- No one will stop you from trying to uphold justice, you'd just be running away and be a hero.

204
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,700
But there isn't just right or wrong in this world.

205
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:25,100
If you no longer have any feelings but ruthlessness and indifference, what's the point of your courage?

206
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,700
You are just afraid.

207
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:54,400
Don't be.

208
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,600
If I were you, I would have already run off.

209
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,100
Do you think when Empyrean Xuanguang jumped, he had no fear?

210
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
Just think about it.

211
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,100
When he jumped, he was just like you.

212
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:14,400
He was terrified, but he jumped anyway.

213
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,500
If we aren't afraid of death, how can we realize the value of life?

214
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,400
I know,

215
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:32,100
the you now must be upset and embarrassed.

216
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,300
Maybe you even once hated yourself to an extreme.

217
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,200
I've been there before.

218
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,900
How I wish there had been someone who would tell me that it wasn't my fault.

219
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:48,400
Today, I want to tell you that.

220
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:53,000
Youqin, you're allowed to be afraid.

221
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,200
You've done nothing wrong.

222
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:36,700
I used to think that I was afraid of being defeated by you.

223
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:39,200
and thus would fail to be an Empyrean

224
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
and fix Guixu.

225
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,600
Now I think I was just afraid of facing myself.

226
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,300
I am sorry.

227
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,600
Come.

228
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,800
After I accepted my fear, I cultivated Perfect Celestial Body without even trying.

229
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:19,700
It seems that cultivation is all about oneself instead of spells.

230
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,000
<i>Who would've known that he was made the emissary soon afterward?</i>

231
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,300
<i>Then he went to cultivate.</i>

232
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:41,100
<i>And that was 1,500 years ago.</i>

233
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:47,100
♫ <i>I see a light in your starry eyes</i> ♫

234
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,300
♫ <i>The sound of the zither ringing</i> ♫

235
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,200
It's been 1,500 years.

236
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,700
You have been here for 1,500 years.

237
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:57,800
You got rid of your own feelings and turned yourself into someone who cared about nothing,

238
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,400
just to wait for the day when you'd sacrifice yourself.

239
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,000
This day

240
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,600
has finally come.

241
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:09,700
You must be the most stupid and stubborn person in the world.

242
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:11,200
♫ <i>Gorgeous flowers and fire bloom momentarily</i> ♫

243
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,200
♫ <i>It all turned into sweetness</i> ♫

244
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,800
♫ <i>I am you, and you are me</i> ♫

245
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:22,600
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

246
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,300
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

247
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,500
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

248
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:32,300
♫ <i>Smiles blooming into happiness that can't be melt away</i> ♫

249
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,300
What is that?

250
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,400
- You can't watch those.
- Why can't I watch those?

251
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,200
I want to see what you were doing with that fairy.

252
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,600
♫ <i>As I see the stars fall</i> ♫

253
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,200
♫ <i>It's like the Queen of the Night flowers and fireworks wrapped in countless rainbows</i> ♫

254
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,400
It's... me.

255
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,000
♫ <i>The passion, between you and I will never be forgotten</i> ♫

256
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,600
You and I didn't really...

257
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,000
We aren't married yet.

258
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
Of course, I must respect the manners.

259
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,000
I was so guilty that I prepared you gifts.

260
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,600
You must return them to me before you go.

261
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:05,300
I might need to give them to someone else.

262
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,500
Who else?

263
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,400
My future husband, of course.

264
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,200
If I marry again, I'll find someone who is caring and nice.

265
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,000
Who doesn't care about four realms, just me.

266
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,400
I will be his top priority.

267
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,000
What are you doing?

268
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,400
I've heard enough.

269
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,100
Once I am gone, use Mirage Ash to seal my tomb.

270
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,800
Do not leave any gaps.

271
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,200
Why?

272
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,700
In the case of my jealousy turns into flames and shines brighter than the sun and moon.

273
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,400
I'll stop talking, all right?

274
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,600
Turn me back.

275
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:40,200
I am glad that you are here today.

276
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,900
I will leave soon.

277
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,700
There's something

278
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,600
that I can only say now.

279
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:53,800
When I first met you, I thought you were too loud and naughty.

280
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,800
I even wanted to stay away from you.

281
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:00,000
But after we spent some time together,

282
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,900
I realized that you're smart and broad-minded.

283
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,700
Even broader than mine.

284
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,200
Earlier...

285
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:17,000
What happened earlier makes me feel like

286
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:21,000
that we have known each other for a long time.

287
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:27,800
But the fact is that you'd only been here for less than six months.

288
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:33,900
This time going to Guixu, I will die for sure.

289
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,300
The Heavenly Realm has promised you the title, Empyrean Consort.

290
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:41,800
So even if I am dead, you will be able to live a happy life.

291
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:45,400
You once said you hated me.

292
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,600
I am glad you did now.

293
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Keep on hating me

294
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,900
so that you will not grieve.

295
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Now, both Human and Beast Realms are urging us are urging us to fix Guixu.

296
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,700
No matter Empyrean Xuanshang has cultivated the Perfect Celestial Body or not,

297
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:26,600
it seems he will have to go and fix Guixu.

298
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,500
This is fate.

299
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,000
We can only hope that Youqin could survive it.

300
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,600
Xuanshang stopped cultivating just half a year ago.

301
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,500
He hasn't gotten married to Princess Qingkui.

302
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,700
If we send him to Guixu now...

303
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:42,200
Given the circumstances, there is nothing we can do about it.

304
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,000
Four realms are at risk.

305
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,000
We ask Empyrean Xuanshang to fix Guixu and save the world.

306
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,100
<i>Your Majesty, please give the order</i>

307
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,100
<i>and have Empyrean Xuanshang go to Guixu now</i>

308
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:00,700
<i>to save the four realms.</i>

309
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,400
Guixu is so dangerous that even Empyrean Xuanguang who was so powerful didn't survive.

310
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,900
Your Majesty, please have the whole Heavenly Realm help Youqin.

311
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:15,200
I care about Youqin as much as you do.

312
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,800
Are you blaming me?

313
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:30,600
Immortals, my son is about to save the world.

314
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,000
It's a dangerous task.

315
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,800
I am the Heavenly Empress, but I am also a mother.

316
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:37,800
I beg for your help.

317
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:42,700
May it be magic items, elixirs, any weapons or armors.

318
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,100
As long as it can protect my son,

319
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,800
I'll do anything to thank you.

320
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,800
Weapons and armors are useless for fixing Guixu.

321
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,200
Empyrean Xuanshang is on his own this time.

322
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:06,400
Your Highness, don't worry.

323
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,800
Empyrean Xuanshang was a student of Empyrean Xuanguang.

324
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,200
He is powerful.

325
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,600
He might...

326
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,100
He might be able to survive this task.

327
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,400
Empyrean Xuanshang is here.

328
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,400
Youqin.

334
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,800
Celestial Mother cares about me. I know.

335
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,400
But as long as I can save the world, I am willing to sacrifice myself.

This has been my task for over a thousand years.

339
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:00,000
Now is a critical time.

340
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,300
I must finish my task.

341
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:05,100
Celestial Father, please give the order.

342
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:11,900
Youqin, do you have confidence?

343
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,900
Don't worry, Celestial Father.

344
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,400
I have cultivated Perfect Celestial Body.

345
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:20,500
So even if I die this time, I'll be able to fix the seal.

346
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,600
The four realms will be safe for another ten thousand years.

347
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
I didn't know that my son has made such a great achievement.

348
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:47,600
In that case, hear my order, Youqin.

349
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,500
I order you to start preparing for the fixing of Guixu.

350
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
- There should be no delay.
- Yes.

351
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,800
♫ <i>When the world is the only star left</i> ♫

352

353

<i>Your Majesty.</i>

354
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:15,800
Wizard Chief Xiangliu got the news

355
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,200
that Shaodian Youqin has cultivated Perfect Celestial Body.

356
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:23,200
It seems that the Heavenly Realm will be fixing Guixu for good.

357
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:26,100
Nice.

358
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,900
Because of Guixu, I had to maintain the relationship with the immortals.

359
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:36,200
Now that Guixu will be fixed and immortals are focused on going to Guixu to fix the seal,

360
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:38,600
the defense of Heavenly Realm must be weak.

361
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,200
It is a perfect time to defeat the immortals and rule the four realms.

362
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:48,800
Tomorrow, I will lead an army myself and go to Guixu Stone Forest to slay the Heavenly Emperor.

363
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,200
Wu Dai, Dingyun, and Chaofeng, the three of you will attack the Heavenly Realm.

364
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,800
Give it your very best try.

365
00:29:56,800 --> 00:30:03,200
Whoever destroys the Heavenly Realm and enters Ninth Heaven Hall will be the Crown Prince of the Void.

366
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:05,000
- Yes.
- Yes.

367
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,600
Yes.

368
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,900
Hurry. Hurry.

369
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,600
Wu Dai has left to inspect his army.

370
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Yet you haven't gotten my things ready.

371
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,200
Why do you care about Wu Dai?

372
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:26,200
Our real opponent is Chaofeng.

373
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,000
Chaofeng?

374
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,000
You still don't understand the situation.

375
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:36,800
The last time we used Wu Dai, we already found out about Chaofeng's real power.

376
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:41,000
Today, in the palace, he was very calm.

377
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,800
He is so hard to read.

378
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,800
I bet he is after the crown.

379
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,200
Him?

380
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,200
This time, you must be very careful.

381
00:30:56,200 --> 00:31:00,000
Do not give him any chance to rise again.

382
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,400
I won't, Royal Mother.

383
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,400
How dare you! Who sent you here?

384
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,800
By His Majesty's order, Princess Yetan ignored the rule of Void and used medicine.

385
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,100
You are a bad influence.

386
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,800
She'll be sent to Cave of Haunted Souls now.

387
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,400
Take her.

388
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:30,700
- Let go.
- Make way.

389
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,900
- Princess.
- Sushui.

390
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:35,200
- Princess.
- Sushui.

391
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,500
Princess.

392
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
I hate to see her suffer.

393
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:56,200
Sir, how many more plays do we have to put on in front of the princess?

394
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,600
You don't understand.

395
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,000
Third Prince is worried that staying here alone, the princess will be harmed.

396
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,200
That's why we had to do that.

397
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Earlier, in Fenyuan Hall, you were so quiet.

398
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,600
Were you thinking about that?

399
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,100
Once we set off, no one will be here to protect her.

400
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:15,300
The most dangerous place can be the safest one.

401
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:20,700
Even if the Void Empress finds out about her identity, she won't know the princess is in Cave of Haunted Souls.

402
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,600
I see.

403
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,800
But she's afraid of Cave of Haunted Souls.

404
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,800
Sushui, about that, you needn't worry.

405
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,200
It hurts.

406
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,100
Heartless Shaodian, I helped you cultivate that Celestial Body.

407
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,500
How could you do this to me?

408
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:51,900
So ungrateful. Turn me back now.

409
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,000
Princess.

410
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:06,100
Where is Heartless Shaodian?

411
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:09,000
He has left the Heavenly Realm for Guixu.

412
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,700
He just left like that? He didn't even say goodbye?

413
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:14,700
His Highness seems indifferent, but he actually has a soft heart.

414
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,400
He can't stand partings.

415
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:21,900
That is why he asked me to turn you back into human after he leaves.

416
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,600
Why didn't you go to Guixu with him?

417
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,200
Fixing Guixu is such a dangerous thing.

418
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,400
Shouldn't there be a person staying somewhere close to protect him?

419
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,500
His Highness worries that once he leaves, the Heavenly Realm will be unguarded and someone will attack us,

420
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:36,200
so he has me guard Heavenly Southern Gate as planned.

421
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,800
<i>This is Guixu.</i>

422
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:45,400
<i>It looks like this.</i>

423
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:50,200
<i>If one day, Guixu breaks the seal, the whole world will be destroyed.</i>

424
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,300
<i>Xiao Feichi, you are my only friend in the Land of Mystery.</i>

425
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:59,900
<i>If one day, Guixu really shows an anomaly, you need to lead an army to guard the Heavenly Southern Gate.</i>

426
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,400
<i>Then go help the people who are hurt.</i>

427
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,900
<i>This is the Heavenly Southern Gate.</i>

428
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,000
<i>Do you understand?</i>

429
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,400
<i>What about you then?</i>

430
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,000
<i>Then,</i>

431
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:24,400
<i>I guess I'll be dead like my master.</i>

432
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,900
<i>There is really someone so silly</i>
<i>[Xuanshang]</i>

433
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,500
<i>that he would sacrifice his life for people he doesn't even know.</i>

434
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:43,930
<i>Heartless Shaodian, did you arrange your own death quietly in such a lonesome place?</i>

435
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,400
You have her now.

436
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,900
- Yes.
- Yes.

437
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,600
Come with me.

438
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:23,800
Princess, this is it.

439
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Please.

440
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:36,200
This is the Cave of Haunted Souls?

441
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,200
<i>Yes, yes.</i>

442
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,600
Why are you so afraid of me?

443
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:42,100
I am the prisoner.

444
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,200
P-Princess, we aren't allowed to be afraid.

445
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,600
I am not afraid.

446
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Yes, right.

447
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,100
Okay, then you can go.

448
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,700
<i>Princess. Princess.</i>

449
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
What is really going on here?

450
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:53,900
Don't cry.

451
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:57,400
Third Prince said, anyone who upsets the princess shall be beheaded.

452
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
One head will be worth one hundred Void Coins.

453
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,700
So listen up.

454
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,100
Let's take a few more heads, otherwise, we won't have enough money for our men.

455
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,800
The princess seems unhappy.

456
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,200
Is she scared by that guy?

457
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,000
Let's kill him first.

458
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,300
Please stop crying.

459
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:13,000
- Just stand up first.
<i>- Princess.</i>

460
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,200
Princess. Please.

461
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,400
After we return, I will ask royal father to marry Tan Tan to me.

462
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,400
Sir, we should set off.

463
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,200
Take the army and go without me.

464
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,600
I will go to Cave of Haunted Souls first.

465
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:37,300
I have arranged everything there.

466
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,500
This war is special.

467
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:40,300
I suggest we set off right away.

468
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,800
It is because this war is special that I have to go talk to her before I leave.

469
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,300
What's there to talk about?

470
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:49,300
As long as we win, the princess will surely be your...

471
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,500
What if Wu Dai or Dingyun wins?

472
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:55,400
Do I just watch her marry Wu Dai or Dingyun?

473
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,800
There's something I have to tell her.

474
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,000
Have some faith in yourself.

475
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,200
Sir. Wait. Sir.

476
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,800
Sir!

477
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:10,700
- Good.
- Nice. Nice.

478
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,000
- Higher.
- Good.

479
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,300
Higher. Higher.

480
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,600
Right. Right.

481
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,600
The princess isn't laughing.

482
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,800
Choke me. Choke me. Do it.

483
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,000
I laid an egg.

484
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,600
The princess laughed.

485
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,400
How about we put on a play for you?

486
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,100
Princess, let me lay another egg for you.

487
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,200
I'll lay another one for you.

488
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,900
Hold on.

489
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,600
I appreciate your kind gesture.

490
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:43,500
But ever since I came into Cave of Haunted Souls, I have watched many of your shows.

491
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,000
I am a bit tired now.

492
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,200
Princess, we will leave you alone then.

493
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,000
If you need anything, Princess...

494
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,600
I will tell you. I promise.

495
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,900
<i>We'll get going.</i>

496
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,200
Take our stuff. Take it.

497
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,500
Come on. Come.

498
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,000
Third Prince.

499
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,400
The Cave of Haunted Souls was supposed to be a scary place.

500
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,500
I don't know why it became like this.

501
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:17,900
Did you arrange this?

502
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,800
Yes.

503
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,300
I bought off the soldiers.

504
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:26,000
I sold my jewelry to get enough money for a visit.

505
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:30,600
An arrangement like this must be very expensive.

506
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,700
I came to thank you.

507
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,600
Thank me?

508
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,000
The Void was a place full of danger.

509
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,200
It was you who made this place less unbearable.

510
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,600
I know that you didn't want to come and stay here.

511
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,200
I also know that you're the Empyrean Consort.

512
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,500
But I fell in love with you.

513
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,100
I love your kindness and bravery.

514
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:58,200
I love your innocence and tenacity.

515
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:00,990
I love you so much that I want to spend my whole life with you.

516

♫ <i>You say, "Light swept through the twin flowers"</i> ♫

517
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:06,700
I wonder if you can give me the chance.

520
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,000
Third Prince,

521
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,100
I grew up being taught how to be an Empyrean Consort.

522
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:25,500
I had to learn how to be merciful to the world and how to love the Empyrean.

523
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,800
But after I accidentally came here,

524
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,700
it was your protection that showed me what it's like to be free.

525
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,700
I am very thankful to you, but I've never thought about...
