21
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,740
Consort Mother.

22
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:06,660
I don't think you remember you have a mother.

23
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,080
I'm afraid you probably think all the voidwalkers are fools,

24
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,100
pawns to be manipulated and used as you will.

25
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,760
You've found out, Consort Mother.

26
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,080
You pretended to be promiscuous and free-spirited,

27
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,800
gathering information in secret, coveting the throne,

28
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,420
and even plotting to have Wu Dai and Dingyun turn against each other.

29
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,080
You caused such a terrible mess, and you dared to hide it from me all this time!

30
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,700
I had them keep it from you so as not to agitate you out of concern for your health.

31
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,760
How thoughtful of you.

32
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,300
Please punish me, Consort Mother.

33
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,200
How… How can I use this whip?

34
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,020
Right.

35
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,100
I knew Consort Mother wouldn't bear to punish me.

36
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,980
Not a single barb on that thing.

37
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,180
Consort Mother, I'm your biological son.

38
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,780
- I'll teach you for being unrepentant!
- Sir!

39
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,820
I'll teach you for being unrepentant!

40
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,440
- It doesn't hurt.
- Come here!

41
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,780
It doesn't hurt.

42
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,540
Don't pull my hair, Sir!

43
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,720
Consort Mother!

44
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,400
Consort Mother, your migraine is acting up.

45
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:16,200
Please calm down. Rest.

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:21,280
Consort Mother.

47
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,680
Feng'er, I've told you this many times.

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,700
You and I are descendants of a clan that committed a grave crime.

49
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,100
There is no place for us in the succession war.

50
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,180
The Void Empress is ruthless.

51
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:43,500
Do you really think she can't see through your facade?

52
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,040
It's dangerous to get involved in the succession war.

53
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:53,160
I only wish for you to find someone you love and live a peaceful life with her.

54
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,920
Why can't you understand me?

55
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,500
Why do you refuse to give up on this obsession?

56
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,180
Consort Mother.

57
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,880
I yearn for peace too.

58
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:07,700
But even after all these years, I can't forget how the Empress afflicted you with that migraine

59
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,500
and how she drove us out of the Void by claiming that we were sinful slaves.

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:17,380
I'm doing all of this scheming so that we will never go hungry or cold ever again.

61
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,300
Feng'er!

62
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,700
<i>The Fuzhu clan was annihilated for going against the Void Tyrant's orders.</i>

63
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,660
<i>All of them died.</i>

64
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,720
<i>But you, a wretched woman, are still alive.</i>

65
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
<i>You're just a coward.</i>

66
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:42,240
<i>You seduced the Void Tyrant with your looks and even became his consort!</i>

67
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:48,480
<i>Do you think I would allow a shameless pair of mother and son such as you two to live?</i>

68
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,120
<i>No! Let my consort mother go!</i>

69
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,640
I understand how you feel.

70
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:00,640
You were only a thousand years old back then.

71
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:05,760
I was restrained, so I couldn't defend myself,

72
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:09,680
and you had to suffer with me.

73
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
If you hadn't become the Void Patrol by your own capabilities,

74
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,580
I wouldn't even be able to stay in this Luowei Grotto in peace.

75
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,460
But, Feng'er, you're fortunate to have made it this far.

76
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,960
If you go any further, I fear it will cost you your life.

77
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,100
If I don't fight, I'll be at their mercy.

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,940
Either way, they will kill us eventually.

79
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:34,840
I will become the Void Tyrant and clear the name of you and the Fuzhu clan.

80
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,080
If the Empress, Eldest Brother, and Second Brother wish to wage war, then we'll see who will be the last one standing.

81
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,860
You…

82
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:43,320
Consort Mother! Servants!

83
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,800
Yes.

84
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,340
Take my consort mother to rest.

85
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,700
Yes.

86
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,800
- Slowly.
- Careful.

87
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:15,260
I've taken the Zhulong Army under my wing.

88
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
It's all that insignificant and bastardly Chaofeng's fault!

89
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,940
He ruined my great plans!

90
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:24,060
Chaofeng has always been inconspicuous.

91
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:27,320
That is why we dropped our guard around him.

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,900
How are you so calm, Royal Mother?

93
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:37,580
Could it be that you already have a plan in mind?

94
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,500
At times like this, it is all the more important to remain calm and assess the situation.

95
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,300
Think about it.

96
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:50,060
The second we moved to take down Wu Dai, Chaofeng killed Zhu Jiuyin.

97
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:55,280
<i>When Chaofeng was about to die at your hands, Wu Dai came and saved him.</i>

98
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,920
<i>That can't be a coincidence.</i>

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:01,620
You mean Chaofeng was behind all of this?

100
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,100
Him?

101
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,200
The son of a slave?

102
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,720
His cultivation is mediocre.

103
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,560
Would he be able to devise such a meticulous scheme?

104
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,860
Is that possible? Absolutely not!

105
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:17,680
Chaofeng was able to escape from your hand with ease that day.

106
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,540
His cultivation is most likely on par with yours.

107
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,740
We've underestimated him all this time.

108
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,560
However, he poses no threat on his own.

109
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,460
You mean...

110
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:33,340
he will work with Wu Dai?

111
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:37,020
We can't let them join forces, of course.

112
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,980
Royal Mother,

113
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,780
what is your plan?

114
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:48,820
My people have found out that Princess Yetan has frequently been visiting Chaofeng since the trial.

115
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,580
The two of them appear to be growing closer by the day.

116
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:02,680
The Shangshu Academy examinations have always been rigorous.

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,560
You're a mortal, and you don't know any spells.

118
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,160
You'll need to study hard for the next three days.

119
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,980
Are you ready for this?

120
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:25,020
How can I learn all of this in three days?

121
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,900
Three days is a short amount of time.

122
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,260
But once you learn one of them, you'll learn the rest accordingly.

123
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,280
As long as you can master one spell, the rest will come easy.

124
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:37,420
So you're saying once I master one spell, I can learn the rest easily?

125
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,920
Revitalization Spell.

126
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:51,060
Regenerate decaying wood.

127
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,840
May the wood be strong and thrive.

128
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,760
May it thrive and grow sturdy.

129
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:02,180
Rise from the ground.

130
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,960
May the earthen deity grant it health.

131
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,520
Transform!

132
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,580
Grant it health.

133
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,120
Why can't I turn it into a flower?

134
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,060
The chant is "May it grow healthy in the earth."

135
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,780
You were too fast.

136
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,080
I didn't even see your hands clearly.

137
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,780
Do it again. I'm sure I can learn it.

138
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,340
The Revitalization Spell is advanced magical arts.

139
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:50,400
I presume the exam will consist of a few questions based on the Transfiguration Spell.

140
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,860
You need to practice it well.

141
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:54,640
The Transfiguration Spell is an art of transformation.

142
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
There are several levels to this spell.

143
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,160
The first level is to materialize an object from an existing object.

144
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,620
Advanced users may even materialize the five elements.

145
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:05,940
Knowledge Star Deity will most likely test you on the basic spell of transforming one item into another.

146
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,760
Watch closely.

147
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:24,760
You try it.

148
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,200
Manifest what's on your mind.

149
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,340
Like this?

150
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
Transform.

151
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,840
Transform!

152
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,020
Don't… Don't be impatient.

153
00:10:51,020 --> 00:10:52,880
It must be a problem with the inkstone.

154
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,100
I'll try again.

155
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,160
Transform.

156
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,280
I did it!

157
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,300
What was it originally?

158
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,620
A brush.

159
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,800
I turned it into candy.

160
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,440
It tastes so sweet! It's lychee-flavored.

161
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,980
Try it.

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,460
Isn't it sweet?

163
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:30,720
Hey, how would you know if it worked or not if you don't try it?

164
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,140
Even if it is candy, the exam is tomorrow.

165
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,560
How are you going to take the exam with these two shoddy works?

166
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,460
Turn them back and get some rest.

167
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,300
How do I make this fluffy again?

168
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,180
Transform.

169
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:46,400
Why isn't it fluffy at all?

170
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:49,960
Liguang Qingkui!

171
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,780
Sorry…

172
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:01,140
Sorry…

173
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,700
The wind finally picked up, but it turned out to be a huge gale!

174
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,420
But at least I finally made it to the Heavenly Realm.

175
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:32,300
That hurts…

176
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,900
Tan Tan, Man Man, where are you guys?

177
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,920
Come and greet… me…

178
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,140
Little one.

179
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,640
Listen up. I'm Princess Ziwu.

180
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,580
- I'm going to pick you up now.
- <i>Ziwu?</i>

181
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:14,280
- Don't bite me.
<i>- Xuanshang's little sister.</i>

182
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,660
<i>The Heavenly Emperor's youngest daughter.</i>

183
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,680
<i>My leg! My leg!</i>

184
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,120
<i>She is beautiful.</i>

185
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,740
<i>But she doesn't look very intelligent.</i>

186
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:32,780
<i>If I can hold her hostage, maybe I'll be able to rescue Tan.</i>

187
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:38,500
<i>The… The celestial patterns on her clothes and the shards on her necklace</i>

188
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,980
<i>are all incredibly powerful protective artifacts.</i>

189
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:44,160
<i>I… I can't use my spells!</i>

190
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:49,160
<i>I'm not that easy! All right.</i>

191
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:59,380
You're wounded. Who could be so cruel to hurt a little puppy?

192
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,400
<i>Puppy?</i>

193
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,940
- So cute!
<i>- Don't touch me!</i>

194
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,620
- So cute!
<i>- Hands off!</i>

195
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:13,080
<i>I never knew being surrounded by pretty ladies could be so terrifying.</i>

196
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,300
- Over here!
- Oh my gosh, Your Highness!

197
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:18,080
- Are all dogs this cute?
- Not necessarily.

198
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:21,040
The Howling Celestial Dog is a dog too. But it isn't as cute as mine.

199
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,480
Of course.

200
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,000
<i>All of you, stop it!</i>

201
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,520
<i>I am a wolf!</i>

202
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,840
<i>Wolf!</i>

203
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,060
<i>Wolf!</i>

204
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,110
How adorable!

205
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:40,220
<i>So adorable!</i>

206
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,640
Don't be afraid. No one will dare to lay a hand on you in my Nongqing Pavilion.

207
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:57,520
There, back to normal. Don't give up. Let's keep trying.

208
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,700
Transform.

209
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,500
Transform.

210
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,540
Heed my word…

211
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,220
Transform.

212
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:37,280
Transform. Transform.

213
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,360
Transform.

214
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,320
Transform.

215
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,460
Transform…

216
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,340
Why won't you transform?

217
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,800
Transform.

218
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,920
Transform.

219
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,080
Transform…

220
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,980
I set the deadline for three days.

221
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,980
Maybe I should have her withdraw from the exam.

222
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,340
You're the Empyrean.

223
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,920
You can tell this to Knowledge Star Deity.

224
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,840
"Knowledge Star Deity, Princess Qingkui is my consort."

225
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,120
"You only gave her three days to master all these spells."

226
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,820
"This is an unreasonable demand for you to make."

227
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,180
"I order you…"

228
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,220
I set the deadline myself.

229
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,180
I mustn't abuse my authority.

230
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,120
How about this, then?

231
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,740
"Knowledge Star Deity, my beloved consort has limited talent."

232
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,480
"Please give her a little more time."

233
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,300
No. That gives a strong sense of favoritism.

234
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,520
Isn't there any other way to get him to change his mind?

235
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,640
We're done for, then. This is too hard.

236
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:05,860
We've always been asked for favors. We've never been the ones to ask for favors.

237
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,480
Stop talking then.

238
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,600
Don't blame me for saying this. Her Highness has been working so hard.

239
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:24,000
If we don't let her take the exam, she will feel so discouraged.

240
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:28,180
- Eldest Brother.
- Eldest Brother.

241
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,840
Why are you here?

242
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,040
You're not here to invigilate the exam, are you?

243
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,340
The exam is a trivial matter.

244
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:40,180
There's no reason for the Empyrean to oversee it himself.

245
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,920
He must be here for my sister-in-law.

246
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:47,880
How sweet. If only I had a relationship like this too.

247
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:50,380
Listen. I memorized everything.

248
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,120
I won't embarrass myself today.

249
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,540
I came today to…

250
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:55,980
Knowledge Star Deity is here to announce the exam question!

251
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:57,040
- Let's go!
-Come on!

252
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,280
Farewell, Eldest Brother.

253
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,120
<i>Let's go check it out!</i>

254
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,240
- Hurry up!
- Wait for me!

255
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,800
Knowledge Star Deity.

256
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,020
Your Highness?

257
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
Why are you here?

258
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,720
I'm here…

259
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,680
to observe.

260
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:34,080
His Highness heard that the students of the Shangshu Academy had made great progress.

261
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,640
So he has come to see if there are any talents

262
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,520
that may be capable of undertaking important roles in the future.

263
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:50,660
Today is the assessment of the Shangshu Academy.

264
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:53,320
His Highness has personally come to observe the examination.

265
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,600
All of you must concentrate and give your best performance.

266
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,240
I will reveal the exam question now.

267
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,640
Transfiguration Spell…

268
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,140
Your assessment is…

269
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,240
Transfiguration Spell…

270
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,480
Revitalize a dead plant.

271
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,300
<i>Revitalize a dead plant?</i>

272
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,720
Revitalization Spell.

273
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,540
The assessment ends when the incense stick is burned out.

274
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:44,460
You predicted the wrong question.

275
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:50,040
The method to cast the Revitalization Spell and Transfiguration Spell is the same.

276
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,200
Only the hand gestures are different.

277
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,520
Do you still remember it?

278
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:54,260
I only saw it once.

279
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:57,740
How could I possibly remember it? Hurry up and tell me now.

280
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,260
Isn't this cheating?

281
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:01,600
The rules are fixed, but people aren't.

282
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,860
No.

283
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,960
I will never show bias.

284
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,180
If you can't remember, you can withdraw from the examination.

285
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,300
- I'll make a plea for leniency on your behalf.
- What are you talking about?

286
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,960
It took me a lot to get this opportunity. There's no way I'm giving it up.

287
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,800
Besides, Knowledge Star Deity already thinks that I'm relying on you.

288
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:20,300
If you ask him for leniency on my behalf, he'll look down on me even more.

289
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:25,820
There's no way I'm going to give up. I won't back out at the last minute. I won't let them look down on me.

290
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:27,920
I'm sure I can remember it.

291
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:39,580
Before we start the exam, the false shall be removed and the truth shall be revealed.

292
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,600
What does he mean by that?

293
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,300
Watch.

294
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,100
What… What is going on?

295
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,900
To prevent the students from cheating and ensure a fair examination

296
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:39,040
for all students, so that anyone who has cast spells on themselves

297
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:43,480
will revert to their original forms once they step into the barrier.

298
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:48,180
Even those who used spells to alter their appearances will not be spared.

299
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:08,280
I didn't know that little guy cared so much about his height.

300
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,680
Everyone has the desire to look attractive,

301
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,160
but it is due for the Heavenly Realm to get rid

302
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,520
of the bad habit of retouching appearances and altering heights.

303
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,260
The path of cultivation follows the ways of nature.

304
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:25,380
Naturally, it is better to look natural.

305
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,160
Fairy Biqiong is really beautiful.

306
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,660
Yes, she looks so pretty.

307
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,940
<i>Those of the Xia clan are born beautiful. We rarely alter our looks.</i>

308
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,880
<i>With such a group of ugly female deities as a comparison,</i>

309
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,660
<i>Cousin will surely fall for me.</i>

310
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:58,140
<i>But he only has eyes for her!</i>

311
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,740
<i>I would like to see her true appearance.</i>

312
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,420
Come on, Princess Qingkui.

313
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:06,380
Sure.

314
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,220
The Empyrean Consort is a human.

315
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:10,780
I wonder if she disguised herself.

316
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,280
No idea. We'll find out.

317
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,090
- She is so beautiful!
- She looks gorgeous!

318
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:25,720
<i>She's really beautiful.</i>

319
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:28,150
Let's get a closer look.

320
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:29,720
Wow.

321
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,760
You're a real natural beauty, Qingkui.

322
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,260
Indeed.

323
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:40,320
You… You didn't alter your appearance?

324
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,080
<i>How unnecessary. I don't even know how to perform the Revitalization Spell.</i>

325
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,740
<i>How could I know anything else?</i>

326
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:49,540
If you fail, you'll disgrace His Highness.

327
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,820
It won't matter how good you look.

328
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,300
You…

329
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:59,340
Come on, Ziwu.

330
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:07,120
The examination... begins now.

331
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:07,740
<i>Impossible! That can't be!</i>

332
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:11,860
Sister-in-law, at this rate, you'll get first grade!

333
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,750
♫ <i>The twilight paints the dark night red</i> ♫

334
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:21,760
♫ <i>Illuminating the delicate world</i> ♫

335
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,520
♫ <i>And the starlight naturally flickering</i> ♫

336
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,220
♫ <i>The living stands in fear</i> ♫

337
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,060
♫ <i>Wake me up from this nightmare</i> ♫

338
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,160
♫ <i>I see through your blushing</i> ♫

339
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:39,240
♫ <i>The thought of you in this world urges me to make a decision</i> ♫

340
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:44,700
♫ <i>Heaven and Earth resonates with the mountains and rivers</i> ♫

341
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,600
♫ <i>The world is untamed and unbridled</i> ♫

342
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,700
♫ <i>Come what may</i> ♫

343
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:56,120
♫ <i>I am willing to risk my life for you</i> ♫

344
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
♫ <i>Let's go stargazing tomorrow</i> ♫

345
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,680
Not only is Qingkui able to revive the dead plant, but she can also transform it into birds!

346
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:04,360
She has improved so much in such a short time!

347
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,580
The examination is over.

348
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,940
Fairy Biqiong. Fail.

349
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,900
Qingheng. Second grade.

350
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:14,500
Princess Ziwu.

351
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:16,580
Second grade.

352
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:22,020
- What about me?
<i>- First grade!</i>

353
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,600
<i>First grade!</i>

354
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:31,440
In such a short time, you managed to reach a high level of mastery of the Revitalization Spell.

355
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,920
How long would it take for you all to reach this level?

356
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:37,500
For an average student, from as little as one year to as much as three years.

357
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:42,180
It would take at least five years... to reach such an advanced level.

358
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:44,460
Five years? You only gave me three days!

359
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:47,720
You were obviously making things difficult for me on purpose.

360
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,800
Thank goodness I am clever and talented.

361
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,120
Wait.

362
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:14,800
Why are there traces of other spells here?

363
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,840
Other spells?

364
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:29,240
I thought you actually reached an advanced level of mastery.

365
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,720
But this is just poor execution of the Revitalization Spell combined with the Transfiguration Spell.

366
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,320
You said to revitalize the dead plant.

367
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,980
You didn't say we could only use the Revitalization Spell, did you?

368
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:43,660
- That's right.
- Besides, my sister-in-law's Transfiguration Spell is impressive.

369
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,580
That's right.

370
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,620
I admit that for being able to learn and integrate these two spells in such a short time,

371
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:54,660
you are exceptionally gifted and intelligent.

372
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:56,420
You can be awarded first grade.

373
00:29:56,420 --> 00:30:00,620
But my intention was to assess your Revitalization Spell.

374
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,580
By that logic, what you did was merely use falsehood to disguise the truth

375
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:07,820
and pass off an inferior item as a superior one.

376
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,920
And that's a stretch too.

377
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,560
Your actions and words are part of the assessment as well.

378
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,420
You…

379
00:30:14,420 --> 00:30:17,620
You are arrogant and have no respect for your teacher.

380
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:21,360
Your grade will be lowered by one. Second grade.

381
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:24,340
You old man! You're so petty!

382
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,840
How dare you act so impertinently!

383
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:33,820
If it were not for my appreciation of talent, you wouldn't even get second grade.

384
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,860
Who cares what grade I got?

385
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:40,020
Either way, I got into the Shangshu Academy.

386
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,560
Sister-in-law, your spell mastery was incredible.

387
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:53,880
Indeed. You're a mortal, but you are outstanding.

388
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,880
I am ashamed of myself.

389
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,400
A piece of cake.

390
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:04,260
Your Highness, shouldn't we congratulate Her Highness too?

391
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,000
Forget it.

392
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,980
I'm not good with words.

393
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:09,520
Let's go.

394
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:36,460
Your Highness.

395
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:38,200
Not bad.

396
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:40,540
- Continue training.
<i>- Yes.</i>

397
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,760
Did you hear?

398
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,060
Princess Yetan has been visiting the Third Prince a lot lately.

399
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:49,720
That's not a big deal. Everyone knows the Third Prince is promiscuous.

400
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,280
This is different.

401
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,500
Princess Yetan is the future crown princess.

402
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:57,640
If His Highness gets close to Princess Yetan, doesn't that mean he considers himself the future crown prince?

403
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,000
Insolent!

404
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:04,880
Your Highness. Just now, you said Chaofeng was vying for the title of the crown prince. Is that true?

405
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,300
I dare not slander the Third Prince!

406
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:09,320
I am the greatest warrior of the Void.

407
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,700
I've made great achievements in battle.

408
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,760
If I haven't claimed that title, what gives Chaofeng the right to do that?

409
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,520
Yes, Your Highness is right…

410
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,300
Come on, let's go meet him.

411
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,800
Her Highness's medicine is really effective.

412
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:34,080
The wounds from Consort Xue and the injuries I got from you are all healed.

413
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:37,340
I didn't expect her to possess such skills.

414
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:52,640
<i>Your Highness is wounded. You must apply medicine promptly.</i>

415
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:05,580
Wait. If I'm healed, wouldn't that ruin her chances of approaching me and proving her loyalty?

416
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,240
Sir, what else do you want Her Highness to examine?

417
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,600
Aren't you worried that Princess Qingkui might find some other illness?

418
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:15,820
Cut the nonsense. The usual.

419
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,360
Help me.

420
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:25,320
This way, Your Highness.

421
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,540
All right. Do you want to break your arm or leg this time?

422
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,140
Arm.

423
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,900
On second thought, leg.

424
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,360
Wait.

425
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,080
Let's stick to the arm.

426
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:42,180
Never mind. Leg it is.

427
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,600
Your Highness.

428
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,740
Your Highness.

429
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,060
You're finally here, Your Highness.

430
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:58,120
Your Highness, to tell you the truth,

431
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,560
His Highness's condition has worsened.

432
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,720
How can that be?

433
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:05,440
<i>- It's...</i>
- a cold.
- chest pain.

434
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,760
That caused chest pains.

435
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,500
This is odd.

436
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:27,000
Nothing appears abnormal with His Highness's pulse.

437
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,280
Dingyun is cruel.

438
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,520
He must've used the dark arts of the Void

439
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,780
to cause me an illness that could not be detected by my pulse reading.

440
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:43,240
Which side of your chest hurts, Your Highness?

441
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:46,440
The right side.

442
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,080
Strange. I thought it was the left side.

443
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,880
Why is the right side hurting now?

444
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,040
The left side hurts too.

445
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,520
This is the first time I've seen such a strange disease.

446
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,600
I must check the medical books.

447
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,100
Oh, right. Your Highness suffered a serious injury.

448
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,460
You need to be careful with your diet.

449
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:15,960
Vegetable pancakes?

450
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,040
I made you some seasonal vegetable pancakes.

451
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:25,540
Your Highness, how could you prepare this for His Highness?

452
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:28,520
Does Your Highness not like vegetable pancakes?

453
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:42,340
<i>Your Majesty, the First Prince is fierce and courageous.</i>

454
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,240
<i>He will surely amount to greatness in the future.</i>

455
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,020
<i>The Second Prince is intelligent.</i>

456
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,360
<i>He will make great achievements in the future.</i>

457
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:50,940
<i>A toast to you, Second Prince.</i>

458
00:35:56,560 --> 00:36:00,640
<i>He made you his consort, but he deliberately mistreats you.</i>

459
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,660
<i>This is too much.</i>

460
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,520
<i>It's good to have a lighter diet.</i>

461
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:07,240
<i>It cleans your body and keeps your internal organs healthy.</i>

462
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,400
<i>Consort Mother, aren't you upset about your poor treatment at all?</i>

463
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,120
<i>The Fuzhu clan has been annihilated.</i>

464
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:17,460
<i>Its people have been slaughtered.</i>

465
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,460
<i>I'm lucky to be alive and to be able to raise my child now.</i>

466
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,420
<i>How could I be upset?</i>

467
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:26,940
<i>Eat up.</i>

468
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:31,280
<i>As long as I have you with me, I don't think life is hard at all.</i>

469
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:48,200
<i>I, Xue Qingxin, raise a roast to Your Majesty.</i>

470
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,220
<i>Here. Drink.</i>

471
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,600
<i>Here.</i>

472
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,960
I don't dislike vegetables.

473
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,260
I just don't like the days when they were all I could have.

474
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:32,700
You should've been enjoying a life of comfort in the Heavenly Realm.

475
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:36,140
Yet you were dragged into the Void by me.

476
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:39,980
I don't want to let them trample over me, but I'm imposing the same selfishness on another.

477
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:41,300
I'm sorry.

478
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:43,260
Don't say that, Your Highness.

479
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:47,020
I'm in this mess because of the Void Empress and Second Prince's evil deeds.

480
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:51,460
Moreover, I'm safe right now because of your protection.

481
00:37:51,460 --> 00:37:54,040
I can't thank you enough.

482
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,900
Chaofeng!

483
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,180
What brings Your Highness here?

484
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,700
Out of my way.

485
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,460
Chaofeng, I heard you've been pestering Princess Yetan.

486
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:22,240
Now that I've seen it with my own eyes, the rumors are true.

487
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,060
Do you actually take yourself as the Crown Prince?

488
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,280
I…

489
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,960
Seize this rascal!

490
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,340
<i>- Yes.</i>
- It's because…

491
00:38:29,340 --> 00:38:31,380
- Because what?
- Your Highness! You misunderstood.

492
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:34,560
I only came to treat Third Prince's wounds.

493
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,960
Treat his wounds?

494
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,900
Eldest Brother!

495
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:57,660
All right, Chaofeng.

496
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,940
I thought you were just lusting after a woman.

497
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:06,440
To think you're actually a coward, disregarding the rules of the Void and seeking medical aid.

498
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,320
- Arrest him!
- Seize him!

499
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,920
This is all because of me!

500
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,860
I insisted on treating His Highness's wounds.

501
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:14,420
If Your Highness wants to punish someone, punish me.

502
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,000
Please don't blame Third Prince.

503
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,800
You! Do you really think I dare not do anything to you?

504
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,440
Do you think I won't apprehend you too?

505
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,880
The rules of the Void cannot be disobeyed.

506
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:28,540
Since you are strict and impartial, I'll have to follow the rules.

507
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:33,880
I am willing to challenge Your Highness in a match of martial arts.

508
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,860
I am willing to challenge Your Highness.

509
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,120
What did you say?

510
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:47,860
The rules of the Void are determined by the strong.

511
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:51,440
If I can resist your moves with my medical skills,

512
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,100
that proves that the Void should not consider medical treatment a taboo.

513
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,020
And Third Prince should not be wronged for seeking medical attention.

514
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:04,020
Eldest Brother, she is joking. Do not take it seriously.

515
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:05,120
Your Highness, you…

516
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,580
I'm serious.

517
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:10,320
Your Highness, are you afraid of accepting my challenge?

518
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,960
Impudent!

519
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:14,800
I've had my way in the Void for thousands of years! There's nothing I fear!

520
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,540
Since you're willing to die, I'll be happy to bury you.

521
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
Don't worry, Your Highness.

522
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:27,720
I won't let you suffer because of me again.

523
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,980
I've been undefeated for thousands of years.

524
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,960
Since you are the Crown Princess, you can set the rules.

525
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,700
Weapons or martial arts? Name it.

526
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,760
Your Highness may use any weapon or martial arts.

527
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,920
But before we begin, will Your Highness allow me to prick you with a few silver needles?

528
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,520
I have over thousands of years of cultivation.

529
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:03,100
There's not a hidden weapon I've yet to encounter.

530
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:07,420
A few needles won't do anything to me. Do as you like.

531
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,440
Thank you, Your Highness.

532
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,320
Here. Help yourself.

533
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,740
Come on.

534
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:28,640
Her Highness is frail. I don't think she'll last a move against him.

535
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,960
Forget what I said.

536
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,640
Are you just going to stand idly by?

537
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,120
Do you want me to fry some wolf's heart and dog's lungs for you to have with some liquor?

538
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:41,540
Why so anxious?

539
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,360
She challenged Eldest Brother for my sake. Of course, I won't let anything happen to her.

540
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:46,780
Be quiet.

541
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,100
I hope Your Highness is a man of your word.

542
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,260
If I win—

543
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:19,580
Hold on. Forget about winning.

544
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:23,100
If you can even beat one of my moves, I'll let Chaofeng go at once.

545
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:27,160
All right. Please make your move, Your Highness.

546
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,000
You asked for this.
