00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:59,800
Today, I'm impudent to ask Miss Liu Rong

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:04,390
to invite everyone over because I'd like to apologize to you all

23
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:08,430
as I've let you down and broken your hearts.

24
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:10,420
This is an unavoidable responsibility.

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,390
It made you no longer have faith in true love.

26
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:17,630
- It's my fault.
- Wait. Who are you?

27
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,470
I'm Wen Ren.

28
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:24,990
Miss Hong Bin, don't you remember me?

29
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,290
What I meant is, who do you think you are?

30
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:30,190
You're a heartless guy who always sows your wild oats and lies.

31
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:31,760
I've long forgotten about you.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,870
Do you think I'll miss you?

33
00:02:33,870 --> 00:02:37,040
Stop being bashful and flattering yourself.

34
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,050
It's really unnecessary.

35
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,700
I haven't finished apologizing.

36
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,420
So it's not a serious matter.

37
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,520
Wen Ren, don't feel upset.

38
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:55,860
I believe sooner or later, you'll meet the one who cares about you.

39
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,450
<i>It turns out I'm the only one who cares so much about him.</i>

40
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:09,420
<i>Now, it appears that he's not that outstanding.</i>

41
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:12,320
<i>What did I see in him in the first place?</i>

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,140
Forget it. I must have been blinded.

43
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,890
Give me back my Chaste Jade Belt.

44
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:19,180
It's an item, after all.

45
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,710
How was it?

46
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:45,380
She's still not willing to undo it for you?

47
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,610
Don't worry.

48
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,760
I believe they'll be impressed one day.

49

50
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:57,490

113
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,420
That means we can revive Eldest Brother?

114
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,560
Yes.

115
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,500
That's great.

116
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,120
Sister-in-law.

117
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,370
Since the soul shards have all fallen for you, we should revive Eldest Brother as soon as possible.

118
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,170
Qingheng, after combining the three soul shards,

119
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:19,490
will Shaodian Youqin still remember everything that has happened here?

120
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,320
Reviving the body with the soul shards is only recorded in the ancient book, there's no precedent.

121
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,270
I have no idea about it.

122
00:07:27,270 --> 00:07:31,230
But the immortals who returned to their original forms in the Heavenly Ministry of Justice

123
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:34,860
only got their flesh and blood back after being revived. They have no memories.

124
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:38,590
That means he'll forget everything?

125
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:40,050
<i>He must not remember it.</i>

126
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:41,910
<i>The soul shards have seen you and your sister.</i>

127
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:44,520
<i>What if you give the game away?</i>

128
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:52,470
<i>These three soul shards have lived freely.</i>

129
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:57,950
<i>Should we obliterate them and bring Heartless Shaodian back to that cold and boring Heavenly Realm?</i>

130
00:07:57,950 --> 00:08:01,600
<i>How am I going to tell them that I try all means</i>

131
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:06,820
<i>to make them fall in love with me just to revive Empyrean Xuanshang?</i>

132
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,320
Anyway, Sister-in-law, please accept my respects.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,420
You're the strongest contributor in this trip.

134
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,760
I couldn't have done it without your help.

135
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:17,520
Thanks to the Heart-listening Item Di Lanjue gave me.

136
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,960
I managed to accomplish it.

137
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,880
One of your earrings is missing.

She's gone early in the morning.

142
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,600
You can't live without Miss Yuexia for a second.

143
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:12,900
Isn't this Yuexia's earring?

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,840
<i>This table just can't seem to get clean.</i>

145

<i>It just can't seem to get clean.</i>

146
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:30,820
Did you say anything?

147
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,460
I didn't.

148
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,760
<i>Miss Liu Rong is actually quite good.</i>

149
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,530
<i>She's sensible and big-hearted.</i>

150
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:46,240

<i>Why don't we stir-fry the vegetables and make sweet and sour fish?</i>

154
00:09:59,950 --> 00:10:02,820
<i>You always know what's on my mind.</i>

155
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,010
<i>What a lively stage.</i>

156

158
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:11,230
<i>Do you like it?</i>

159
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:19,520
Wen Ren!

160
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,900
Wen Ren, did you see...

161
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,040
Are you looking for this?

162
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,630
What's precious for acquaintances is understanding.

163
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,180
You know me well.

164
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,080
But I don't understand you.

165
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,060
I can explain.

166
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,360
I did this to...

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,970
It was to make me fall for you, to make me your man.

168
00:10:48,970 --> 00:10:50,580
Am I right?

169
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,830
Yes.

170
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,380
When we first met,

171
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:05,860
you and I fought against each other, none of us dared fall for one another.

172
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,730
In the end,

173
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,800
I lost.

174
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Yuexia, just one question.

175
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,100
Are you true to me or it's just for fun?

176
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,400
I...

177
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,400
Then, let me hear your thoughts.

178
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,900
Don't.

179
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,100
What's the matter?

180
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,000
He found out about this.

181
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,400
So what?

182
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,600
Now that he has fallen for you.

183
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,600
Just explain to him.

184
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,200
It won't affect the revival of Empyrean Xuanshang.

185
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,700
It's easy for you to say.

186
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,400
I'm frustrated that I don't know what to do now.

187
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,100
Hear it for me. Come on.

188
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,000
It's so noisy.

189
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,400
I'm distraught now.

190
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,800
Just help me out.

191
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,800
Hang in there.

192
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,600
Give it a try.

193
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,400
Heartless Shaodian, you jerk!

194
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,000
Why do you have so many soul shards?

195
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,400
It makes me miserable.

196
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,700
I...

197
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,700
It's dirty words.

198
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,400
I can't say it out.

199
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
And?

200
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,500
Nothing more.

201
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:43,000
Even you don't know what's on your mind. How am I able to hear it clearly?

202
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,400
Along the trip, you said you came to find the soul shards to undo the Iridescent Eyes.

203
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,000
But at every critical moment, you risked your life to protect him.

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,500
And now, the three soul shards have fallen in love with you.

205
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,700
It's time for you to ask yourself why you did all this.

206
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,000
In my opinion, you've fallen for Empyrean Xuanshang right from the start.

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,200
Or is it Fiery, Heartless, or Wen Ren?

208
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:12,300
Don't tell me you can't distinguish it.

209
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:13,500
I...

210
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,500
Well, actually, it's easy to sort out.

211
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,800
Now, the three soul shards have fallen for you.

212
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,000
You risked everything and came here in secret.

213
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
What was that for?

214
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,300
It was

215
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,000
to save Heartless Shaodian.

216
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,700
That's it.

217
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:37,900
Didn't you already fulfill your initial purpose of coming here?

218
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,800
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law!

219
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:43,000
I've sent a message to Ziwu.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,100
I told her that we'd gathered the three soul shards.

221
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:49,800
What's wrong?

222
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,300
You're right. I don't care who I love.

223
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,900
They look the same, anyway. I should stop dilly-dallying.

224
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:58,400
I'm going to make it clear to the three soul shards.

225
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,000
What?

226
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,400
Wait for me.

227
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,100
Did I catch a cold?

228
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,300
It's all because of the cursed Heartless.

229
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:24,000
He could've done something else. But he insists on writing scripts.

230
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,800
I can't eat in time while living day and night reversed.

231
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,600
Why are you here?

232
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,600
We've left the Prince's Mansion for quite some time.

233
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,900
They came here as they were worried about you.

234
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,400
You're making clothes.

235
00:14:56,100 --> 00:14:58,000
This is the best fur on them.

236
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:03,000
What spell did you cast on them that they gave you their best fur of their own free will?

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:07,300
Don't you know the experience I've gained in the Heavenly Realm?

238
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,300
Did you hug every one of them?

239
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
Go away!

240
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,600
Get lost! You too!

241
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,500
All of you, get lost!

242
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,300
What's wrong with you?

243
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:42,800
You're the princess of the Immortal clan. But you always hang out with the beasts.

244
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,600
I can't stand it anymore.

245
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,300
Aren't you from the Beast Realm, too?

246
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,600
I...

247
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,600
Why can I only hang out with you?

248
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,300
Why can't I have fun with them?

249
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:57,500
Moreover, this is a farewell gift for you.

250
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,700
A... Farewell?

251
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:08,500
I just received a message from Qingheng that the soul shard, Wen Ren has completely fallen for Sister-in-law.

252
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,300
That means they've gathered the three souls of Eldest Brother.

253
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,300
I...

254
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:17,300
I may soon return to the Heavenly Realm.

255
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,400
So I discussed with them making a piece of cloth with the best wolf fur in the Beast Realm as a gift for you.

256
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,200
A'Cai.

257
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,600
Why do you bring this up again?

258
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,600
This is the last time I can take care of you.

259
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,100
Just let me call you A'Cai once again.

260
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,700
A'Cai.

261
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,000
♫ <i>I have this sudden yearning to hear you say, "I like you"</i> ♫

262
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,100
♫ <i>How do I put this feeling into words and foreshadow my little excitements?</i> ♫

263
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:09,200
♫ <i>Maybe our superstitious of love is sweet</i> ♫

264
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,400
Sister-in-law. Sister-in-law!

265
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,500
Sister-in-law.

266
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,100
Did you drink liquor?

267
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,200
What's wrong with her?

268
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:33,000
Guys, Princess Qingkui is going to tell the soul shards the truth.

269
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Is that true?

270
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:37,900
Does... Does it mean I don't have to watch over them anymore?

271
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,600
Yes, of course.

272
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,600
That also means both of us can see Eldest Brother again.

273
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,600
Go ahead.

274
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,100
You're at the door. Don't back out.

275
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,800
Go on, hurry. Just go.

276
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:07,900
- Go, go.
- You can do this.

277
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,400
Fight on.

278
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:14,000
<i>Many people have suffered with me for over a year.</i>

279
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,800
<i>They have faith in me and help me.</i>

280
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,600
<i>All they wish is for Shaodian Youqin to be revived.</i>

281
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,400
<i>If I stop here, then, they...</i>

282
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,600
Money.

283
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,800
Money.

284
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,700
You're back.

285
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,700
I'm glad you're back.

286
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,200
Come on.

287
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,200
I'm leaving you.

288
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,800
You only have eyes for your money.

289
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,100
Hold on.

290
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,200
That's only half true.

291
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
What do you mean?

292
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,000
Money.

293
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,100
I only care about my Money.

294
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,200
How is it?

295
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,300
You know what?

296
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,300
This is adapted from the third volume of "Romantic Heroic Chronicles".

297
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,800
Do you like it?

298
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,300
Will people buy such a lame story?

299
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,400
It's not lame.

300
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,300
I have a lot of ideas.

301
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,900
The thought of you has brought me a lot of inspiration.

302
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
We're going to spend our lives together.

303
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,200
I'll come up with a lot of wonderful scripts.

304
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,800
Xiao Mei, I...

305
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,500
It's just that I'm not as rich as before.

306
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,800
You might have to suffer while living with me.

307
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,400
But it's all right, don't worry.

308
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,600
I'll work hard to earn money.

309
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:09,500
I'll earn back the money that was burned before and promise you a better life.

310
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,500
In the future, we're going to have a lot of children.

311
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,300
Our son's name will be Wealth.

312
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,300
Mei Wealth?
<i>(T/N: No wealth)</i>

313
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,100
It won't do. No way.

314
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,800
His name will be Fortune.

315
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,200
Our daughter's name will be Treasure.

316
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,500
Fortune and Treasure.

317
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:31,400
And we can enjoy a good time together as a happy family.

318
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:37,400
Mei has never only wanted or dreamed of the future like this before.

319
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:39,800
<i>Seeing how he's attached to the human world,</i>

320
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,600
<i>I don't have the heart to...</i>

321
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,800
Money, Money.

322
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,200
It's my fault.

323
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,800
I was too happy.

324
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:49,600
I kept talking about my idea.

325
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,000
Were you trying to tell me something?

326
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,800
I'm looking forward to the latter content of "Romantic Heroic Chronicles".

327
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Is that true?

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,200
I'll show you another play.

329
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,600
Well, why didn't you tell him about it?

330
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:27,800
Xiao Mei has a lot of cheerful thoughts for his future.

331
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,200
I just couldn't tell him that.

332
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,900
Fiery is simple-minded.

333
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,100
I'll try to tell him.

334
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
Three of you, just wait here.

335
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,800
Man Man and I will go to the Prince's Mansion.

336
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:50,910
Let's go, come on.

337
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,240
I haven't figured out what to say.

338
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,430
I'll start from the Heavenly Realm.

339
00:21:58,430 --> 00:21:59,410
It won't do.

340
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,880
I'll start with Empyrean Xuanshang.

341
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,190
No.

342
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,090
I'll start with the false marriage.

343
00:22:07,090 --> 00:22:08,480
You're dilly-dallying and indecisive.

344
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,880
Are you still Tan Tan I used to know?

345
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,480
Let's go.

346
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,000
Go on.

347
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,240
Go.

348
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,990
Move.

349
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
Go on.

350
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:46,450
Who is it?

351
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:56,450
Dear.

352
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:01,980
You're back.

353
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,760
I'm back.

354
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,510
Fiery, did you carve all these?

355
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,120
When you weren't around, I behaved well.

356
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,490
I didn't go anywhere and had been carving the stones.

357
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,640
I'm sorry.

358
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:26,360
I got held up. Sorry to keep you waiting.

359
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:29,830
I'm glad you're back.

360
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,360
Dear, look.

361
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,580
Cups.

362
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,290
Bowl.

363
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,660
When you weren't around,

364
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:48,550
I inquired about the marriage custom in the Beast Realm.

365
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:52,930
These will be used after we get married.

366
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,560
I... I made them.

367
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,810
The dressing table is not yet done.

368
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:11,870
Dear, I will settle down here in the Beast Realm.

369
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:17,390
I'll make you the happiest bride in the world.

370
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,590
Fiery,

371
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:28,050
thank you.

372
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:43,530
<i>I'm touched and heartbroken. Have I really fallen in love with the three of them,</i>

373
00:24:43,530 --> 00:24:46,150
<i>including Heartless Shaodian?</i>

374
00:24:46,150 --> 00:24:48,230
<i>There are four of them in total?</i>

375
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,050
Oh no. Something bad happens.

376
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:52,840
- It's really bad.
- What do you mean?

377
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,180
Sister Qingkui is missing.

378
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:57,620
- What did you say?
- Qingkui is missing.

379
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,720
I couldn't find her.

380
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,590
Man Man, is there any news?

381
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,980
No.

382
00:25:10,670 --> 00:25:13,590
I heard the Void Army has withdrawn from the Beast Realm for no reason lately.

383
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:16,990
I wonder if these two matters are interrelated.

384
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:19,220
We're screwed. She acted on her own again.

385
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,770
Sister-in-law,

386
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:25,960
if Princess Yetan is really with the Void Empress, then, there's only one way to get her back now.

387
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,090
What is it?

388
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:30,110
Revive Youqin.

389
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:35,980
Sister!

390
00:26:08,090 --> 00:26:09,770
How is he?

391
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:16,320
Fortunately, Princess Yetan has tried to slow the onset of the snake venom.

392
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,040
So we can use power to barely keep him alive.

393
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:26,460
However, healing him is beyond our reach.

394
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,220
I'm afraid

395
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,020
he'll lose his powers forever and live like a mortal.

396
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:36,420
Thank you, Your Highness.

397
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:43,020
I didn't expect that it was Princess Yetan and the Void Patrol who saved us once again.

398
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:52,490
Chaofeng is one of the voidwalkers, but he cares a lot about Princess Yetan.

399
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,760
Let's go.

400
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,530
Sister,

401
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:20,600
he was the one who swapped the carriages and also your savior.

402
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:24,450
The entanglement between you and him is hard to untangle.

403
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:32,360
It broke my heart not because he switched the carriages

404
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:37,380
but because he told me that he never loved me. That he was just using me.

405
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:40,630
I suspected him

406
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:47,380
until he came to Yuewo Village to rescue me while the venom was taking effect.

407
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,490
Only then did I realize his love.

408
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,490
That was when I felt reassured.

409
00:27:53,490 --> 00:27:55,620
You forgave him?

410
00:27:56,230 --> 00:28:00,200
Rather than forgiving him, actually,

411
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,790
in my mind, our lives have been bounded together.

412
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:12,720
No matter what, I won't leave him alone.

413
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:17,750
Now that he has lost his powers, he can no longer return to the Void.

414
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,160
If he wants,

415
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:27,130
I'd like to spend the rest of my life with him at a quiet place without caring about the world.

416
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,350
Tan'er, do your thing.

417
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:43,850
I'll dress his wounds.

418
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,330
Sure.

419
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,660
Sister-in-law.

420
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,920
Sister-in-law. Now that Chaofeng is severely injured, we can no longer expect internal fighting in the Void.

421
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,290
We should revive Eldest Brother as soon as possible. You finally gathered the soul shards.

422
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,950
It must be tiring. Why don't you stay here and get some rest?

423
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:20,500
Ziwu and I will split up and explain everything to the soul shards.

424
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,460
Don't tell them first.

425
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:25,080
I haven't figured out what to say.

426
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:28,860
The soul shards suffered from congenital deformities and got implicated.

427
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:33,060
They've had a rough life. Now that they finally can live freely.

428
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:37,360
If I tell them the truth, it's tantamount to putting an end to his hopes for the future.

429
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,780
By then, he'll return to the Heavenly Realm and become the most-treasured deity again.

430
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:44,400
A lot of shackles will be put on him again.

431
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:50,200
But, Sister-in-law, didn't we do all this just to revive Eldest Brother?

432
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,760
Sister-in-law,

433
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:55,980
are you going to give up?

434
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,470
No.

435
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:59,680
Give me some time.

436
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,450
Let me think about it.

437
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:03,240
But...

438
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,520
I'll come with you.

439
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,070
You stay here.

440
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,330
Leave me alone.

441
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,670
Didn't I tell you to leave me alone?

442
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:40,370
Tan'er.

443
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,810
Sister?

444
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,760
Man Man told me everything.

445
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,280
She asked me to talk some sense into you.

446
00:30:51,280 --> 00:30:56,870
Sister, do you think I'm acting silly?

447
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:01,120
If he returns, we won't have to be afraid of the Void Empress.

448
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,350
And you don't have to set foot in the dangerous place for me.

449
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,450
Everything will end well, won't it?

450
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,360
Silly girl,

451
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,520
if you could throw other's life away easily, that wouldn't be you anymore.

452
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:16,680
Xiao Mei, Fiery, and Young Master Wen Ren, three of them have different personalities.

453
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,800
But all of them are kind people.

454
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,330
You've known them for a long time, it makes sense that you can't let go of them.

455
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:25,140
What about Heartless Shaodian?

456
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,840
The soul shards are him, aren't they?

457
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,526
The soul shards are him.

458
00:31:33,526 --> 00:31:37,750
That means he's the one who's mad,

459
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:43,000
greedy, and lecherous.

460
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,950
<i>Here.</i>

461
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:53,250
<i>Yuexia,</i>

462
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:56,390
<i>this face of yours is really pretty.</i>

463
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:57,810
<i>Transform.</i>

464
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,570
<i>Liguang Qingkui!</i>

465
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,950
Sister, he's always been the one in my heart.

466
00:32:06,950 --> 00:32:08,810
I refuse to let him return to the Heavenly Realm

467
00:32:08,810 --> 00:32:12,410
because I don't want to see him suffer from the forbidden rule of love.

468
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:17,960
I want him to forgo the heavy burden and live his life freely.

469
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,280
But what about the Void Empress?

470
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,380
I don't want you to suffer because of me.

471
00:32:26,710 --> 00:32:29,270
And I don't want the soul shards to hide for their lives.

472
00:32:29,270 --> 00:32:35,950
Tan'er, as long as you made up your mind, no matter how hard it is, we can find a way to solve it.

473
00:32:35,950 --> 00:32:40,640
Whatever choice you make, you'll have my support.

474
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,830
Sister, give me some time.

475
00:32:44,830 --> 00:32:47,430
Let me think about it.

476
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:52,700
Sister-in-law is hesitating to combine the soul shards.

477
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,330
It looks like we can only take our chance.

478
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,790
Qingheng, what are you going to do?

479
00:32:57,790 --> 00:32:59,670
Let the three soul shards meet each other.

480
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:02,500
Then, tell them about their origin.

481
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:08,220
But if the soul shards are disappointed in Sister-in-law, what should we do with the revival of Eldest Brother?

482
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:13,180
If they really love Sister-in-law, they'll understand why she did all this.

00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:16,480
I hope Sister-in-law could understand our intention

484
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,700
and won't blame us for it.

Let's try another one.

499
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:00,240
Another one.

Sister-in-law.

00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,210
Sister-in-law!

507
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,950
What's wrong?

508
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:40,320
Sister-in-law, something bad happened.

509
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,240
Liu Rong and the others went after Eldest Brother again.

510
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:47,520
Yes, that's true. Sister-in-law, go and check on them.

511
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:49,780
Come on. Let's go.

512
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,300
Let's go.

513
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:56,080
- Come on.
- Let's go.

514
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:07,180
Wen Ren. Wen Ren.

515
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,790
Wen Ren.

516
00:36:08,790 --> 00:36:10,330
Yuexia.

517
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,400
- Yuexia.
- Wen Ren.

518
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,530
You're finally back.

519
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,490
You...

520
00:36:18,490 --> 00:36:20,200
Are you all right?

521
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,570
I'm fine.

522
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:25,310
Yuexia, I thought you wouldn't come back again.

523
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,800
Why would I do that?

524
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,560
I was afraid that you'd blame me.

525
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,560
I won't. I won't blame you.

526
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,950
I want to thank you.

527
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,690
For what?

528
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,560
After you left, I looked back to the days after I was born.

529
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:45,300
At that time,

530
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:48,360
I was always with the beauties and partied every night.

531
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,580
I never relied on anyone else.

532
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:53,110
And I would never let anyone rely on me either.

533
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:58,120
That time, I tried to use those to fulfill what my heart needed.

534
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,780
I thought that was the most dashing and comfortable life.

535
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:09,750
But that time, I felt more and more empty.

536
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,600
After being alienated by everyone, I spent my days with you.

537
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,230
<i>You gave me a sense of peace and satisfaction that I had never experienced before.</i>

538
00:37:18,230 --> 00:37:23,350
<i>And my inner heart has been warmed by the sprinkling of affection.</i>

539
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,780
<i>You know what?</i>

540
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,190
<i>That was the happiest time I've had since I was born.</i>

541
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,880
<i>I'm sorry, Yuexia.</i>

542
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:33,820
<i>For doubting you and blaming you because of the item.</i>

543
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:38,030
<i>But after you left, I recalled the days we spent together.</i>
<i>[Regret not having met earlier]</i>

544
00:37:38,030 --> 00:37:40,370
That was genuine.

545
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,920
Thank you for saying this.

546
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,330
It's me who should thank you.

547
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,410
I was going to look for you.

548
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:54,380
And I received your letter last night.

549
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:57,320
You said you were willing to celebrate your birthday with me.

550
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:59,530
I was so excited that I couldn't sleep last night.

551
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:00,960
Letter?

552
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,380
Yes.

553
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,280
Come.

554
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,530
Sit.

555
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:26,430
Yuexia, this is the Reunion Longevity Noodles I made for you.

556
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:33,530
It has the meaning of the deep affection between husband and wife.

557
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:38,030
Though you didn't say you love me,

558
00:38:44,670 --> 00:38:47,640
I've made up my mind.

559
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:52,620
Whatever your answer is, I've already fallen for you.

560
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:56,250
Starting today, I'll treat you better

561
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:01,760
and redouble my love for you until you fall for me.

562
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,520
Happy Birthday,

563
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,200
my Yuexia.

564
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:37,800
Qingheng and Ziwu tried to mend my relationship with Wen Ren.

565
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,350
But they didn't have to do this. They made me worry along the way.

566
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:47,220
Sir, why did you suddenly dye your hair red?

567
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,890
It's hot and eye-catching. Isn't it good?

568
00:39:49,890 --> 00:39:51,720
It's nice.

569
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,940
- Dear.
- Fiery.

570
00:39:56,430 --> 00:39:57,940
Dear, you're here.

571
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,840
What are you doing here?

572
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,380
Surprise.

573
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:06,000
It's noisy here. Let's talk in a quiet place.

574
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:16,180
<i>Heartless is here, too.</i>

575
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,450
<i>What's going on here?</i>

576
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:21,220
What's wrong?

577
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,630
Nothing, nothing.

578
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:25,430
It occurs to me that the room on the first floor is quite quiet here.

579
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,280
Let's get a room on the first floor.

580
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,020
Go inside, hurry up.

581
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:34,330
The waiter is strange, he called me "Sir".

582
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,780
He... He's just trying to make all the guests feel at home.

583
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:40,800
So he calls everyone "Sir".

584
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,750
It's new out there.

585
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,170
You're amazing.

586
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,860
<i>I'm sorry, Fiery.</i>

587
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:49,180
<i>I can only lie to you for now.</i>

588
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,550
Dear, Dear!

589
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,310
<i>I got to send Xiao Mei back before he found Fiery.</i>

590
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,880
I'm having a stomachache.

591
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,880
I'll be right back.

592
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,840
Get a physician.

593
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,580
I'm fine. I'll be right back. Okay.

594
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:04,070
- Dear.
- Do not move. Sit down.

595
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:12,300
Sir, why did you dye your hair black again?

596
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:14,430
What are you talking about?

597
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:16,240
Nothing, nothing.

598
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:20,460
Youqing.

599
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,970
Money.

600
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,360
What are you doing here?

601
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,980
Didn't you ask me to come and celebrate your birthday?

602
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:30,500
I... <i>Qingheng, Ziwu, what are you guys up to?</i>

603
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,780
I heard you've got a room.

604
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,200
It's that way, right?

605
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,410
This way, here.

606
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,540
Sister-in-law is smart.

607
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:46,360
She remains calm in such a situation and has the three soul shards in different rooms.

608
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:50,460
Qingheng, if this goes on, I'm afraid it'll be hard to realize our plan.

609
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:51,780
The best-laid plans often go awry.

610
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,800
You and I just have to wait.

611
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,700
Wait, hold on.

612
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,860
I saw you coming out from the other room.

613
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:01,080
I went to take a look at that room.

614
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,080
I found it bad. So I switched to this room.

615
00:42:05,010 --> 00:42:08,560
Did Qingheng and Ziwu tell you that I was at the House of Colors?

616
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,880
Yes, Money. Today is your birthday.

617
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:13,120
But you didn't tell me.

618
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,980
Luckily, Qingheng and Ziwu reminded me about it.

619
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:18,843
Don't worry. When I go back, I'll be sure to...
