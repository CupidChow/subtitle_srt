<i>[Episode 34]</i>

21
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:51,600
<i>Stand aside and we shall spare you.</i>

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,420
<i>The Ganoderma Vein is connected to the souls of the people of Dongqiu.</i>

23
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:02,420
<i>Without the sacred tree, the people of Dongqiu will die.</i>

24
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,760
<i>Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant, if you insist on destroying the sacred tree, then do it over our dead bodies.</i>

25
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,000
<i>We will sacrifice our blood to the spirit of the sacred tree!</i>

26
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,160
<i>- Chief!
- Chief!</i>

27
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,040
<i>Chief!</i>

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,940
<i>Kill them!</i>

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,480
Back then, our people guarded the Ganoderma Vein with their flesh.

30
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:23,660
Unfortunately, we were too weak.

31
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,080
We died at their hands.

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:31,000
But in the end, I still had a glimmer of hope.

33
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:06,940
<i>There's someone still here.</i>

34
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,000
<i>Souls?</i>

35
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,200
<i>I will leave a trace of your bloodline.</i>

36
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,060
What remained of my soul latched on to a coriander plant.

37
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,940
And that's how I survived.

38
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,800
When I was finally able to take on a human form again and returned to Dongqiu,

39
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,140
I discovered the remnants of the Ganoderma Vein.

40
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,980
As a member of the Five Spice clan, I became an immortal attendant in the Heavenly Realm

41
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:32,020
and tried to find the Soul-Gathering Lamp in hopes of reviving the souls of my deceased clan.

42
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:37,740
To my surprise, the remnants of the flower spirit of the Ganoderma Vein recognized you

43
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,580
in the Heavenly Realm.

44
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:44,640
You stood up for me and taught Biqiong a lesson.

45
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,160
<i>You let me stay in Tianpa Hall.</i>

46
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,720
<i>You don't know how happy I was.</i>

47
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,100
I realized I was finally not alone anymore.

48
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,120
How I wanted to tell you my name wasn't Husui but Suzhi so badly.

49
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,680
That we were both from Dongqiu.

50
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,960
We were family.

51
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,240
That's why you've been helping me.

52
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,860
I couldn't bear to see you suffer because of the Iridescent Eyes.

53
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,980
<i>So I helped you go to Mortal Realm to save Empyrean Xuanshang.</i>

54
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:15,220
<i>When the wrongful marriages were exposed, I knew you would not stay in the Heavenly Realm.</i>

55
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,700
So I followed you at all costs.

56
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:22,220
After that, I met Princess Qingkui.

57
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:24,880
She said I seemed familiar to her at first sight.

58
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,460
I was overwhelmed with emotions.

59
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:35,180
I may still be as weak as I was 10,000 years ago, but I will not stand idly by and let you two be hurt.

60
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:37,340
You sound so sanctimonious.

61
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:40,060
You knew they were the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein,

62
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,100
but you still made them reveal their powers.

63
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,180
What's your intention?

64
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:49,020
Could it be that you just want to use their powers to avenge Dongqiu?

65
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,020
It's true that I want to avenge Dongqiu.

66
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,540
But I can't do it alone.

67
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,680
My cultivation is weak.

68
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,780
There was no way I could do it.

69
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:03,440
They are both from Dongqiu.

70
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,480
But they have found love, and they hold no affection for Dongqiu.

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,060
They wouldn't work with me.

72
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,000
So what does it matter if I want to seek revenge?

73
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,840
I once thought that it might be better if they could never find out about all of this.

74
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,040
I'll endure the pain of losing my entire clan myself.

75
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:26,700
But now, their lives are in danger.

76
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:33,680
If I don't awaken their powers with the root, am I supposed to watch them die at the hands of the voidwalkers?

77
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,420
I can't believe it.

78
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:43,280
Not only am I a harbinger of calamity, but I am also the flower of destruction.

79
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,460
How capable I am.

80
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,800
Tan'er…

81
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:52,320
You have me with you now.

82
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,460
We'll share the burden together.

83
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,260
You must leave this place at once.

84
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,420
Zhu Duanshan recognized my Dongqiu magic.

85
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:06,180
The four realms will come together once again.

86
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,460
They will not allow the flower spirits to live.

87
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:14,500
We can prove to them that we mean no harm.

88
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,980
But how?

89
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,320
It has been so long since then.

90
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:22,140
My celestial father might not hold the same thought anymore.

91
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,740
Besides, the Heavenly Realm has always placed great importance on courtesy and righteousness.

92
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:29,620
As long as we can prove ourselves to him, my father will believe us.

93
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,280
All your brother did was be reborn with his desires, and the Heavenly Emperor is already so wary of him.

94
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,420
The flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein concern the fate of the four realms.

95
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,400
The Heavenly Emperor would rather kill an innocent than take chances.

96
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,020
He wouldn't give us a chance to explain ourselves.

97
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:47,300
How about this? All of you will stay here for now.

98
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,100
At least I have my Beast Soldiers to protect all of you.

99
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,280
Where we are no longer makes a difference.

100
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:56,920
Let's not cause any more trouble for the Prince's Mansion.

101
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,700
Let's go home.

102
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,480
Things have come this far.

103
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,860
No matter what you intend to do, I will be with you in life and death.

104
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,460
Man Man has left us,

105
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,500
but I will always be by Your Highnesses's side.

106
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,740
What happened?

107
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:56,380
Your Majesty, the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein have reappeared.

108
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,060
What?

109
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,800
I ran into Yetan and Qingkui in the Beast Realm.

110
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,840
I discovered that Yetan could take in turbid air.

111
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,400
Everyone in the four realms knows

112
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,100
that only the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein are capable of doing so.

113
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,140
Those two princesses are no mere mortals.

114
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:15,340
Your Majesty, you were merciful and spared Qingkui.

115
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:20,080
But your decision has no doubt left a grave risk for the four realms.

116
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:23,000
Forgive me, Your Majesty.

117
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:37,380
Your Majesty, legend has it that when the Twin Flower of the Ganoderma Vein is separated,

118
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,540
it absorbs pure air and turbid air.

119
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,260
Together, they open the Guixu and activate the Force of Chaos!

120
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:44,640
This is a serious matter.

121
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:49,420
- Alert all of the Void to seize those two women and kill them all.
- Yes.

122
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:53,180
Your Majesty, what about Third Prince?

123
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,220
Would I still care about that?

124
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,220
- Kill them!
- Yes.

125
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:02,620
But this matter concerns more than the Void.

126
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:06,380
Should we notify the other three realms?

127
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,760
Fine.

128
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,180
In the past, the Heavenly Emperor has always been in charge.

129
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:14,880
This time, the Void will be the one to make the arrangements regarding the four realms.

130
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,540
Invite the rulers of the other three realms to the Void.

131
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,020
Yes.

132
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:49,860
The Void Tyrant sent us a letter informing us of the resurgence of the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein.

133
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,260
How did you learn of this information?

134
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,960
My subordinate, General Zhulong,

135
00:11:55,960 --> 00:12:01,100
was nearly drained of all his turbid air by the power of the flower spirit of the Ganoderma Vein.

136
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,620
It is just as recorded in the ancient texts!

137
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:12,680
Ten millenniums years ago, the four late rulers came together to eliminate Dongqiu and destroy the flower spirits.

138
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:18,020
Now, after all these years, we've come together for the same purpose again.

139
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,020
This matter cannot be taken lightly.

140
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:24,040
Are you aware of the whereabouts of the flower spirits, Void Tyrant?

141
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,780
Well, all of us have seen them.

142
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:31,180
Have we?

143
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,480
What do you mean?

144
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:38,340
The Twin Flower from the Ganoderma Vein of Dongqiu is Emperor Tun's two daughters.

145
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,280
What?

146
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,040
Emperor Tun, are you still pretending?

147
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,480
Let me ask you something.

148
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,080
Why did you marry off the Twin Flower of Destruction to the two clans?

149
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,960
What is your intention?

150
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,620
That's impossible!

151
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,700
Void Tyrant, my empress gave birth to Tan'er and Kui'er.

152
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,480
Everyone in my palace can attest to that!

153
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,620
Void Tyrant,

154
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:08,360
why are you accusing my two children of such horrible crimes?

155
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:13,000
This is Liguang Yetan's doing.

156
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,940
How do you explain this?

157
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,020
Tan'er?

158
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:20,460
Then…

159
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:23,480
How could this be her doing?

160
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,260
The immortals have blessed the human race for thousands of years.

161
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:30,880
Emperor Tun, you are returning our kindness with ingratitude.

162
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,180
Heavenly Emperor, there must be a mistake!

163
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:34,860
There must be a misunderstanding.

164
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:40,760
The Void Tyrant may be ruthless, but he would not frame two mortal women with the matter of Dongqiu.

165
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:44,080
This... This can't be!

166
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,900
The human race wouldn't dare.

167
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,360
Even if they did, they are not capable of such a thing.

168
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,980
Beast King is right.

169
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,340
The human race would not dare to harbor the flower spirits of destruction,

170
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,480
much less oppose the immortals and the voidwalkers.

171
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:04,840
Enough.

172
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,260
The matter has come to this.

173
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:12,020
Our priority is to eliminate the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein.

174
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,000
Heavenly Emperor. Void Tyrant.

175
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,040
Your Majesty…

176
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:20,020
What will you…

177
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,120
What will you do to Tan'er and Kui'er?

178
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:26,060
The Twin Flower holds power to bring about the end of the world.

179
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:27,440
Naturally, they must be eliminated.

180
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,160
No!

181
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,420
Absolutely not!

182
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,440
Rest... Rest assured, Heavenly Emperor, Void Tyrant.

183
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,300
Emperor Tun will not spare the two princesses.

184
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:42,940
No… I meant… The demonesses of destruction.

185
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,180
We are faced with formidable enemies.

186
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:53,960
Would you be willing to follow in our ancestors' footsteps, put aside our differences for now,

187
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,020
so as to take on our enemies together?

188
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,340
Since you've shown such sincerity,

189
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,280
the Void would be willing to lead the four realms and work together

190
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,440
to destroy the flower spirits of destruction, of course.

191
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,920
Your Majesty…

192
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,540
All right.

193
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:18,260
I will not spare anyone who defends the flower spirits.

194
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:21,040
Not even my biological son will be an exception.

195
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,380
But Heavenly Emperor, as for your precious son…

196
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:29,300
If my son tries to defend them, I will deal with him myself.

197
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,400
I will not show him mercy.

198
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,720
Emperor Tun, the marriage between the immortals and the human race is no more as of this moment.

199
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:42,340
There will be no connection between Liguang Yetan and the Heavenly Realm henceforth.

200
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,920
This…

201
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:52,000
Indeed, you never forget to defend the reputation and honor of the immortals.

202
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,940
The immortals will not have a demoness as their Empyrean Consort.

203
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,420
Beast King, I heard Qingkui and Yetan are currently in the Beast Realm.

204
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,340
I knew nothing about that.

205
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,800
Nothing at all.

206
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,500
If both of you intend to go to war, the beastfolk will give our full support.

207
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,620
Good.

208
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:19,960
From this moment on, the four realms will join forces to take down those demonesses.

209
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:21,620
Wait!

210
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,140
What's the matter?

211
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:25,860
Do you have any objections, Emperor Tun?

212
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:28,320
No, not at all!

213
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,020
Do not act recklessly.

214
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:35,440
If we go against them, the entire human race will be decimated into dust.

215
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,880
There's no time to lose.

216
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:43,440
Let's prepare ourselves.

217
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:02,800
<i>What will happen to Kui'er and Tan'er now?</i>

218
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:12,100
Why is it you?

219
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,420
I've guarded the Guixu for a thousand years.

220
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:22,180
I would give up my life for the peace of the four realms!

221
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:25,340
But you're the flower spirit of the Ganoderma Vein.

222
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:28,400
You can open the Guixu. The irony of it all.

223
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,580
Don't blame me.

224
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:46,320
I will not allow Guixu to be opened again.

225
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:54,020
What's wrong?

226
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:55,920
Did you have a nightmare?

227
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,600
I dreamt that someone was trying to kill me.

228
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,200
Silly.

229
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,720
I remember Liguang Yetan said that she would only pay respect to Shaodian Youqin.

230
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,340
Right?

231
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:12,840
Since you did that, I will hold it up for you.

232
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,560
Even if we face an army of millions, I will not let any of them lay a finger on you.

233
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,760
You have nothing to worry about.

234
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,560
You're the hero of the world.

235
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,280
I'm the enemy of the world. In the future…

236
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:29,940
Our future will be the same as now.

237
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,080
We've been through so much together.

238
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,460
I know the kind of person you are.

239
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:42,420
Even if you had the power to open Guixu, you would never do it.

240
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,940
It's all right. Even if no one else in the world believes you, I will.

241
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,620
I will never leave you.

242
00:18:56,300 --> 00:19:01,340
Tan'er, you know even if there is an ominous astronomical sign, the world remains the same.

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:04,720
You and the four realms will be fine as well.

244
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,220
Sleep. I'll watch over you.

245
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,940
When I had nightmares as a child,

246
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,380
Man Man would hold my hand like this too.

247
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:29,400
I'll be here from now on.

248
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,960
Don't try to get me to leave.

249
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,820
I won't.

250
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,240
I just feel sorry for you.

251
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,960
You've endured so much for your consort mother's sake in the past.

252
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,520
Now, because of me, you're on the run and cannot return home.

253
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,260
Don't say things like that.

254
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,520
I'm your husband.

255
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,560
You should rely on me.

256
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:18,720
Sometimes, I wish you would be more selfish like Yetan.

257
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,100
At least I wouldn't worry as much.

258
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:27,540
I thought the four of us could live happily ever after just like this.

259
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,200
But who knew?

260
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,220
We'll take appropriate measures as the situation calls for.

261
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,260
Don't worry.

262
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:37,600
Old Fifth and I will not back down.

263
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,480
I know.

264
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,740
Has His Highness not returned yet?

265
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:51,400
Man Man's coffin should've just arrived at Mount Cangdan by now.

266
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:57,200
Di Lanjue said he would return after sending Man Man back to her homeland.

267
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,220
His Highness and Princess Yetan loved Man dearly.

268
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,660
They remind me of my late clan.

269
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,660
Suzhi,

270
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:15,040
you must hate the immortals.

271
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:22,240
Even if I do, I know that there is both evil and good in the four realms.

272
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,100
There are people that deserve to live.

273
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,380
Princess Ziwu, you should return to the Heavenly Realm.

274
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,680
I will not abandon my eldest brother and sister-in-law.

275
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:40,040
Maybe… Maybe nothing will happen tomorrow.

276
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:41,780
Maybe…

277
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:46,580
Maybe Zhu Duanshan didn't even recognize you and my sister-in-law's powers.

278
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:48,180
That could be true, right?

279
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,800
I hope so.

280
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,200
Suzhi…

281
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm sorry.

282
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,900
Di Lanjue must be back.

283
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,300
Beast King.

284
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,200
Princess Ziwu.

285
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,800
How did you know I was…

286
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,900
Actually, I knew who you were from the start.

287
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,800
Don't bother, Princess Ziwu.

288
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,600
I've apprehended Di Lanjue.

289
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:48,200
So you already know it, Beast King?

290
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,200
All of the four realms have been made aware.

291
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:58,200
Your Beast Soldiers are no match for Xuanshang and me.

292
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,800
I would not overestimate my capabilities.

293
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:08,100
I came to tell you that the Beast Realm cannot hide you all any longer.

294
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:14,800
I promised Di Lanjue I would not expose your whereabouts to the Heavenly Emperor and the Void Tyrant.

295
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:17,800
So I never saw any of you today.

296
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:23,600
And please do not say a word about meeting me to anyone else.

297
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:27,500
Please find your own way out.

298
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:31,400
However, Ziwu is my future daughter-in-law.

299
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,600
She will come with me.

300
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:35,600
No. I will stay.

301
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,100
I will stay to protect my eldest brother and sister-in-law.

302
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:42,100
Ziwu, I appreciate the thought.

303
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,600
You and Di Lanjue should live a happy and peaceful life.

304
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,000
Do not follow us through the storm.

305
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,300
Ziwu, go back.

306
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:55,100
You won't be able to protect me even if you stay.

307
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,600
Your sister-in-law and I will need to walk this path ourselves.

308
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,600
Eldest Brother...

309
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,400
There, there.

310
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,200
Celestial Father loves you the most.

311
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:12,000
You might even be able to plea for mercy on our behalf when you go back.

312
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,300
Really?

313
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:18,300
Yes. When have I ever lied to you?

314
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,800
I will get Celestial Father to change his mind.

315
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,600
Ziwu, take good care of Celestial Mother for me.

316
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,800
Tell her that if she sees the Evening Star shining,

317
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,500
that is me paying my respects to her.

318
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,400
Take care.

319
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,000
Take care.

320
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:19,500
Our best course of action now is to head to the White Bamboo Valley.

321
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,200
No. It's different this time.

322
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,800
The four realms will turn the White Bamboo Valley upside down to find us.

323
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,300
Where else can we go?

324
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,600
Let's get out of here first.

325
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:34,600
I'll pack our things.

326
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:40,900
The four realms are vast, but there's not even a place for us.

327
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:44,200
It's all right.

328
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,800
It's fine.

329
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,700
Let me go!

330
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,900
Let me out of here!

331
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,000
Impudent son!

332
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,800
I locked you up for your own good.

333
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,600
Ziwu.

334
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,300
Di Lanjue.

335
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:18,500
Beast King, Beast Queen, please let Di Lanjue go. Please? I'm begging you.

336
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,600
Princess Ziwu, do not blame us for being hard-hearted.

337
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,200
The situation in the four realms is treacherous and unpredictable.

338
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,600
My son is impulsive and reckless.

339
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:30,300
I do not want him to get involved in this mess.

340
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,400
That's right.

341
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,300
We just lost Man Man.

342
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,400
I shudder to think about what else could happen.

343
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,400
If something happens to my son, too, I don't think I can bear it.

344
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,700
Royal Father… Sister Hua…

345
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:46,700
You guys should know that despite Tan Tan's mischievousness, she has no desire to destroy the world!

346
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:48,700
Her sister is kind.

347
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,200
She is even less likely to do that…

348
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,600
It doesn't matter whether we understand that.

349
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,000
What matters is what the Heavenly Emperor and Void Tyrant think!

350
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:01,600
The beastfolk and the human race have no say in this regard!

351
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Royal Father, I...

352
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:04,100
Di Lanjue.

353
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,300
Stop trying.

354
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,900
His Majesty and Her Majesty have done the best they can by letting them go.

355
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,900
Leave the rest to me.

356
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,500
I'll return to the Heavenly Realm at once to get my father to withdraw his orders.

357
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:26,600
No matter what happens, I will try my best.

358
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:30,500
I advise you not to waste your efforts, Princess Ziwu.

359
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,800
He is the Heavenly Emperor of the immortals.

360
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,500
He cannot overturn his decision overnight.

361
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:41,100
It would be better for you to stay in the Beast Realm to be safe.

362
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,600
Ziwu, go on.

363
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,700
No matter what, we have to try.

364
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,200
I'll be fine.

365
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
Don't worry about me.

366
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,800
Celestial Father, I know my sister-in-law…

367
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:28,000
Qingheng, I'll tell you this today.

368
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
I have dissolved the marriage with the human race.

369
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:34,600
Liguang Yetan no longer has anything to do with the Heavenly Realm.

370
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,400
Do not call her your sister-in-law any longer.

371
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,600
Liguang Yetan is not someone who will destroy the world!

372
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,800
Why must we kill her?

373
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,500
Your Majesty, in view of her previous actions,

374
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:47,600
it would not be a surprise even if she does become one that would end the world.

375
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:54,000
Even if she does not harbor such ill intent, there are others in the four realms that seek to do evil.

376
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:58,700
It would be bad for us if she is manipulated by someone of ill-nature.

377
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,700
Yetan is clever, and Qingkui is intelligent.

378
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,200
They would not let themselves be used!

379
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,000
Besides, 10,000 years ago, the four realms slaughtered the entire Dongqiu clan

380
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,200
and destroyed their sacred tree in the name of eradicating harm.

381
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
That was already a most unrighteous act!

382
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,200
Are we going to kill them again?

383
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,900
Who taught you all this nonsense?

384
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,700
I... What I meant was…

385
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:23,100
A noble man that acts dishonorably is no different than a villain who wreaks havoc.

386
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,000
You've only been acting as an Empyrean for such a short amount of time.

387
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,900
Yet you dare to question the late heavenly emperor's conduct in the Ninth Heaven Hall.

388
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,400
If it had not been for the late heavenly emperor's decision,

389
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,900
the Heavenly Realm would not be the head of the four realms today.

390
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,600
- I…
- Enough!

391
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,500
You will repent before the late heavenly emperor's spirit tablet for three days.

392
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,900
You are dismissed.

393
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,200
General Guangtian.

394
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,400
Erlang Deity.

395
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,400
General Golden Armor.

396
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,500
<i>- Yes.
- Yes.</i>

397
00:29:57,500 --> 00:29:58,900
Report from the Beast Realm.

398
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:02,000
The demonesses have left the Beast Realm. Their whereabouts are currently unknown.

399
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,100
The three of you will lead troops of 3,000 soldiers each to find them in the Mortal Realm.

400
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,200
- Yes.
- Yes.

401
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,400
Wait.

402
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,900
Allow me to ask a question before we send out the troops.

403
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:18,000
Who among us in this hall can confirm

404
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,400
that Qingkui and Yetan are the flower spirits of the Ganoderma Vein?

405
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,000
How can we prove that?

406
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,000
No idea.

407
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,100
In that case,

408
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:33,900
we might kill the wrong people, wouldn't we?

409
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,700
We only have the Void Tyrant's word that claimed Qingkui and Yetan are the flower spirits of that tree of destruction.

410
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:42,600
Has anyone in Heavenly Realm ever seen it in person?

411
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,500
I've never seen it.

412
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,200
No one has seen it with their own eyes, right?

413
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:50,300
Immortals and voidwalkers have been feuding for thousands of years.

414
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,600
This could be a conspiracy by the Void.

415
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,000
Reverend Masters.

416
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:59,100
You are incomplete without your fourth, indeed.

417
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:02,300
It is clear that you miss Yetan very much.

418
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,200
It is one thing for Qingheng not to know any better.

419
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:09,200
But for the three of you to act with bias as well?

420
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,600
I respect your integrity and reputation.

421
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:17,000
I've always treated you with courtesy and sincerity.

422
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
But this matter concerns the fate of the four realms.

423
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,900
Once Guixu is opened,

424
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:26,900
the four realms will fall into chaos.

425
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,200
If that does happen,

426
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,000
who among you will take responsibility?

427
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:40,100
The safety of the four realms is not a trivial matter!

428
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:45,700
We cannot be sure if they are flower spirits yet.

429
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,200
But we know for sure

430
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,500
that the four realms cannot afford the consequences of making the mistake of letting them go!

431
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:52,000
I will set out at once.

432
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,300
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

433
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,600
I will eliminate the flower spirits and protect the peace of the four realms.

434
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,900
Good.

435
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:04,900
All three generals will be carrying the glory of the immortals

436
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:07,600
on your shoulders.

437
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,500
I will eliminate the flower spirits before the Void does and show them the power of the immortals!

438
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,800
Understood.

439
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,800
Erlang Deity!

440
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:38,500
Erlang Deity, where are you going?

441
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,000
His Majesty has given orders.

442
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,900
We are heading to the Mortal Realm to apprehend the two princesses of Liguang.

443
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,600
Wait.

444
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,200
I'll persuade my father to withdraw his orders.

445
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,600
Do not bother, Your Highness.

446
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,200
His Majesty's mind is made up.

447
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:53,600
Earlier, Immortal Qingheng and the three Reverend Masters
tried to plead for mercy.

448
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,800
His Majesty was enraged.

449
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,800
Tell His Majesty to withdraw his orders.

450
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,400
If His Majesty refuses,

451
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:18,800
I will kneel outside the Ninth Heaven Hall until he does.

452
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,300
Go!

453
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,500
Yes.

454
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,400
Your Majesty, Princess Ziwu is kneeling outside the hall.

455
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:32,300
She says…

456
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:37,400
She says she will not get up until Your Majesty would withdraw your orders.

457
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,800
I've spoiled her rotten.

458
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,000
Let her kneel.

459
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,500
Yes.

460
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:53,600
The immortals in the Heavenly Realm have claimed to be the head of the four realms

461
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,800
by the virtue of their repairing the Guixu.

462
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:01,500
This time, we cannot let them claim credit for eradicating the flower spirits.

463
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:07,200
In the future, I want the humans' temples to be dedicated to the Devil of the Void!

464
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,600
Yes.

465
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
- Royal Father…
- Your Majesty.

466
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,800
Princess Qingkui once healed countless Void soldiers.

467
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,200
If we kill her, we would be disregarding right and wrong.

468
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,500
That would make us no different from those hypocrites in the Heavenly Realm!

469
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,600
Wu Yun!

470
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,900
There is no place for you to speak when I speak.

471
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,000
All of you, find the flower spirits!

472
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,600
<i>Yes.</i>

473
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:51,700
Your Majesty, I know you can't bear it,

474
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:56,800
but Yetan is not just the bane of the human race.

475
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,800
She and Qingkui are the keys to the Guixu!

476
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,600
Your Majesty has raised them for 18 years.

477
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,800
But... But they were never part of the human race, to begin with.

478
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,700
They are Dongqiu descendants.

479
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:12,300
And they're not even human!

480
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,000
Guards!

481
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

482
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,200
Is Your Majesty tired?

483
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,200
Does Your Majesty require rest?

484
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,400
Throw Liguang Chiyao into the dungeons.

485
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,500
Your Majesty!

486
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:23,200
This… What is the meaning of this?

487
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:27,900
I took pity on you and reinstated you.

488
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,500
But you refuse to change your ways.

489
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,000
Listen up.

490
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,600
It doesn't matter whether they're harbingers of calamity or demonesses that will end the world,

491
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:37,000
I will protect them no matter what.

492
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:43,000
If I let myself be swayed and waver again, they would be disappointed in me for the rest of their lives.

493
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,000
I am your uncle!

494
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,000
I have served the court for three dynasties!

495
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,600
Hold on.

496
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:57,700
It is precisely because you are my uncle that I'm putting you in prison.

497
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,400
Otherwise, I would've killed you.

498
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,300
- Take him away!
- Yes.

499
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:04,500
Your Majesty!

500
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,500
You must not show mercy!

501
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:07,800
Your Majesty!

502
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:11,400
You must not show mercy, Your Majesty!

503
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,000
<i>[Snowfall]</i>

504
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,000
Consort Xue!

505
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,300
Shui'er.

506
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:16,200
How is it?

507
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:19,400
I couldn't find them. It seems they have fled the Beast Realm.

508
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,900
There is no place for them in the four realms.

509
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:24,100
Where could they go?

510
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,500
No. I must find them.

511
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,900
Wait, Consort Xue. The four realms are vast. Where will you go to find them?

512
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,500
Moreover, if you are caught by the voidwalkers,

513
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,800
it would be even easier for the Void Tyrant to use you against His Highness.

514
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:36,700
That's right.

515
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,900
Please calm down, Consort Xue.

516
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:41,300
Haichao, go and get more information.

517
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,200
I'll continue searching.

518
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,500
- Shui'er, look after Consort Xue.
- All right.

519
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:47,000
- I'm off.
- Be careful.

520
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,800
It'll be fine.

521
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,500
Silly girl.

522
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,300
Why must you do this?

523
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:08,300
Celestial Mother, Celestial Father is so cruel…

524
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,500
Come. Get up first.

525
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
Celestial Mother,

526
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,000
Celestial Father does not understand.

527
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:22,400
If he insists on doing so, then he is forcing eldest brother to stand against us.

528
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,200
Eldest Brother loves my sister-in-law with all his heart.

529
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:26,000
He has made up his mind.

530
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:30,100
Before I returned, he told me to relay this to you.

531
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:35,800
If you see the Evening Star shining, that is him paying his respects to you.

532
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,800
Youqin is prepared for us never to see each other again.

533
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,200
Get Qingheng.

534
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,000
We'll form a plan.

535
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:53,300
Celestial Mother.

536
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,600
You're finally back.

537
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,000
I heard all about it.

538
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:00,700
You were made to reflect on your actions for disobeying the Heavenly Emperor.

539
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:03,800
Celestial Mother, you must think I was wrong too.

540
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,300
I gathered both of you here because I've decided to take your side.

541
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:14,700
Regardless of what the four realms think of Yetan and what abnormal abilities she possesses,

542
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,800
to me, she is only Youqin's wife.

543
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,300
And a child of mine, just like both of you.

544
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,800
Celestial Mother is right.

545
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:24,600
Sister-in-law is our family.

546
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:28,800
If both Celestial Mother and Ziwu say so, then I have nothing to fear.

547
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,200
In the past, eldest brother always took care of Ziwu and me.

548
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:36,100
Now, the path ahead of them is dark and grim.

549
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:40,000
Let us be his stars and light his way this time.

550
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,200
His Majesty is determined to act as he wishes.

551
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,000
But so long as our hearts are united, we will surely find a way to help them.

552
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,200
Wangliang City is beyond the rule of the four realms.

553
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,800
We'll head to Wangliang City first and then make plans.

554
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:07,000
All along our way were wanted notices for us.

555
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,300
The four realms have made their moves.

556
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,400
You were the hero of the four realms.

557
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,400
You must be deeply disappointed now.

558
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,000
Even the beastfolk are after us.

559
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,800
Hearts are unpredictable indeed.

560
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,800
That is how the world works.

561
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:23,000
If you feel disappointed, that's because you expected too much from them.

562
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,700
You must be prepared.

563
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,900
The immortals will not show mercy.

564
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:29,400
And neither should you.

565
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
I'll get us more firewood.

566
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,700
Don't go too far.

567
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,300
Be careful.

568
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,500
Suzhi, is there really no way to remove the power of the flower spirits in Tan'er and me?

569
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,700
The flower spirits are your souls.

570
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:54,000
How could they be removed?

571
00:39:55,900 --> 00:40:01,000
Unless the two of you are separated by life and death.

572
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:09,400
When the base of the Twin Flower is damaged, the powers of the flower spirits will be lost.

573
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,800
Separated by life and death?

574
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:16,600
Tan'er and I have been able to sense each other's pain since we were children.

575
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:19,200
Shouldn't we live and die together?

576
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,600
Your flesh vessels are mortal.

577
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,800
There is no living and dying together to speak of.

578
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:28,300
You are able to sense each other's pain due to sharing the same flower base.

579
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:34,800
I know you two don't want to continue to run, but there is no other way.

580
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:56,300
Sister, what's on your mind?

581
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,000
Nothing.

582
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,600
It's all my fault.

583
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:06,300
I acted in the heat of the moment, and that put you two in this situation.

584
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:07,600
Don't say that.

585
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,200
We're a family now.
