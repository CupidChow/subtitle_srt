<i>[Zhuoxin Hall]</i>

21
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,380
This is Zhuoxin Hall.

22
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,840
Your Highness will be staying here in the future.

23
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,640
Your Highness, you're the Void Crown Princess.

24
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,120
Once the Void Crown Prince has been selected, you may only leave this place after the wedding.

25
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
My name is Sushui.

26
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,760
I'll be Your Highness's maidservant in the future.

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,860
Please instruct me if you need anything done.

28
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,080
Thank you.

29
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,820
I have a question.

30
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,680
Have any other mortals excluding me been here before?

31
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,900
No. Your Highness, you're the only mortal who's daring enough to venture into the Void.

32
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,520
Your Highness, please.

33
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:43,440
<i> Tan, where exactly did you go?</i>

34
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,160
Your Highness, please get changed.

35
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:56,280
Void Empress has prepared a welcoming feast for you.

36
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,240
Later...

37
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:02,880
Your Highness, do you possess the most elegant fragrance in the Human Realm,

38
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,520
which is the Ninth Heaven Sandalwood Fragrance?

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,960
You know that too?

40
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,580
If you like it, I can give you some.

41
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,460
No, Your Highness. Please don't harm me.

42
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,500
Pretentious things like fragrances are forbidden in the Void Realm.

43
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,600
Void Tyrant and the Empress don't like them either.

44
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
Your Highness, please refrain from using them.

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,400
If so, the smell I have now...

46
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,720
Your Highness, don't worry.

47
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,660
We will get rid of the smell for you right now.

48
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:29,100
We'll make sure you smell normal when you meet His Majesty.

49
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,840
Thank you.

50
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,500
So, it's just a normal bath.

51
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,740
I thought you guys prepared something special.

52
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,160
Your Highness, please get undressed.

53
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:53,340
Don't worry. They will control their strength.

54
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,060
Strength?

55
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,380
Must you guys do this?

56
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:06,620
Your Highness, we call this back-rubbing.

57
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,800
It can get rid of the smell on a human's body effectively.

58
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:11,740
Later, you'll feel like you've been reborn.

59
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,720
This is one of the greatest enjoyments in the Void Realm.

60
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,720
Enjoyment?

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,520
Put your back into it. Let's get rid of that fragrance.

62
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,240
All right. Add more salt to it.

63
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:25,320
<i>Tan’er, where are you? Why aren't you here yet?</i>

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,260
Put your back into it!

65
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
<i>I'm in the Void Realm.</i>

66
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,340
<i>Could it be that Tan went to the Heavenly Realm?</i>

67
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:35,840
- And this side too.
- Okay.

68
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,840
Princess Qingkui, where are you going?

69
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,060
Excuse me...

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,220
<i>[Guangtian]</i>

71
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,660
General Cremation.

72
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,640
Your Highness, can you not call me that?

73
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,700
If so, I'll call you General Tortoise?

74
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,520
It doesn't sound too polite either.

75
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,080
But if you don't mind, we'll call you that.

76
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,320
My name is Guangtian!

77
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,780
So, you're General Guangtian?

78
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,760
Hey. It's my first visit to the Heavenly Realm.

79
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,780
I wish to take a look around and witness its heavenly glory.

80
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:43,100
General, can you please let me pass?

81
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,420
The Empyrean has given us orders.

82
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,900
Your Highness, please remain within Tianpa Hall before the dinner banquet.

83
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,220
Do not simply move around.

84
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,600
We'll be back before the dinner banquet.

85
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,120
We'll be quick. Let's go!

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,460
Fine, we'll stay. We'll stay.

87
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,040
You have to descend to the Beast Realm, contact Di Lanjue,

88
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:09,480
and inquire about Qingkui's whereabouts from him.

89
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,180
Understood.

90
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:14,880
I...

91
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,500
He...

92
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,480
She's not attending the dinner banquet. Why are you stopping her?

93
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,800
That's right.

94
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:25,880
The Empyrean hopes that your friend from the Beast Realm can stay together with you.

95
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,560
That darned Xuanshang, he kept his guard against me.

96
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:44,100
Wouldn't you be on your guard if you have a wife who puts a bounty on your head and has friends

97
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:48,300
from the Beast Realm who try to steal her from you when you receive her?

98
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:49,440
Who are you siding with?

99
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,600
I'm saying that we should try something else.

100
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
You're so petty.

101
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:01,580
Your Highness, your banquet dress is ready.

102
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,440
Can we help you with your makeup now?

103
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:16,060
<i>I've been living for over a decade.</i>

104
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,520
<i>This is my first time being meticulously treated as such.</i>

105
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,420
<i>This headband is so soft.</i>

106
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:32,680
<i>It's just like the wings of a dragonfly.</i>

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,280
<i>I'll take it with me when I leave.</i>

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,920
Your Highness?

109
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,720
What's the matter? Do I not look good in this?

110
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,500
Of course, you do. Your Highness, you're the prettiest no matter how you doll yourself up.

111
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,060
Your Highness is really creative.

112
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,980
Lesser immortals like us can never think of something this creative.

113
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:57,000
Creative? Well...

114
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,520
What do you all use this for?

115
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,980
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

116
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,520
Look, His Highnes's here.

117
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:21,820
All female deities came here to congratulate you when they heard about your wedding.

118
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,420
I can see why.

119
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,280
Eldest Brother, you and Qingkui are a perfect match.

120
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,380
It's been a long time since the immortals gathered around like this.

121
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,920
But she might cause a scene here.

122
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,400
Eldest Brother, what did you say?

123
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,920
Nothing.

124
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:39,920
Greetings, Masters.

125
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,680
I must be mistaken.

126
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,020
Isn't she wearing a garter on her head?

127
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,200
Shut up if you don't know anything.

128
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,700
I'm sure that's the latest trend in the Human Realm.

129
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,440
<i>Why is she wearing a garter on her head?</i>

130
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,900
<i>Is she trying to embarrass me on purpose?</i>

131
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,380
<i>What are you staring at?</i>

132
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,700
<i>I didn't doll myself up to get married to you.</i>

133
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,980
<i>I have to marry a person like her?</i>

134
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,420
<i>I would rather train in seclusion in the Land of Mystery.</i>

135
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:55,760
<i>You're still staring at me?</i>

136
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,880
<i>I knew I was charming.</i>

137
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:01,280
<i>I captivated him without lifting a finger.</i>

138
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,940
Do you know what you're wearing on your head?

139
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
It's a garter.

140
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:05,620
If so, why are you still wearing it?

141
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:07,440
Because it looks nice.

142
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:15,680
Ever since Youqin came back, he didn't like to converse with people.

143
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,520
But it's as if he can converse with Sister-in-law without any issues.

144
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,820
This is what we call love at first sight.

145
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,960
Didn't you realize that Eldest Brother cross the Marriage Bridge in advance?

146
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,580
Today's my first time seeing Sister-in-law.

147
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:29,280
I can tell that she's different from the rest.

148
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,400
To tie her hair with a garter?

149
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,260
That means Sister-in-law is definitely not someone ordinary.

150
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,660
It's no wonder Eldest Brother treats her differently.

151
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:38,840
Look at Eldest Brother.

152
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:41,520
He's staring at Sister-in-law all the time.

153
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,120
I wonder when I'll encounter a mate as infatuated as him?

154
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,040
You?

155
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,840
Remove it immediately.

156
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,320
You're making yourself a subject for ridicule.

157
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,960
Aren't you afraid that people might gossip about you?

158
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,660
Why should I care about other people's opinions?

159
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,720
You...

160
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,160
The Heavenly Emperor and Empress have arrived!

161
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,200
Greetings, Heavenly Emperor, Heavenly Empress.

162
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:34,600
Princess Qingkui, you're different from what we had heard.

163
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:39,100
I suppose this is your first time wearing an immortal's outfit.

164
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,400
Your hair accessory is very unique.

165
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,600
Your Highness, do you like it as well?

166
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,700
I knew Your Highness had great taste.

167
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,800
You're unlike that dumb and old-fashioned fool.

168
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:51,000
If you like it, I'll make one for you tomorrow.

169
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,300
Since everyone is here, you all may take your seats.

170
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,000
<i>The Heavenly Emperor looks fierce.</i>

171
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
<i>I feel a little scared.</i>

172
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,900
I heard that something happened when you were receiving your bride.

173
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,000
Were you hurt?

174
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,000
I'm fine.

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,800
Shaodian Youqin, why were you so cold to her?

176
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,300
Your mother was concerned about you.

177
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,700
But you didn't even let her touch your hands.

178
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:31,600
Are you heartless?

179
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,200
Why don't I call you Heartless Shaodian then?

180
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,900
This has nothing to do with you.

181
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,300
Fine then.

182
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:40,500
Princess Qingkui, the trip to the Heavenly Realm must be a long one.

183
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,100
Heavenly Empress has prepared this welcoming feast in order to celebrate your presence.

184
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,300
Princess Qingkui, we shall hold your wedding ceremony

185
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:53,000
with Youqin after you get used to life in the Heavenly Realm.

186
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,100
Since this is our first encounter, Princess Qingkui, I've prepared this banquet for you.

187
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,800
The rest of you can bask in her glory and enjoy the banquet together.

188
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,500
Let the banquet begin.

189
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:25,400
Princess Qingkui, please.

190
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,500
Is this even fit for human consumption?

191
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:56,700
If we take human food, we will fall sick.

192
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:59,200
Immortals abstain from food.

193
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,700
We only consume pure air.

194
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,400
This is...

195
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:04,500
Your Highness, you may not know, but this is top-quality pure air.

196
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,000
Mother sent her men to Northwest Heaven to collect such air.

197
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,200
It's much more precious than the heavenly peaches.

198
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,500
We're just smelling some air, aren't we?

199
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,200
Won't you all starve to death?

200
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,400
Immortals do not consume food.

201
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:23,000
We consume air and dew to harness cloud energy so that we can fly around the Four Seas.

202
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:26,100
You have so many excuses for consuming air alone.

203
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:50,600
Princess Qingkui, not only can you replace your food source with this,

204
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,000
but it can also help you dispel any foul aura and help you cultivate an immortal body.

205
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,400
Princess Qingkui, do you feel unwell?

206
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
No.

207
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,100
Humans consume food usually.

208
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:11,800
That's why I feel a little off since this is my first time consuming pure air.

209
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,500
Your Majesties, sorry for disappointing you.

210
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:14,400
It doesn't matter.

211
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,800
I expected that to happen.

212
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,800
That's why I have prepare something else for you.

213
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Bring them here.

214
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,400
Mother is thoughtful indeed.

215
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,000
I'm sure Sister-in-law will like them.

216
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:46,400
<i>Why does it still taste cold to me?</i>

217
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,000
What do you think?

218
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,300
What are these?

219
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,700
These are illusions created by using pure air.

220
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:55,200
It resembles the food in the human world greatly.

221
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,800
Do you like them?

222
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,500
<i>Seems like I can't avoid consuming air.</i>

223
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
I do like them.

224
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,900
They relieve me from my homesickness.

225
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,000
They're delicious.

226
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Your Majesty, thank you for your kind intention.

227
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:15,200
<i>I want to leave the Heavenly Realm right now.</i>

228
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,400
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

229
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,800
Princess Yetan is just a mere human.

230
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,000
If I must say, she's not even worth setting up the welcoming banquet for.

231
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:11,300
However, both you and the Empress actually assigned some maidservants to her.

232
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:14,800
I assigned your maidservant, Sushui, to her in advance.

233
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,200
How do you plan to reward me?

234
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,400
The Empress's reach is getting longer.

235
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,600
Luckily, I have you.

236
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,300
You're used to lying low.

237
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:27,400
You do not act unless it's crucial to do so.

238
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,000
However, you're spending all of your efforts on her this time.

239
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:35,500
Could it be that there's something special about that human princess?

240
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,900
You don't need to know.

241
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,200
Princess Yetan has arrived.

242
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,200
Void Third Prince,

243
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,100
you can't stop yourself from staring at her.

244
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:44,000
Don't tell me you fell for that human princess?

245
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
How could that be?

246
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
You're the only woman I fancy.

247
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
I'm Liguang Yetan.

248
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:08,200
Greetings, Void Tyrant, Void Empress.

249
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:13,000
I hate the pretentious etiquette that the immortals practice.

250
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,400
Princess Yetan, since you've joined the Void,

251
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,000
you can forget about their pretentious etiquette.

252
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,200
Princess Yetan joined the Void not long ago.

253
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,200
She needs time to learn our customs.

254
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:27,000
Void Tyrant, why are you being so harsh on her?

255
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
Come.

256
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,300
Come to me.

257
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Don't be scared.

258
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:44,600
Come on, sit here.

259
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,200
Princess Yetan is the Void Crown Princess selected by me and the human emperor.

260
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:02,700
If any of you becomes the Crown Prince, you'll get to marry her.

261
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,100
I assume you don't know the princes yet.

262
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:13,000
Void Empress, please enlighten me.

263
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,300
That's the Void First Prince, Wudai.

264
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:19,600
Although he's young, he's brave and powerful.

265
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,200
He's the best warrior in the Void.

266
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,400
However, his mother passed away at an early age.

267
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,700
He only respects the Void Tyrant.

268
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Our clan proves ourselves with what we can do.

269
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:38,300
If you want me to listen to you, you have to defeat me first!

270
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,600
Excellent!

271
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,600
That's how the best warrior among the voidwalkers should speak.

272
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:51,500
Back then, I ascended the throne of Void Tyrant with a drive similar to his.

273
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,300
Wudai, receiving the bride must've been tough.

274
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,300
Why don't you have a toast with Princess Yetan?

275
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:04,400
I didn't bring her here to have a toast with me!

276
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:10,800
This is Void Second Prince, Dingyun.

277
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,500
He's my son.

278
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,000
He's a disobedient child.

279
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,200
That's why he can only help his father out.

280
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
He's inferior to his elder brother.

281
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,000
He won't amount to anything.

282
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Today is the welcoming banquet for Princess Yetan.

283
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,500
Second Prince, you should have a toast with Princess Yetan.

284
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,600
Lord Zhulong is considerate indeed.

285
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,100
Yun'er, propose a toast to Princess Yetan.

286
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,500
Royal Mother, since you've asked,

287
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,800
Princess Yetan, please.

288
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
Please.

289
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:12,660
Royal Father, Royal Mother, it seems like Princess Yetan despises me.

290
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:17,820
Blood liquor is a top-grade tonic in the Void Realm.

291
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:20,960
It boosts one's cultivation.

292
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,500
Princess Yetan.

293
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:32,260
Please.

294
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,420
That's sacred liquor to you!

295
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:04,980
Royal Mother, you're so biased.

296
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:10,000
You introduced my brothers without introducing me.

297
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,260
Second Brother.

298
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,520
You good-for-nothing, get out!

299
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,280
Royal Father, I forgot my manners after getting drunk.

300
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,780
Please forgive me.

301
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:41,760
You wasted some fine liquor there.

302
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,400
Beauty!

303
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,760
Where did you come from?

304
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,080
Princess Qingkui, don't panic. I'll protect you.

305
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,600
She's Princess Yetan!

306
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,020
The future crown princess.

307
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,060
Third Prince, you received her when she was coming.

308
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,440
How could you forget who she is?

309
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,000
Princess Yetan, I guess I was too drunk.

310
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,340
I couldn't tell it was you.

311
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,120
Royal Father, I deserve to be punished.

312
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,780
I deserve it! I deserve it!

313
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,740
I deserve it!

314
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:23,120
Scram!

315
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:26,400
Yes, Royal Father.

316
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,060
<i>He actually knows my identity?</i>

317
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:49,680
You're back? What delicious food did the Heavenly Empress...

318
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,760
This is... What have you eaten?

319
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,700
Listen, the dark cuisines here are terrifying!

320
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,620
I had to consume air together with them!

321
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,020
You didn't plan on becoming an immortal anyway.

322
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,100
Why did you consume so much pure air?

323
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,860
I threw up all the way. I'm starving. Find me some food.

324
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,460
You know that they don't consume food in the Heavenly Realm.

325
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,600
Where can I find you some food?

326
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,140
You do have a point.

327
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:18,080
But I see a bird in front of me.

328
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:24,400
- I'll start the stove and cook it!
- You just want food, right? Just leave it to me. Wait here.

329
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,040
I wonder how Qingkui is doing in the Void Realm?

330
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:43,180
Well, will her purest body be affected in that foulest hell?

331
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,200
Do you think you can hurt me with these needles?

332
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,220
You know that I'm not Yetan.

333
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,000
So you were the one who swapped the sedans.

334
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,880
You were the one who brought me here.

335
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,560
You and I bear no grudges against each other.

336
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,620
Why would I do so?

337
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:16,000
I wouldn't help you out just now if I wanted to harm you.

338
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,940
Princess Qingkui, calm down.

339
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,060
I'm here to tell you the truth.

340
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Actually, the person who swapped the sedans

341
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,820
was my second brother, Dingyun.

342
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,100
So, according to you, Tan'er was sent to the Heavenly Realm because she found out that Dingyun was trying

343
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:52,820
to assassinate the First Prince during the struggle to be the Void Crown Prince?

344
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,840
Dingyun is devious and cunning. For the sake of the throne,

345
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:59,120
he'll even resort to harming his elder brother. Yetan found out.

346
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,140
Right now, he sees her as a thorn in his eyes.

347
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,620
He'll definitely silence her.

348
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:06,340
Right now, you're the only person who can save her.

349
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,800
Me?

350
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:11,060
Come up with a way to tell Yetan not to descend into the Void Realm.

351
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:14,180
If not, her life will be in danger.

352
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:16,700
Third Prince, why are you trying to help us?

353
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,360
To be honest,

354
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,900
I heard that Princess Yetan was a big-hearted person.

355
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,800
She never adores immortals or despises voidwalkers.

356
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,800
I admire her very much.

357
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,400
Moreover, this happened because of my brothers.

358
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:32,260
I'm not willing to implicate her because of us.

359
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:35,200
Remember, you mustn't let anyone know about your true identity.

360
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,060
If not, Yetan will be implicated too.

361
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,100
Go now. Don't let anyone get suspicious.

362
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:55,380
<i>[Heavenly Garden]</i>

363
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,200
Celestial Father, why have you summoned me?

364
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:25,200
I heard that the Empyrean Consort was gracious and elegant.

365
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:29,780
But today, she has proven to be otherwise.

366
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:35,120
Seems like the human emperor was negligent in his duty when he raised his daughter.

367
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:39,620
You have to discipline her before the wedding ceremony.

368
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:43,340
Make sure that she's fit to be the Empyrean Consort

369
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:48,880
so that the immortals won't become a laughing stock.

370
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,860
Me? Disciplining her? Is there an issue with that?

371
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,760
Father, Princess Qingkui and I are not married yet.

372
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,180
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for me to discipline her in secret.

373
00:28:58,180 --> 00:29:00,620
You should...

374
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,560
We must not wash our dirty linen in public.

375
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,180
You're calm and collected.

376
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:08,880
I can rest at ease if I leave her under your care.

377
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,660
But...

378
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:15,340
Celestial Father, I will not disappoint you.

379
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:17,080
You're not doing it for my sake.

380
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,600
It's for your sake.

381
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:23,180
Wearing a garter on one's head, do not let things like that happen again.

382
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,720
Yes, Celestial Father.

383
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:33,960
Sir, you're getting better and better at lying.

384
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:36,820
Do you think the Princess will believe your ridiculous lie?

385
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:38,760
We swapped the sedans because we had no choice.

386
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:41,660
You're making up one lie after another.

387
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,680
Aren't you exhausted?

388
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:45,420
Not only does the Crown Princess concern the throne,

389
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,160
but she's also related to the power struggle of the Four Realms.

390
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,440
I can only use this fake princess
<i>[Chaofeng's Military Camp]</i>

391
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,040
to ascend the crown prince's throne if Qingkui stays here.

392
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:55,180
So you lied to her that Second Prince was the one who swapped the sedans

393
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,940
so that she would bear a grudge against him and side with us, right?

394
00:29:57,940 --> 00:29:59,340
Sir, let me ask you this then.

395
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:01,260
Have you eliminated First Prince?

396
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,640
But now, you're pitting yourself against Second Prince?

397
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,660
Why don't we eliminate your father tomorrow?

398
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,780
You can ascend the Void Tyrant's throne immediately.

399
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,480
Isn't it a great idea?

400
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:15,260
I already intended to frame Dingyun after I eliminated Wudai.

401
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:17,780
I'm killing two birds with one stone and getting rid of them once and for all.

402
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:22,140
Although Father dotes on Eldest Brother, he's a brute after all.

403
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:23,960
There's no need to fear him.

404
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
However, it's different for Dingyun.

405
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
He has the backing of the Void Empress.

406
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,860
Didn't you see how the Void Empress was trying to get on

407
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:33,260
the Crown Princess's good side during the banquet?

408
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:37,580
I can only achieve success if I get rid of Dingyun.

409
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:41,820
Sir, although that's the case, don't forget

410
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:43,760
that you're trying to manipulate Princess Qingkui here.

411
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:47,540
She's the Empyrean Consort. Do you think you can manipulate her as per your will?

412
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:51,560
Besides, there's no news regarding her sister, Yetan, in the Heavenly Realm yet.

413
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,600
- What if something...
- There are no "what ifs".

414
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,120
If we can hide this from everyone successfully, we'll get ourselves a crown princess for free.

415
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,800
If we fail to do so, we can send them to their deaths.

416
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,340
It's a win-win situation for us.

417
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,280
I assume you know how tight the security is.

418
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,980
I looked for food while hiding from the guards.

419
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,280
I went through half of the Heavenly Realm before I found this nut tree.

420
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,800
I took a thorough look at it.

421
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:16,300
Since it had roots, I was sure it wasn't an illusion formed by pure air.

422
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:18,220
Eat up.

423
00:31:19,060 --> 00:31:21,540
These nuts don't contain poison, right?

424
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:24,800
The Heavenly Realm is a righteous place. How could there be poison in these nuts?

425
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:35,240
How is it?

426
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,680
It's good!

427
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,480
So, we can have these on the road.

428
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:42,780
On the road? Are we leaving?

429
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,640
I can finally return to His Highness's side! Di Lanjue?

430
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:47,900
I couldn't care less about him.

431
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,700
- That means you're worried about Qingkui.
- Yeah.

432
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:59,020
I'm worried that she might ruin my plan when she's in the Void Realm. I have to meet up with her.

433
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,500
It's easy for you to say. You're in the Heavenly Realm.

434
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,880
You can't even escape from this place. How do you plan to meet up with her?

435
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,880
I'll use a messenger pigeon.

436
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:12,160
You're trying to use me again?

437
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,140
Mind you, I'm not a pigeon!

438
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,840
That hurts!

439
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,860
That hurts?

440
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:21,080
I have an idea!

441
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:25,480
How do you plan to meet up with her?

442
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,600
Have you forgotten?

443
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,620
Qingkui and I shared our sense of pain since young.

444
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:31,900
I'm sure she'll definitely sense it if I carve letters on my hand.

445
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,040
Are you doing it or not?

446
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:50,080
You didn't do anything to yourself.

447
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,400
What's with that expression? She's doing it!

448
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,760
<i>Are you there?</i>

449
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:13,400
You must be out of your mind! Just get straight to the point!

450
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,740
<i>Where are you?</i>

451
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,420
<i>I'm in the Void Realm.</i>

452
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:45,460
<i>Tomorrow, at Wangliang City.</i>

453
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:51,840
I've read so many books about the Void Realm.

454
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:56,020
It's my first time knowing that there are so many strokes to the character "Void"!

455
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,940
And this "Wangliang"...
<i>[Wangliang City]</i>

456
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:01,420
It hurts just looking at it.

457
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,060
If I do give birth in the future, I'll either call my child "One" or "Two".

458
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,080
No. I'll definitely call my child "One".

459
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:12,780
Tan'er, I'm sorry.

460
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,820
I know you're afraid of pain.

461
00:34:17,740 --> 00:34:19,360
<i>I have to notify Father.</i>

462
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:21,840
<i>He'll definitely come to our rescue.</i>

463
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,960
<i>Imperial Father, I, Qingkui, have gone against your teachings.</i>

464
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,540
<i>Our sedans got swapped during the bride-receiving day.</i>

465
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:37,060
<i>Now, I'm in the Void Realm.</i>

466
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:39,280
<i>I'm afraid my life is in danger.</i>

467
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:42,380
<i>My sister, Yetan, has been sent to the Heavenly Realm by mistake too.</i>

468
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:45,160
<i>I couldn't sleep or eat when I think about her.</i>

469
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,460
<i>This matter is related to the power struggle in the Void Realm.</i>

470
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,160
<i>I cannot do anything about it myself.</i>

471
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,780
<i>After thorough consideration, Imperial Father, seeking your help was the only way out for us.</i>

472
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,840
<i>Please announce the truth and help us to escape from our plights.</i>

473
00:34:57,840 --> 00:35:01,720
<i>Sorry for the hasty note. Please forgive me.</i>

474
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,160
<i>With regards, Qingkui.</i>

475
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:18,580
<i>Tan'er, I'll definitely get to the bottom of this and save you from the Heavenly Realm.</i>

476
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:31,380
<i> [Qinzheng Hall]</i>

477
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:36,820
<i>Princess Qingkui, please stop being stubborn.</i>

478
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,420
<i>His Majesty isn't willing to see you.</i>

479
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:41,020
<i>It won't help even if you kneel here all night long!</i>

480
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:44,900
<i>Back then, I did badly when I was learning the Heavenly Rules.</i>

481
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,700
<i>Senior Maidservant Li punished me severely.</i>

482
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:50,760
<i>Yetan only got into trouble because she stood up for me.</i>

483
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,840
<i>It's all my fault!</i>

484
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,680
<i>If Imperial Father isn't willing to see me, I'll kneel here until he changes his mind.
[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

485
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,880
<i>I'll try to plead with His Majesty again.</i>

486
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,720
<i>Here.</i>

487
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,420
<i>Do you admit your mistake?</i>

488
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,280
<i>I did nothing wrong!</i>

489
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,740
<i>Your Majesty, Princess Qingkui is kneeling in the rain to plead for Princess Yetan's sake.</i>

490
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:26,620
<i>Do you know that your elder sister is kneeling outside the hall to plead for you?</i>

491
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,020
<i>Do you still not yield?</i>

492
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,700
<i>I just need to admit my mistake, right? Fine.</i>

493
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:46,140
<i>You force me to bow and admit my mistakes hundreds of times per year anyway.</i>

494
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,880
<i>Doing it one more time doesn't matter to me!</i>

495
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:50,040
<i>You rascal.</i>

496
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,620
<i>Scram immediately.</i>

497
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:54,200
<i>I don't want to see your face!</i>

498
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:01,480
♫ <i>You say, "Light swept through the twin flowers"</i> ♫

499
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:08,540
♫ <i>Wandering at the desolate cliff</i> ♫

500
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:13,380
♫ <i>Whose face has the wind comfort again?</i> ♫

501
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,200
<i>Imperial Father didn't make things difficult for you, did he?</i>

502
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,900
♫ <i>The flying seabed sand</i> ♫

503
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,320
<i>I'm fine.</i>

504
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:21,360
<i>But you, you came here to put on a sentimental act.</i>

505
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,660
<i>Imperial Father reprimanded me again because of you.</i>

506
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,620
♫ <i>If only I can spend the sorrowful night with you</i> ♫

507
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:29,740
<i>I'm glad that you're fine. This is nothing to me.</i>

508
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:32,160
<i>All right. You should head back now.</i>

509
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:36,000
<i>If not, they'll reprimand you for being a subpar Empyrean Consort again.</i>

510
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,200
♫ <i>Hair being messed up by the misplaced time and space</i> ♫

511
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:44,680
♫ <i>No matter how tough it is, I'm not afraid</i> ♫

512
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:50,940
♫ <i>You are the crescent in my heart</i> ♫

513
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:57,740
♫ <i>My radiant light shining through the years</i> ♫

514
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:08,680
♫ <i>If I do shed tears, they will turn into flowers in my heart</i> ♫

515
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:19,100
I already told her to be careful and avoid hurting herself.

516
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,800
That hurts so much.

517
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:24,700
So you were hesitating because you were afraid that Qingkui might be hurt?

518
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,220
She always protected me since young.

519
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,220
She always tended to all my needs.

520
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,960
And she always pleaded for my sake whenever I got in trouble.

521
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,440
I just wanted to help her out this time.

522
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:37,040
But she ended up in the Void Realm because of me.

523
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,420
You shouldn't blame yourself for this.

524
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:42,440
It's harder to leave the Heavenly Realm than to enter it.

525
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,480
We can't even leave the Heavenly Realm.

526
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,120
How are we going to save Qingkui?

527
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:47,480
We have to save her no matter what.

528
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,100
She's silly and stubborn.

529
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:52,200
Who will save her if she gets into trouble down there?

530
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,140
No.

531
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,840
I need to go see Heartless Shaodian now.

532
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:57,700
Don't! You...

533
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,480
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

534
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,000
Penglai Hall?

535
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,840
So this is the legendary Penglai Hall.

536
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:13,360
I think I know the entire layout of the Heavenly Court after searching for food.

537
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,600
Why is it so hot in here?

538
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,600
Princess Qingkui?

539
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,440
Princess Qingkui, what are you doing here?

540
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,180
I...

541
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:26,120
I miss the Empyrean. I'm here to visit him.

542
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,280
Great timing.

543
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,240
His Highness said he had a gift for you.

544
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,260
He has been preparing it inside the hall after he came back.

545
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,780
He didn't even take a break.

546
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:34,260
Please check on him.

547
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:38,860
<i>Heartless Shaodian is preparing a gift for me?</i>

548
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,860
<i>Seems like he's in a good mood now.</i>

549
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,100
<i>Maybe I can persuade him to set me free.</i>

550
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,540
See you, then.

551
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,400
So these are the gifts you've prepared for me?

552
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,480
All these are copies of the Heavenly Rules?

553
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,320
Where did the Heavenly Realm get all these rules from?

554
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,560
Why would you wear a garter on your head and let people mock you if you knew about the Heavenly Rules?

555
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:08,780
These are the notes I've prepared for you.

556
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,980
Diligence is the means by which one makes up for one's dullness. You still have hope.

557
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,220
<i>You're the dull one here.</i>

558
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,620
<i>- Calm down. Don't forget your goal.</i>

559
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:21,020
Fine. I'll take my time to read them when I get back.

560
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,800
However, I came here because of another matter.

561
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,600
Your Highness, please allow me to leave this realm so that I can visit my relatives.

562
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,600
Look here.

563
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:38,380
According to Article 1,367 of the Heavenly Rules, you need a token before you can leave this realm.

564
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:44,900
What are you doing?

565
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:48,240
How could I leave the realm if you don't give me a token?

566
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,600
<i>What's going on?</i>

567
00:41:04,140 --> 00:41:06,660
<i>Why do I feel hot?</i>

568
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:07,960
<i>Why am I being captivated by him?</i>

569
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:11,000
The heavenly guards only acknowledge the owners of the token.

570
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,000
It cannot be used by people other than their owners.

571
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,460
It cannot be used by people other than their owners.

572
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,140
Look at your pretty face.

573
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:25,120
How could you look so handsome?

574
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,360
<i>Yetan, what's wrong with you?</i>

575
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,760
<i>What are you saying?</i>

576
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,580
I meant...

577
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:44,120
People say that the Empyrean is concerned about the Four Realms.

578
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,960
They say

579
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,360
that you love all beings!

580
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,520
Why don't you show me some love as well?

581
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:59,640
Do not try to flatter me with your silver tongue.

582
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:03,780
Do not try to flatter me with your silver tongue.

583
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,480
It's stated clearly within the Heavenly Rules.

584
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,880
The temporary token will only be allocated to you

585
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,920
once the officials of Shenxiao Jade Bureau confirmed your reason

586
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:13,460
for leaving the realm after you submit the official documents to them.

587
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:17,180
If so, that means I have to wait for some time.

588
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:20,220
- What's wrong with you?
- I...

589
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,260
I can no longer wait!

590
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,380
What did you eat?

591
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,640
Come on.

592
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,120
Did you consume Jianmu Fruit?

593
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,220
Your Highness!

594
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:40,780
Help me up.

595
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,860
Do you know this fruit is also known as the fruit of taboo?

596
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:47,920
It serves to aid immortal couples who wish to produce offspring.

597
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,940
Oh, no!

598
