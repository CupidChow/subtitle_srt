- Mine!

22
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,554
Stop running!

23
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,960
It smells like villains in here.

24
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,860
Why did you bring me here?

25
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,530
Don't tell me you want to rob them.

26
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:14,350
They're the Desert Dwellers! They'll rob you instead!

27
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:17,570
I'm trying to uphold justice here.

28
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:19,760
That's why I want them to stop their evil acts.

29
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,190
Wait.

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,350
You want them to stop their evil acts?

31
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:27,280
Listen. The Assassin Assembly Hall is nothing compared to them.

32
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,340
Even the Beast King needs to show them some respect.

33
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,880
He dare not attack them recklessly.

34
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,850
Our promise was to earn 5,000 gold within half a day.

35
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:36,640
Now, we have one hour left. Are you going to rob them?

36
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,810
You won't be able to keep your promise.

37
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:40,570
If I win, you better keep your promise.

38
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,600
Fine. You only have one hour.

39
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,560
Get out of the way.

40
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,740
Buddies, good job.

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,130
These are killer hornets!

42
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,500
Get out of the way!

43
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,090
Hurry!

44
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:41,650
There are so many demons and beasts here.

45
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,840
How could you rob them while staying untouched?

46
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:47,320
It's not like I'm going to meet them.

47
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,840
Just wait and see.

48
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,240
Where's Hulu?

49
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,600
Where's Hulu?

50
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:14,320
Why are you hiding there? Come here!

51
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,670
Come here!

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,010
You!

53
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,010
Why are you crying?

54
00:04:31,010 --> 00:04:34,260
Go and find the antidote! We need the Blood-Cooling Ointment!

55
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:37,910
Sir! Now that we're poisoned by the killer hornets,

56
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,970
we'll definitely die within one hour!

57
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:44,940
We'll die for sure!

58
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,450
We don't have much time!

59
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:49,250
What do you think?

60
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,470
We are in the desert.

61
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,010
Where did the killer hornets come from?

62
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,350
Is someone trying to harm us here?

63
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:59,010
Sir!

64
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:03,210
Sir! Sir!

65
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:05,960
The antidote...

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:08,740
Where is it? Where's the antidote?

67
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,970
It's over there!

68
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,640
Let's go!

69
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,910
Hurry! The antidote is over there!

70
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,810
Slow down!

71
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:25,840
The antidote is over there!

72
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,620
Hurry!

73
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,010
Go and take a look!

74
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:35,470
"Repent and be absolved of your crime?"

75
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:37,210
"100 gold for one bottle?"

76
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:38,500
"I pray for your health?"

77
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,110
It's done.

78
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,770
I knew it!

79
00:05:43,770 --> 00:05:45,880
Someone was out to harm us!

80
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,570
That's right!

81
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,340
When I find that person, I'm going to skin him alive!

82
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah! Skin him alive!

83
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,880
Hulu.

84
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:05,100
Hulu!

85
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,940
It's the Blood-Cooling Ointment!

86
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,210
Guys, smash them!

87
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:22,100
Smash them!

88
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,900
Sir! My ointment!

89
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,050
They're smashing your cabinets!

90
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:27,790
Give me more!

91
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,450
It's fine. It'll only last for a while.

92
00:06:30,450 --> 00:06:33,030
My Transfiguration Spell can last long enough.

93
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,690
Sir, look!

94
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:49,100
Look!

95
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,130
They're giving us money!

96
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,940
Where did you learn that from?

97
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,740
Teach me.

98
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,520
I learned it from the past you.

99
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,470
Stop joking around.

100
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,980
Fine. Even if they can't destroy the cabinets,

101
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,790
how do you intend to retrieve the money?

102
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:13,970
Don't tell me you'll carry all of them back.

103
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:15,770
Cut the crap already.

104
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,300
Just look.

105
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,600
Hurry!

106
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:24,200
Move them!

107
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:28,140
Hurry!

108
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:30,790
Drag them back!

109
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,150
- You're smart indeed.
<i>- One, two, three!</i>

110
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:36,310
He...

111
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,790
Our money!

112
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:49,640
Give us back our money!

113
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:53,500
Who exactly is behind this?

114
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,430
After them!

115
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,110
Hurry!

116
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:07,540
Let's find a safe place and collect our money.

117
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,810
How did you come up with this idea?

118
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,660
The Desert Dwellers always committed evil deeds.

119
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,400
However, no one could handle them.

120
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,100
Naturally, they wouldn't expect someone else to teach them a lesson in their territory.

121
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:21,870
Not only did you teach them a lesson, but they also had no idea who you are, so you are impressive.

122
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:23,260
I agree. Let's go.

123
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,600
Let's go.

124
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:31,670
I've never experienced such a thrill of making money ever since I was born.

125
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:33,840
In the future, I'll call you "Money."

126
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,120
Money, you're truly an intelligent money maker. I'm truly impressed.

127
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,190
I've kept my end of the bargain.

128
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,420
What about you?

129
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,430
We can talk this over.

130
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,210
<i>Money is an expert at making money.</i>

131
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,760
<i>If I agree to her request like this,</i>

132
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:52,920
<i>I'm afraid she'll stop working hard to make money for me as my wife.</i>

133
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:56,280
<i>No, I have to keep tantalizing her.</i>

134
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:03,520
Money, we need to work hard to make more money.

135
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,850
What about this? I promise you.

136
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:08,950
If you can get me one more bucket...

137
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,950
I mean, five more buckets of gold, I will be yours.

138
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,560
Five buckets of gold? Why don't you ask for ten instead?

139
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,400
Are you trying to pocket my pay like how you subdue your subordinates in the Assassin Assembly Hall?

140
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,660
You stingy man.

141
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:20,760
Listen, this is all you get.

142
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,490
If you don't love me with all your heart, I won't give you a single cent!

143
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:26,170
That hurts! Let go!

144
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:29,770
Do you love me or not? Do you love me or not?

145
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:34,210
Miss, I mean Fairy, you're putting me on the spot here.

146
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,790
True love is the hardest thing to afford in the world.

147
00:09:36,790 --> 00:09:38,640
You and I only got to know each other a few days ago.

148
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,100
How could I entrust my heart to you?

149
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,910
If you insist on getting that title...

150
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:44,710
What about this? From today onward, I'll be Romeo.

151
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:47,100
You can be my Juliet. Let's keep it at that for now.

152
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,520
However, as long as you pay me enough,

153
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:52,280
I'll definitely marry you and spend the rest of my life with you, okay?

154
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,140
Just you wait. I have ways to make you fall for me.

155
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,980
Fine.

156
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,820
<i>This guy only has eyes for money.</i>

157
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:03,110
<i>He has no idea what love is.</i>

158
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:07,480
<i>I have to think of a way to make him fall for me.</i>

159
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:10,800
Come with me.

160
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,580
Where are you bringing me?

161
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:14,100
There's no business around here.

162
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:17,360
This time of the year is the Beast Tribe's mating season.

163
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,960
Listen.

164
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:26,700
That's the mating call of a female frog.

165
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,180
Don't tell me you want to mate with me.

166
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:32,710
I brought you here to attend a wedding banquet.

167
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:34,930
A wedding banquet?

168
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:36,720
Fine. At least I can eat for free.

169
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,560
Let's go.

170
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,130
This is my gift to you.

171
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,420
Hurry!

172
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,980
This place is so lively.

173
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,270
Let's go!

174
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,530
We should join them.

175
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,000
Come.

176
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,920
Here, take this.

177
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,990
Go!

178
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,480
Let's sit here!

179
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,030
- Let's sit here.
<i>- Congratulations.</i>

180
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:04,390
<i>Congratulations. Congratulations.</i>

181
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,730
<i>Congratulations!</i>

182
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:10,300
<i>Congratulations! May you have a blissful marriage!</i>

183
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,440
The Peacock clan is known for its romantic nature.

184
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,230
Look, how happy they are.

185
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,830
So, money isn't the only thing

186
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,480
in the world, but also love.

187
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,000
You're right. Why didn't I think of that?

188
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,280
Do you wish to...

189
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:29,160
Come! Hurry!

190
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,940
Count us in!

191
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,580
Heartless, are you touched by this scene?

192
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,260
Do you wish to do it?

193
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:45,700
Let's get married.

194
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,770
You... Say that again?

195
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:51,010
I said, let's get married. Will you marry me?

196
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,470
You figured it out already?

197
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,470
There's no time better than the present.

198
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,940
We need to do it immediately. Let's get married.

199
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,220
This fast?

200
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,100
Congratulations.

201
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,400
Thank you.

202
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,700
I have a question. I don't know if I should bring it up.

203
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:11,260
Can you guys sell your used wedding gowns to me?

204
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,710
Well...

205
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:15,680
Can we get a lantern for free if we buy them from you?

206
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
It's not unreasonable, right?

207
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:20,100
Well...

208
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,190
It's the emergency signal!

209
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:45,570
It's the emergency signal!

210
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,420
What happened?

211
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,780
Hall Master! Hall Master!

212
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,630
It's been a long time since you issued an emergency signal.

213
00:12:57,630 --> 00:12:59,250
Is something huge going to happen?

214
00:12:59,250 --> 00:13:01,220
All right. I assume everyone's here.

215
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:02,630
There's something huge indeed.

216
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,530
Today's my wedding ceremony with Money.

217
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,870
Take your seats. The bride will arrive soon.

218
00:13:10,870 --> 00:13:12,690
Take your seats.

219
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:15,400
Wedding ceremony? He only got two lanterns.

220
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,030
He's so stingy. Yeah.

221
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,500
Hey, our hall master was always focused on his career.

222
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,640
He never said anything about getting married at all.

223
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,950
That girl actually made him fall for her this quickly.

224
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,110
She's truly something else.

225
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:31,100
Don't tell me it's the lady who always came to Hall Master.

226
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,200
She said this before.

227
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,100
If we help her win his heart, she'll give us a raise.

228
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,160
And we'll receive a commission if we complete a job.

229
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,270
Really? That's great.

230
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,830
I was planning to buy a house.

231
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:45,750
Look at Hall Master. Don't you think he looks like a bird?

232
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:49,510
He might have spent all of his money on his outfit.

233
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,880
♫ <i>I see a light in your starry eyes</i> ♫

234
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,560
♫ <i>The sound of the zither ringing</i> ♫

235
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,060
♫ <i>As I sing softly, you and I look at each other</i> ♫

236
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,560
♫ <i>There is an azure blue ocean over there</i> ♫

237
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,160
<i>When I was sent to the Heavenly Realm by mistake</i>

238
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,010
<i>and found out that I was going to be his consort,</i>

239
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,920
<i>I hated every second of it.</i>

240
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,990
<i>But for some reason, I'm looking forward to it this time.</i>

241
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,580
<i>Yetan, what's wrong with you?</i>

242
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:33,050
<i>Don't forget your duty here.</i>

243
00:14:33,050 --> 00:14:34,400
It's truly her.

244
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
We'll definitely get a raise for sure.

245
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,440
I never expected the bride to look so beautiful in a wedding dress.

246
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:40,990
♫ <i>It melts into unrestrained fireworks</i> ♫

247
00:14:40,990 --> 00:14:43,000
Hall Master, you're so lucky!

248
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,480
♫ <i>Gently flickering, illuminating the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

249
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,980
♫ <i>Gently flickering, illuminating the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

250
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:50,350
♫ <i>Protecting our promise regardless of the faults of fate</i> ♫

251
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:54,200
You're so beautiful.

252
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:58,940
Everyone, I would like to thank you all for attending my wedding.

253
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,010
Today's my wedding with Money.

254
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,600
I know you all have work to do.

255
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,980
We'll keep it simple.

256
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,470
The ceremony will be completed after we finish our nuptial wine.

257
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,480
<i>Great! Great!</i>

258
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,850
<i>Forget it.</i>

259
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:16,770
<i>It doesn't matter how simple the ceremony is as long as he truly loves me.</i>

260
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,620
<i>Drink up! Drink up!</i>

261
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,760
♫ <i>It was you</i> ♫

262
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,680
♫ <i>Who sweetened my parched heart</i> ♫

263
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,000
♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

264
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,950
Drink up!

265
00:15:33,890 --> 00:15:36,180
<i>Great!</i>

266
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:52,870
<i>Be together! Be together! Be together!</i>

267
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:55,830
Money, thank you.

268
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:59,680
I would've never thought of this if you didn't bring me to the wedding banquet.

269
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,160
You're my strategist.

270
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,930
- Money, will you...
- Yes, I do.

271
00:16:06,870 --> 00:16:08,750
Hold this for me.

272
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,160
Everyone, since today is my wedding with Money,

273
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,890
and now that we've gotten married, according to the formalities,

274
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:21,590
we need to receive gifts for our new house.

275
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,570
Why are you guys sitting down?

276
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:27,670
When it comes to gifts, the closer you are to me,

277
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:30,250
the more you have to show your sincerity.

278
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,890
Since all of you have joined me in battles for over a year,

279
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:36,220
I assume we're closer than blood relatives, right?

280
00:16:37,230 --> 00:16:39,110
Fine. None of you are making a move, huh?

281
00:16:39,110 --> 00:16:40,990
None of you will get a share from my next business deal.

282
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:43,180
Don't just sit there. Hurry up.

283
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:47,260
I'm referring to you. You have to be their role model.

284
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,930
Thank you, everyone.

285
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,000
Everyone, don't stand on ceremony.

286
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,430
Where's the raise she promised us?

287
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,730
Thank you, Money.

288
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,770
What are you doing?

289
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:10,580
I thought you fell for me.

290
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,670
So, you're marrying me in order to make money?

291
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,300
Wait. Didn't I tell you already?

292
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:17,980
I would never think of this if you didn't bring me to the wedding banquet.

293
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:20,800
<i>Here, take it.</i>

294
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:22,700
<i>Let's sit here.</i>

295
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,320
<i>Let's sit here.</i>

296
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:29,700
<i>The Peacock clan is known for the romantic nature.</i>

297
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,590
<i>Look at how happy they are.</i>

298
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:34,120
<i>So, money isn't the only thing</i>

299
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,860
<i>in the world, but also love.</i>

300
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,870
<i>You're right. Why didn't I think of that?</i>

301
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,880
This is ridiculous.

302
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,120
What are you doing? You can go against everything, except for money.

303
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,830
You're truly intelligent.

304
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,660
But of course.

305
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,320
Money, do you have a hometown?

306
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:59,060
Where's your hometown?

307
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,530
Let's hold another wedding in your hometown.

308
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,860
This way, we'll earn double the amount. We'll earn this much.

309
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,890
Do you wish to know where my hometown is?

310
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,240
Do you have plenty of relatives? I guess friends work as well.

311
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,320
Where did your follower go?

312
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,710
She's closest to you. She has to join us.

313
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:15,150
Say, if we...

314
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,430
Yes, you're the only one left. Show some sincerity.

315
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:20,210
- Man Man. Did you hear his beckon?
- I...

316
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,030
Come. Let's settle our scores with him.

317
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:27,090
This belongs to us.

318
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:28,730
What about this? You can have more of it.

319
00:18:28,730 --> 00:18:30,460
I'll give you 10%. That is enough, right?

320
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,730
Who told you to use me?

321
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:32,960
Who told you to deceive me?

322
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,440
Who told you to use me, you liar!

323
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,390
- Stop!
- Don't run!

324
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:38,570
- I'll kill you!
- Help!

325
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:40,760
I'll kill you!

326
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:43,480
- Why are you trying to kill me?
- You guys are...

327
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,280
Are you sure you want to give up?

328
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,330
Yes.

329
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:55,140
We finally escaped from the Heavenly Realm.

330
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:57,930
Now, we're leading a carefree life. Isn't it great?

331
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,910
Listen. Heartless looks just like Heartless Shaodian.

332
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,270
Both of them are heartless. They have no conscience at all.

333
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,980
I risked my life in order to save him, but him?

334
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:12,840
He only has eyes for money.

335
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,010
If that's the case, from today onward,

336
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,710
I, Liguang Yetan, will not save his soul shards anymore.

337
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:25,010
Are you serious?

338
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:26,480
Of course.

339
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,690
I won't let him take away my hard-earned money again.

340
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:32,050
Soul shards? Heartless Shaodian?

341
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:36,130
In the future, I will have nothing to do with him.

342
00:19:40,810 --> 00:19:43,340
I forgot about this thing that wanted to protect its master!

343
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,830
Listen, you can make my head hurt all you like.

344
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,930
I won't care about you anymore.

345
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,560
I won't withstand your stupid temper again!

346
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:55,090
Fine then. Since you've already said that, I won't attempt to persuade you.

347
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:58,080
However, if you want to talk about sincerity,

348
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,150
how sincere were you when you first approached Heartless?

349
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:04,390
If you do not care about him,

350
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:07,480
why are you being angry right now?

351
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:12,000
Think about it.

352
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:26,320
My little precious.

353
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,420
Money, you're not angry anymore, right?

354
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:34,110
Did I hurt you just now?

355
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,860
Not at all. Let me see.

356
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,290
Seems like you haven't recovered yet.

357
00:20:41,290 --> 00:20:45,040
What about this? I'll compensate you by treating you to hotpot.

358
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:46,900
- I'll bring some vegetables then.
- It's my treat.

359
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,320
Even so, I have to bring my own vegetables.

360
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
Wait for me.

361
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,220
Shui'er, higher!

362
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,290
- Raise your hand!
- Can't you lower your head?

363
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:10,570
You look like a dog.

364
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,930
Are you a dog?

365
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:13,760
How can I eat it then?

366
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,480
- Shui'er, give me another piece.
- Go away.

367
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,520
Give me another piece.

368
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,040
Did Kui'er send them?

369
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,240
Yes, Sir.

370
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,940
Her Highness was afraid that you might say mean things out of spite again.

371
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,530
That's why she sent us plenty of delicacies.

372
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:29,080
She even prepared health-preserving tea for us.

373
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:31,440
She's afraid that I'll be angry, huh?

374
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:34,090
- She should release me then.
- Precisely, Sir.

375
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:37,090
Who cares about the tea and delicacies?

376
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,050
Shut up. You're enjoying yourself here.

377
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:45,220
Actually, Sir, I think Her Highness still has feelings for you.

378
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,560
If not, she wouldn't return to the Void with us of her own accord.

379
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,810
It's just a soul shard, right? We should ignore it if we can't kill it.

380
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,150
You can become the crown prince using another method.

381
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:55,860
Anyway, Wu Dai and Dingyun don't know that the soul shard is in the Beast Realm.

382
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:58,110
I don't know if First Prince knows about it.

383
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,430
Second Prince is in the Beast Realm.

384
00:21:59,430 --> 00:22:00,810
If he finds out where the soul shard is...

385
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,090
Second Prince is in the Beast Realm?

386
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,910
What's going on?

387
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,800
<i>The entire patrol battalion is under Dingyun's supervision.</i>

388
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:15,800
<i>They can tail us if they want to.</i>

389
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:19,900
<i>However, it depends on their luck whether they can catch up to us or not.</i>

390
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:28,300
So, Second Prince had always been tailing us.

391
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:32,800
When the soul shard was in the Mortal Realm, Sir, you told me to lure Dingyun to somewhere far away.

392
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:37,000
I took my own initiative and lured them to the Beast Realm.

393
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,800
You fool!

394
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:41,800
It's fine too.

395
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,300
Even you weren't a match for Di Lanjue's magic item, Sir.

396
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:47,400
Even if Dingyun does go there, he can't kill the soul shard, right?

397
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,800
He may not be able to kill the fire demon soul shard, but what if he encounters the other soul shards?

398
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,200
There are other soul shards?

399
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,000
Initially, it was just my speculation.

400
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:00,600
But ever since I found out that Yetan wasn't by Qingkui's side in the Prince's Mansion, I believed it.

401
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:06,100
If the fire demon was the only soul shard, Yetan would've revived Shaodian Youqin long ago.

402
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:10,300
Now that she has disappeared, I'm sure she's looking for the next soul shard.

403
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,300
Speak! Where is Chaofeng?

404
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Over my dead body!

405
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,700
Fine.

406
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,400
Another stubborn fool.

407
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:34,300
You two fools, you actually went in circles when you were chasing after his subordinate.

408
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,900
Second Prince!

409
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,700
Do you have news of Chaofeng?

410
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,200
No. Listen to me.

411
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,900
What is he doing here?

412
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,200
- Follow me.
- Yes, Sir.

413
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,800
Let me see if there are any injuries on your back.

414
00:23:57,800 --> 00:23:59,000
No need for that.

415
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,100
Let me see.

416
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,400
You're hurt.

417
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,000
Just let me see.

418
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,600
Just one look.

419
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,600
We couldn't capture Chaofeng, but we bumped into Shaodian Youqin instead.

420
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,200
So, the mighty empyrean is enjoying his life in the Beast Realm.

421
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:15,900
Could it be that Chaofeng was here to assassinate him?

422
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,300
Shaodian Youqin showed his prowess once in Guixu.

423
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,200
He's way stronger than the Void Tyrant.

424
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,700
Chaofeng and his underlings actually tried to assassinate him?

425
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,800
That's impossible.

426
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:27,700
But usually, we could feel Shaodian Youqin's pure air from 100 li away.

427
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:32,200
Why is his pure air so weak now?

428
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:34,000
I'm sure there's more to it than meets the eye.

429
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,000
Second Prince, no matter what the reason is, Shaodian Youqin isn't at his full power now.

430
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,000
It's a great chance for us to strike.

431
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:45,700
Chaofeng will definitely die after you become the crown prince.

432
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,000
Excellent words.

433
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,400
Wait for my order and kill them all.

434
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,300
Yes, Second Prince.

435
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,200
No need for that.

436
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,100
Stop.

437
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,400
What's wrong?

438
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,700
The voidwalkers are nearby. We've been surrounded.

439
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,100
What?

440
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,200
The voidwalkers?

441
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:19,200
Do you owe them money too? Or are they your sworn enemies?

442
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,400
<i>They're your sworn enemies.</i>

443
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,200
Be careful. It might be a trap.

444
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,700
Anyway, I'll say something later.

445
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,500
- Just cooperate with me.
- Why?

446
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,400
Don't ask so many questions. I'll explain it to you later.

447
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:32,800
- Cooperate with me.
- How can I cooperate with you if you don't explain the situation to me?

448
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,900
I'll pay you.

449
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,400
Ten liang per sentence.

450
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,600
Are you testing me?

451
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,400
Don't tell me you're going to beat me up again.

452
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,000
Shaodian Youqin is isolated now. We have the number advantage.

453
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,800
It's our best chance to strike.

454
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:49,800
- If Chaofeng...
- I said, stay put.

455
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,800
I won't beat you up.

456
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,600
Fine.

457
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,000
Say this.

458
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:01,800
"I've hidden my cultivation and pretended to be hurt. I'm sure they won't notice."

459
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:04,300
Wait. I'll charge ten liang per word.

460
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:07,000
Fine. Ten liang it is.

461
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:11,300
Empyrean, do you think the voidwalkers will fall for this?

462
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:15,400
I think Jade Deity's method is pretty risky.

463
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,300
He set up such a huge ambush.

464
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,700
What should we do if the voidwalkers find out?

465
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:25,000
I've already hidden my cultivation to lure the enemies in.

466
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:27,400
I'm sure they won't notice.

467
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,600
Empyrean, you have a point.

468
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,200
Your powers have received a massive boost after the battle at Guixu.

469
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,600
That's right.

470
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
The voidwalkers are trying their best to kill me.

471
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,600
I'm sure they won't let go of this opportunity.

472
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,800
They will surely come for me in spite of the risk.

473
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:48,800
However, my cultivation has already reached unattainable heights.

474
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,100
Even if the ancient deities resurface, they're no match for me.

475
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:57,800
They will perish with the flick of my finger.

476
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,600
Stop boasting.

477
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,400
They won't fall for it if it's too ridiculous.

478
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,500
I've led an army for many years. Naturally, I'm well-versed in it.

479
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:04,500
He has already attained such powers?

480
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,000
It's no wonder Chaofeng didn't strike even when he was in the Mortal Realm for so long.

481
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,500
Darn you, immortals.

482
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:09,900
Darn you, Shaodian Youqin.

483
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:11,600
How dare you come up with such a despicable trap?

484
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,300
Luckily, I'm wise enough to avoid it.

485
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:17,200
I almost fell for it.

486
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,300
Empyrean, say no more. I understand now.

487
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,500
No, you don't understand at all.

488
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:27,300
For this plan, I've deduced it 81 times and corrected it 49 times.

489
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,300
I eliminated all possibilities of failure.

490
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:34,400
Moreover, I still have 100,000 heavenly soldiers training under my command every day.

491
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:36,400
- That's enough.
- What?

492
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,600
You're asking me who's under my command?

493
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,600
I'll list them out one by one.

494
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,800
The guard of the Heavenly Southern Gate, Erlang Deity.

495
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,100
The guard of the Heavenly Northern Gate, General Golden Armor.

496
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,400
<i>Heartless, you added so many lines just to make more money off me.</i>

497
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:50,600
<i>Just you wait.</i>

498
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,600
Don't tell me that bird is impersonating Shaodian Youqin.

499
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,600
He's so talkative.

500
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
He's telling her all about the traps that the immortals had laid without any hesitations.

501
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,200
Better be safe than sorry.

502
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,100
Those darned immortals are scheming and devious, especially Shaodian Youqin.

503
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,600
Back then, he set up an array in the Heavenly Southern Gate even though he was in Guixu.

504
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:09,700
I was captured because of that.

505
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,200
We have to be on our guard.

506
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:16,000
Second Prince, are you going to let them off?

507
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Empyrean, you have a point.

508
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:21,300
Why don't we trap them in the Beast Realm and annihilate them one by one?

509
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,400
You make a good point.

510
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
No matter if it's true or false, we should retreat first.

511
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,300
Second Prince!

512
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:26,900
Are you in charge here? Or am I in charge here?

513
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:30,200
Of course, it's you.

514
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,900
It's fine that we couldn't capture Chaofeng.

515
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:35,300
It'll be terrible if we were to die in Shaodian Youqin's hand.

516
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:37,800
Rush back to the Void and ask mother for her opinion. Let's retreat.

517
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,600
One against 10,000 men.

518
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,200
I engaged them 300 times.

519
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:46,300
My sword skills were unparalleled, just as the saying goes...

520
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,400
Enough!

521
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:51,200
If it's ten liang per word, and the total is 36,000 liang.

522
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,000
Thank you. Please pay up.

523
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:59,600
<i>Money, if you wish to win my heart, you still have to make money for me at least for a few more years.</i>

524
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:02,300
<i>Seems like they have no idea about the soul shards.</i>

525
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:06,000
<i>However, they'll definitely find out his identity as a soul shard soon.</i>

526
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,700
- Money?
- You can head back first. I have something else to do.

527
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,200
Aren't we leaving together?

528
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,500
I'm busy.

529
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:16,300
Fine. You can owe me the payment for now.

530
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,200
She's actually angry?

531
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,200
"IOU."

532
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,800
"On the 26th day of the eighth month, Beast Year,

533
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,700
Money requested me to partake in her stage act.

534
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:32,600
The cost was ten liang per word. The total sum is 36,000 liang."

535
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:41,300
<i>It's not like this is my first time kicking someone when they're down.</i>

536
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,300
<i>Why do I feel pity only for her then?</i>

537
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,800
<i>Just now, she left with a sour expression.</i>

538
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:50,200
<i>Could it be that she made up an excuse and left because she didn't want to see me?</i>

539
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,800
Everything's fine.

540
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,800
She'll come back once she's appeased.

541
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,700
Hall Master? What are you doing here?

542
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:15,090
The rooster hasn't heralded the break of dawn yet.

543
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:16,430
Where's Money? Is she here?

544
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:19,020
No. I thought madam got married to you.

545
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:21,000
Don't you live together?

546
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,700
She went out for business.

547
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,500
She knew that I would do my business in the hall during daytime.

548
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,700
I'm sure she'll look for me when she returns.

549
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,400
<i>It's still early.</i>

550
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,200
<i>Usually, she only arrives around five in the morning.</i>

551
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,600
<i>I'm sure she's on her way now.</i>

552
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,800
Hall Master, why don't you wait inside?

553
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:48,900
No. I'll wait here.

554
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:50,300
Yes, Sir.

555
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
What are you doing here?

556
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:07,100
What a coincidence. Fancy to see you here.

557
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,700
I just bought some vegetables.

558
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,000
It's already been one day.

559
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,200
I don't think Madam will come today.

560
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:49,600
Why don't we close up shop?

561
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,100
<i>I'm sure she's utterly disappointed by me.</i>

562
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,800
<i>That's why she left without bidding farewell.</i>

563
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:56,600
Hall Master?
<i>[Closed]</i>

564
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:46,200
♫ <i>You are the crescent in my heart</i> ♫

565
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,400
♫ <i>My radiant light shining through the years</i> ♫

566
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:58,300
<i>Hubby, this sword can express your might better.</i>

567
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:03,900
♫ <i>they will turn into flowers in my heart</i> ♫

568
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,400
<i>Hubby, slow down.</i>

569
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,500
<i>Does this look nice?</i>

570
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:10,500
♫ <i>I'll always be the unchanging love in your heart</i> ♫

571
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:17,400
♫ <i>Even the galaxy will agree with me, love needs no answer</i> ♫

572
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:22,600
♫ <i>I'll shine for you</i> ♫

573
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:29,500
♫ <i>In this flawless world</i> ♫

574
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:35,600
♫ <i>I'll always be the unchanging love in your heart</i> ♫

575
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:41,900
♫ <i>In this flawless world</i> ♫

576
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,600
Qingheng?

577
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,800
Qingheng?

578
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,700
Sister-in-law?

579
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,560
Sister-in-law, you're back.

580
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,760
Have you guys found anything in the Beast Realm?

581
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,040
We found the second soul shard called Heartless in the Beast Realm.

582
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,700
Really?

583
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:10,000
I haven't found anything yet from my trip to the Mortal Realm.

584
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,840
I didn't expect you to locate the second soul shard before us.

585
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,600
Did everything go smoothly then?

586
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,500
It did go smoothly.

587
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,300
However, the voidwalkers were at the Beast Realm too.

588
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:19,000
They've discovered Heartless.

589
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,800
I'm afraid I can't protect him with my powers alone.

590
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,000
That's why I'm here to seek your help.

591
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,800
Okay, Sister-in-law. Don't worry.

592
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,200
I will definitely not let the Void Army hurt Youqin.

593
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,700
Heartless!

594
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,900
Heartless?

595
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:50,700
Heartless?

596
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:55,000
I'm talking to you. What are you doing beside the Assassin Assembly Hall?

597
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,200
I even went back home to look for you.

598
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,600
Wait.

599
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,600
I'm sorry. You're back?

600
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
Where else can I go?

601
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,100
I thought you...

602
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,800
It's nothing.

603
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
What?

604
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,800
You thought I wasn't coming back? Did you miss me?

605
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,000
I... I don't think so.

606
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,400
You've been waiting for me, right?

607
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,800
Who said so? The night market is open today. I want to check it out.

608
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,100
No. It's dangerous out here. Let's go home.

609
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,400
Who dares to touch me right beside my territory?

610
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:42,700
And... my woman.

611
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,600
Let's go.

612
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:05,200
<i>Seems like sister-in-law will succeed soon.</i>

613
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,000
<i>I wonder how Husui is doing.</i>

614
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,600
- Over there?
- Yeah, over there.

615
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:27,800
I thought you saw it.

616
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,000
- Let's go.
- Excellent item for sale!

617
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,400
The Bone Flute, a top-tier magic item!

618
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:38,300
Everyone, this Bone Flute produces a pleasant sound.

619
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,400
<i>Bone Flute for sale!</i>

620
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,900
<i>Buy it as a love token for your wife.</i>

621
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,500
<i>I like it. Buy it for me.</i>

622
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,600
<i>- Buy it for me.
- You're a princess.</i>

623
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:48,900
<i>Not only are you holding the arms of a stranger, but you're also extorting money from me.</i>

624
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,900
<i>How could you be considered a stranger?</i>

625
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,500
<i>Since you didn't agree to cancel the wedding, that means you'll be my future husband.</i>

626
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:55,200
<i>Buy it for me.</i>

627
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,200
- Take a look!
- Do you like it?

628
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,300
Bone Flute for sale!

629
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,600
Let's take a look.

630
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,600
Miss, check it out.

631
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,900
How much does this cost?

632
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,800
The Bone Flute costs 30 liang.

633
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,600
It costs 30 liang?

634
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,000
I don't have the money for this.

635
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,600
Why are you touching it then?

636
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:17,900
Are you blind?

637
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,700
She can touch whatever she wants!

638
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:31,300
<i>Is he out of his mind?</i>

639
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,100
Why are you looking at me like that?

640
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:38,400
Are you truly going to buy this for me?

641
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,400
Yes.

642
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,100
Here, count them.

643
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,900
You won't ask me to pay you, right?

644
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,200
What are you saying?

645
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,500
Fine, you owe me a Bone Flute anyway.

646
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,900
Since when? Why can't I remember?

647
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,000
It's been so long since then.

648
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:58,400
I'm sure you cannot remember.

649
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,400
That's fine.

650
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,600
If that's the case, I'll make it up to you today.

Yes, Sir.

You smiled.

Everything was worth it.

So, there are things other than money that can make me happy.

672
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,400
Money,

673
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,400
how much do you think my true heart costs?

674
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:59,300
That stingy man was actually so generous today.

675
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:04,600
We could've bought more of your favorite things if Qingheng didn't need to protect him in secret.

676
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:10,900
When you wake up tomorrow, you can collect another soul shard with just a little spark.

677
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,000
What's the matter?

678
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,000
I was still in Heavenly Realm when I received this many gifts last time.

679
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,400
But I know, he bought them for Qingkui.

680
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,800
But this time, it's different.

681
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,400
He bought them for me from the bottom of his heart.

682
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,300
A moneygrubber like him actually bought so many gifts for me.

683
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,400
I'm sure he's heartbroken.

684
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,000
That means you'll be able to collect the soul shard soon.

685
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,800
Why are you pulling a long face instead?

686
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,300
It's not that I'm afraid to tell Fiery and Heartless that I'm doing this to revive Heartless Shaodian...

687
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:47,700
I don't know how to explain it to them.

688
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,800
You don't need to explain it to them.

689
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,800
We came here to locate the soul shards and revive the Empyrean.

690
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,700
After that, you can remove the Iridescent Eyes.
