This is?

22

Royal Father? Follow me to the hall and protect the Void Tyrant!

23
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,700
Chaofeng?

24
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:19,100
As long as the Heavenly Emperor is alive, that means I haven't avenged Kui'er.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,800
We have no way to absorb impurity.

26
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,300
Conquering the Void Army is the only way if we wish to attack the Heavenly Realm.

27
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,700
All of you, listen up.

28
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:30,300
I've slain the Void Tyrant.

29
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:32,700
I have the Xingtian Void Token now.
<i>[Xingtian Void Token]</i>

00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,800
- As long as you all are willing to side with me and attack the Heavenly Realm,
- Royal Father!

31
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,300
I will let bygones be bygones.

00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:40,900
What's going on?

33
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,600
I have no idea.

34
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:55,100
How could the Void yield to the heretic of Dongqiu?

35
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:01,000
I will never bow to you even at the expense of my life!

36
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
Chief Wizard!

37
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,600
All of you, listen up.

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,700
The Void Realm always bows to the strongest being of the realm.

39
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:38,700
Since Yetan has slain the Void Tyrant, naturally, she's the next leader of the Void.

40
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,400
Stop your meaningless struggle and you'll get to live.

41
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,900
Shut up!

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,600
She slew my father!

43
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,100
She's my sworn enemy!

44
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,700
I will never bow to her!

Wu Dai!

46
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:07,600
Yetan, he looked after Kui'er when she was living here.

47
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,500
Spare him.

48
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:20,800
Jia Louluo, the Snake Saintess, and the Void Patrol Battalion will join you, Princess Yetan.

49
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:25,000
Your Highness, please let the First Prince off.

Do not kneel! Stand up!

55

The Void Army is mine now.

56
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:57,100
I'll spare you on account of your feelings for my sister.

57
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,000
Take him to the Cave of Haunted Souls so that he won't stir up any trouble.

58
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,700
First Prince, sorry for this.

59
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,400
Don't touch me!

60
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:56,500
Sister said she saw the herbs you grew for her.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Kui'er?

62
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,300
<i>I swapped your carriage.</i>

63
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,000
<i>I'm your sworn enemy.</i>

64
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,800
<i>Although you'd deceived me for a long time, I never felt that your feelings for me were fake.</i>

65
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,200
<i>It's been waiting for its owner for many years.</i>

66
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
<i>Princess, you're its owner.</i>

67
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,400
<i>In the future, I won't go anywhere else. I will just stay by your side.</i>

68
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,400
<i>No matter if it's crushing herbs or serving tea, I'll follow your every order.</i>

69
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,600
<i>As long as I can marry you, I'm not afraid of anything.</i>

70
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:36,100
<i>I want to be with you, no matter in life or death.</i>

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,100
I think she'll be the happiest if she stays with you.

72
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:55,800
Kui'er.

73
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:04,600
I once promised her that I would give her a stable and blissful future.

74
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,900
But in the end, I still failed.

75
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,900
Kui'er, our happiest days weren't the days we spent in White Bamboo Valley

76
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,000
or the Beast Realm.

77
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,100
Instead, it was the time when we tried everything we could to escape from the Void.

78
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,100
Kui'er,

79
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,200
we're home now.

80
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:34,000
From now on, no one will harm you.

81
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,700
Princess Yetan, Kui'er's flower spirit has a special meaning to you,

82
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,000
yet you're willing to hand it to Feng'er.

83
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,300
Words cannot express my gratitude.

84
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:47,900
Consort Xue, don't mention it.

85
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,800
Although the Void Tyrant had mistreated you guys for many years, you guys were a family after all.

86
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,900
Now that he's gone, I'm sure you're more heartbroken than I am.

87
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,300
Your Majesty, according to sources from the Mortal Realm,

88
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:14,300
Liguang Yetan has slain the Void Tyrant and conquered the Void.

89
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,900
What?

90
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,000
That's impossible.

91
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,800
Now, Liguang Yetan is a mere mortal.

92
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,100
How could that be?

93
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,500
Could it be that her twin flower spirit is still intact?

94
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,600
You spared Yetan from death due to your kindness.

95
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:33,400
Now, she has turned into a formidable foe.

96
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,200
Since it has come to this,

97
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,800
we must get rid of her before she establishes her foothold.

98
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,800
Yetan is no longer the same person she was.

99
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,800
The Heavenly Army might not win without the help of the reverend masters.

100
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:50,200
Why don't we send the three masters after her?

101
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,100
Send Youqin there.

102
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:54,200
However, Empyrean Xuanshang and Yetan are...

103
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
Youqin has been planted with the Stake of Oblivion.

104
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,000
His ridiculous memories with Yetan had been wiped away.

105
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,400
Now, he has a pure heart.

106
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,300
He's a sharp sword that can pierce through darkness and evil.

107
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,100
If Yetan does possess the twin flower spirit, once the Heavenly Army goes after her,

108
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,600
she might break the seal of Guixu out of desperation.

109
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,000
Everything will only be fine when we send Youqin after her.

110
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,200
Your Majesty is wise.

111
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,100
Summon Youqin.

112
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

113
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,400
Wait.

114
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,700
I will see him in Penglai Hall personally.

115
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:51,400
Does Luowei Grotto have this many lotus plants in the first place?

116
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,200
These were sent here by our tribe members.

117
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,600
When they heard that the Third Prince brought Princess Qingkui's flower spirit back to the realm,

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,000
they sent these flowers here to mourn her.

119
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,600
So, they still remember Qingkui?

120
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:08,300
Princess Qingkui opened the Crown Princess's Clinic despite all odds and saved countless of our tribe members.

121
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:12,800
The voidwalkers will never forget her kindness.

122
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,300
Back then, Kui'er was the one

123
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:19,400
who treated my facial scar.

124
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,800
Sister was a kind medical practitioner.

125
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:24,800
How could I speak to her like that?

126
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,300
Actually...

127
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,000
Actually, ever since Princess Qingkui

128
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,900
was sent to the Void by accident, she had been talking about you.

129
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:34,900
She said your ambition was to achieve great things in the Void.

130
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:38,000
You wanted everyone to refer to you as the Devil of the Void.

131
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,200
She opened the Crown Princess's Clinic to fulfill your dream for you.

132
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,500
Where's the Crown Princess's Clinic?

133
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,600
It's at the west of Luowei Grotto.

134
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,200
It's at Zhuoxin Hall.

135
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,100
Let me bring you there.

136
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,400
It's okay.

137
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,600
I wish to check it out myself.

138
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,100
Greetings, Celestial Father.

139
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,500
We are father and son. There's no need for such strict customs.

140
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,600
Spare the formalities.

141
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,800
There's a difference between our ranks.

142
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,900
Father, if you have any orders for me, you could've asked the immortal attendant to summon me.

143
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,200
There's no need for you to come personally.

144
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:37,600
I came here today as I need to discuss the fate of the world with you.

145
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:43,500
Guangtian found out that the Void had been conquered by the demoness of Dongqiu.

146
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,400
That demoness is the human form of Ganoderma Vein's twin flower spirit.

147
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,200
She intends to disrupt the four realms.

148
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,600
After careful consideration,

149
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,600
sending the Heavenly Army to hunt her down is the only way we can maintain peace within the four realms.

150
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,500
Celestial Father, may I know her name?

151
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,700
Liguang Yetan.

152
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,700
<i>Tan'er.</i>

153
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,900
<i>Did you pour my medicine away again?</i>

154
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:23,900
<i>All medicine is bitter.</i>

155
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,200
<i>Be a good girl.</i>

156
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,000
<i>Finish it.</i>

157
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:35,000
<i>You get into fights all day long.</i>

158
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,700
<i>You don't behave like a lady at all.</i>

159
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,300
<i>You should keep your Beauty's Dagger away.</i>

160
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,200
<i>I know.</i>

161
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,400
<i>You always wanted to be strong and unrestrained.</i>

162
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,000
<i>That's why I made this portrait for you.</i>

163
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,800
<i>I hope you can become the Devil of Void.</i>

164
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,800
<i>Do you like it?</i>

165
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,500
I like it.

166
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,000
I like it very much.

167
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,100
<i>Tan'er, may you get what you wish for.</i>

168
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,600
<i>May you lead a carefree and happy life.</i>

169
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,400
Sister.

170
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,800
I...

171
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,600
I've already become the Devil of Void.

172
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:02,000
But I'm not happy at all.

173
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:30,600
Sister. Sister!

174
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,600
Sister!

175
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,600
I miss you!

176
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,800
Qingkui! Come back!

177
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:54,600
Come back! Come back!

178
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:58,600
Sister!

179
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,200
For the past few days, Your Majesty has shown more concern for the Empyrean.

180
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:08,500
I'm sure the Empyrean is delighted.

181
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,400
Many things had happened to Youqin lately.

182
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,100
Although I bore witness to them, I couldn't do anything about them.

183
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:15,900
I could only spend my effort preparing better food for him.

184
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,100
Thank you for harvesting the Honey Fruit for me.

185
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,800
Your Majesty, you're most welcome.

186
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,500
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

187
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,100
General Guangtian?

188
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:30,000
What is he doing here again?

189
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,200
Greetings, Your Majesty.

190
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,700
His Majesty is discussing important matters with the Empyrean inside.

191
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,200
Your Majesty, please wait outside.

192
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,200
What important matters?

193
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,000
Your Majesty!

194
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Such audacity! How dare you stand in my way?

195
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:58,900
Since the demoness is a threat to the four realms, I'm willing to share your burden and lead our army.

196
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:05,100
Youqin, although you possess the Perfect Celestial Body, do not underestimate Liguang Yetan.

197
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,500
You must practice caution.

198
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:10,300
Celestial Father, for your sake, and for the four realms' sake, such danger means nothing to me.

199
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,500
I will gather our troops and hunt down the demoness.

200
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,700
- My dear?
- Greetings, Celestial Mother.

201
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,400
I've failed my duty.

202
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
Youqin.

203
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,500
What did you say just now?

204
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,700
Who were you going to kill?

205
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:46,600
I've taken on the task to hunt down the demoness of Dongqiu, Liguang Yetan.

206
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,900
You cannot!

207
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
My lifelong ambition is to protect all living beings.

208
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,200
Celestial Mother, why are you stopping me?

209
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,600
Youqin, listen to me.

210
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,600
Celestial Mother, I will listen to you after I slay the demoness.

211
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
Youqin!

212
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:05,200
You used Tan'er's life to threaten us so that we wouldn't mention the past to Youqin.

213
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,300
But now, you want Youqin to kill Tan'er?

214
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:11,200
Not only did you go back on your word, but you also used your son as a tool.

215
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:12,600
How heartless you are!

216
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,700
I did it for his sake.

217
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:18,700
Once he kills Yetan, no one will criticize him.

218
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,300
By then, he can retain his position in Penglai Hall and be a good empyrean.

219
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:28,100
You did everything to consolidate your own throne.

220
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,600
In your eyes, Youqin is just a pawn.

221
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,500
You want him to sever his feelings and be cold-blooded

222
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,800
all because you're trying to groom a puppet that's willing to die for you!

223
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,900
Stop it.

224
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:47,300
I wouldn't have been kept in the dark for so long if you didn't protect Yetan from the beginning.

225
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,000
Also, don't think that I have no idea.

226
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Back then, when Youqin and Yetan got married in the Beast Realm,

227
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:58,500
you even granted them the rainbow blessing of the Xia clan.

228
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,000
Soft-hearted women like you can never achieve anything.

229
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,600
I never wanted to be the Heavenly Empress!

230
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,100
I only wanted to be a mother to my children!

231
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,700
You're the heavenly ruler and possess absolute power.

232
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,800
Why can't you tolerate the feelings of the world?

233
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:12,900
Shaodian Xiaoyi!

234
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,400
From now on,

235
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,600
we cease to be husband and wife.

236
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:27,800
I would rather return to the Xia clan than stay with you in this uncompassionate place.

237
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:39,200
I still have official affairs to attend to.

238
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,800
Heavenly Empress, you may do what you deem fit.

239
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:55,200
Your Majesty.

240
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,600
Well... What should we do?

241
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,000
Hurry and find Qingheng. Ask him to think of something.

242
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

243
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,200
You'll win if you throw out Two Dots.

244
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,400
Two Dots?

245
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
It's this one.

246
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,900
This one.

247
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I'm sure it's this one.

248
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,650
This one. I'm sure it's this one.

249
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,200
That's Two Dots? What is this then?

250
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,000
Two Characters.

251
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:30,900
Great.

252
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,200
Forget it. I quit.

253
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,700
Come on. You're an utter fool.

254
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:38,000
I've been teaching you the entire day, yet you still can't recognize the tiles.

255
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
I'm foolish. Let's play another round.

256
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
The three of us aren't fools, you know?

257
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,900
You two had joined us for several days.

258
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:47,900
I'm sure you guys have a favor to ask.

259
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,600
Speak up. Hurry up.

260
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
I'm getting sleepy.

261
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,200
Masters, please practice your wise judgment.

262
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,700
Although the flower spirit of Dongqiu has been destroyed, the feud still remains.

263
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:04,200
People are still suffering over this.

264
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Masters, I know you three are compassionate and kind.

265
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,900
That's why you guys kept the Soul-Gathering Lamp for 10,000 years.

266
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:12,100
You wish to retrieve the lamp and help Suzhi to revive her tribe members, right?

267
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,200
We knew that.

268
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,900
But your father took the lamp away long ago.

269
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,000
It's no longer in the Land of Nature.

270
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,100
Celestial Father?

271
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,900
If so, I'll steal it from Celestial Father.

272
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:23,300
Qingheng, do not act recklessly.

273
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,600
It's impossible to steal the lamp from Father.

274
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,400
Immortal Qingheng!

275
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,500
Hurry!

276
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:33,400
Immortal Qingheng, the Empyrean and General Guangtian gathered the Heavenly Army

277
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,600
and went to the Void to hunt down Princess Yetan.

278
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,600
<i>What?</i>

279
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,200
My sister-in-law is in the Void?

280
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,300
Qingheng, what should we do?

281
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,400
Celestial Father still isn't willing to let the people of Dongqiu off.

282
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,700
We can't just let eldest brother kill our sister-in-law.

283
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,300
Let's go.

284
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,000
Your Highness, you're exhausted.

285
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,300
Why are you visiting the Empress's quarters?

286
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,400
We should return to Fenyuan Hall.

287
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,000
No need for that.

288
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,200
This is Yingzhao's ornate mirror.

289
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,300
I once desired to conquer the Void and be a devil that is feared by everyone.

290
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:28,720
But now, although I've realized my ambition, I've lost all of my loved ones.

291
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,340
My sister died to save me.

292
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:33,240
Youqin was captured by the Heavenly Emperor.

293
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:37,290
Now, I can only quench my longing by staring into the mirror.

294
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,750
Your Highness, I understand your pain.

295
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:47,030
However, the Heavenly Emperor won't kill the Empyrean.

296
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:51,080
Once we wipe out the Heavenly Realm, I'm sure Your Highness can reunite with the Empyrean.

297
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:56,010
Your Highness, please do not indulge yourself in this illusion and forget about our goal.

298
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,940
I know this is an arduous journey.

299
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,210
Since we've already taken the first step, there's no turning back.

300
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:09,020
Your Highness, to you, this may only be the first step.

301
00:23:09,770 --> 00:23:12,060
However, I've waited for this for 10,000 years.

302
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:16,900
For the past 10,000 years, I'd always been thinking about why the spirit of the sacred tree

303
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:19,780
didn't appear and save our tribe from the massacre.

304
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:22,560
But now, my call is finally answered.

305
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,910
Your Highness, I'm begging you. Please do not just dwell on your loss.

306
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:33,160
You must wield the Beauty's Dagger and uphold justice for our tribe members, who died a wrongful death.

307
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,100
You said before that the Soul-Gathering Lamp was created by the branches

308
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,640
of the Ganoderma Vein and that it could last forever.

309
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:48,060
Since the flower spirits of our tribe members were already injected into the lamp, I'm sure it still exists.

310
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,160
Don't worry.

311
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,310
I'll definitely retrieve the lamp, revive the dead, and help you reunite with your parents.

312
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:56,590
Thank you, Your Highness.

313
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,850
Your Highness, we received a report from the Void Patrol Battalion.

314
00:24:09,850 --> 00:24:12,900
Empyrean Xuanshang has entered the Void.

315
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,730
Youqin is here? Where is he?

316
00:24:14,730 --> 00:24:17,000
He's at the Passage of Twilight. But...

317
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,560
Youqin is here to look for me. I knew he wouldn't be bound by the Heavenly Emperor.

318
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:22,390
He's here for me.

319
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:44,110
Youqin!

320
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:51,590
So, you're Liguang Yetan?

321
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:59,180
Since the Empyrean is leading the Heavenly Army, I'm sure he's not here to reunite with Your Highness.

322
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,210
The Heavenly Army launched a sudden attack.

323
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:03,030
Our defending army lost to them and had to retreat.

324
00:25:03,030 --> 00:25:06,790
Seems like Empyrean Xuanshang is here to attack us.

325
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:11,570
I've been missing you ever since we parted ways at Guixu.

326
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,240
Youqin, do you not remember me?

327
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,770
Empyrean, do not be bewitched by that demoness!

328
00:25:16,770 --> 00:25:18,490
Kill them!

329
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,970
Wait!

330
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:24,670
I'm here to rid the world of evil.

331
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:29,680
Since you're facing me alone, I will not pressure you with my army.

332
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,090
What's wrong with you?

333
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,380
Youqin, don't you remember me? I'm Tan'er!

334
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,140
Your Highness, be careful!

335
00:25:55,290 --> 00:25:58,930
<i>This is the star formation most commonly used by the immortals.</i>

336
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,620
<i>Now, I'll teach you how to dispel it.</i>

337
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,430
<i>You must remember it.</i>

338
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:34,350
You actually dispelled my star formation?

339
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:40,730
That night, you said you wanted to reward my effort with a beautiful galaxy.

340
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:43,460
I always remembered this formation, which you taught me.

341
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,770
But I never expected you to be the one to use this star formation on me.

342
00:26:48,770 --> 00:26:54,790
Youqin, since I could make you remember me three times, I'm sure I could do it again.

343
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,010
The Empyrean actually imparted his sword skills to her?

344
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:41,490
Her Highness is trying to awaken the Empyrean's dormant memories with her sword skills.

345
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:43,760
However, Her Highness is already a ball of impurity.

346
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,740
She cannot utilize the immortals' sword skills to the fullest.

347
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:53,400
If this continues, and if Xuanshang still cannot remember her, Her Highness will definitely lose.

348
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:28,490
Something seems off. Keep an eye on Her Highness.

349
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:30,380
I'll gather the army.

350
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,890
Who exactly are you?

351
00:28:37,890 --> 00:28:41,560
Youqin, I'm your wife,

352
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,750
your Money, and your Yuexia.

353
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:05,000
<i>I'm your wife.</i>

354
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:12,970
Your Highness!

355
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,430
You're the demoness of doom.

356
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,190
But why can't I take your life?

357
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:25,710
Youqin, do you truly not remember anything?

358
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:28,380
Empyrean, do not let her mislead you.

359
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,850
Liguang Yetan is unrelated to you.

360
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:33,440
She's just trying to bewitch you.

361
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,380
I will assist you in dispatching her.

362
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,700
Heavenly generals, set up formation!

363
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,600
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

364
00:29:59,910 --> 00:30:01,790
Qingheng?

365
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,560
- Tan'er, we're here.
- Di Lanjue?

366
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:08,120
Ziwu? You guys are...

367
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,890
I never expected you guys to go through so much after my royal father kept me detained in the Prince's Mansion.

368
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:16,630
We rushed all the way here after Qingheng and Ziwu got me out.

369
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:21,130
Didn't we say that we would be buddies forever?

370
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,960
Set up formation!

371
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:31,150
- Follow me!
- Stop.

372
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:32,630
Kill the demoness!

373
00:30:32,630 --> 00:30:35,120
I said, stop!

374
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,870
Empyrean, we mustn't let this opportunity go to waste!

375
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,580
Back down.

376
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,040
Youqin, both Qingheng and Ziwu are here.

377
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,700
They can testify for me.

378
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:54,580
Sister-in-law, Youqin was injured in Guixu.

379
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,320
He couldn't do anything about it when Father planted the Stake of Oblivion in him.

380
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,810
He...

381
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:02,390
He already forgot about the past.

382
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:05,320
<i>Qingheng, Ziwu, why are you guys helping Liguang Yetan</i>

383
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,450
<i>even if it means that you have to go against Celestial Father's will?</i>

384
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:11,060
<i>What exactly happened between us?</i>

385
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,690
<i>Why can't I remember anything?</i>

386
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,220
Your Highness, the Void Army has arrived.

387
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:37,730
The Void Army?

388
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,870
<i>I mustn't let Yetan bewitch the Empyrean any longer.</i>

389
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,200
Empyrean, this was supposed to be a sneak attack.

390
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,060
However, Immortal Qingheng and the Prince of the Beast Tribe

391
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,640
turned against us and sided with the demoness instead.

392
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:50,480
Now that the Void Army is here, the situation is unfavorable for us. Let's retreat.

393
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,350
Qingheng and Ziwu mustn't remain here.

394
00:31:52,350 --> 00:31:54,580
We have no time for them! Empyrean, please focus on the bigger picture!

395
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:57,970
The Heavenly Emperor will deal with them when we return to the Heavenly Realm.

396
00:32:01,810 --> 00:32:03,370
Retreat.

397
00:32:04,610 --> 00:32:06,290
Youqin!

398
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:18,550
<i>[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

399
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:21,820
Your Majesty, you have been weak lately.

400
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:27,420
You have to follow the imperial physician's instructions and recuperate.

401
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,950
How's Tan'er been doing lately?

402
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:34,940
Princess Yetan has been staying in Zhaolu Hall for the past few days.

403
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:37,080
Your Majesty, please don't worry.

404
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,780
It's been some days since I visited Tan'er.

405
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,730
I will head to Zhaolu Hall later.

406
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,700
Your Majesty!

407
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:49,120
What are you doing?

408
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,490
Don't tell me Tan'er is...

409
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,100
Tell me.

410
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:58,950
Is Tan'er in Zhaolu Hall now?

411
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:03,560
Princess Yetan left the palace together with Consort Xue a few days ago!

412
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:06,220
She said she would head to the Void and avenge Princess Qingkui!

413
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,900
Your Majesty! You had been unwell lately!

414
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:12,870
I... I dared not tell you the truth!

415
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,540
Your Majesty!

416
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:17,750
In the end, Tan'er still went to the Void.

417
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,420
I will bring her back now.

418
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:24,740
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

419
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,450
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

420
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:37,260
Suzhi, give my sister-in-law some time alone.

421
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:41,320
After the Empyrean left, Her Highness locked herself away in Fenyuan Hall.

422
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:43,470
I'm worried about her.

423
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:47,020
Suzhi,

424
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,640
don't worry.

425
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,360
Sister-in-law always had a tough personality.

426
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,300
She should be fine.

427
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,710
After Qingkui's passing, Shaodian Youqin became the person she cares about the most.

428
00:33:57,710 --> 00:34:01,770
All this while, she slew the Void Tyrant and conquered the Void.

429
00:34:01,770 --> 00:34:06,230
She may look determined, but in reality, her heart was already riddled with holes.

430
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:11,766
Just when she thought that her husband could return to her side, it turned out to be...

431
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:26,360
<i>I'm here to rid the world of evil.</i>

432
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,440
<i>Since you're facing me alone,</i>

433
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,430
<i>I will not pressure you with my army.</i>

434
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:32,950
<i>What's wrong with you?</i>

435
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:36,070
<i>Youqin, don't you remember me? I'm Tan'er!</i>

436
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:50,070
In the end, you were still planted with the Stake of Oblivion.

437
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,310
Even if you forgot about your soul shards,

438
00:34:54,310 --> 00:35:00,020
Tianpa Hall, and everything that had happened,

439
00:35:00,020 --> 00:35:03,050
you still couldn't bear to strike me down.

440
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,890
You still have feelings for me,

441
00:35:07,890 --> 00:35:09,550
right?

442
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:12,370
But...

443
00:35:12,370 --> 00:35:16,450
how can I save you from the Heavenly Emperor's clutch?

444
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,830
Emperor Tun?

445
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:37,940
Emperor Tun.

446
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,610
Where's Tan'er? How has she been doing?

447
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,050
Great timing.

448
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:43,180
Tan Tan is fine.

449
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:46,200
However, many things had happened lately.

450
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,150
Tan Tan, she...

451
00:35:50,730 --> 00:35:52,330
Tan Tan slew the Void Tyrant.

452
00:35:52,330 --> 00:35:53,920
And Shaodian Youqin forgot about her completely.

453
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,070
After that, she locked herself away in her room.

454
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:57,500
We're here to visit her.

455
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,550
But we dare not bother her.

456
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,440
What about you...

457
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,560
Tan'er?

458
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,800
Imperial Father.

459
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,820
Tan'er.

460
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:38,440
It's all my fault.

461
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:42,930
I had to bear witness as they harm you and Kui'er.

462
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:47,770
Even so, I couldn't even uphold justice for you two.

463
00:36:47,770 --> 00:36:52,600
You had to toughen yourself up and go against them.

464
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:56,270
Imperial Father, you've always been acting for my and Qingkui's sake.

465
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:04,050
On my way here, I was utterly flustered.

466
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:09,500
I was afraid that you might act recklessly and end up being captured by the Void Tyrant due to your anger.

467
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,730
But I never expected you to be the leader of the Void Realm. And you even met the Empyrean...

468
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,960
Imperial Father, you came here to persuade me not to avenge Qingkui, right?

469
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,510
I wish to return to the palace and keep you company too, Imperial Father.

470
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,500
But look at the current situation...

471
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:23,050
I've behaved like a coward all my life.

472
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:26,220
I have to suck up to all those immortals and deities.

473
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:30,770
In the end, the Heavenly Emperor still played me like a fiddle.

474
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:33,920
I wish to kill the Heavenly Emperor and avenge Kui'er too.

475
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,720
But I can never achieve that.

476
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:40,700
Tan'er, you and the Heavenly Emperor are mutually antagonistic now.

477
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,000
If I persuade you to let go of the hatred in your heart,

478
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,630
that means I allow them to bully you again.

479
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:50,410
Imperial Father, thank you for understanding.

480
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,250
The Heavenly Emperor is known throughout the four seas for his benevolence.

481
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,450
However, he's 100 times more ruthless than the Void Tyrant.

482
00:37:54,450 --> 00:37:56,840
I have no powers.

483
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:58,670
I cannot help you out.

484
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,810
The only thing I can do is ensure my safety so that you won't need to worry about me.

485
00:38:05,110 --> 00:38:08,820
Tan'er, no matter in life or death,

486
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:14,090
I will stand by you and stay by your side.

487
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,420
Luckily, our sister-in-law still has Emperor Tun with her.

488
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:30,630
That's right.

489
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:34,230
Initially, I thought Emperor Tun was the most detestable father in all of the four realms.

490
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:38,200
But now, he's actually Tan'er's last backing.

491
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:43,000
Right now, the most detestable father in all of the four realms is the Heavenly...

492
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:46,780
The Heavenly Emperor.

493
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:48,280
He said it, not me.

494
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,700
The Heavenly Emperor has committed plenty of atrocious deeds.

495
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,730
There's no need to deny the truth.

496
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,710
It's been some days since we met, and you've grown quite a lot, huh?

497
00:38:55,710 --> 00:39:00,400
You're better than your eldest brother when it comes to differentiating right from wrong.

498
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,610
Naturally, Youqin is 100 times better than me.

499
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:04,170
It's just that...

500
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,660
It's just that he keeps losing his memories.

501
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,130
The Empyrean?

502
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:10,770
The strongest being of the four realms?

503
00:39:10,770 --> 00:39:13,130
He always forgets things during crucial moments.

504
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:18,010
Could it be that he severed some other nerves... when he severed his desires?

505
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,870
Stop your nonsense!

506
00:39:19,870 --> 00:39:21,750
Fine, fine. I'll stop.

507
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:23,420
Don't be angry.

508
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,570
Fate sure is unpredictable.

509
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:31,600
If only Tan'er wasn't a descendant of Dongqiu.

510
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,280
Suzhi. Suzhi!

511
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:00,060
I know.

512
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:03,620
You're joining my sister-in-law on her quest for vengeance not just for Princess Qingkui's sake.

513
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,170
You're doing it for your sake too.

514
00:40:05,170 --> 00:40:09,840
10,000 years ago, the immortals massacred Dongqiu and caused you to be separated from your parents.

515
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:14,360
Actually, ever since I found out that you were a descendant of Dongqiu,

516
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,170
I wanted to apologize to you on the immortals' behalf.

517
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:18,110
I...

518
00:40:18,110 --> 00:40:20,460
It happened 10,000 years ago.

519
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,200
I know it has nothing to do with you.

520
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,730
You don't need to blame yourself for it.

521
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:27,300
Since my sister-in-law has the flower spirit power, she will definitely have a showdown with my father.

522
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,760
However, you're barely alive.

523
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,950
There's no need for you to get involved in this struggle.

524
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,440
Thank you for always being concerned about me.

525
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:40,140
However, reviving my tribe members was the only thing that kept me going for the last 10,000 years.

526
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:44,780
I can help you steal the Soul-Gathering Lamp and revive your tribe members.

527
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,490
I'm already grateful enough that you risked your life to save us.

528
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:50,640
You've already done enough for me.

529
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,820
Don't say that.

530
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Actually...

531
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,290
- Actually, I...
- Immortal Qingheng,

532
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,550
I know what you're trying to say.

533
00:41:00,550 --> 00:41:02,250
Thank you.

534
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,680
<i>Qingheng, you're the best immortal I have ever met.</i>

535
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,000
<i>But I'm sorry.</i>

536
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,400
<i>No matter what, I won't get myself entangled with worldly feelings like Yetan.</i>

537
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:33,910
Qingheng and Ziwu actually held a candle to the devil and went down to assist Yetan without permission, huh?

538
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,060
Nothing's worse than a familiar enemy.

539
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:42,030
Father, although Qingheng and Ziwu are mischievous, they can still tell good from evil.

540
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:47,220
Before this, when I exchanged blows with Liguang Yetan, I realized that she could utilize immortal skills.

541
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,890
This might be bold of me to ask so, but, Celestial Father, who exactly is Liguang Yetan?

542
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:56,490
Liguang Yetan is a member of the crazed Dongqiu Tribe.

543
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:59,070
She's the human form of the Ganoderma Vein's flower spirit.

544
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:02,040
She has no connection with the immortals.

545
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:05,430
Youqin, you've received immortal teachings for millenniums.

546
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:09,100
You have the responsibility to protect all living beings.

547
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:13,100
Facing a devil like her, you should've shown her no mercy.

548
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:18,230
Do not let her bewitching words fool you into questioning your beliefs.

549
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:20,400
Yes, Celestial Father.

550
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,470
It's a shame that you didn't manage to slay her in the Void Realm.

551
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,980
You must be exhausted. Go and rest.

552
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:31,060
I still need you to protect our realm.

553
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,440
Yes, Celestial Father.

554
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,290
I shall take my leave.

555
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:58,340
