00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,800
Of course. I also have many secret remedies that preserve one's youthful appearance.

23
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Truly?

24
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,400
I'll teach you next time.

25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,600
Your Highness, you don't have to see me out.

26
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:00,900
After the popularity of medicine has increased, I'll return to express my gratitude.

27

When you find a husband, don't forget to extend an invitation to me.

28

This veil...

29
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,700
I won't need this thing anymore.

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,100
I'll take my leave now.

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,900
Saintess, take care on your way.

Let's go back inside.

33
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,500
Saintess, your appearance has been restored to its former beauty. It's wonderful.

34
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
I owe my thanks to Your Highness for the recommendation.

35
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,600
For that, I'm grateful.

36
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,600
Saintess, don't thank me just yet.

37
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,900
I have a favor to ask.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,800
If you don't behave, I'll swallow you alive.

39
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,900
Wonderful.

40
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,100
Splendid.

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,200
Don't get angry.

42
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,500
Annoying!

43
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:39,600
I don't want to kill. But you kept coming every day.

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,700
He... He looks quite busy.

45
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,100
Why don't we come another day?

46
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,100
Let's just get out of here.

47
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,100
Come back here. Sit still.

48
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,100
He looks quite sinister.

49
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:51,300
I can finally put my lifelong studies into practice.

50
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,600
No more alcohol.

51
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,100
You can't see me.

52
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,000
Come on.

53
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,000
Over here.

54
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,200
This fellow's dwelling is unexpectedly primitive.

55
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,700
He doesn't look like someone with the ambition to achieve greatness.

56
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,600
Did you see him lose his temper just now?

57
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,900
What's wrong with him?

58
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,300
He scared me.

59
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,200
Don't be scared. Just proceed with my plan.

60
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,400
Let's go.

61
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:24,600

62
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,400

63
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,200
Your Majesty!

64
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,000
You, again!

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,200
Wait! Your Majesty, please calm down.

66
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,100
Yesterday was a misunderstanding.

67
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,900
I'm not a demon hunter.

68
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,100
I heard about your fame. So I came to seek your protection.

69
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,400
Look at the gifts I brought you as a greeting.

70
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,800
- Do you like them?
- No!

71
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,200
Leave!

72
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,200
Is it not grand enough or impressive enough?

73
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,600
I can go and get some more gifts for you.

74
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,500
I said I don't like it! Leave!

75
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:58,600
Of course. As the king, you have to strike fear into the hearts of people to dominate Yuewo Village, right?

76
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,900
I'll be honest with you.

77
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,200
Since I was a child, I've always had the desire to be a villain.

78
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,100
However, I couldn't find anyone who I could share this dream with me.

79
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,700
It feels like I've been waiting for this moment until I met you today.

80
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,300
If we join forces, we can dominate the entire Yuewo Village.

81
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,800
No, the whole world will be at your feet.

82
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,200
You can go wherever you want and burn whoever you wish.

83
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,800
Burn. Burn.

84
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,600
Wait!

85
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,900
The flag of Fire King.

86
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,500
You drew me again!

87
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,500
Calm down! Calm down!

88
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,600
Your Majesty, don't be upset.

89
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,300
Don't be angry!

90
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,100
No need to be upset!

91
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,900
Oh, my. That was so scary.

92
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,500
That was really terrifying.

93
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,600
He was so scary.

94
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,000
But you're wearing the Holy Fabric, what do you have to be afraid of?

95
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,400
My heart almost dropped!

96
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,400
I was really scared!

97
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:15,900
Why did he get rid of them?

98
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,700
I wasted my effort putting those up.

99
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,000
She called me fire demon again.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,800
Keep coming.

101
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,400
Annoying me.

102
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:40,000
The time has come.

103
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:37,100

104
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,800

105
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,740
<i>Clothes.</i>

106
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,400
<i>Try it.</i>

107
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,840
<i>All right.</i>

108
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
<i>That's not how you throw it.</i>

109
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,200
<i>Swing it like this.</i>

110
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,520
<i>All right.</i>

111
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,580
<i>Have some.</i>

112
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,820
<i>Eat it. It's really tasty.</i>

113
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:08,220
<i>What's... this?</i>

114
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,000
<i>Mother!</i>

115
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,800
<i>I'll go and play with him over there.</i>

116
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,880
<i>All right. Don't come home late.</i>

117
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,580
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

118
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,820
<i>The grasshopper is ready.</i>

119
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:29,480
<i>For you.</i>

120
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,460
<i>Thank you.</i>

121
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,060
<i>You're welcome.</i>

122
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:54,200
<i>Xiao Ming is still over there!</i>

123
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,700
<i>What's going on?</i>

124
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,660
<i>Xiao Ming!</i>

125
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,720

<i>You, fire demon!</i>

133
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,540
<i>You set the fire and burned my son to death!</i>

134
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,480
<i>The fire... It wasn't me. Fire.</i>

135
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,400
<i>It's him! It's this fire demon! Beat him to death!</i>

136
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,960
<i>Fire!</i>

137
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:36,560
Only you... were nice to me.

138
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,860
But

139
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,040
fire... killed you.

140
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:46,000
Rest assured.

141
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,460
I... will put out the fire

142
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:52,280
to protect the villagers.

143
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,280
Come here!

144
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,460
I'm a fire demon. Catch me if you can.

145
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,920
I'm coming to get you!

146
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,360
I'll gobble you up!

147
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:17,120
Come and get me!

148
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,880
You can't catch me!

149
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,260
Come and get us!

150
00:15:24,260 --> 00:15:25,480
You can't catch me!

151
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,520
You missed!

152
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,560
- You missed!
- Come and get me!

153
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:39,080
I got you!

154
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,560
I caught you, fire demon!

155
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,820
No, you can't catch me!

156
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:47,680
He wants to get close to people.

157
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,560
It looks like he's not some kind of monster.

158
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,180
I'm the fire demon! I'm coming to eat you!

159
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,620
Then why didn't he explain it to the villagers?

160
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:58,880
The world says I'm a forewarning of disaster.

161
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,580
What chance did I have to reconcile and make peace with them?

162
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,700
He has a bad temper and carries a mystic flame inside him.

163
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,140
People would naturally condemn and disapprove of him.

164
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:09,720
What do we do now?

165
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:27,200
And?

166
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:31,260
I haven't received any information on his other soul shards.

167
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,640
That fire demon...

168
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,720
I mean, Fire Deity.

169
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,800
How did it go? Have you come up with a way to deal with him?

170
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,760
This Fiery is unyielding and won't be swayed by any means.

171
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:49,160
We've wasted so much of our energy.

172
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,280
I really want to bite him.

173
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,960
I pricked my fingers to make that ornament. But it was useless.

174
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,300
You don't have to do it.

175
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,860
No one is forcing you.

176
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,120
Don't yell at him.

177
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,860
I have medicine.

178
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:09,820
It's all recovered. I don't need it anymore.

179
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,520
- Just take it.
- Why...

180
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:16,000
Thank you.

181
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,160
Ziwu, why do you always take his side?

182
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:24,620
Probably... because he looks so similar to A'Cai.

183
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,120
To His Highness, the name Cai is practically an elixir for clearing his excess heat.

184
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,560
Clearing excess heat?

185
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,140
I have a plan.

186
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,380
Where are you going?

187
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,160
Where is she going?

188
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,140
Since the battle in Guixu,

189
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,740
Chaofeng has not only controlled the military power

190
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,100
but he's also associated with Wizard Chief Xiangliu.

191
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,880
His influence is growing day by day.

192
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:00,120
How can I not resent him?

193
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,880
Don't be impatient when doing great things.

194
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,940
You still have me.

195
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,080
Don't lose your composure.

196
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,860
Your Majesty, I, the Saintess, request an audience.

197
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,400
Why is that ugly creature doing here?

198
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,080
Why are you venting your anger to someone else?

199
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,740
Let her come in.

200
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

201
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,580
Stop drinking.

202
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,020
All right.

203
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,500
Greetings, Tribe Mother.

204
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,020
Your face...

205
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:49,240
Sister, your face has recovered?

206
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,040
Forgive me, Tribe Mother.

207
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:57,000
To restore my appearance, I went to Zhuoxin Hall to seek Princess Yetan for medicine.

208
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,460
Yetan?

209
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:01,120
Could it be... that you don't know about this?

210
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,700
Princess Yetan and Third Prince have established an apothecary in Zhuoxin Hall.

211
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:05,020
Apothecary?

212
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:09,920
The high officials of the court, even the Wizard Chief, have gone to seek medicine.

213
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:13,440
I was wondering how Chaofeng gained influence so quickly.

214
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,660
So he used treating illnesses as an excuse to win the people's hearts.

215
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,720
Guards.

216
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,220
Deliver my order.

217
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,260
Capture Chaofeng and Yetan immediately.

218
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,820
Yes, Your Majesty.

219
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,120
Are you scared?
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

220
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:55,320
Since I came to the Void, I only did this thing that pleased my heart.

221
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:58,060
The voidwalkers have flesh and bones.

222
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:02,080
Sometimes they can be more carefree and adorable than the immortals.

223
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:06,240
No matter if I become the Empyrean Consort or the Void Crown Princess,

224
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,260
I'm nothing but a mere mortal who cannot change the course of the world.

225
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,540
It's more practical to stick to helping people in front of me in the moment and place.

226
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,100
I made the right call for not stopping your healing practices.

227
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,220
Thank you for that.

228
00:20:23,220 --> 00:20:25,760
But I got you into trouble again.

229
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,560
You're still drawing a line?

230
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,120
<i>Go.</i>

231
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,220
The voidwalkers had never allowed healing practices.

232
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,360
Princess Yetan is in huge trouble now.

233
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,760
You're right.

234
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,840
Chaofeng and Yetan provided healing practices for others without permission.

235
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,300
Here is the evidence.

236
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,000
Please give orders to deal with them, Your Majesty.

237
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,580
You... caused trouble again.

238
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,360
I thought you'd stop causing trouble.

239
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,540
But you...

240
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,640
Your Majesty,

241
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:26,520
Chaofeng and Yetan's actions are not just about destroying public morals.

242
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,060
The art of healing is the crafty technique of the immortals to deceive the world.

243
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:34,480
Their actions of spreading the practices for the immortals is a crime of rebellion!

244
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,860
What do you suggest we do with them?

245
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:42,900
Stripping them of all their official titles and life imprisonment.

246
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,500
Royal Father, royal mother said that for you and the voidwalkers.

247
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:59,060
Royal Father, our tribe suffered heavy losses in the battle of Guixu.

248
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:03,060
I resorted to such means because I was not willing to see the loss of talents in the army.

249
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,020
The art of healing may be an invention of heaven.

250
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:08,860
But if we can use their method for our benefit, I don't see what's wrong with it.

251
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,960
I humbly ask Your Majesty to lift the ban on healing practices

252
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,200
and let Her Highness continues with her healing practices.

253
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,820
How dare you!

254
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,340
You are so manipulative.

255
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,160
So you're saying not only did you make no mistake, but you also made contributions.

256
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,400
The prohibition of healing practices was set by the ancestors.

257
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,080
How can we abolish it?

258
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:37,020
Do you want your father to disobey the ancestors?

259
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:43,040
The art of healing does have its magical effects.

260
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,220
Haven't all of you present here

261
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:49,920
experienced its miraculous effects yourselves?

262
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:56,480
I urge all of you to persuade Their Majesties for the sake of the people.

263
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:01,400
These old fogeys aren't reliable at all.

264
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:03,540
We're only going after the main offender.

265
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:05,940
We won't implicate any accomplices.

266
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:09,360
If all of you insist on protecting Chaofeng,

267
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,060
don't blame me for forgetting your place in the court.

268
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,080
Your Majesty, Princess Yetan cured my chronic head pain with her miraculous abilities.

269
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,900
I can attest to that.

270
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:30,420
Both of you and your son are of the same kind and cannot be counted on.

271
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,460
Jialouluo?

272
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,480
Princess Yetan has restored my appearance and given me a second life.

273
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:44,000
You dare to defy the Tribe Mother?

274
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,100
Your Majesty has married into the royal household.

275
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,740
Now I'm the Tribe Mother of the Snake Clan.

276
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:52,940
Your Majesty, the Snake Clan is willing to vouch for Princess Yetan.

277
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,980
Please abolish the healing practice ban.

278
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,960
Your Majesty.

279
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,580
Wizard Chief, you also...

280
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:15,660
You know I've been tormented by chronic head pain for thousands of years.

281
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,320
Princess Yetan's medicinal herbs are indeed effective.

282
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,740
That's right.

283
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:24,460
<i>We used them too. That's right.</i>

284
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:27,140
Please abolish the healing practice ban.

285
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:31,820
<i>Please abolish the healing practice ban.</i>

286
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,000
Royal Father, they're...

287
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:50,240
Since everyone thinks healing practices are effective, we'll give it a chance for now.

288
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,880
<i>Your Majesty is wise!</i>

289
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,800
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

290
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,480
Come quick, Your Majesty.

291
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,580
Come.

292
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,040
You again!

293
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,920
I'm here to apologize.

294
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:26,920
Go! Just go! If you don't, I'll burn you!

295
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,060
<i>I'll take a chance.</i>

296
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:33,500
I know you don't want to harm me or anyone else.

297
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,220
Am I right?

298
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,660
Leave!

299
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:40,980
Why don't

300
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:43,580
we forget our grudges over a drink?

301
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,700
No drink!

302
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:49,480
This is an excellent wine brewed by the human race using high-quality sorghum.

303
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,440
Smell it.

304
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,160
No! No! No!

305
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,120
I'll sit over there and drink with you, then.

306
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:31,500
Such a good wine.

307
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,600
So fragrant.

308
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:42,380
Isn't it a shame no one is here to share this good wine with me?

309
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,480
Do you like it?

310
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,680
Come here.

311
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,760
Just come. Aren't you tired from squatting?

312
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,060
I'm sure you can't feel your legs now. Just come.

313
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,140
It's good.

314
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,420
Look at you.

315
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:42,040
Don't touch me.

316
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,200
See? Nothing happened.

317
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,920
The Holy Fabric can resist fire.

318
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,980
Why are you nice to me?

319
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,200
Aren't you scared of me?

320
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,620
With your ability, would I still be alive talking to you if you wanted to kill me?

321
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:04,240
You were just born different than others, that's all.

322
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,380
I've been through that. So I understand.

323
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:10,720
The villagers don't know.

324
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,660
Rest assured. I'll make the villagers understand you.

325
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,640
No need!

326
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,100
They hate me.

327
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:19,580
Fiery.

328
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,220
Fiery?

329
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,080
You have a new name.

330
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,360
Fiery and eye-catching.

331
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,140
From now on, you have friends.

332
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,520
You have Qingheng, Ziwu, and me.

333
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,900
We're all your friends.

334
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,000
After you remove the fire from your body, those villagers will also be your friends.

335
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,260
Come here. Come

336
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,980
Come here.

337
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,640
Come.

338
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,780
Here.

339
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,360
Drink up.

340
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,780
Ziwu, did you really see Sister-in-law add medicine to Fiery's wine?

341
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:18,160
I saw her come back with a jar of wine and pour a pack of medicinal powder into his wine.

342
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,840
She said it was to help Fiery to expel heat.

343
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,900
Fiery loves wine very much.

344
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:26,240
With Kui Kui's ability, she'll definitely bring him under control.

345
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,720
She's taking too long to come back.

346
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:32,520
I don't think she's merely trying to subdue him.

347
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:33,700
<i>Medicine?</i>

348
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,940
<i>If it's effective, we can get rid of the fire demon.</i>

349
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,220
<i>I must tell the village head now.</i>

350
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,960
Cheers.

351
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,160
I didn't think there would be a day we would drink wine together.

352
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,740
You're many times better than Heartless Shaodian,

353
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:55,180
who tried to be a hero every day because you can hold your drinks better than him.

354
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,940
Heartless?

355
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:00,000
You'll know in the future.

356
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,500
Listen. You must not run away again.

357
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:05,340
It wasn't easy for me to find you.

358
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,220
Fiery.

359
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:25,080
Poison.

360
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,760
Village Head, the fire demon is indeed poisoned.

361
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,000
Let's take the chance to kill him!

362
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,940
Yes, let's go!

363
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:33,760
Kill him! Kill the fire demon! Kill him!

364
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,760
I only added medicine for expelling heat in the wine.

365
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,060
I wanted to help you to expel heat.

366
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,840
Trust me. I didn't tell them to come. Trust me! Fiery!

367
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,440
Beat the fire demon.

368
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:43,280
Stop it!

369
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:44,700
- Beat the fire demon!
- Don't hurt him!

370
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:47,700
Fire demon! Hurry!

371
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,000
Stop it!

372
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,100
Come on! We must not miss the chance! Beat the fire demon!

373
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,860
Stop it! I said, stop it!

374
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,980
Stop! Don't hurt him!

375
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,460
Hurry!

376
00:30:57,460 --> 00:31:00,900
Everyone! Listen to me! Stop it!

377
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:04,100
I said, stop it!

378
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:07,600
Miss, that demon is poisoned.

379
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,880
It's the best time to catch him.

380
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:12,120
<i>- That's right!
- Don't stop us!</i>

381
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,700
This demon has profound skills.

382
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,740
<i>If you acted blindly and provoked him, what would you do?</i>

383
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,160
I suggest all of you wait.

384
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,200
We can't wait any longer!

385
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,880
As long as the fire demon stays in our village, we'll continue to suffer each day.

386
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,020
Fellow villagers, am I right?

387
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,760
We can't wait anymore! Villagers, charge!

388
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,380
No! Stop it! What are you doing? Stop it!

389
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:35,260
Listen to me! Fellow villagers! Hurry!

390
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,140
Fellow villagers!

391
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,500
I'll pay for all your losses.

392
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,760
- Pay?
- Can you afford it?

393
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,740
Miss, you must be joking.

394
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,380
The fire demon has lived in our village for a year!

395
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:53,200
Do you know how much our losses are?

396
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,060
How many fertile fields, fruit trees,

397
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:57,980
- water sources, and animals have we lost? Can you afford it all?
<i>- That's right!</i>

398
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,820
You want to make a loss here?

399
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:03,740
- That's right!
- That's right. She won't do it.

400
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,120
So what if I make losses?

401
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,160
Whether it's making a contract or writing a life-and-death agreement, I'll pay.

402
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:12,680
Chief, this young lady has an exceptional aura.

403
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,980
She's not an ordinary person.

404
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:17,880
If they can pay us, it won't hurt to wait a few more days before we go after the demon.

405
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,720
<i>Fine. I'll trust you this once.</i>

406
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,160
But listen here.

407
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:27,680
If you don't compensate when our village suffers another great loss,

408
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,580
we'll find another way to deal with the demon.

409
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,620
Am I right, fellow villagers?

410
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,420
Yes! We'll find another way if you don't compensate.

411
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,040
We'll trust her this once. Let's go!

412
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,700
Come on.

413
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,400
- Let's go.
- We'll trust her this once.

414
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,540
- Are you all right?
- Are you all right, Sister-in-law?

415
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Let's go first.

416
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,620
Be careful.

417
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,480
Hurt me.

418
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,280
But help me.

419
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:18,780
Why?

420
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,760
Are you better now, Sister-in-law/

421
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,920
She's not very clever.

422
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:28,680
We're still sneaking fruits from the temple ourselves.

423
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:32,100
I can't believe you promised to compensate for the entire village's losses.

424
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,900
So what now? Are you planning to rob?

425
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:36,020
Where are you going to get that much money, huh?

426
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,800
With a thing like the Iridescent Eyes in me, would I dare to commit a crime?

427
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,820
I'm glad you know that.

428
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:47,160
But how do we get money for free in this world without doing anything illegal?

429
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:52,200
There is. Our own home.

430
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:56,220
I'm familiar with your house. I'll go with you.

431
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,800
No need. There'll be too many people.

432
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,460
We'll split up and get things done. Leave Fiery to me.

433
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:06,260
I'll leave other soul shards to all of you.

434
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:09,620
That's a good idea. We won't be of much help even if we stay.

435
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,940
Di Lanjue and Man Man can stay here to look after Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law.

436
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:16,420
Ziwu and I will continue searching for Eldest Brother's whereabouts.

437
00:34:17,475 --> 00:34:21,080
<i>[Rixi Palace]</i>

438
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:23,100
Weeds have grown in Kui'er's medicinal fields.

439
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,380
It must be because the palace servants don't recognize medicinal herbs.

440
00:34:26,380 --> 00:34:29,660
Deliver my decree. Let the imperial physicians inspect the medicinal field often.

441
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:31,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

442
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,240
Since Princess Qingkui went to the immortals,

443
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,760
Your Majesty often comes here to see her belongings, to comfort your longing heart.

444
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,250
It's truly moving.

445
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:42,425
<i>[Zhaolu Hall]</i>

446
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,700
Your Majesty.

447
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,580
It's getting late. You should go back and rest.

448
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:57,740
All right. Let's return to the palace.

449
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,740
It's me.

450
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:19,520
Di Lanjue? Are you all right?

451
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,000
I told you to watch Fiery. Why are you here?

452
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,060
Man Man is watching Fiery.

453
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,660
Besides, when have I ever missed out when you do something bad?

454
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:31,180
Old rules. You take action, I keep watch.

455
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,500
I'll signal with wolf howls.

456
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,700
- Go.
- Sorry about that.

457
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:43,675
<i>[Qinzheng Hall]</i>

458
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,740
What is this that you have to hide in the cabinet?

459
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,420
<i>Why are you grinding so many wood blocks?</i>

460
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,740
<i>To make chess pieces.</i>

461
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:02,820
<i>Shouldn't there be characters on them?</i>

462
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,440
<i>What should I carve on the chess pieces?</i>

463
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,740
<i>You grind it very well.</i>

464
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:20,960
<i>Is it a gift you prepared for Imperial Father's birthday?</i>

465
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,540
<i>I'm not preparing his birthday gift.</i>

466
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,160
<i>I made them for fun.</i>

467
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,460
<i>So are you going to teach me or not?</i>

468
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:29,875
<i>[General]</i>

469
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:38,000
<i>When imperial father comes here to teach me chess, why don't you come and learn, too?</i>

470
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:41,960
<i>He doesn't even want to see me.</i>

471
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,560
<i>I'm sure he won't let me.</i>

472
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:50,640
<i>Yetan.</i>

473
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:53,060
<i>Imperial Father.</i>

474
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,600
<i>Good girl.</i>

475
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:58,820
<i>Why are you here?</i>

476
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,080
<i>If you don't want to learn, that's fine, but why do you have to influence your sister as well?</i>

477
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:04,480
<i>It wasn't her. I wanted to make them.</i>

478
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,980
<i>I asked Tan'er to help me out.</i>

479
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,740
<i>You're such a good girl.</i>

480
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:16,800
<i>If you want to learn how to play chess, you can just tell me.</i>

481
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,420
<i>Why bother wasting your energy and time on this?</i>

482
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:33,540
<i>I'm sure he thinks Qingkui made these.</i>

483
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:38,360
<i>If he knew I made these, these would have been discarded like worn-out shoes.</i>

484
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,700
Are these enough?

485
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:03,320
Yes, for this month.

486
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,660
You still owe for the past ten months or so.

487
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,440
Miss, let me explain it to you.

488
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,900
This fire demon has been here for a year,

489
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,620
and he has destroyed over 50 mu of fertile land

490
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,320
and over a thousand fruit trees.

491
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,180
Please look at this.

492
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:20,680
Am I supposed to compensate you, or rebuild Yuewo Village, huh?

493
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,720
You said you'd compensate us.

494
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:25,020
We only wanted to get rid of the demon.

495
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,160
<i>- Exactly.
- That's right. That's what we wanted.</i>

496
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:29,460
We never wanted your money.

497
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,800
Miss, you can just be honest if you're not satisfied.

498
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,100
We can ask for help from elsewhere.

499
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,320
No! I'll pay.

500
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,040
As long as he stays here, I'll compensate for all the losses he caused.

501
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,140
Don't ask for help from elsewhere.

502
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,780
All right.

503
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,800
Are these enough?

504
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,840
Yes.

505
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,840
How can it cost so much to search for his soul shards?

506
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,440
<i>- Your mount, the divine bull, was eaten by Princess Qingkui.
- What?</i>

507
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:19,900
<i>I'll leave a branch of the silver moon cypress as compensation for my guilt.</i>

508
00:40:19,900 --> 00:40:22,400
<i>Consider it as compensation from me.</i>

509
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,840
<i>It was me who made him angry before.</i>

510
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:28,340
<i>Now I have to run around for him and endure being ignored.</i>

511
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,820
<i>Retribution will have its way.</i>

512
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,240
<i>Every bad decision sure comes with consequences.</i>

513
00:40:55,325 --> 00:40:56,775
<i>[Apothecary]</i>

514
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,540
Please come in.

515
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,100
All right.

516
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,760
- Tan'er.
- Sister.

517
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:07,400
After the ban was lifted, you can finally open the apothecary without hindrance.

518
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,880
That's because of your great help.

519
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,920
Now, the influential and powerful people in the Void seek medicine from your apothecary.

520
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,360
Don't forget me when you're successful in the future.

521
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,420
I wouldn't forget you.

522
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,060
Tan'er!

523
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,420
- Your Highness.
- Tan'er, I came as soon as I received the news.

524
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:28,120
I never thought you could give the Empress such a blow.

525
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,960
It's truly satisfying.

526
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:33,280
I specially brought these furs to congratulate you.

527
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,780
Well...

528
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,380
Eldest Brother!

529
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,540
Eldest Brother, this fur belongs to a living being.

530
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:45,020
How could you let these innocent creatures suffer for your personal gain?

531
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:48,780
You must understand that without trade, there would be no killing.

532
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:51,180
You should take the fur back.

533
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,960
I didn't see you holding yourself back during hunting in the past.

534
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,100
Besides, it's for Tan'er.

535
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,780
Why are you being nosy? Move aside.

536
00:41:58,780 --> 00:42:02,640
Your Highness, fur is indeed not proper.

537
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,460
Why don't you take it back with you?

538
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:06,360
I...

539
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,940
Do you not know how I feel?

540
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:10,580
I...

541
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,900
I like you...

542
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,100
Your Highness, what did you say?

543
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,680
I...

544
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,260
I said... I like you...

545
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,000
I like you!

546
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:34,420
Like you!

547
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:40,380
I like you!

548
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:21,580
