<i>Princess Qingkui. I knew you'd try to escape.</i>

21
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,830
<i>The law here is absolute.</i>

22
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,510
<i>Your action won't be tolerated!</i>

23
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:21,100
<i>I can't take it anymore! I'll tell you the truth!</i>

24
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,000
<i>I'm Yetan, not Qingkui! My sister is in the Void Realm!</i>

00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,280
<i>Take this thing off of me and let me go!</i>

26
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,220
<i>I'm not Qingkui!</i>

27
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,100
<i>I'm Yetan!</i>

28
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,453
<i>Sister...</i>

29
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,560
<i>Tan'er. I was switched to the other sedan because of you.</i>

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,300
<i>How could you expose your real identity so recklessly and put me in harm's way?</i>

31
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,120
<i>Sister, I...</i>

32
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,820
<i>No!</i>

33
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,340
No!

34
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,300
Tan Tan! Tan Tan!

35
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,760
Tan Tan! Are you all right?

36
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:13,300
You were hunted and bound by the Iridescent Eyes.

37
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,150
Maybe you're exhausted.

38
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,753
Qingkui... The voidwalkers are bloodthirsty.

39
00:03:18,753 --> 00:03:20,620
She has no power.

40
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,380
Forget about Qingkui. You should take care of yourself!

41
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:25,120
The Empyrean planted the Iridescent Eyes on you.

42
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,640
You yourself are in deep water. Forget about Qingkui!

43
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,540
Curse that Heartless Shaodian! He's the cause of everything!

44
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,000
It hurts...

45
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:42,053
It hurts.

46
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,713
What are you...

47
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,100
What about the pain?

48
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:22,080
<i>Oh, Qingkui. Your rashness put Tan'er and the Third Prince in danger.</i>

49
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,400
<i>[Are you safe?]</i>

50
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,740
Sorry, it was unexpected.

51
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,331
I didn't get the chance to tell you that I'm all right.

52
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,200
<i>[Are you alright?]</i>
<i>[Yes.]</i>

53
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,813
<i>[Me too.]</i>

54
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:08,320
<i>The Third Prince is imprisoned because of the wedding.</i>

55
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,360
<i>Tan'er and I are on our own.</i>

56
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,260
<i>I must proceed with extreme caution.</i>

57
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,800
<i>[Just stay.]</i>

58
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,340
"Just stay?"

59
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,780
Qingkui wants us to play along with the mistake?

60
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,140
What do you think?

61
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:34,540
It's foolish! Utterly foolish!

62
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,320
Whether it's Dingyun or Wu Dai, it's me they wanted dead.

63
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:39,500
She has no reason to take the risk for me!

64
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,220
Besides, given her incompetence, how can she survive on her own?

65
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,680
Calm down for now.

66
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,840
I think Qingkui has a point.

67
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,820
She made the decision, meaning she is safe in the Void Realm.

68
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,160
But you? You're restricted by Shaodian Youqin here and a wanted fugitive in the Void Realm.

69
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,880
You are much safer staying here.

70
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,541
That is true enough, but I can't let her take all the risks on her own.

71
00:06:02,541 --> 00:06:04,920
What else can you do?

72
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:12,090
<i>Imperial Father, I, Qingkui, have gone against your teachings. Our sedans got swapped during the bride-receiving day.</i>

73
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:18,030
Tan'er, don't worry.

74
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:20,700
I will become a great crown princess in your place.

75
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,000
I won't draw any suspicion.

76
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,873
Tan'er.

77
00:06:31,873 --> 00:06:35,580
I may be trapped in the Void Realm,

78
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:42,231
but knowing that you are safe in the Heavenly Realm is enough to ease my worries.

79
00:06:42,231 --> 00:06:46,100
That fool! I didn't ask for your decision.

80
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:53,500
<i>I thought I understood what you've been through in the Human Realm.</i>

81
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:59,440
<i>But after arriving at the Void Realm, I was shunned.</i>

82
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,500
<i>Only then did I realize what you went through.</i>

83
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:05,140
Thankfully, it was me who came here.

84
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:08,071
At least you won't become an outcast here.

85
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,093
I am trapped here with no means to escape.

86
00:07:12,093 --> 00:07:13,780
Take good care of yourself.

87
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,700
I'll turn the situation around when I get the chance.

88
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:21,480
I'll save you from the Void Realm and give you a peaceful life.

89
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,460
My dear Tan'er...

90
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:35,740
That fool! A hopeless fool!

91
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:39,580
Your sister went to great lengths to save you.

92
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,580
It was my goal to reach the Void Realm. I can't let her take it from me.

93
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,041
I must find a way to leave this place.

94
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:50,800
Can't you be honest for once?

95
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,120
You clearly want to save your sister. You're worried sick.

96
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:57,001
Do you have to act tough right now?

97
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:00,893
But how does that thing work?

98
00:08:00,893 --> 00:08:02,773
This thing?

99
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,280
It's just a magic item.

100
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,540
I've known Di Lanjue for years. I can figure it out.

101
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,860
You mean to undo it yourself?

102
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,020
The best thing about me

103
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,920
is that I won't surrender!

104
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,513
Will this even work?

105
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,573
Over there!

106
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,680
I hate to say this, but it's now a fact.

107
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,613
I... surrender.

108
00:09:08,613 --> 00:09:10,740
Buddy, don't give up now.

109
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,860
Even if my Young Master Di Lanjue whose knowledge about magic items is second to none,

110
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,200
we can't do much without fine materials.

111
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,020
Fine materials? Where do we get them?

112
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:23,940
The experienced craftsmen from the Beast Realm say

113
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:29,720
that the fine materials needed to make magic items are all within Jade Deity's Land of Nature.

114
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:34,340
Your Highness!

115
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:36,880
Get down here!
<i>[Land of Nature]</i>

116
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,080
Don't touch that!

117
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,400
This is the Drizzle Obsidian.

118
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,080
It's a pebble.

119
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,160
- Meteorite of Concealment!
- Be careful!

120
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,740
Xuanwu Crystal!

121
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:56,760
It's only a piece of junk.

122
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,120
Your Highness!

123
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,620
Princess Qingkui. How may I help you today?

124
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:05,410
Was the gift underwhelming to you?

125
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:09,280
These are materials used to forge magic items. You have no use for them.

126
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:13,873
I didn't, but that jerk put this item inside me...

127
00:10:13,873 --> 00:10:15,613
Iridescent Eyes?

128
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:18,780
That is His Highness' ultimate treasure. Why do you have it?

129
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,580
You know this item?

130
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:23,833
If you do, please get rid of it.

131
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,740
Well... It's His Highness' ultimate treasure.

132
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,400
I should stay out of this.

133
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,760
Look. You may go back for now.

134
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,760
I have a few things to take care of afterward.

135
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,120
If you won't help, I must do it myself.

136
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,800
I'm borrowing these things. I'll return them.

137
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,700
Hey!

138
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,553
<i>Quick!</i>

139
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,660
Your Highness, you mustn't go there.

140
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:07,820
So, you're meeting them for gambling?

141
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,480
Nonsense, young lady.

142
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,240
I thought the formation of this game is a remarkable piece of art from the Human Realm.

143
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,580
My friends and I are studying it.

144
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:20,500
So, why are you using the spirit bead as your chips?

145
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,440
Well... Since you saw right through it, I'll just admit it.

146
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,660
Your Highness, gambling is banned here.

147
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:29,340
Please do not tell anyone.

148
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:30,620
Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us.

149
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:32,280
Do not tell anyone about this, please.

150
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:34,700
What are the odds? I know a great deal about mahjong.

151
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,660
Perhaps I could show you the wonders of this game.

152
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,060
What do you think?

153
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,920
<i>Are you serious?</i>

154
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,360
Yes. Come on, sit down.

155
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,220
Go!

156
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:47,460
The three of us were clueless for days.

157
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:51,940
Thanks to you, we finally learned the wonders within!

158
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:55,700
This game called mahjong is indeed a lot of fun!

159
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:01,420
Thunder Deity, can you please not let out the thundering smell while playing?

160
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,200
I've been controlling thunder for ages. It's an old habit.

161
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,480
When I get excited, I...

162
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,740
I let it roar.

163
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,700
Master. What is your job here?

164
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,140
Do you make pills?

165
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:13,660
Something along the line.

166
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:17,380
Who knows if they are dedicated or just weird people?

167
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,680
Come on, let's keep playing.

168
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,040
Rain Deity. What do you do here?

169
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,660
I take care of the Jade Pool.

170
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,780
I'm in charge of prayers and resolving disasters.

171
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:27,800
Disasters?

172
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,360
- Nine Bamboo!
- Pong!

173
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:37,700
With that thing in you, the pain gets worse every time you cast a tile.

174
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:42,600
The Empyrean Consort is risking her life for the game.

175
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,940
<i>I'm still waiting for you to help me get rid of this cursed item.</i>

176
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,120
<i>Of course, I must play along.</i>

177
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,840
For your enjoyment, I'm all in.

178
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:52,000
Come on! Pong!

179
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,300
Over here. The item is sentient.

180
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,240
You're breaking the Heavenly Rules here, so it's upset.

181
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,460
Try complimenting its owner.

182
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,740
Perhaps that could ease the pain.

183
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,540
You want me to compliment that rascal?

184
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:06,373
Not a chance!

185
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,880
Empyrean Xuanshang, aren't you ever so dashing and delicate,

186
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,780
dapper and righteous?

187
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,340
Well? Do you feel better now?

188
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:24,880
It doesn't hurt, but I feel like throwing up.

189
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:30,660
Masters, I'm having a rough time with this game.

190
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,460
Could you do me a favor and help me get rid of this thing?

191
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,400
I'll break it to you.

192
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,140
This thing is His Highness' ultimate item.

193
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:44,540
Without his permission, we can't do anything even if we want to.

194
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:51,020
That's right. If I remember correctly, the ultimate item was forged with his primordial spirit.

195
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:57,520
If he doesn't want to undo it, the thing will only be removed if his soul perishes. Am I right?

196
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:59,420
- That's right.
- I've also heard that.

197
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:02,911
Do you mean he must die for this thing to come off?

198
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,220
Oh no. All hopes are lost.

199
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,940
We've only played one round. It's far from over.

200
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:14,220
I bet the Iridescent Eyes are just the result of your daily squabble.

201
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:18,420
Someday, His Highness might be in the mood to undo it for you.

202
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:22,060
Time flies like a galloping stallion.

203
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,780
Back then, Youqin was just a little kid.

204
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:26,200
He'd come to my place and have fun there.

205
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:29,600
I still remember that playful boy.

206
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,380
In the blink of an eye, he got married!

207
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,740
That's unbelievable.

208
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:37,000
Thunder Deity. You can stop lying to yourself.

209
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:42,180
The young Youqin loved climbing on the peach trees in my lush garden the most.

210
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,000
He wouldn't go home unless the Heavenly Empress told him to go home.

211
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,220
Enough. You both got it wrong.

212
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:49,860
I was the closest to him back then.

213
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,700
He came here after he first learned to walk.

214
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,260
- He learned spells...
<i>- That Heartless Shaodian was very close with these masters.</i>

215
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:57,940
- <i>Fortune favors me.</i>
- It was me!

216
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:02,040
<i>Heartless Shaodian, you'll suffer my incoming onslaught!</i>

217
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,900
You are all right.

218
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:07,321
I'll play with you to your hearts' content!

219
00:15:07,321 --> 00:15:08,980
<i>Come on! Let the game begin!</i>

220
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,160
<i>Come on.</i>

221
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,740
Greetings, Celestial Mother.

222
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,500
You accepted the punishment on Qingkui's behalf.

223
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,900
How are the wounds?

224
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:26,820
Celestial Mother, I understand.

225
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,360
Everyone knows about the trouble Qingkui caused.

226
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:33,480
You worried that your father would punish Qingkui for running off to the Human Realm.

227
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,340
You then accepted punishments for failing to educate her.

228
00:15:36,340 --> 00:15:40,580
It was my fault for failing to keep her in check.

229
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:44,460
From what I see, it's fine if she is a little playful.

230
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,480
This realm can be boring. It lacks gaiety.

231
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:51,000
Besides, you were a naughty kid once.

232
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,500
Don't you remember? When Youqin was little, he secretly cut my hair.

233
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,140
I was so embarrassed to let anyone see it.

234
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:01,460
Of course. When His Majesty was taking a nap,

235
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,460
His Highness used an amplification to broadcast his snoring to the entire realm.

236
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:07,513
And there was...

237
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,500
I was immature.

238
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,020
I'm sorry that I've made you worry.

239
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,960
I'd rather suffer your mischief than seeing you become so disciplined and lifeless.

240
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,060
Over the millennia you were training in seclusion, I often thought about your childhood mischief.

241
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:29,440
If you hadn't been sent to repair the Guixu,

242
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,480
if you could be like other immortals and grow up without any burdens, wouldn't that be great?

243
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,720
But ever since you completed your training, I’ve came to realize

244
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,270
that the Youqin I once knew is gone for good.

245
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,840
♫ <i>The flames illuminate the dark night</i> ♫

246
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:59,720
<i>Silences surrounds the world</i> ♫

247
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,540
♫ <i>The starlight fades away</i> ♫

248
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:05,160
♫ <i>The living stands in fear</i> ♫

249
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,100
♫ <i>Wake me up from this nightmare</i> ♫

250
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:11,220
♫ <i>I see through your blushing</i> ♫

251
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:17,100
♫ <i>The thought of you in this world urges me to make a decision</i> ♫

252
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:19,880
♫ <i>Entrusted to me the gale and flame</i> ♫

253
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,680
♫ <i>This farewell leaves me in pain</i> ♫

254
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:25,460
♫ <i>I am fearless when I take a drive into the abyss for you</i> ♫

255
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:28,960
♫ <i>I'll defend death to be with you</i> ♫

256
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,560
<i>Wonderful.</i>

257
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:34,420
<i>When I leave the Land of Mystery, I teach Qingheng this technique.</i>

258
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,920
<i>Mother will be glad too.</i>

259
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:44,080
<i>How many other things should I tell them when I leave? </i>

260
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,600
<i>Qingheng and Ziwu will already be adults by then. </i>

261
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:52,100
<i>Would they even be interested to know? </i>

262
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,320
Celestial Mother, is that...

263
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:29,973
Youqin.

264
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:33,260
I was looking for you.

265
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,620
Celestial Father.

266
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:39,180
Did you put the Iridescent Eyes on Princess Qingkui?

267
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:40,180
Yes.

268
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:44,740
Iridescent Eyes can only restrict her behaviors, not change her personality.

269
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:48,060
If she ends up using flattery and deception to her advantage, what will you do then?

270
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:50,940
The Princess is new to this place.

271
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,440
Please be more lenient with her.

272
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,220
Aren't you ever so merciful?

273
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,760
You would even tolerate her unacceptable behaviors like wearing a garter on her head.

274
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,680
It's no wonder she's become so audacious.

275
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,480
Celestial Father. I've looked into it.

276
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,080
She acted that way because she missed her family.

277
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,480
So... So you took the punishment on her behalf?

278
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,300
Is that your way to silence
the gossip circling around?

279
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:22,480
Qingkui is your consort, but you can't spoil her.

280
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,340
Otherwise, people will think you're incapable of managing your family.

281
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:29,480
I will definitely keep Qingkui in check.

282
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,940
Celestial Father, Celestial Mother, you need not worry.

283
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,673
Good.

284
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,020
- I win!
- She won again.

285
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,280
Oh, no.

286
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,020
Is this what they call Three Dragons?

287
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:47,953
Oh, no. It's over.

288
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:59,040
Masters, you now owe me over six million spirit beads.

289
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:04,640
Are you going to pay with the spirit bead or mortgage your magic items?

290
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,520
<i>Be careful with these!</i>

291
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,260
Slow down.

292
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,693
<i>Take it easy.</i>

293
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:15,280
Come here.

294
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,640
Well... Take the Azure Bull to Zhang Guolao's place.

295
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,660
Tell him I got bored of the bull. Get me his donkey instead.

296
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,220
I'll try riding it while sitting backward.

297
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:25,560
Yes.

298
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:28,000
She is digging into your door!

299
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,160
What...

300
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:32,600
This is... Stop!

301
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:36,800
Your Highness. These are inlaid glass pearls.

302
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,420
It's part of the door.

303
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,520
Do not ruin such a precious creation.

304
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,580
Great. I should take down the door too.

305
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:44,980
You want the door?

306
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,000
Master. Don't be sad.

307
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,833
Check this out.

308
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,420
The air outside is refreshing.

309
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:58,320
It's much easier to enjoy the northwesterly.

310
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,340
But the door faces south.

311
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:07,181
When you get rid of the Iridescent Eyes for me, I will return these treasures to you.

312
00:21:07,181 --> 00:21:08,900
See you.

313
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,533
But...

314
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,100
My family and friends, cherish your life.

315
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,700
Stay away from gambling.

316
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,560
To think I'd lose everything I have at this age!

317
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,620
How disheartening.

318
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,660
Hey, you. Get me a coat.

319
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:31,920
He's getting you the donkey. Even your closet was taken away.

320
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:35,600
Go to my place and get him a coat.

321
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,460
We lost even more than he did.

322
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:40,360
How are we supposed to live?

323
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,080
Oh, no!

324
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,180
It's the same with us.

325
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,620
Did we just get blackmailed?

326
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,420
Did we?

327
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:52,820
We got blackmailed!

328
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,240
His Majesty must know! I must report this to His Majesty!

329
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,340
No.

330
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:02,100
If he finds out we were gambling, we'll be punished by the Heavenly Thunder!

331
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:04,100
Are you even strong enough to take it?

332
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:05,260
You can't.

333
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,660
- What do we do now?
- What now?

334
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,000
We must do as she says.

335
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,020
Let's go to His Highness.

336
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,540
Cursed Chaofeng. He killed Zhu Jiuyin while I was away.

337
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:25,100
Your Highness. Mr. Zhulong's rank was low. Chaofeng turned himself in.

338
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,800
When he finishes his sentence, Mr. Zhulong will have died in vain.

339
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,200
Are you telling me what to do?

340
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:32,700
I... I wouldn't dare.

341
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:39,600
Do you think I'd let him get away with it?

342
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,000
I'll return to the Void Realm at once and ask Royal Mother to have Royal Father try Chaofeng.

343
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,100
Zhu Jiuyin will not die for nothing.

344
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:50,400
Your Highness, should we...

345
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,300
You should do your job accordingly.

346
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:57,400
Go to the border guards.

347
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:03,100
Why should we be afraid of the nobody, Chaofeng?

348
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,600
Our top priority is to subdue Wu Dai!

349
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,300
<i>Yes!</i>

350
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:16,730
<i>[Cave of Haunted Souls]</i>

351
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,590
Have you had enough?

352
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:28,300
<i>I heard the enforcer of the Cave of Haunted Souls is very cruel.</i>

353
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,600
<i>He enjoys torturing people.</i>

354
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,200
<i>Everyone who goes in will suffer excruciating pain.</i>

355
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,600
<i>His Highness will be put through a meat grinder.</i>

356
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,500
<i>The Third Prince is suffering for protecting me.</i>

357
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:55,900
<i>If anything happens to him in the cave, I can never repay his kindness.</i>

358
00:23:58,020 --> 00:24:01,400
No mortals have ever come to this cave.

359
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,500
Miss, you're a brave one.

360
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,800
I am Princess Yetan. I came to visit someone.

361
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,800
It's Her Highness.

362
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,100
I hate to break it to you, but no visitors are allowed here.

363
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,600
Unless...

364
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,500
Please do me a favor.

365
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,900
Take me to the Third Prince.

366
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,600
All right.

367
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,400
Hold on.

368
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:30,400
Who are you visiting again?

369
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,900
The Third Prince?

370
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,400
Yes.

371
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,900
But...

372
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,100
Well... Well...

373
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,900
Well...

374
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:57,700
Sirs, do you like the food?

375
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,600
Should I summon a few pretty ladies to keep you company?

376
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,000
No need.

377
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Don't tell the Lady of Luowei Grotto that I was sent here.

378
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,000
My royal mother is ill. She'd be worried about me.

379
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,200
Yes, Your Highness.

380
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,900
Ever since you took over the Void Patrol Battalion, you've never come to this rundown cave.

381
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,600
May I know what brought you here today?

382
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:21,000
His Highness sold himself out to cover up for his own lies.

383
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,200
No way. He's told more lies than the number of prisoners here.

384
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,900
He always covers his lies.

385
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,600
I should stuff your mouth.

386
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:30,700
It's time to get working.

387
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:50,800
Your Highness! What was that for?

388
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,200
This cave is a vile place.

389
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,400
If I went out unscathed, people would suspect.

390
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,500
You're meticulous, Sir.

391
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:01,000
Your Highness, I've followed you for years.

392
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,000
I wanted to go to war with you.

393
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:06,100
But after so many years, I've never slain any enemy.

394
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:09,400
I only used all my strength to beat you up.

395
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,700
Enough chitchat. Again.

396
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,300
Eat this! Eat this!

397
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,000
Eat this!

398
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,700
- Eat...
- Sir!

399
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,200
Sir, we have a visitor.

400
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,700
You said my mother doesn't know about this.

401
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:26,100
I've never told her... Your Highness, it's not Consort Xue.

402
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,500
Your Highness, it's not Consort Xue.

403
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,200
It's Princess Yetan.

404
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:37,300
Sir. I'm new to this place. I don't have too much money on me.

405
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,100
Would you accept my jewelry instead?

406
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,900
But... Please don't make things difficult for me.

407
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,600
This is all that I can spare.

408
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,800
Please do me a favor and let me through.

409
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,000
But...

410
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,800
Your Highness, I can't let you through!

411
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:55,800
You want more?

412
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:57,500
No!

413
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,500
She'd come here alone just for me.

414
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,700
I have a pair of earrings.

415
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,600
She is a simple girl, but she has a heart of gold.

416
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,200
Your Highness was sidelined by your family for years.

417
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,000
You've never met anyone as kind as her, right?

418
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,400
What are you trying to say?

419
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,500
- Your Highness...
- Please, help me out.

420
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:18,400
Your Highness, I can't.

421
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
The Second Prince is upset and will make a move soon.

422
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,600
The power struggle is perilous.

423
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,400
How could you drag her into this mess?

424
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,900
The Crown Princess of the Void Realm plays an important role.

425
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,900
It's a shame not to make use of her.

426
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:32,800
However,

427
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,500
I am slowly growing more fond of Princess Qingkui.

428
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,100
I can't help you!

429
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,800
Please, Sir!

430
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,900
I'm begging you!

431
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,800
Let her through.

432
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,700
Please leave.

433
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Do it.

434
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Sir. Please accept this, too. I'm begging you.

435
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,900
- I'm begging you.
- I can't take this!

436
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,400
Please. Do me a favor.

437
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,000
<i>[A Beauty With a Heart of Gold]</i>

438
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,600
Masters, what is this for?

439
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,300
We came here on Princess Qingkui's behalf.

440
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,000
When she first arrived, I could tell right away

441
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,000
she was born a prodigy.

442
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:26,400
But you've never mentioned it before.

443
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:30,300
Due to some circumstances, we had a great time talking to Her Highness.

444
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:35,700
We all agree that she has a brilliant mind and a merciful heart.

445
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:40,500
We came to congratulate you for marrying such a fine wife.

446
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,000
I am genuinely surprised by your opinion of her.

447
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,500
She also told us that you used your ultimate item to help her acclimate to her new life here,

448
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:55,900
which was the item known as the Iridescent Eyes.

449
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,400
I thought she'd resent me for it.

450
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,500
Surprisingly, she understands I mean well.

451
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,600
The method was effective.

452
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:07,900
She shall wear it for an even longer time.

453
00:29:09,540 --> 00:29:10,400
You got it all wrong.

454
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:12,200
- That is not necessary.
- You got the wrong idea.

455
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:17,700
Her Highness thinks that using the Iridescent Eyes to monitor her is a display of distrust.

456
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,100
She weeps every day because of it.

457
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,200
It pains us to see her cry.

458
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,100
You two will spend ages with each other.

459
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,900
Are you going to let the Iridescent Eyes become what binds you?

460
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,700
Speaking from experience, I...

461
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:33,400
We are requesting that Your Highness

462
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:37,800
<i>undo the Iridescent Eyes for her.</i>

463
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:45,100
Did Princess Qingkui send you here to persuade me?

464
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,200
<i>No.</i>

465
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,100
Your Highness, we are speaking from the bottom of our hearts.

466
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,200
Are you saying you don't trust us anymore?

467
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,500
That is not the case.

468
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,500
But you're acting weird today.

469
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,300
You never go anywhere without your whisk.

470
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:03,500
Where is it now?

471
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,400
And you. You are particular with your appearance.

472
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:13,400
If I'm not seeing things, that hairpin you're wearing is a twig.

473
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,000
And there is this plaque.

474
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,800
It looks to me like the rotten board you used to stabilize the forge in the Land of Nature.

475
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,400
How observant of you.

476
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,500
Masters, are you going to come clean or not?

477
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,000
<i>You're the eldest here.</i>

478
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Go!

479
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,400
We gathered around and gambled a little.

480
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,400
That's all.

481
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:42,000
What? Gambling is banned here!

482
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,400
- How could you...
- Wait.

483
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,100
We know we did the wrong thing.

484
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:49,500
Qingkui's request can be done with a flip of a palm.

485
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:52,000
If I let her get her way, I will be holding the candle to the devil!

486
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,200
If His Majesty finds out, I...

487
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,900
No!

488
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,400
His Majesty must not learn about this.

489
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,800
When you were a mere boy, you played at the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

490
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,300
You broke my Thunder Rod, but I didn't want you to get punished.

491
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,000
So I didn't report it to His Majesty.

492
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,100
I took it upon myself to fix the rod.

493
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:12,200
It cost me months of my salary!

494
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,000
Thunder Deity!

495
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,600
Poor thing!

496
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,700
Back then,

497
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,800
His Highness was playing with fire.

498
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:25,800
<i>That woman is exploiting the three masters to get to me and blackmail me.</i>

499
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:28,500
<i>This is outrageous!</i>

500
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,200
Forget it.

501
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,400
Fellow masters.

502
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Penglai Hall should cover the asset Princess Qingkui took.

503
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,100
<i>Do you mean it?</i>

504
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:50,000
If you don't mind, you can take it.

505
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:56,100
But... The amount of money she won from us is very substantial.

506
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:59,300
Your Highness, are you sure about this?

507
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:03,400
All three of you took great care of me when I was young.

508
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,800
Even if it costs me everything in this hall,

509
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,400
I will have no complaints.

510
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,600
<i>We'll hold you to that!</i>

511
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:27,580
<i>[Penglai Hall]</i>

512
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:42,420
Your Highness. Thank you for the help.

513
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:44,350
Please enjoy this cup of tea.

514
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,080
Thank you.

515
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:55,020
Is there anything else?

516
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,400
If you're done, I need the cup back.

517
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:07,160
I'm sorry it's come to this.

518
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,220
Your Highness, what... What happened here?

519
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,140
It's a long story.

520
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,400
Where were you?

521
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:29,160
Your Highness, Her Majesty is aware that Princess Qingkui is a mortal and she can't consume pure air.

522
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,420
She set up a dining area next to Tianpa Hall.

523
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:35,400
She orders to have you deliver the food to the Princess for better bonding.

524
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:38,980
She causes me trouble every day and now I must send her food?

525
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:45,030
It seems Princess Qingkui has caused another trouble again.

526
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:51,840
With all due respect, if the Iridescent Eyes can't keep her in check, you must figure something else out.

527
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,200
As the books of strategies say, "Let them have a taste of their own medicine."

528
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,160
Does Your Highness already have a plan?

529
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,780
Feichi, listen.

530
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,693
Forget it.

531
00:34:08,693 --> 00:34:14,280
If you don't figure something out, you'll... You'll lose even the robe you're wearing!

532
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,673
I...

533
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,100
I knew it wasn't a viable plan.

534
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,360
Why not? That is a brilliant plan!

535
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,480
Who would've thought that Princess Qingkui managed

536
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,880
to bring out the smart young boy you were before you went into seclusion.

537
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:35,400
Don't worry. I'll get everything prepared.

538
00:34:37,340 --> 00:34:40,600
Your Highness. For bonding.

539
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,213
Sir.

540
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:10,673
Your Highness!

541
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,300
You were punished so severely because of me.

542
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,380
Don't feel sorry about it.

543
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:21,480
The death came to light.

544
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,321
I turned myself in to my father, so Second Brother wouldn't give you a hard time.

545
00:35:25,321 --> 00:35:31,270
As long as you're safe, I will not fear... any form of punishment.

546
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,420
Thank you for defending me.

547
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:42,760
Please, stand up.

548
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,441
<i>She came to this torture chamber for me.</i>

549
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,700
<i>Perhaps she has fallen for me due to my kindness.</i>

550
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,220
<i>We killed Zhu Jiuyin and covered up the wedding that went wrong.</i>

551
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:01,020
<i>Now, I've earned myself a beautiful lady.</i>

552
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:03,300
<i>This deal is a steal.</i>

553
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,440
I now realize how kind Your Highness is.

554
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,300
I can never repay your kindness.

555
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,960
Please take off your clothes.

556
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,693
What?

557
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:16,080
I studied medicine at the Imperial Academy of Medicine.

558
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,280
I'll treat those wounds for you.

559
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,593
Hold on.

560
00:36:22,593 --> 00:36:27,120
Maybe you haven't heard, but asking for treatment is a heinous crime among our kind.

561
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:28,200
Why is that?

562
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,480
It's the knowledge of the immortals.

563
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:34,860
Throughout all ages, people pray to heaven to acquire knowledge of medicine.

564
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,860
However, this infuriated the previous Void Tyrants.

565
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:41,540
Hence, the law says that voidwalkers must not get any treatment.

566
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,140
Break the law and punishments await.

567
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:49,080
If the dispute between the two kinds keeps people from receiving treatment, that is not right.

568
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,540
Besides, an emergency calls for an exception.

569
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,140
His Highness is injured. He needs immediate medical attention.

570
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:55,340
That is true, but...

571
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,720
<i>She would violate the law of the Void Realm just to help me?</i>

572
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:02,500
- What do you think, Your Highness?
- Great.

573
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,760
Sir?

574
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,193
Yes.

575
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,000
Don't worry. I will help you get well soon.

576
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,380
I must go now.

577
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,500
Please rest well and recuperate.

578
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,440
Take care.

579
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,720
It wasn't easy getting these wounds. She almost healed them all.

580
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,480
You asked for this.

581
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,331
I could throw a few punches at you now.

582
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:13,880
Roasted leg of lamb!

583
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:18,640
Red and glittering with a tasty shine,

584
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:21,360
crispy on the outside and tender on the inside.

585
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:27,020
The texture and flavor are just right, a fusion of flavors all in one bite!

586
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:29,480
And there is the sweet and sour fish.

587
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,800
Take a good look at it.

588
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,720
That's Tianpa Hall's delicacy.

589
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:37,080
It looks great and smells
tasty, you can't miss out on it!

590
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:39,720
Sweetness and sourness are separated. Combined, they give the meat a crunch.

591
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,060
With a clove of garlic and two slices of ginger, the aroma only gets better.

592
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,060
Refreshing in summer, warming in winter.

593
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:49,220
Grab a bite and live an eternal life!

594
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:51,020
<i>[Dining Hall]</i>

595
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:08,080
Roasted leg of lamb.

596
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,713
Your Highness.

597
00:39:09,713 --> 00:39:11,980
You look uptight.

598
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:15,480
It looks great and smells tasty, you can't miss out on it!

599
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:19,180
Hawking requires the right emotion.

600
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:24,400
Otherwise, how can you entice Princess Qingkui into paying 100,000 spirit beads for one dish?

601
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,493
Take your time. We'll do it line by line.

602
00:39:27,493 --> 00:39:29,413
The first line.

603
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:34,160
Roasted leg of lamb!

604
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,280
This is beyond me. Let's try something else.

605
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:40,280
Your Highness, I know you find it embarrassing.

606
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,350
So I borrowed this from Her Majesty.

607
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,200
You used this to broadcast His Majesty's snoring to the entire...

608
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:27,700
Look at all of these.

609
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:30,380
Holy Fabric! It's said to be fireproof and waterproof.

610
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,320
It can extend based on its master's will.

611
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:34,620
This is the real deal!

612
00:40:34,620 --> 00:40:36,280
Keep it. Use it for an armor.

613
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,973
Really?

614
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:41,720
Hey, do you smell something delicious?

615
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:44,533
There is.

616
00:40:44,533 --> 00:40:46,380
Sweet-and-sour fish.

617
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,560
Roasted leg of lamb!

618
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,360
And roasted goose too!

619
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,220
Let the aroma reach every corner of the realm.

620
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,960
She'll crave the food if she smells it.

621
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:00,900
But Princess Qingkui is not a hound.

622
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:04,280
How could she follow the smell here?

623
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,680
Are we going there?

624
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,993
I'm hungry. Let's go.

625
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:12,413
Okay.

626
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:20,173
You prepared these for me?

627
00:41:20,173 --> 00:41:21,653
Yes.

628
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,453
Let's eat.

629
00:41:23,453 --> 00:41:24,973
Wait.
