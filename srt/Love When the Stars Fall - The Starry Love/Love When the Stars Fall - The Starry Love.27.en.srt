Here you go.

00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,650
Here.

29
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:06,480
Let's dig in.

30
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:15,890
Tell me. As the Empyrean Consort, if I still can't master these Abstinence Techniques, will it raise suspicion?

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,900
I won't eat.

32
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,590
Not eat?

33
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:24,550
This is the first time I've heard you say you won't eat since I've known you.

34
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:28,140
Why? Are you giving up all bodily desire just to be an Empyrean Consort?

35
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:30,670
From now on, we should not cause trouble with other immortals anymore.

36
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:35,430
Or else they'll complain about me to the Heavenly Emperor. Then Youqin will have to clean up my mess again.

37
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,260
What's the point of staying cooped up here all day?

38
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:43,330
Are we going to fold these every day?

39
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:57,720
Your Highness, ever since you returned from Fairy Biqiong's birthday banquet last night,

40
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,920
you seem to be preoccupied with something.

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,450
Is something troubling you?

42
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:06,480
Princess Qingkui said she would be more careful in the future.

43
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,710
Your Highness should be happy that she is so sensible.

44
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,110
But who wants her to be sensible?

45
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:14,920
I love her, not a virtuous Empyrean Consort.

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,610
She doesn't even like music, chess, calligraphy, painting, or etiquette.

47
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:23,660
If she is forced to do things she doesn't like and is unhappy, how can I be happy?

48
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,390
But if we let Princess Qingkui do as she pleases, Heavenly Realm will be in chaos.

49
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,150
And then, it'll be you who has to clean up the mess.

50
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,000
Have you forgotten what happened last time when she gambled with the three masters?

51
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,080
Feichi, I'm going to Tianpa Hall.

52
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,640
Find a reason to keep Guangtian busy.

53
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:47,720
I'm really having a hard time.

54
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:19,020
I'm so bored. When will Youqin finish handling his official affairs?

55
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:22,660
Look how restrained your life is as the Empyrean Consort. You can't eat or play anything all day.

56
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,520
All you can do is sit here and wait for your husband to come back.

57
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,740
Where's the demeanor of Liguang Yetan?

58
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:42,450
You're back.

59
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,440
Did you really stay in Tianpa Hall for half a day?

60
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,030
I didn't want to be discovered.

61
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:59,000
We may need to be cautious but not to this extent.

62
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,620
Come with me. I'll take you somewhere.

63
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,960
All right.

64
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:09,620
After merging the soul shards, Empyrean Xuanshang is now quite good at pleasing people.

67
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:20,800
Consort Xue, the carriage has arrived.

68
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,980
All right. Then carry all our belongings to the carriage.

69
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:25,180
All right. Sure.

70
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:30,560
<i>Scented pouch! Pendants! Trinkets for sale!</i>

Feng'er!

72
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,920
Feng'er! Stop dawdling.

73
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:35,100
Come down.

74
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,960
Consort Mother! Consort Mother!

75
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,100
Kui'er.

76
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,760
Consort Mother, Chaofeng has returned to the Void.

77
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,010
What? He returned to the Void?

78
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,030
Oh, no. The secret letter is gone.

79
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,150
- I think he left last night.
- Why are you so clumsy?

80
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:52,930
So he left this letter for me.

81
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,530
He said he couldn't bear to let the soldiers be implicated. So he decided to return and take all the blame.

82
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:01,660
He wanted me to send you to White Bamboo Valley.

83
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,830
Consort Mother, I must return and save him.

84
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,590
You can't, Kui'er.

85
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:09,760
Feng'er made a big mistake by swapping the carriages.

86
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:12,930
Now, how can I let you return to the Void?

87
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,200
Whether it's life or death, I want to be with him.

88
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,370
Then I'll return with you.

89
00:07:16,370 --> 00:07:19,090
- I'll go too.
- Me too.

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:25,470
Consort Mother, Chaofeng cares and worries about you the most.

91
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:28,270
If you go, he'll only worry more.

92
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:31,330
It's better to wait for my news outside the Void.

93
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,130
Sushui, Haichao. Please take care of Consort Xue.

94
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,230
Only I can go on this trip.

95
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,330
All by yourself?

96
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,170
That's like a sheep entering a tiger's den.

97
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,880
Your Highness, let me go back and save him.

98
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,460
The Void Patrol Battalion still has some men hidden somewhere.

99
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,200
I'll go and find them now.

100
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,350
We have no chance of winning now.

101
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,200
We'll only end up with the entire army being defeated if we fight.

102
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,830
Now,

103
00:07:54,760 --> 00:07:57,710
we can only place our hope on Void Tyrant.

104
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:00,030
- Void Tyrant?
- Your Highness...

105
00:08:00,030 --> 00:08:04,120
Haichao, use your magic to send me back to the Void.

106
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,020
Your Highness, please accept my respect.

107
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,960
Since we have nothing to do, I'll give you two a demonstration
of drawing the tiles.

108
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,380
Two Bamboos.

109
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:35,400
No, that's not right. It's definitely Two Characters.

110
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,470
Sixty Thousand?

111
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,750
This is quite far off.

112
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,020
How did Princess Qingkui manage to do it?

113
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,990
It'd be great if Qingkui is here.

114
00:08:44,990 --> 00:08:49,250
These days with one player short is really difficult to bear.

115
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:52,050
Youqin won't let her come.

116
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,450
Youqin?

117
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:59,780
Don't try to trick us again.

118
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,960
Why? Are you here to join us, too?

119
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:07,380
All you three masters, no need to hide anymore.

120
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:10,400
We came today to enjoy the game, Sparrow Mahjong, together.

121
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,920
Don't try to test me.

122
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:15,560
I remember Heavenly Realm banned gambling when I was seven years old.

123
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,550
- How could you bring him here, Little Brat?
- Nothing will happen.

124
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,490
Youqin, please spare us.

125
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:22,490
We know we were wrong.

126
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:27,280
See? It was because you were so strict that you scared the three masters.

127
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,540
You can rest assured.

128
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:31,860
We're really here to play Sparrow Mahjong.

129
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,010
- Really?
- Really?

130
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,080
This one is a Ten Thousand Character tile.

131
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,440
This one is a Bamboo tile.

132
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,180
This one is a Dot tile.

133
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,770
Can you count how many there are?

134
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,130
How much of Heartless's playing skills do you remember?

135
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,440
- Embedded in my heart.
- We'll work together later.

136
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:53,500
<i>It seems this kid really wants to play a game.</i>

137
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,340
<i>It's rare to have enough players.</i>

138
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,920
<i>Why not trust him this once and let him join?</i>

139
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:02,720
<i>After dragging Youqin into this, we won't have to worry when we play in the future.</i>

140
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,270
<i>Don't forget how many spirit beads they won from us in the beginning.</i>

141
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,560
<i>We should take advantage of Youqin being new to the game and rip him off.</i>

142
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,230
Go!

143
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,930
How dare you return?

144
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:38,450
I'm going to kill you!

145
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,660
Whether he lives or dies, Royal Father has the final say.

146
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,380
Who are you to decide?

147
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,730
Let him in.

148
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:56,470
Your Highness, what's the meaning of this?

149
00:10:56,470 --> 00:10:58,630
Is my order not clear enough?

150
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,090
Get lost!

151
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,220
Thank you, Eldest Brother.

152
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,530
I did it for Tan Tan.

153
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:13,060
Tell me where she is now.

154
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,440
I can plead with Royal Father.

155
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,380
No need, Eldest Brother. I return to end everything.

156
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:19,730
She doesn't belong in the Void.

157
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:23,790
Let her stay away from this turmoil and live in the world's most beautiful place.

158
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,540
You...

159
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,310
Greetings, Royal Father.

160
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,740
Royal Father...

161
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,470
I'll take responsibility for my actions.

162
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:23,430
I beg Royal Father to spare the warriors under my command.

163
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,990
Your mother comes from a family of criminals.

164
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,100
I elevated you to the position of Void Patrol.

165
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,990
After the battle of Guixu, I held you in even higher regard.

166
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:40,960
Is this how you repay me?

167
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,510
Royal Father. You wield great power.

168
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,610
Naturally, you wouldn't understand how difficult it is for lowly people like us.

169
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:53,470
If I can protect the ones I care about with my life, that is already fortunate.

170
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:08,540
- Who are you?
- Who's there?

171
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,900
Tan Tan? You've returned.

172
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,260
Don't harm my beloved Tan Tan!

173
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,090
Everyone, step back!

174
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:19,470
Tan Tan.

175
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:21,500
Thank you, Your Highness.

176
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,610
Where do you want to go?

177
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,210
Chaofeng has committed a capital crime. You can't barge into Fenyuan Hall.

178
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:29,800
Come with me. I'll take you to my place.

179
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,400
With me around, Royal Father will not harm you.

180
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,320
I returned to save Chaofeng.

181
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,930
You! Tan Tan!
<i>[Fenyuan Hall]</i>

182
00:13:38,930 --> 00:13:40,300
Tan Tan!

183
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,350
Stop, Tan Tan!

184
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,770
Liguang Yetan!

185
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,900
Tan Tan!

186
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,650
You shouldn't have returned.

187
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,780
You shouldn't have abandoned me.

188
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,180
How dare you return?

189
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,400
Royal Father, calm down.

190
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,350
Tan Tan was just misled by someone.

191
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,660
Second Brother's death has nothing to do with her.

192
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:08,110
Please spare her, Royal Father.

193
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:09,540
What do you mean by misled?

194
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,110
Yetan and Chaofeng have had an affair for a long time.

195
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:14,970
They are both guilty and should die!

196
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:18,400
If royal father insists on killing Tan Tan, then kill me, too.

197
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,930
You!

198
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:23,720
Void Tyrant, we were not the ones who killed Dingyun.

199
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,750
It was Empyrean Xuanshang.

200
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,930
The accusation of colluding with the immortals is groundless.

201
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:32,630
If Chaofeng did something wrong, it was because he shouldn't have offended the Void Empress,

202
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,060
and he shouldn't have fought with his siblings.

203
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,900
But who drove the Three Princes of Void to compete
for the position of Crown Prince?

204
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:43,820
And who said anyone who kills Empyrean Xuanshang will be the Crown Prince?

205
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,610
Are you saying that I caused Yun'er's death?

206
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,900
That's right. You.

207
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:50,800
<i>Tan Tan.</i>

208
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:58,830
Void Tyrant, did you notice Chaofeng's cultivation was completely destroyed when you were punishing him?

209
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:05,410
When you were sitting on the throne in the Void, did you notice that Consort Xue was almost killed by Void Empress?

210
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:10,280
Void Tyrant, you're known for your decisiveness in killing,

211
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:15,090
but you were indecisive in the matter of the Crown Prince, which led to this bloodshed.

212
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:18,470
Now, Dingyun is dead and Chaofeng is injured.

213
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:24,860
If you still refuse to stop and let Void Empress from causing trouble, the Void will never be peaceful.

214
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:31,970
What a sharp tongue!

215
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:37,630
It was clearly you who colluded with Shaodian Youqin and caused Yun'er's death!

216
00:15:37,630 --> 00:15:40,400
Yet you're trying to put the blame on me?

217
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:47,620
Void Tyrant, you promised me that you would kill Chaofeng and Yetan to give Yun'er justice.

218
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:51,300
Void Tyrant, even a fierce tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

219
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:56,910
After all these years, do you not have any fatherly affection for Chaofeng at all?

220
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,460
Do you remember who risked his life to save you during the battle of Guixu?

221
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:21,660
Void Tyrant, we don't want to fight for power or position.

222
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,000
We only ask that you spare Chaofeng's life and the lives of all the warriors of the Void Patrol Battalion.

223
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:44,220
Void Tyrant, do you really want to let Yun'er die without peace because of the son of an enslaved criminal?

224
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,880
Imprison Liguang Yetan and Chaofeng in the Cave of Haunted Souls and execute them on a chosen day.

225
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,120
- Yes, Your Majesty.
- Yes, Your Majesty.

226
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,240
Royal Father, you...

227
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,800
Move!

228
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:14,500
This is...

229
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,020
You're so amazing!

230
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:34,660
You won so many rounds.

231
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,660
I'm glad you're happy.

232
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:44,620
By the way, this Eight Treasure Glazed Vase seems to make a pair to the one I have in Penglai Hall.

233
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:47,380
No! Give it to me.

234
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,940
I want to put flowers in it and display them in Tianpa Hall.

235
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:55,920
You just said that today's success was all because of me.

236
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:59,640
Without me feeding you the winning tiles, could you have won so much?

237
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,900
That's true.

238
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:04,300
All right, then. So tell me how you want to divide the winnings.

239
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,040
Let's play a game called "Have You Ever."

240
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:12,360
If you mention something that the other person has done, the item will belong to that person.

241
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,700
If the other person hasn't done it, then the item belongs to you.

242
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
What do you think?

243
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:18,260
Do you really want to play this game with me?

244
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:22,700
I've lived two thousand years longer than you and even repaired the seal in Guixu.

245
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,160
- Then...
- So what?

246
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,280
You must not underestimate my ability.

247
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,920
- All right.
- I'll go first.

248
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,400
All right.

249
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,120
For the past 18 years, I lived half of my life in the dungeon and the other half confined in the palace.

250
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:35,700
Have you done it?

251
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,220
So it's mine.

252
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,600
I won. So I'll go again.

253
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,500
For the safety of my life, I've slept on the beams for more than ten years.

254
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,040
Have you done that before?

255
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,420
No?

256
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,640
It's mine again.

257
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:53,240
Also, when I was four years old, I was thrown into the mountains and almost didn't make it back alive.

258
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:54,960
Have you?

259
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:59,440
No? So it's mine again.

260
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,220
When I was young...

261
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:04,580
When I was young, I hurt a wet nurse before.

262
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,460
Have you?

263
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,160
You haven't?

264
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:11,860
I won again. He had never done all those things.

265
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,460
Not at all.

266
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,960
I was punished by my father

267
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,740
to kneel in front of the main hall all night when I was a child.

268
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,440
Have you?

269
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,060
Have you?

270
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,300
I won again.

271
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,940
Give it to me.

272
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,540
All these are mine.

273
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,700
Why are you looking at me like this?

274
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,980
When you told Fiery that your family didn't treat you well,

275
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:31,960
I had no idea it was this bad.

276
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,460
So this is the real life of Liguang Yetan.

277
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,480
Those are all in the past.

278
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,240
Without those experiences, I wouldn't be able to win all these from you.

279
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,920
Let's talk about something happy today.

280
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:48,740
If you really feel sorry for me, you can compensate me with something else.

281
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,280
All right. What do you want?

282
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:52,360
I want...

283
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,700
I want to learn some skills.

284
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,280
That's great, then.

285
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,640
In a few days, Shangshu Academy will start classes.

286
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,760
You can go to school.

287
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,900
It'll not only help you learn some skills, but also relieve your boredom.

288
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,040
Can I really go?

289
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,240
Man Man! Man Man! Where are my writing materials? Man Man!

290
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
Clam down. What's the rush? It's late now.

291
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,100
It's not too late to talk about it tomorrow.

292
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:17,020
I heard that Knowledge Star Deity has arranged a particularly heavy coursework this time.

293
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,400
We'll have very little time to meet.

294
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,900
Don't worry.

295
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:40,180
I'll definitely think of you when I'm there.

296
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:44,100
Well, I have something to discuss with you.

297
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,220
Today, I contributed too, right?

298
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:49,140
Can you save one for me?

299
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,900
Sure.

300
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,740
This one.

301
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,220
Get in!

302
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,500
Sir.

303
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,240
I understand.

304
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,340
Royal Father personally ordered this.

305
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,480
He even laid a formation on the dungeon gate.

306
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,800
You must not show us any special treatment.

307
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,880
Thank you for following me for so many years.

308
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,680
You and Her Highness's fates are unpredictable.

309
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,040
Even if it costs my life, I must break the rules for you this time!

310
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,940
Sir!

311
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,440
- Sir!
- Sir!

312
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,980
Void Tyrant refused to spare your life.

313
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,040
But he eventually showed mercy and spared our brothers of the Void Patrol Battalion.

314
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:09,440
We're here to thank you and Her Highness for risking your lives to save us!

315
00:23:14,033 --> 00:23:19,833
When I was 20 years old, I joined the army without Consort Mother's knowledge to earn military merit.

316
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:23,340
I started as a lowly soldier and worked my way up to where I am today.

317
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:28,880
I was fortunate enough to meet Haichao and all of you in the army.

318
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:33,720
Many of you are talented with martial arts skills that could earn you titles and high positions.

319
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,500
But you chose to stay in the Void Patrol Battalion for me.

320
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:47,700
I am grateful to everyone.

321
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,880
All brothers from the Void Patrol Battalion are here.

322
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,460
I can ask you all to bear witness.

323
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,840
What are you up to?

324
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:12,300
On my way back to the Void, I've already made up my mind.

325
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,000
Whether we live or die,

326
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:16,880
I want to be with you.

327
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:21,300
Since Void Tyrant gave us another day to live,

328
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,360
Chaofeng, let's get married.

329
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,440
- Get married?
- They're getting married?

330
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:43,120
This is the Cave of Haunted Souls, a place full of evil spirits.

331
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,340
How could I let you marry in a place like this?

332
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,940
♫ <i>If only I wander to the lighthouse of destiny with you</i> ♫

333
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:50,460
As long as I can marry you,

334
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:53,660
I'm not afraid of anything,

335
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:00,880
especially since you've forgotten that Cave of Haunted Souls is where we fell in love.

336
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:05,620
♫ <i>No matter how far it is, we'll get there</i> ♫

337
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:11,780
♫ <i>You are the crescent in my heart</i> ♫

338
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:15,540
♫ <i>My radiant light shining through the years</i> ♫

339
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,360
Your Highness is righteous!

340
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,440
I may not be able to open this gate.

341
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,500
But I can still find two or three red candles!

342
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,700
My brothers!

343
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:26,560
Let's offer our best wishes to Third Prince and Her Highness!

344
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:30,020
- All the best!
- Best wishes to you!

345
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:31,700
<i>- Congratulations!
- Best wishes to both of you!</i>

353
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,560
Who allowed you to cultivate here?

354
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,840
Have you finished sweeping?

355
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,640
The smell of the coriander is so suffocating.

356
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:34,280
I finished all the tasks assigned by the immortal master before I practiced cultivating.

357
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,680
This is the Jade Pool of the Heavenly Realm.

358
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,360
Who are you to cultivate here?

359
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,840
You were sent here to be punished. Yet you're so arrogant.

360
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,040
You disrespect your superiors and show no respect. Go somewhere else!

361
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:59,040
Are you all right?

362
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,240
- Greetings, Immortal Qingheng.
- Greetings, Immortal Qingheng.

363
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,200
I saw everything.

364
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,700
You were disrespectful to Fairy Husui and even tried to push her into the Jade Pool.

365
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,500
What is the reason for your behavior?

366
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,320
Explain yourselves.

367
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:18,100
Immortal Qingheng, she's a low-level fairy who is still being punished.

368
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,740
How could she cultivate here?

369
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:22,320
We were just reminding her.

370
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,900
Reminding her?

371
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,620
The immortal masters only punished Husui to come here to sweep.

372
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,940
They didn't tell you to bully her.

373
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,640
Your behavior is against the Heavenly Rules.

374
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,300
You should be punished!

375
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:36,840
- We're sorry.
- We're sorry.

376
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,820
We won't do it again.

377
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,220
We'll apologize to Fairy Husui.

378
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,340
Fairy Husui, please forgive us.

379
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:46,380
Immortal Qingheng.

380
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,880
Fairness and peace are the foundation of the Heavenly Realm.

381
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,440
It's unbelievable that you have no respect for the rules of immortals.

382
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,780
Therefore, I'll punish you.

383
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:58,940
Starting today, you'll take care of Fairy Husui's daily necessities.

384
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:01,040
- You want us to take care of her?
- You want us to take care of her?

385
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,720
Do you have any objections?

386
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,740
- I dare not.
- I dare not.

387
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,160
Immortal Qingheng, why did you bring me here?

388
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,900
I already know what happened.

389
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,320
After you helped us escape to the Mortal Realm, you were sent to Jade Pool to sweep.

390
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,100
<i>This is all because of me.</i>

391
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,240
<i>I'll go and talk to the supervisor to exempt you from your duties later.</i>

392
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,740
From now on, you'll serve in my hall.

393
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,860
Thank you, Immortal Qingheng.

394
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:50,440
But I didn't do it for you.

395
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:53,380
I did it for Princess Qingkui.

396
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:59,440
If you really want to help me, please send me back to Tianpa Hall.

397
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,700
All positions of attendant in Tianpa Hall are occupied.

398
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,000
Besides, Eldest Brother and Sister-in-law have been inseparable lately.

399
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,160
They don't like to be disturbed.

400
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,820
It's better for you to stay here.

401
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:11,000
Immortal Qingheng, I...

402
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,300
Fairy Husui's daily expenses will be provided by my palace.

403
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:17,740
If you dare to disrespect her again, I'll punish you by sending you to the Heavenly Ministry of Justice.

404
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:19,400
- Yes, Immortal Qingheng.
- Yes, Immortal Qingheng.

405
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:23,080
Immortal Qingheng, I'm just a low-ranking fairy and not worthy of your kindness.

406
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,580
You're worthy.

407
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,620
Stay here and I will come back and see you later.

408
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:30,940
Immortal Qingheng!

409
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:34,100
Fairy Husui, we really envy you.

410
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:38,080
Immortal Qingheng is so kind to you.

411
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,760
How did they all end up staying in the Heavenly Realm, one by one?

412
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,500
Leaving me all alone here.

413
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,960
I'm so lonely now.

414
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:18,320
<i>This will be the last time I'll take care of you.</i>

415
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:22,400
<i>Can I call you A'Cai one last time?</i>

416
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:24,120
<i>A'Cai.</i>

417
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,600
Sister Hua.

418
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,180
Your mother is here.

419
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,600
But you look a little disappointed.

420
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,780
Were you waiting for someone else?

421
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,480
No.

422
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,340
Just look at your dejected face.

423
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,520
Stop pretending already.

424
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,980
Do you think I don't know what's on your mind?

425
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,520
Take this.

426
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,020
<i>[Official Decree]</i>

427
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,380
Shangshu Academy?

428
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:12,160
I went to great lengths to secure you an opportunity to study in the Heavenly Realm.

429
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,540
Go to the Shangshu Academy and find your little Heavenly Realm Princess.

430
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,300
It's better than sulking around the mansion every day.

431
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,900
Sister Hua.

432
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,440
I can go to school again.

433
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:30,100
This year, I'll work hard to improve my magic arts.

434
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:33,520
Sister-in-law, seeing how hard you work, Qingheng and I must work even harder.

435
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,000
That's right.

436
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:38,720
Here I come!

437
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,320
Di Lanjue?

438
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:46,680
Di Lanjue, did you sneak into the Heavenly Realm again?

439
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,160
Don't be ridiculous.

440
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:50,960
I came to attend classes openly this time.

441
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:53,180
You're just everywhere.

442
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,460
Well, if that's the case, we can study together from now on.

443
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,360
Since we parted in the Beast Realm, I've been missing you every day.

444
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:05,740
I never expected my dream to come true.

445
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:08,520
I've missed you, too.

446
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,080
Let me check your official decree to prove that you really have permission to attend classes.

447
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,740
You brought all these messy things.

448
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:27,900
Are you here to cultivate or to work as a craftsman?

449
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:31,120
He's the top in the Four Realms in crafting magical tools.

450
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,300
He's really amazing.

451
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,880
All right, then. Let's go inside.

452
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,320
- Come on.
- Let's go.

453
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:03,040
Let me see.

454
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,000
I think it should be like this.

455
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,760
Princess Qingkui, why are you at Shangshu Academy?

456
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:12,200
I thought you wouldn't come to study with us because you were personally taught by His Highness.

457
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,340
It's so boring to spend time with His Highness every day.

458
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:22,200
Occasionally practicing and having fun with everyone is a good way to keep things balanced.

459
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,800
These few days, I have been recalling how skilled you were in playing the zither at my birthday banquet.

460
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,780
My skills are really inferior.

461
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:42,120
I really want to ask for some guidance in playing the zither so loudly.

462
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,760
Why is there such a strange smell in the Heavenly Realm?

463
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:50,800
- A strange smell?
- A strange smell?

464
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,440
What strange smell?

465
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:58,120
It's sour and smelly.

466
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,640
I'm sure you know I have a very sensitive nose.

467
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:04,720
The smell is making me feel nauseated.

468
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,820
I need to find where it comes from.

469
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,080
Hey! You.

470
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,180
Why does this fairy have such a pungent smell on her?

471
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,440
You! Where did you come from?

472
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,440
You seem to be unaware of the rules of the Heavenly Realm.

473
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,220
I'm Di Lanjue, from the Beast Realm.

474
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,600
My shortcoming is my keen sense of smell.

475
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:34,220
Please don't be offended.

476
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:39,480
Nowadays, all sorts of people can attend the Shangshu Academy of the Heavenly Realm.

477
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,060
Fairy Biqiong, you're mistaken.

478
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:44,880
In terms of status, he's the Prince of the Beast Tribe.

479
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,240
In terms of ability, he's the top-notch master of magic tool forging in the Four Realms.

480
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,700
In terms of personality, he's smart, quick-witted, kind-hearted, and loyal.

481
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:55,960
In terms of achievements, he's one of the heroic contributors who helped in reviving Youqin.

482
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,980
Why shouldn't he be allowed to enter our Shangshu Academy of the Heavenly Realm?

483
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:07,360
What are you looking at?

484
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,720
Didn't you make some sarcastic remarks about him earlier?

485
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:16,120
Why the sudden change in attitude today?

486
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:17,480
That's a different thing.

487
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,940
He has gone through hardships with us after all.

488
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:22,620
I can't let an outsider bully him.

489
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,640
You have a point.

490
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:26,400
Knowledge Star Deity has arrived!

491
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,460
- Greetings, Reverend Master.
- Greetings, Reverend Master.

492
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,520
You can drop the greetings.

493
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,000
Please be seated.

494
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,900
This year's coursework for the Shangshu Academy will be very heavy.

495
00:35:56,900 --> 00:36:02,360
So I've invited an official from the Xia clan, Tuiyun, to come and assist me.

496
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,880
Let's not waste any more time on small talk.

497
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,760
Let's begin.

498
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:14,480
Last year, we concluded the class with the sacred tree of the Dongqiu clan,

499
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,180
Ganoderma Vein, and how it grew from the Force of Chaos.

500
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,260
It's said when the Twin Flower of Ganoderma Vein blooms,

501
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,140
it'll absorb the pure and turbid air,

502
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,000
and even dispel the seal of Guixu,

503
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:36,260
unleashing the Force of Chaos and bringing about the end of the world.

504
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,300
In the year 46,596 of the Celestial Era, of the Ninth month,

505
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,620
the Four Realms discovered that the Twin Flower had indeed bloomed.

506
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:49,740
Thus, the four leaders of the realms put aside their differences and decided to eradicate the Ganoderma Vein

507
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:54,540
at the peak of Mount Chongling in Beast Realm.

508
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:59,220
Ziwu. Ziwu.

509
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,220
The immortals sure have a lot of details about ancient history in the Four Realms.

510
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:04,680
It's terrifying.

511
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,780
This is just one of the courses.

512
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,380
This year will be a tough year for us.

513
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,480
I can do it.

514
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,186
I can still learn.

515
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:20,260
These are about the Xia clan.

516
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,980
These ones are about the Fish Dragon Tribe.

517
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,580
These ones are about the Birds Tribe.

518
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,500
These are about the Flora Tribe.

519
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:28,240
The rest will be moved here gradually.

520
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,980
We need to understand the memorials sent by each department first.

521
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:34,040
Only by doing so can we remain impartial in our review.

522
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:39,400
It would take days to go through the information of just one clan, let alone to fully understand it.

523
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,540
You can start with the least amount of information first.

524
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,700
Your Highness, your tea is ready.

525
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:44,960
All right.

526
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,800
Organize the ones I mentioned just now.

527
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
Rest assured, Your Highness.

528
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,500
Shouldn't the class at Shangshu Academy be over now?

529
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,020
You've asked more than 800 times.

530
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:09,480
Knowledge Star Deity increased this year's coursework and extended the class hours to four hours.

531
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,840
I thought sending her to the Shangshu Academy would please her.

532
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:14,400
But I didn't expect it to turn out like this.

533
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:18,140
I can't even see her for half a day now.

534
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,560
I must go and pick her up myself.

535
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:24,180
Your Highness, don't you think it's inconvenient now?

536
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,260
Your Highness!

537
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,720
Your Highness, it's over! They're leaving!

538
00:38:31,360 --> 00:38:32,980
Came out?

539
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,160
What came out?

540
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,360
Oh, nothing came out.

541
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:42,020
So did it come out or not?

542
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:48,700
Hanmo meant Heavenly Empress came out from the Ninth Heaven Hall.

543
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,220
I'm going to pay my respect to Celestial Mother.

544
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,040
You don't have to come with me.

545
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,880
I can keep you company.

546
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,420
Your Highness!

547
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:08,700
Tan Tan.

548
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:14,240
It's the first day of admission, Knowledge Star Deity has already assigned so many practice scrolls?

549
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,540
That's too much.

550
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,920
Have some fruit first.

551
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,420
I won't be eating.

552
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:22,340
If I don't finish my homework, I'll be caught at a disadvantage by Biqiong

553
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,780
who would report me to Knowledge Star Deity.

554
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,260
I'll have to stay up late again tonight.

555
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,760
Eating some fruit won't take much time.

556
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,980
I knew you would be here.

557
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,780
I've waited for you at Penglai Hall all night.

558
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,960
Do you know how much I've missed you?

559
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,260
I have to finish my homework.

560
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:44,020
I'll accompany you after I finish.

561
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,140
How about this?

562
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,960
I'll help you with your homework.

563
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,020
No need. I should finish my homework myself.

564
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,940
How about eating some fruit?

565
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:07,820
Have another one.

566
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,860
Your hard work will only pay off in the long run, not the present moment.

567
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,680
Look how swollen your eyes are from staying up late.

568
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:52,600
I still have one more scroll to complete.

569
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,940
Which one is it again?

570
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:15,240
