20
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:20,940
Don't come any closer.

21
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,960
- Was it you?
- No, it wasn't me.

22
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,060
Split up and search!

23
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:27,160
- Capture anyone suspicious back for questioning!
- Yes, Your Highness!

24
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,980
- Search over there!
- Yes!

25
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,420
Sir, are you all right?

26
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,400
They are immortals.

27
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,040
Darn it.

28
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,860
Chaofeng?

29
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,160
- Eldest Brother?
- Chaofeng.

30
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,400
What are you doing here?

31
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,960
I was on the street when I saw two people trying to assassinate you.

32
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,620
So I led my men to go after them.

33
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,800
But they got away.

34
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,860
I was too incompetent.

35
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,880
Those two used the immortals' magical arts.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,240
Could today's incident be related to the wedding procession?

37
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,620
We don't get along with the immortals.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:14,940
I'm sure they want to kill me to ruin the wedding.

39
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,480
How repulsive.

40
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,340
Absolutely repulsive!

41
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,180
I'll definitely teach them a lesson!

42
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:24,980
You're right! With you here, the immortals' plot will not succeed!

43
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,180
My eldest brother is mighty!

44
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,060
Of course.

45
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,580
But I'm not trying to blame you.

46
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,920
After all, you're the Void Third Prince.

47
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,920
You can't even catch two assassins.

48
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,780
All you do is indulge in pleasure.

49
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,340
The son of a sinner is nothing but trash!

50
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:40,300
Back to the camp!

51
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,800
Take care, Eldest Brother.

52
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,240
Sir, lies come out as soon as you start talking.

53
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,700
You managed to pin everything on the immortals in just a few sentences.

54
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:59,520
"My eldest brother is mighty!" How convincing.

55
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:05,020
A simpleton like Wu Dai will still believe it, even if the acting is bad.

56
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,140
It's just that the man managed to subdue my skill.

57
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:14,060
Who could have such high cultivation?

58
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,120
The immortals should be happy that we have internal strife.

59
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,700
I think what just happened was a coincidence.

60
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:25,290
No matter what, things are going to be interesting to have a strong opponent.

61
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,500
Before you cast the spell, couldn't you at least tell me earlier?

62
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,100
You should watch your conduct.

63
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,720
Stop going to places like Wangliang City.

64
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,560
Is that the edict?

65
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,180
Are you serious about marrying Qingkui...

66
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:55,140
I mean, me.

67
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,780
I told you it's not up to us in this matter.

68
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,840
- You...
- Hurry.

69
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,200
Just you wait.

70
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:05,200
Come.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,260
Forgive me for not welcoming you upon your arrival, Empyrean Xuanshang.

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,740
Greetings, Emperor Tun.

73
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,560
This is the edict to confer the Empyrean Consort.

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,680
Please accept it, Emperor Tun.

75
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

76
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,060
<i>It looks like Shaodian Youqin is determined to drag Qingkui into living a life of suffering.</i>

77
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,660
<i>What should I do now?</i>

78
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,140
Tan Tan,

79
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:52,280
look who I brought.

80
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,660
Di Lanjue?

81
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:59,420
Di Lanjue, the Prince of the Beast Realm at Princess Yetan, his lover's service.

82
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,260
Stop talking nonsense and sit down.

83
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:02,300
I need a favor from you.

84
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,920
What is it? For my beloved Tan Tan,

85
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,240
Even if I have to put my life on the line, I will not refuse you.

86
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,460
So this is my plan.

87
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:12,340
- Snatch the bride.
- Snatch the bride?

88
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,720
I have it all planned out.

89
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,400
The procession tomorrow will be the last chance to help Qingkui escape her ordeal.

90
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,480
The immortals and the voidwalkers are never on good terms.

91
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:25,340
At this time, you'll instigate them to start a war between both parties.

92
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,680
<i>- See my muscle and look at yours!
- I'll beat you!</i>

93
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,480
<i>Beat him!</i>

94
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,360
During this commotion, you'll fly into Qingkui's sedan

95
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,480
<i>- and snatch her away.
- I'll beat you! I'm going to beat you up.</i>

96
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,100
You'll go as far as you can.

97
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,480
<i>Let go! Let go!</i>

98
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,560
<i>- How dare you pull my ear!
- Beat him! I said, beat him!</i>

99
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:42,020
<i>[Liguang Palace]</i>

100
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,280
I get it.

101
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,260
Both of us will snatch the Empyrean Consort of Empyrean Xuanshang, who is extremely powerful.

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
You must be dreaming.

103
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,720
Di Lanjue, only you can save Qingkui now.

104
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,700
Please help me.

105
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,500
Princess Qingkui has a pure heart.

106
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:01,340
Who can bear to watch her jump into a life of suffering?

107
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,560
Am I right?

108
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,540
Rest assured. I will do this favor for you.

109
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,440
You're indeed a reliable friend.

110
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,700
I no longer have to watch Qingkui live a miserable life.

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,920
Your Highness, are you mad?

112
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,600
What do you know? Come here.

113
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,980
I've always loved Tan Tan.

114
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:22,920
But I'm afraid she'd rather be the Devil of Void than accept me.

115
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,860
Now, she has made things easy for us.

116
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:29,600
Tomorrow, we'll snatch both the immortal and the Void's crown princesses.

117
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:34,840
Even if she gets upset after that, she'll have to accept my love after saving her sister.

118
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:38,620
Then she'll follow me back obediently and be my princess consort

119
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,900
That is a lot of Desire Spheres.

120
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,980
You've cultivated for thousands of years and have already cleansed your heart of desires.

121
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,620
How did you get so many distracting thoughts from a trip to the Mortal Realm?

122
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,680
<i>I don't want to be the boring consort!</i>

123
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,420
<i>I don't want to go to the boring Heavenly Realm!</i>

124
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,740
<i>Let alone marry you!</i>

125
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,840
Who's this lady?

126
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,900
She's Princess Qingkui.

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,000
<i>You're ancient and you still want a wife?</i>

128
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:31,340
<i>I'm so young and beautiful, but now, I have to marry an old, crinkly man.</i>

129
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,080
<i>Please have some mercy.</i>

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,820
<i>Just let me go.</i>

131
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:43,220
It's said that Princess Qingkui of the Liguang family is noble and endowed with both beauty and talent.

132
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,220
Why does she seem

133
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:47,480
so outspoken?

134
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,980
Since Princess Qingkui is against this matrimony,

135
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,600
why don't you submit a memorial to the Heavenly Emperor to break off the engagement?

136
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,440
If it weren't for celestial father's wish to use marriage to maintain the relationship between humans and immortals,

137
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,660
I wouldn't marry her.

138
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,200
We can only provide strict lessons for her when she arrives here.

139
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,260
She's merely a mortal.

140
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:12,940
Yet she could distract me so much.

141
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,440
It looks like

142
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,380
I can only gain a pure heart after breaking through the bottleneck to obtain the Perfect Celestial Body.

143
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:22,520
I should spare more time for my cultivation.

144
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,460
Again?

145
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,860
The Perfect Celestial Body is a legend among immortals.

146
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,660
No one has ever obtained it.

147
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:34,400
Even if it's someone with a rare gift like you, you've been trapped here for more than 300 years...

148
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,920
I'll remember to maintain protective formation for you every day.

149
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,780
But we and the voidwalkers are both expecting a wedding tomorrow.

150
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:47,040
You have to prepare yourself for the wedding.

151
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,620
Why don't we pick another day to cultivate?

152
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,780
Don't blame me for being nosy.

153
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:55,840
In my opinion, you don't lack in your cultivation.

154
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,820
You are just upset because of the Empyrean Consort.

155
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:00,120
After the wedding is over and getting familiar with each other,

156
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,120
you no longer will have so many distracting thoughts.

157
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,640
<i>You better think about this carefully.</i>

158
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:09,660
<i>Can you stand living with someone like me forever?</i>

159
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,360
Your Highness?

160
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,320
Forever?

161
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:21,780
Feichi, get ready for the wedding.

162
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
I need to get rid of the distracting thoughts.

163
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,740
<i>[Siqu Pavilion]</i>

164
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,380
These are the best wine and meat you can find in Siqu Pavilion.

165
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:39,080
Do you like them, Eldest Brother?

166
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:40,960
Not bad.

167
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,700
What are you planning to do about the assassination today?

168
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,540
Of course, I'll have to wait until tomorrow to capture them.

169
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,180
Then I'll chop them into pieces.

170
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,100
That's right!

171
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,420
We must chop them into pieces.

172
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,780
But tomorrow is the wedding day.

173
00:10:54,780 --> 00:11:00,500
If we make our move first and disrupt the wedding procession, would royal father be upset if he finds out?

174
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,400
Then what do you think we should do?

175
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,700
In my opinion,

176
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,700
those assassins are nothing.

177
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:11,300
The immortals sent the assassins here just to crack the whip to get the voidwalkers and you to obey them!

178
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,500
In that case, we mustn't do what they want.

179
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,100
For tomorrow's wedding, we must show them our imposing manner.

180
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,200
We must not let the immortals be more imposing than us.

181
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,600
You're right.

182
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,000
That old Heavenly Emperor is very conceited.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,400
He always looks down on us, the voidwalkers.

184
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:33,300
We shall show them the bearing of our Void warriors tomorrow.

185
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,900
Eldest Brother, you are mighty!

186
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,300
Have a drink.

187
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,200
My eldest brother is mighty! My eldest brother is mighty!

188
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
<i>First Prince is mighty!</i>

189
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Enough already.

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,050
<i>So the powerful man who fought me yesterday was Shaodian Youqin.</i>

191
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,200
<i>Void Patrol?</i>

192
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,200
<i>So he set the ambush in Wangliang City.</i>

193
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,400
<i>The messenger from Heavenly Realm has arrived!</i>

194
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,500
<i>The messenger from Void Realm has arrived!</i>

195
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,200
Kui'er, it's a huge responsibility to marry the immortal.

196
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,900
I may not worry because you have a decent character.

197
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:03,600
But you must be more cautious when you reach the Heavenly Realm.

198
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,800
Please rest assured, Imperial Father.

199
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,400
Since I was a child, you've raised me, educated me, and shown me grace.

200
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:15,900
I shall fulfill my mission and do my duty to maintain the stability between the immortals and the human race.

201
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,800
Fool.

202
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,100
Yetan.

203
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,100
No matter what,

204
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,100
you're still my daughter.

205
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,800
Imperial Father...

206
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,300
After you become the Crown Princess of the Void,

207
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,300
don't bring me shame again.

208
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,400
<i>The auspicious hour has arrived!</i>

209
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,000
<i>Time to leave the palace!</i>

210
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,500
<i>[Liguang Palace]</i>

211
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,000
<i>We're about to get into the sedan.</i>

212
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,400
<i>Where on earth is Di Lanjue?</i>

213
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,000
Sir, how could she be Princess Yetan?

214
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,400
She was obviously with Shaodian Youqin that day.

215
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,500
I don't care what kind of relationship they have.

216
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,400
Since she knows our secret, we can't let her marry into Void now.

217
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,600
<i>Have you thought this through?</i>

218
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,200
<i>There are massive forces stationed here from both clans.</i>

219
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:01,200
Killing the Crown Princess without permission is a capital crime.

220
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,200
<i>Today's priority is to receive the bride.</i>

221
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:22,100
<i>If he doesn't stir up any trouble, I'll let him off the hook.</i>

222
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,900
<i>Lest they cause unnecessary problems.</i>

223
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,300
The wedding procession is departing soon.

224
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,200
What now, Sir?

225
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,300
Shaodian Youqin is on guard.

226
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,000
I can't make my move.

227
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,300
I need to think of something else.

228
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,500
What is taking him so long?

229
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,300
Tan Tan's plan won't go wrong.

230
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:27,800
As long as I release this arrow to instigate them to fight,

231
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:31,200
I can snatch Tan Tan and her sister away.

232
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,800
Stop wasting time and release it already.

233
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,700
- Fight, fight.
- Fight, fight, fight.

234
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:35,600
Shaodian Youqin, you failed to kill me in Wangliang City.

235
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,700
Now, you're trying to start a fight. Kill him!

236
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,000
- Attack!
- Wait!

237
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,600
First Prince, they said Shaodian Youqin's cultivation has improved greatly after his seclusion.

238
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,400
We must not take his strength lightly.

239
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
We'll wait for him to make the first move.

240
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
Come on, start the fight.

241
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,600
Why aren't they fighting? Your Highness, they're taking Tan'er away.

242
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,300
Come on. Do something!

243
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,700
There's a change of plan.

244
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:01,400
It looks like we have to take them by storm.

245
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,300
Di Lanjue has made his move!

246
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:49,200
Don't just stand there. Go and save them.

247
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,300
What are you doing here? You should go and save my sister.

248
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,900
His Highness said he's taking you along too.

249
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,200
- Come with me now.
- I'm not leaving.

250
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,800
I want to be the Devil of Void.

251
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,900
It looks like someone took the opportunity to make trouble. Here's our chance.

252
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,400
There's a sandstorm out of a sudden.

253
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,100
<i>It must be someone with ulterior motives trying to cause trouble.</i>

254
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:30,200
How dare you cause trouble on an important day for the immortals!

255
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,800
Protect the Crown Princess!

256
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,100
Eldest Brother, I'll go!

257
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:46,400
Go now! Shaodian Youqin has profound power. Di Lanjue's trick won't deceive him for long.

258
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,700
It'll be too late if you don't save her now.

259
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,600
How did you know Shaodian Youqin has profound power?

260
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,200
His Highness isn't that weak.

261
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
<i>I pretended to be Qingkui to trick Shaodian Youqin before this.</i>

262
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,500
If you don't go now, it'll be too late. Go now.

263
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,000
<i>- Come with me.
- I'm not leaving.</i>

264
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,500
- Let's go together.
- No. I'm not leaving.

265
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,800
Sir, we'll alert First Prince if you kill her now.

266
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,900
It's nothing if we fail to kill Yetan.

267
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,500
But if First Prince finds out we once tried to assassinate him, we'll be in big trouble.

268
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,600
You must think twice.

269
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,100
Sir! Don't be a fool.

270
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:12,000
Didn't you hear she pretended to be Qingkui?

271
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,200
We'll let her keep up the act.

272
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,180
- Go now!
- No!

273
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,360
- You must go now.
- Don't tug at me.

274
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,160
Go now! Just go!

275
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,180
- Your Highness, come with me!
- No!

276
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,800
<i>What was his motive?</i>

277
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,280
<i>This concerns the four realms.</i>

278
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,020
<i>I should bring Princess Qingkui back to the Heavenly Realm and then think about this.</i>

279
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:46,540
Isn't this the immortal's sedan? What happened?

280
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:49,500
The sedan belonging to the immortals sure is mysterious.

281
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,880
It could actually transform.

282
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,880
This isn't what His Highness had planned.

283
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,460
Could he have a better idea?

284
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,920
What better ideas could he have?

285
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:04,080
I've planned everything carefully for 18 years.

286
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:06,040
I didn't expect to fail because of my friend.

287
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,560
Di Lanjue, you fool!

288
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,480
How's Crown Princess?

289
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:19,280
Rest assured, Eldest Brother.

290
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,940
Shaodian Youqin, today is the day voidwalkers escort the bride.

291
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:28,000
What is the meaning of this devious means?

292
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,780
Eldest Brother.

293
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,900
Our First Prince is talking to you!

294
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,000
Hey! I'm talking to you!

295
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,640
Eldest Brother! Eldest Brother.

296
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,780
Since Her Highness is safe, we should return to the Void before anything else happens.

297
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:40,240
You...

298
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,080
Forget it.

299
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,020
Return to the Void!

300
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,980
No, I must leave.

301
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:59,320
No, you can't. If they find out, they'll definitely kill you.

302
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,500
My sister is in there!

303
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,720
Just don't mind her.

304
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,240
Your Highness.

305
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,400
You must be startled.

306
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,920
The person who was here to snatch the bride has repelled.

307
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,960
You can rest assured now.

308
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,100
How can I feel assured?

309
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,040
You're not the one I want to marry. You're marrying the wrong person.

310
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,640
Stop putting up an act. Sit still.

311
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,620
Return to Heavenly Realm.

312
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:33,740
<i>[Prince's Manor of the Beast Realm]</i>

313
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,040
Are you sure Princess Yetan went to the Heavenly Realm, and not the Void Realm?

314
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,100
Yes, Your Highness.

315
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:45,040
We all smell the scent of Princess Yetan flowing down from the Heavenly Realm's sedan.

316
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,400
Go.

317
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,940
Gather all the troops now!

318
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:52,740
But... Your Highness,

319
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:55,460
everyone is here.

320
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:57,520
You've caused a lot of trouble lately.

321
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,080
Beast King has detained the rest of the troops to punish them.

322
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,900
So, tell me.

323
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:09,020
Can I attack Heavenly Realm with only a few of you?

324
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,660
<i>You're here just in time.</i>

325
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:20,420
<i>Hurry! Come with me!</i>

326
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,960
No, Your Highness.

327
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,060
You should come with us.

328
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,920
What do you mean?

329
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,440
Beast King is furious after knowing you went to the human's imperial palace to snatch a bride.

330
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,420
He ordered us to arrest Your Highness.

331
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:40,420
Insolence. How dare you try to kidnap me!

332
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:42,340
We're only following the order.

333
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:45,420
I'm afraid Your Highness will spend some time in prison.

334
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:48,760
Let me go. Release me. I'm going to bite you.

335
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:51,200
- Move.
- Release me!

336
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,780
How dare you tie me up!

337
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,360
Let me go!

338
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,720
I must save Tan Tan!

339
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:01,780
<i>[South Heavenly Gate]</i>

340
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:09,840
Greetings, Your Highness.

341
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,860
You look weary, Your Highness.

342
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
Did anything happen during the escort?

343
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,160
You know my strength the best.

344
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:20,000
It doesn't bother me that much to deal with the voidwalkers.

345
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,040
But what I can't stand the most

346
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,020
is noise.

347
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,620
Your Highness, we've prepared the necessities in Tianpa Hall.

348
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,220
All that's left is for you to bring Empyrean Consort there.

349
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,620
So...

350
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:46,880
See? I'm doomed this time. I'm really in the Heavenly Realm now.

351
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,580
What should I do now?

352
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,580
Don't panic. After His Highness finds out, he'll think of a plan to rescue you.

353
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,580
Don't even mention him. I get upset at the thought of him.

354
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,860
If it weren't for him, would we end up here?

355
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:56,580
I can only rely on myself at the critical moment.

356
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,020
I'm going to see Shaodian Youqin and make things clear.

357
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:59,020
Sit down.

358
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:00,300
How are you going to explain it to him?

359
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:01,660
Are you going to say that you, the Void Crown Princess,

360
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,640
coaxed the Beast Realm's Prince into kidnapping the Heavenly Realm's Empyrean Consort?

361
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:05,740
Or do you say you deliberately try to destroy the alliance between immortals and humans?

362
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,400
The immortals and voidwalkers never got along.

363
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,420
If they heard you, what do you think they'll do to you?

364
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,380
You better sit still.

365
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,820
Don't scare me.

366
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,460
I want to be the number one Devil of Void.

367
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,840
Have I ever feared anyone in my whole life?

368
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,180
Your Highness, we have arrived in the Heavenly Realm.

369
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:26,000
<i>Please get off the sedan and follow me inside.</i>

370
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:12,660
<i>Aren't these Malevolent Yaksha and Xingtian of Ganqi?</i>

371
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,320
<i>The heroes of the voidwalkers whom I admire had fought the immortals and ended up so miserable.</i>

372
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:23,640
<i>If they know I'm Void Crown Princess who plotted to abduct the Empyrean Consort...</i>

373
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,100
Are the immortals always this cruel toward the voidwalkers?

374
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:31,780
Since ancient times, the voidwalkers have been the cause of chaos in the four realms for generations.

375
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:33,760
Naturally, everyone wishes to punish them.

376
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,540
The ancestors of the immortals saved the four realms.

377
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,620
It was a meritorious deed.

378
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:38,800
How can it be considered cruel?

379
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,520
Why are you taking the side of the voidwalkers?

380
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,100
Of course not.

381
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,860
I was being emotional about how mighty and brave the immortals had been.

382
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,740
I spoke without discretion.

383
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:52,740
Please don't be offended. Please forgive me.

384
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,360
I do have one question.

385
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,100
If the immortals find out a voidwalker entered the Heavenly Realm, what would the immortals do?

386
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:03,520
Your Highness, Article 510 of Heavenly Rules stipulates

387
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,660
any voidwalkers who cause trouble for the immortals

388
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:09,320
shall be executed and have their primordial spirit destroyed and doomed for eternity.

389
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,140
Your Highness, why did you mention the voidwalkers?

390
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,160
I got it wrong.

391
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,860
I wanted to say the beast folk

392
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:20,760
because I brought my beast folk servant without permission.

393
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,920
I heard Heavenly Rules are very strict.

394
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,520
So I asked.

395
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:28,740
A moment ago, I already noticed a beast folk hiding.

396
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,040
I didn't expect it to be your servant.

397
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:35,500
I even met the Prince of the Beast Realm, who appeared at the wedding procession today.

398
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:39,120
It looks like you have a good relationship with the Beast Realm.

399
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:42,560
Prince of the Beast Realm? I don't even know him.

400
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:46,900
I brought this bird with me because she saved my life when I was a child.

401
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,980
I'm someone who always repays the kindness of others.

402
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:51,520
When I heard I had a chance to enjoy life in Heavenly Realm,

403
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,720
I naturally wanted to bring my friend along.

404
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,940
I hope you can make an exception.

405
00:29:55,940 --> 00:29:56,940
<i>Excuses.</i>

406
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:01,880
<i>I'm sure this is another trick after the Beast Realm failed to abduct her.</i>

407
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,420
<i>I didn't expect her determination not to become the Empyrean Consort to be so great.</i>

408
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,500
<i>Forget it.</i>

409
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,700
<i>Since we've returned to the Heavenly Realm, I shouldn't fuss about it anymore.</i>

410
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,200
Never mind.

411
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:16,740
With this bird accompanying you, I can enjoy a more quiet life.

412
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,560
But you must watch your conduct after this and stop causing trouble.

413
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:22,660
I can't afford to wait upon you.

414
00:30:22,660 --> 00:30:25,140
You can rest assured. She'll stay in here. She won't come out.

415
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:25,980
She's very obedient.

416
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:28,400
I meant you.

417
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:32,060
Your Highness, don't blame me for being nosy.

418
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:35,820
If we don't enter now, the auspicious hour will pass.

419
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,800
Let's go.

420
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:53,180
<i>[Passage of Twilight]</i>

421
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,620
She doesn't look that bad.

422
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,820
As for her figure, why are you covering yourself this much?

423
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:15,600
Are you scared of the cold?

424
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,880
We have arrived at the Void Realm.

425
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,380
- Get the princess off the sedan.
- Yes.

426
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,380
<i>Void Realm?</i>

427
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:27,480
<i>This is the Void Realm?</i>

428
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:30,200
<i>How did I end up in the Void Realm?</i>

429
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,800
<i>There must be a mistake.</i>

430
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,220
<i>Before I enter, I must explain this.</i>

431
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,120
- Sir—
- Princess Yetan, the entrance to the Void Realm is ahead.

432
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:43,740
Those in the Void are bloodthirsty killers.

433
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,240
You're a mortal.

434
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,740
Even if you suffer any grievances, no one will care.

435
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,800
Please be cautious in your words and actions.

436
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:54,220
Your Highness, please get off the sedan!

437
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:30,500
The remains you're seeing now belong to immortals who overestimated their abilities.

438
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,400
This is the glory of the voidwalkers.

439
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,040
Void Tyrant never resented the friendship between the human race and the immortals.

440
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,960
I hope you'll consider the overall interest at all times.

441
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:39,780
Stop wasting time.

442
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,400
Royal Father is waiting for us to report back to him.

443
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,580
Let's go.

444
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:45,300
Yes, Eldest Brother. Let's go.

445
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,560
<i>The voidwalkers are cruel toward the immortals and the human race.</i>

446
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:54,420
<i>If I tell them my identity, I'm afraid...</i>

447
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:57,620
<i>Where's Tan'er right now?</i>

448
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:01,520
<i>If it weren't for that sandstorm just now and a step too late...</i>

449
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,820
Can you keep up?

450
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,460
Come on!

451
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,300
Hurry.

452
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,240
<i>Tan'er is familiar with the voidwalkers' nature.</i>

453
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:14,400
<i>When she arrives, I'm sure she'll explain it to the voidwalkers.</i>

454
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:18,820
<i>I'll enter for the time being and wait for her before planning anything.</i>

455
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,580
<i>[Marriage Bridge]</i>

456
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:44,140
Your Highness, Princess Qingkui. Please cross the Marriage Bridge together.

457
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:53,640
I don't see any bridge here.

458
00:34:09,220 --> 00:34:11,520
Is that how far the bridge goes?

459
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,880
You may not know this, Empyrean Consort.

460
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:15,840
This is a ritual that every couple in Heavenly Realm should go through.

461
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:17,900
It was set up to test the fate of the couple.

462
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:21,700
Only those who are destined to be together can cross the bridge safely.

463
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,460
That's why it's called Love Bridge.

464
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,320
<i>Telling the truth will cost my life.</i>

465
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,380
<i>I'll also die for not telling the truth.</i>

466
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,000
<i>What should I do now?</i>

467
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,000
Why don't we skip this bridge today?

468
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,380
We can cross it on the day of our wedding ceremony.

469
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,340
Let me go.

470
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,920
No. It's too high up. What if I fall?

471
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:48,320
I'm not going, not going.

472
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,140
I'm scared.

473
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,600
Let's not cross the bridge.

474
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,360
<i>Please stop. Let's not cross it.</i>

475
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,580
I'm not crossing it.

476
00:34:55,580 --> 00:34:57,380
I'm scared.

477
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,260
I beg you. Stop walking.

478
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:00,600
<i>Let's not cross it.</i>

479
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,680
Your Highness, please.

480
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,360
Your Highness, stop walking.

481
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,500
I don't want to cross it. I'm too scared.

482
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,360
- I don't want to cross it.
- Let me go.

483
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,760
No, I don't want to cross it. I'm scared.

484
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,480
- Just go.
- I'm scared.

485
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:16,520
<i>I don't want to do this. I'm scared.</i>

486
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,000
<i>No, I'm not walking.</i>

487
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,600
I'm not doing this. I'm scared.

488
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:25,700
I don't want to cross it. I want to go home.

489
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:33,820
- Open your eyes.
- I'm scared.

490
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,900
<i>Didn't he say this bridge is to test the fate of a couple?</i>

491
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:49,660
<i>But I'm not his destiny.</i>

492
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,360
<i>How can there be such a change?</i>

493
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,400
<i>Could this bridge malfunction?</i>

494
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,860
<i>I can't believe I'm destined to be with this woman.</i>

495
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,900
<i>Fate sure plays strange tricks.</i>

496
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:03,440
<i>How am I going to live my life after this?</i>

497
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,100
Wait. Wait for me.

498
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,540
- Let's go.
- Slow down. Not too fast.

499
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,380
Don't go too fast.

500
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,200
Your Highness, not too fast. Slow down.

501
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,420
♫ <i>Love and affection accompanies the Queen of the Night blossoms</i> ♫

502
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,640
Slow down. I'm scared.

503

♫ <i>In full bloom, you and I agreed that eternity is only a flash</i> ♫

505
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:21,380
Let me go.

506
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,420
I'm scared.

507
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,700
♫ <i>The moment the flower and fire blossomed in splendor</i> ♫

508
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:26,620
Walk slowly.

♫ <i>It all turned into sweetness</i> ♫

510
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,280
Your Highness, I'm scared. Your Highness.

♫ <i>I am you, and you are me</i> ♫

I'm scared. I'm so scared.

513
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,760
I'm scared. Your Highness, I'm scared.

514
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,700
I'm scared.

515
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:39,160
♫ <i>The silhouette of our embrace</i> ♫

516

♫ <i>The stars in the eyes of my beloved gleams with sweetness</i> ♫

517
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
<i>- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.</i>

518
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:57,140
<i>- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.</i>

519
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,360
You're a match made in heaven.

520
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,600
<i>Indeed, indeed.</i>

521
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,480
Congratulations.

522
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,660
Congratulations, Eldest Brother.

523
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:05,300
What a match.

524
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:08,600
Empyrean Consort and Empyrean Xuanshang are destined to be together.

525
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,220
A happy couple united by heaven.

526
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,200
It's worthy of joy and celebration.

527
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,260
Old Immortal, come with me.

528
00:37:15,260 --> 00:37:17,240
Is that bridge malfunctioning?

529
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:19,120
Princess Qingkui, you must be joking.

530
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:22,180
This bridge is a sacred object to test the fate of couples.

531
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,520
How can it be broken?

532
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,920
If you don't believe me, why don't we go and test it together?

533
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,000
Oh, no.

534
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:29,720
The Heavenly Realm is a sacred place. Do not behave brazenly.

535
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,420
Sister-in-law. I, Qingheng, pay respect to you.

536
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:35,240
Sister... Sister-in-law?

537
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:39,160
Greetings, Sister-in-law. I'm Youqin's younger sister, Ziwu.

538
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:41,480
He's my second brother, Qingheng.

539
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,880
We heard Eldest Brother is bringing you back to Heavenly Realm today.

540
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,720
So we both came to receive you.

541
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:48,420
Sister-in-law, it's our first meeting today.

542
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,740
So I've prepared a gift for you.

543
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:59,340
This is Purple Jade Gourd.

544
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:00,700
It's the Heavenly Realm's magic weapon

545
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,260
I saw in the storybook when I was young.

546
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,460
Sister-in-law, do you like it?

547
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,880
Yes, I like it.

548
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,520
I also prepared a gift for you.

549
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,480
There are more gifts?

550
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,040
This is a Gilded Jade Cassock.

551
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:18,080
It's the Gilded Jade Cassock, which can withstand magical attacks from an Imperfect Celestial Body.

552
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,280
Yes, you're right.

553
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:22,200
It looks like you really like the gift I prepared for you.

554
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:24,540
Yes, I do. Of course I like it.

555
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,720
Empyrean Consort, I do have a gift for you too.

556
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:29,340
Come.

557
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:35,960
This is the Six-Dragon Divine Fire Shield.

558
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,460
Your Highness, you have a good eye.

559
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:38,520
I have a gift for you too.

560
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:39,900
- More gifts?
- Here.

561
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,240
Let me see.

562
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,600
This is Crystal Ganoderma.

563
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,940
Crystal Ganoderma?

564
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,140
It looks pretty.

565
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:50,740
Excuse me. I also prepared a Heavenly Glazed Lamp for you.

566
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,480
There are so many treasures.

567
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,840
- Thank you so much.
- Don't drop it.

568
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,000
It's all yours.

569
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,060
Thank you very much.

570
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:57,560
Thank you.

571
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,920
You're so generous.

572
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:02,900
Look at all these gifts.

573
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,480
I don't even have enough hands to hold all of them.

574
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,820
Where's Xiao Chi?

575
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,620
Xiao Chi?

576
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,260
Yes, Princess Qingkui.

577
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:11,300
Later, please put these in my chamber.

578
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,620
You must not steal a single one of them.

579
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,620
I've already counted them.

580
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,520
Your Highness, please rest assured.

581
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:17,380
I'll send all these gifts there without missing a single one.

582
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:25,980
I tell you what, I recognize many treasures from the story books.

583
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,860
I also recognize the one in your hand.

584
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:30,120
If I marry her...

585
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,140
Heavenly Thunder Pagoda.

586
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:32,640
I may not have peace my whole life.

587
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,100
Princess Qingkui looks clever and alert.

588
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,480
She just doesn't have good manners.

589
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,700
She'll be a qualified Empyrean Consort in the future

590
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,660
after advising her more according to the Heavenly Rules.

591
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:45,100
Feichi, I don't feel comfortable with so many people around.

592
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,640
- I'll let you take care of them.
- Yes, Your Highness.

593
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:51,660
After that, bring Princess Qingkui back to Tianpa Hall for rest.

594
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,820
Mother wants to meet her later.

595
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:56,420
By the way, she's stubborn and unruly.

596
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:59,820
- You must keep an eye on her. Don't let her cause any trouble.
- Yes, Your Highness.

597
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:00,900
Am I right?

598
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:04,860
Also, I'll make more room for these treasures

599
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:18,340
<i>[Tianpa Hall]</i>

600
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,000
Princess Qingkui, this is Tianpa Hall.

601
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:29,460
Heavenly Empress, Immortal Nihong, has personally prepared this temporary dwelling for you.

602
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:34,840
<i>I didn't expect that Heavenly Realm holds Qingkui in high regard.</i>

603
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:40,100
<i>This place is many times better than my crude courtyard in the Mortal Realm.</i>

604
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,860
Heavenly Empress is inviting Your Highness to a banquet tonight.

605
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:47,460
I shall go and prepare your clothes and ornaments.

606
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,940
Where are my treasures?

607
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,340
They're all in the palace.

608
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,980
You can leave now.

609
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,620
That was close.

610
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:44,140
Luckily, you somehow managed to cross the Marriage Bridge.

611
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:47,300
Or else you would have become a piece of meat pie after falling from the Ninth Heaven.

612
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:50,040
If it weren't for my great fortune,

613
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,420
I wouldn't have enjoyed Qingkui's fortune to have all these.

614
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:53,880
You're right.

615
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:56,640
What do we do next?

616
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,400
You've accepted so many gifts.

617
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,680
Are you planning to stay and live like a widow on Qingkui's behalf?

618
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,800
No way.

619
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:08,120
I haven't accomplished my grand ambition of becoming the Devil of Void yet.

620
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,380
All of these...

621
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,200
Don't mess around with these Five Thunder Beads.

622
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,260
I'll take these as my ready money first.

623
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:20,580
You're such a money-grubber.

624
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:26,440
Man Man, teach me how to keep all these treasures in this handkerchief with magic.

625
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,840
Why?

626
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,300
It'll be troublesome to carry so many things when you're on the run.

627
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:32,800
Are you planning to escape to the Human Realm?

628
