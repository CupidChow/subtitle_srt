21
00:01:58,810 --> 00:02:01,300
I wonder if Her Highness's plan is working.

22
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,260
Why is there no news yet?

23
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,670
This won't do. I need to enter the Void.

24
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:08,890
Wait, Consort Xue. You're the person Sir cherishes the most.

25
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,710
Before Her Highness left, she instructed me to ensure your safety.

26
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:15,270
If anything happens to you, I'll blame myself forever.

27
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:21,690
If Feng’er and Kui’er can't overcome this ordeal, there's no point in living alone.

28
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:26,940
Consort Xue is right. No matter if they're dead or alive, we have to check them out.

29
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,570
All right then. We'll see how it goes after we go inside.

30
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:33,003
Let's go.

31

First Prince, His Majesty said he wasn't going to see anyone.

32
00:02:39,033 --> 00:02:41,330
It's useless to keep kneeling here.

33
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,530
Do you want me to let Tan Tan die together with Chaofeng for no reason?

- Your Majesty

41
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:11,610
Did you really hurt Chaofeng?

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:16,260
So what if I did? Could it be that you have love for Chaofeng?

43
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:20,420
Don't forget, he's the descendant of the the Fuzhu clan.

44
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,360
However, you are hesitating to execute him.

45
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:27,320
Seems like you were bewitched by Yetan's words!

46
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,320
Fine.

47
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:33,681
Since you can't make up your mind, I'll head there and deal with this rebellious son of yours!

Come back!

49
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,140

Consort Xue?

55
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,430
Greetings, Your Majesty.

56
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,900
Good.

57
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,910
All of you are here to die, huh? I'll kill all of you at once!

58
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,563
Yingzhao!

59
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:32,330
After going through the massacre of Fuzhu clan and years of torture under your hand,

60
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:36,553
do you think I'll still be afraid of death?

61
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,370
Maybe I shouldn't be soft-hearted and allowed you to live in the first place.

62
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,700
You weren't soft-hearted.

63
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,560
You were just afraid.

64
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,730
Back then, the clans of Void Realm were having an internal struggle.

65
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,730
There were feuds between clans.

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:58,930
You used your power to frighten the other clans and united the Void Realm.

67
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:03,600
That's how the Void, which represents the rival faction of the Heavenly Realm, came into existence.

68
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,490
However, you were afraid.

69
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:09,520
You were afraid that the rebel army might stage an uprising.

70
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,010
You're afraid a slave like me will bear a grudge toward you.

71
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:20,193
Therefore, you could only let your three sons fight for the throne.

72
00:05:20,193 --> 00:05:23,820
You'll choose the strongest heir to inherit your throne.

73
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,020
If not, the Void Realm will be divided after my retirement.

74
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:32,510
That's the only thing I can do.

75
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,920
The slaves and rebel army have already put down our grudges.

76
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,060
We stopped trying to seek revenge.

77
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,950
It's not because of your power.

78
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,300
It's because your existence had stopped the internal struggle between the clans.

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,200
We can lead a stable life now.

80
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,230
To conquer the world, one may use his army.

81
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:55,440
However, to conquer the people's hearts, one may not use his army.

82
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,960
Just let down your guard.

83
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,930
No one can rule over the realm peacefully on a throne tainted with blood.

84
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:12,230
<i>The three of you, listen up.</i>

85
00:06:12,230 --> 00:06:18,290
<i>The one who gets rid of Shaodian Youqin will be the next Void Crown Prince.</i>

86
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,950
You're full of lies!

87
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:23,850
If you don't intend to seek revenge, why did you encourage Chaofeng to fight for the throne?

88
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,370
I'll kill you right now!

89
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,890
Your Majesty!

90
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:33,780
Qingxin has stayed out of worldly affairs for many years. She has no intention of stealing the throne.

91
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:39,200
After listening to what she has to say, I've finally sorted out my thoughts.

92
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,910
To conquer the world, one may use his army.

93
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:43,350
However, to conquer the people's hearts, one may not use his army.

94
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,090
It's my fault that Yun’er is dead.

95
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:49,960
Even if we kill Chaofeng, we cannot bring Yun’er back to life.

96
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,220
I've already lost one son.

97
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,453
Why don't we put down our grudges and co-exist peacefully?

98
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,930
Put down our grudges, huh?

99
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,960
Co-exist peacefully?

100
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:09,403
Yanfang,

101
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:13,330
in the end, I was still wrong about you!

102
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:24,580
Your Majesty, I express my gratitude to you on Feng'er’s behalf.

103
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,753
How did it go?

104
00:07:33,753 --> 00:07:35,390
His Majesty has spared Feng.

105
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,760
Let's head to the Cave of Haunted Souls and release him.

106
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,880
Really?

107
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:39,313
Come on!

108
00:07:39,313 --> 00:07:41,160
- All right!
- Go now!

109
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,983
This is great!

110
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,760
Under His Majesty's order, Third Prince, Chaofeng, is acquitted of his crime!

111
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,980
Under His Majesty's order, Third Prince, Chaofeng, is acquitted of his crime!

112
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,250
Under His Majesty's order, Third Prince, Chaofeng, is acquitted of his crime!

113
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,040
Under His Majesty's order, Third Prince, Chaofeng, is acquitted of his crime!

114
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,640
Sir, Your Highness, His Majesty has spared you two.

115
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:17,540
<i>[Crown Princess's Clinic]</i>

116
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,610
Saintess?

117
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,110
Tan’er, you guys are finally back.

118
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:57,490
I've been waiting for your news for the past few days.

119
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,240
Luckily, His Majesty spared you guys.

120
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:04,131
Why are there weapons of the immortals inside this hall?

121
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,200
First Prince told me to build this hall.

122
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:12,780
After you guys left, he went to the border area to fight with the immortals.

123
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,180
Whenever he killed one of them, he would erect their weapon here.

124
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:21,840
He said he wanted to prove to you that he was stronger than Third Prince.

125
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:25,430
There are so many weapons here. Don't tell me he picked them up from the battlefield?

126
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:26,973
Nonsense.

127
00:09:26,973 --> 00:09:30,770
First Prince is the mighty Devil of Void. Why would he commit such folly?

128
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,110
I was referring to First Prince, too.

129
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,440
Why are you panicking?

130
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,620
I... Who's panicking?

131
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,750
Enough.

132
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,410
No matter what, all's well that ends well.

133
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,510
Feng’er and Princess Yetan just got married.

134
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,540
Tonight, we must hold a celebration.

135
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:49,560
Feng’er, Haichao, arrange for a banquet immediately.

136
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,240
- Yes, Consort Mother.
- All right. Go now.

137
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,960
Sushui, why are you still standing there?

138
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,830
We'll head in and take a break.

139
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,630
Consort Mother, take care.

140
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,080
Let's go.

141
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:04,480
- We need to get busy later.
- Yes, Consort Xue.

142
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,840
We have to decorate the entire place, you hear me?

143
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,730
- Yes.
- And, listen.

144
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,320
First Prince

145
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:19,240
is strong, meticulous, and loyal.

146
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,560
No wonder you fancy him.

147
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,230
How did you know?

148
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,280
You showed us a sorrowful expression when you were looking at the weapons.

149
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:32,690
Why would you do so if you didn't fancy him?

150
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,060
Tell me about it. What happened between you and First Prince?

151
00:10:37,650 --> 00:10:44,490
After you guys left, I came here to take my medicine. But I bumped into him by accident.

152
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,160
<i>What's so good about Chaofeng?</i>

153
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:02,580
<i>I've lived alone for a millennium. And, I've never fallen for anyone before, except for you.</i>

154
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:12,603
<i>First Prince. What are you doing here?</i>

155
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:15,260
<i>I've gathered the most beautiful flowers in the Four Realms.</i>

156
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:20,540
<i>Initially, I wanted to give Tan Tan a surprise, but...</i>

157
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:26,930
<i>First Prince, you truly have a deep affection for Tan’er.</i>

158
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:33,280
<i>Controlling the fire is the key to brewing medicine.</i>

159
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,540
<i>The time and amount of water are also important to the process.</i>

160
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:38,073
<i>Try it.</i>

161
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,540
<i>It's so bitter.</i>

162
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:53,020
<i>Here, have a piece of candy.</i>

163
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:11,280
<i>What do you think? Isn't it sweet?</i>

164
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,490
<i>I've never had anyone care so much about me before.</i>

165
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,660
<i>Is that so?</i>

166
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:25,450
<i>I heard that several of our brethren refused to marry you because of your hideous looks.</i>

167
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:30,620
<i>Those scoundrels must be blind. In my opinion, you actually look pretty.</i>

168
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,613
<i>First Prince, are you serious?</i>

169
00:12:36,613 --> 00:12:40,230
<i>Of course. I never lie.</i>

170
00:12:44,350 --> 00:12:46,930
<i>First Prince, thank you for the compliment.</i>

171
00:12:46,930 --> 00:12:48,280
<i>You don't need to thank me.</i>

172
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,240
<i>After you help me court Tan Tan successfully, I'll pick the strongest</i>

173
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:55,460
<i>and toughest general within the Void Army to be your husband.</i>

174
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,130
In a place where force is pursued, like the Void Realm, everyone is scheming against each other.

175
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:14,680
I've never seen anyone as pure as him before.

176
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:17,430
Tan’er, I'm not jealous of you.

177
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:20,800
I understand your feelings for Third Prince.

178
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,700
However, he's still infatuated with you. I couldn't bear it.

179
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:26,263
I...

180
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,020
First Prince is a simple and honest man.

181
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,110
He's indeed someone you can entrust your love to.

182
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,600
Let me think of a way.

183
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,250
I'll ensure he understands your feelings for him.

184
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,320
What are you doing?

185
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,960
I’m tidying up.

186
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,893
Ziwu!

187
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,353
Di Lanjue.

188
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:59,200
Why are you so energetic today? Have you finished your homework?

189
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,230
I didn't touch them at all.

190
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:02,530
You didn't touch them?

191
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:06,310
I didn't come to Shangshu Academy to improve my skills.

192
00:14:06,310 --> 00:14:08,110
If so, why did you come here?

193
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:12,880
- I...
- Anyway, no matter why you're here, when Knowledge Star Deity comes to question you,

194
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,460
I won't let you copy my homework.

195
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,160
Who wants to copy your homework?

196
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,940
Why are you staring at me?

197
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,510
Empyrean Xuanshang is here.

198
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:40,970
- Empyrean.
- Empyrean.

199
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,790
Empyrean Xuanshang is concerned about the cultivation of deities.

200
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,611
- What are you doing here?
- Are you happy to see me?

201
00:14:49,611 --> 00:14:51,550
He shall teach us spells personally.

202
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:53,850
You're messing around, aren't you?

203
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,480
It's excruciating to wait for your class to be over. I have no choice.

204
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,910
I can only come to see you personally.

205
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:00,460
Geez.

206
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:07,590
Knowledge Star Deity alone is already demanding enough.

207
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:11,180
And now, Eldest Brother is here too? Are they trying to kill us here?

208
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:14,320
I'm afraid we have to sleep at Shangshu Academy this year.

209
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,510
All of you are studious and hardworking. I'm relieved to see that.

210
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:20,490
However, Knowledge Star Deity and I have come to a conclusion.

211
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:23,990
In order to reduce your burden, from tomorrow onward,

212
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,650
all lessons shall not have any extra homework.

213
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,590
The lessons shall not be delayed.

214
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:34,573
The homework you get after the lesson can be finished within an hour.

215
00:15:34,573 --> 00:15:36,550
All of you don't need to pull all-nighters again.

216
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,230
- Long live Youqin!
- Long live Youqin!

217
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,440
This is great!

218
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,850
- Let's begin, then.
- Hurry!

219
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:44,100
- Let's begin.
- Let's go. Have a seat.

220
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:48,530
What's wrong with them? They weren't this enthusiastic when Knowledge Star Deity was here.

221
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,410
It's like they're on steroids.

222
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:55,280
They've never attended a lesson taught by an intelligent empyrean like Youqin.

223
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,710
That's why they're excited.

224
00:15:57,710 --> 00:16:00,670
That's fine. Sitting at the back is pretty good too.

225
00:16:00,670 --> 00:16:02,710
We can chat in the back.

226
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:16,720
Lessons require silence. This is not the place for you to chat.

227
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,433
Ziwu.

228
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,920
What is this?

229
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,853
It's for you.

230
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,413
Look.

231
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,460
<i>[See you at Tianpa Hall after dinner.]</i>

232
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:52,080
<i>See you at Tianpa Hall after dinner.</i>

233
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,700
All right. That's all for today's lesson.

234
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,253
Class dismissed.

235
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:06,793
Cousin.

236
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:13,140
I still can't figure it out. Can you stay and explain it to me?

237
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,560
Cultivation cannot be achieved in one day. You need to take it one step at a time.

238
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,420
I just said that I wanted to reduce your burden.

239
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:22,820
If I stay here, I'll be going against my word. Class dismissed.

240
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,760
- Farewell, Empyrean.
- Farewell, Empyrean.

241
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,800
I'll wait for you.

242
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,633
Come.

243
00:18:40,633 --> 00:18:41,940
Sister-in-law.

244
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:45,000
- Sister-in-law, see you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow.

245
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,940
I’m leaving now.

246
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,473
Di Lanjue, where have you been living these days?

247
00:18:49,473 --> 00:18:51,520
Don't tell me you travel back and forth between the two realms.

248
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:57,053
No. Ziwu found me a new place.

249
00:18:57,053 --> 00:19:00,310
So, that's the reason you're here, huh?

250
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,820
Don't tell anyone about it.

251
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,460
- Go now.
- See you.

252
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:04,973
See you.

253
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,200
I tried my best to reduce your burden for you, yet you're practicing again.

254
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:54,240
People could tell you did so out of your selfish desire.

255
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,740
You just wanted me to spend more time with you, right?

256
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,480
However, this is my first time attending school officially.

257
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,820
I would like to cherish the opportunity.

258
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:06,761
Besides, you're the top immortal who had mastered the Perfect Celestial Body.

259
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:10,220
I have to stand shoulder to shoulder with you in order to be your consort.

260
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:13,120
I'm just afraid that you'll tire yourself out.

261
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,180
Is there anything here that can boost my power by a tremendous amount after consuming it?

262
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:21,040
The path of cultivation is tempered by one's will to achieve more.

263
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,200
We shouldn't take shortcuts.

264
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:29,113
However, I think we do have something called Honey Fruit.

265
00:20:29,113 --> 00:20:30,820
It'll awaken your immortal intelligence after you consume it.

266
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:31,980
I want to have that then.

267
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,620
You're such a glutton.

268
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,560
Honey Fruit trees only bear fruit once every 3,000 years. It's not that easy for you to have it.

269
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,780
If so, it seems like I can only train by myself.

270
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:43,413
Fine.

271
00:20:43,413 --> 00:20:46,720
When you practice the techniques, you need to remember the points listed on the scrolls.

272
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,980
If not, you'll get half the result with twice the effort.

273
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:53,620
Since that's the case, I'll do you a special favor.

274
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,320
<i>I mustn't cross the line.</i>

275
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:32,080
<i>He doesn't have any Jianmu Fruit with him. I wonder if he can do it.</i>

276
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,660
<i>Spending the night in Tianpa Hall? If news of this gets out, her reputation will be affected.</i>

277
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:03,513
Why don't you head inside? I'll leave now.

278
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,020
Fine.

279
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:19,460
<i>Seems like he still needs the help of Jianmu Fruit.</i>

280
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,560
Princess Qingkui, your outfit is here. Please get changed.

281
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,340
Thank you. You can leave it there.

282
00:23:58,940 --> 00:24:02,260
What's on your mind? You're salivating all over your outfit.

283
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:06,700
I... I just think that this outfit is quite old.

284
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:11,040
I want to sew some embroideries on it. It'll be as good as new.

285
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:15,840
Wait, the sun isn't rising from the west, right? You're actually doing needlework now?

286
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:26,620
What exactly are you up to?

287
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,500
I... I'm just afraid that I'll get bored in the Heavenly Realm.

288
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,480
I want to nurture my hobby.

289
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,110
Coincidentally, I can practice my skills by doing this.

290
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:44,600
Before this, I had no idea why Qingkui loved this.But now, I think it's pretty fun.

291
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,380
Give them back to me!

292
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,300
I know what you're up to.

293
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,820
You know nothing! Give them to me!

294
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,860
I know what you're up to.

295
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,420
Give them to me.

296
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,253
<i>Give them to me!</i>

297
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,660
I don't understand what you're thinking. How could you ask other people to help you out with this?

298
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:27,140
You saw through my plan anyway. You should help me out.

299
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,213
Take it.

300
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,580
Hey.

301
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,860
Although it isn't as good as Qingkui's work, at least it's better than mine. I'll take it.

302
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:43,180
Give it back if you don't want it.

303
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:45,780
It's excellent.

304
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,240
Say, why isn't Youqin here yet? It's getting dark.

305
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,880
Stop waiting already.

306
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:59,060
The empyrean needs to head to the Star Observatory and set up thousands of star formations.

307
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:01,020
You should wash up and go to sleep.

308
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:06,000
You have a point. Why should I wait for him when I can look for him?

309
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:10,560
You're a lady! Can you be more reserved for once?

310
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,133
Youqin!

311
00:26:30,133 --> 00:26:32,640
What are you doing here?

312
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,380
You didn't come after so long. I had no choice but to look for you.

313
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,300
You can resume your duty. I'll observe you.

However, I'm already done.

315

It's over? But I wanted you to teach me.

<i>Our marriage contains hidden dangers after all. Maybe I can teach her the star formation.</i>

<i>That can be of use when she's in danger.</i>

Here, like this.

319
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
What are you doing?

320
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:04,150
You wanted to learn from me, right?

Now, I'll teach you how to dispel it. You must memorize it.

You're teaching me something this difficult already?

328

You did master the Revitalization Spell in one go, didn't you?

Please have a try.

374
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,060
It's rare for you to be this thoughtful.

It's nice, indeed.

376

Celestial Mother, I came here today because I have a favor to ask of you.

377
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,500
Princess Qingkui has been living in the Heavenly Realm for awhile now.

378
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,800
- Celestial Mother...
- Now that my children have grown up, they have their own thinking now.

379
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,460
On the night we observed the stars, I was intending

380
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,740
to help improve the relationship between you and Qingkui.

381
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,721
However, I never expected it to end up being an ordeal for you two.

382
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:24,420
I've straightened out my thoughts after that harrowing encounter.

383
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,780
Nothing is as important as your safety.

384
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:29,300
Don't worry about the wedding.

385
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,740
I will never urge you guys to get married.

386
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,080
No, no, no. Celestial Mother. I think you should urge us.

387
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,100
I won't urge you two.

388
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
You should.

389
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,900
I said...

390
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:42,980
What did you just say? Say it again.

391
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:47,560
Celestial Mother, I'm afraid we're in a hurry to get married.

392
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,720
Is it something urgent?

393

Very.

394
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,320
Don't tell me the celestial phenomenon last night was...

395
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,920
Hurry! I need to head to Ninth Heaven Hall!

396
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,500
Your Majesty, you haven't finished your tea yet.

397
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,701
What tea? Didn't you hear him? This is urgent!

398
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,400
These are all the scrolls I've studied.

399
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:15,200
I've included some notes, too.

400
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,900
Since I couldn't help you to get into Shangshu Academy,

401
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,180
I could only prepare these for your self-study session.

402
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,820
Immortal Qingheng, I do not deserve your kindness.

403
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:26,353
Thank you, Immortal Qingheng.

404
00:31:26,353 --> 00:31:27,930
Don't mention it.

405
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,780
Immortal Qingheng, you should rest early.

406
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,080
I will study hard right now.

407
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,900
Why are you always avoiding me?

408
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,230
Are you afraid of me?

409
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,313
No.

410
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,080
I'm just a lowly fairy.

411
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,440
Immortal Qingheng, I do not deserve such concern from you.

412
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:59,760
I live in fear every day.

413
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:03,710
Immortal Qingheng, you should send me back to Tianpa Hall.

414
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:08,990
A few days ago, I inquired about you from the Five Spice clan.

415
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:15,140
The place where you became a fairy was the place I met the stalk of coriander in the Source Mirror.

416
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:17,180
You were that coriander I met before.

417
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,740
Why didn't you admit it?

418
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,640
You even tried to avoid me.

419
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,300
I don't remember it.

420
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,700
I've remembered you even though it has been so many years.

421
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,333
Why...

422
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,740
Why aren't you willing to admit it?

423
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,480
Immortal Qingheng, you kept wanting me to admit that I was the stalk of coriander you took care of.

424
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,020
What are you trying to get here?

425
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:40,093
- I...
- Qingheng,

426
00:32:40,093 --> 00:32:42,760
I brought your notes.

427
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,833
Qingheng, don't tell me you transferred Husui to your place because you wanted to court her.

428
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:05,300
Be honest with me.

429
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:08,220
Do you have feelings for her?

430
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:14,230
- I...
- If not,

431
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:20,300
why would you treat her so well and do everything in your power to make her stay by your side?

432
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:37,580
<i>I do like Husui. But will she like me?</i>

433
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:43,760
<i>When we were in the Mortal Realm, Sister-in-law braved everything for the sake of love.</i>

434
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:48,620
<i>Now that I've fallen for her, I should at least tell her how I feel.</i>

435
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:51,020
<i>Why am I still hesitating?</i>

436
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:59,500
Husui, although I'm the second heavenly prince,

437
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,980
my feelings for you have no ties with my title.

438
00:34:01,980 --> 00:34:06,960
Believe me. I'm willing to spend my life protecting you

439
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,593
and loving you.

440
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,680
<i>Where is she going?</i>

441
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,930
<i>Why isn't she taking the main entrance?</i>

442
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,660
<i>[Land of Nature]</i>

443
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,360
Immortal Qingheng?

444
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,921
You would've lost your life to this magic array if I was one step later.

445
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:56,901
Did you come to the Land of Nature at this hour and activated

446
00:35:56,901 --> 00:36:00,240
the magic array the Jade Deity had cast to obtain this magic item?

447
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,940
Judging from its design, it's a magic item from Dongqiu.

448
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,560
Why are you trying to acquire a magic item that's from Dongqiu?

449
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,360
I...

450
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,140
I thought you said we would have enough members today.

451
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,600
In the end, we still lack one.

452
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,600
You lied to me.

453
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:23,500
Wait. Why is the door open?

454
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,933
Something's off.

455
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,880
And this.

456
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,240
We have intruders!

457
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:40,580
Immortal Qingheng?

458
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:42,400
Greetings, Masters.

459
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,200
Immortal Qingheng, may I know why you barged into the Land of Nature at this hour?

460
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:52,580
My magic item, Jinghong, was broken when I was searching for Eldest Brother's soul shards in the Mortal Realm.

461
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:55,720
Lately, I've been attending lessons about magic items and learned something new.

462
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,220
I was intending to repair my magic item using some heavenly tools and ingredients.

463
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,920
Master, when I came here to see you, the gate was ajar, and no one was guarding here.

464
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,120
I didn't know where you went.

465
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:10,540
So, may I know why the three of you are here at this hour?

466
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:15,540
- I...
- Just now, I think I heard something about a sparrow.

467
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:17,220
Sparrow?

468
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:20,520
I did keep a sparrow in the past.

469
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,060
However, it had already flown away together with my youth.

470
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:26,720
Rain Deity, have you kept a sparrow before?

471
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,600
I don't think so.

472
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,580
What I said just now was... You were busy.

473
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,420
That's right.

474
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,920
There have been too many blessing requests lately.

475
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,780
I asked both of them to help me out.

476
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,720
We just finished our tasks. That's why we only came back now.

477
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,600
- Thunder Deity, am I right?
- That's right.

478
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:52,080
Since the three of you have public duties to perform, I shall not interrupt you all.

479
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,860
Master, thank you for the item.

480
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,900
Don't mention it.

481
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,860
Once I've done the inventory check, I will send you the list of items I need.

482
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:02,000
No problem.

483
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,613
Let's go.

484
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:16,260
You can tell me now.

485
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:22,020
If you insist on keeping it from me, I have no choice but to ask the Jade Deity.

486
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,633
Don't!

487
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:36,220
That magic item does come from Dongqiu.

488
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:39,290
It's the Soul-Gathering Lamp, which I mentioned before.

489
00:38:39,290 --> 00:38:42,391
It contains the souls of my dead tribesmen.

490
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,573
Tribesmen?

491
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,520
I'm from Dongqiu.

492
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,881
Everyone knows that the Dongqiu people used the sacred tree of Dongqiu, Ganoderma Vein,

493
00:38:55,881 --> 00:38:57,380
in an attempt to open a path to Guixu.

494
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:59,120
That's why they were vanquished by the Four Realms.

495
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,320
- How could you...
- Even so, do you think it's entirely correct?

496
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:04,860
- We were framed.
- Framed?

497
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:08,920
My tribesmen and the sacred tree never intended to destroy the world.

498
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,980
We were massacred because the Four Realms feared us due to the ancient legend.

499
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:17,620
I would've never survived if I didn't keep the only surviving fraction of my soul

500
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:20,740
in that stalk of coriander.

501
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:22,870
This is impossible.

502
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,140
That's not what the late emperor said.

503
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,040
The Heavenly Realm will never reveal the truth to the world.

504
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:32,460
However, I witnessed the massacre personally.

505
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,880
The immortals were the ones who took the Soul-Gathering Lamp away.

506
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,400
If so... If so, did you come to the Heavenly Realm

507
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,320
so that you could revive the souls that were trapped within the lamp?

508
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,320
I intended to do so.

509
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:45,320
But I was powerless.

510
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:49,260
It was hard for me to locate the Soul-Gathering Lamp.

511
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,740
But I was too powerless to do anything about it.

512
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,160
I only gathered my courage and snuck in when I heard

513
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,980
that the three masters were gathering today.

514
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:58,580
I knew I had no power to erect a shelter for the people of Dongqiu.

515
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,970
However, I still can't help myself from bringing the lamp with me.

516
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:09,110
Now that you know everything,

517
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,260
you can report me to the authorities.

518
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,600
I won't do so.

519
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,740
But why?

520
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,273
I...

521
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,753
I trust you.

522
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,060
Maybe I can try to persuade my father and tell him to investigate the truth behind the incident.

523
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,300
By then, we might be able to return the remnant of Dongqiu to you.

524
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,180
The case of Dongqiu has already come to a close.

525
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:35,460
There's no way to overturn the result.

526
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:38,760
The day you mention the incident in Dongqiu to the Heavenly Emperor

527
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,700
will be the day of my death.

528
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,313
No matter what,

529
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,230
Immortal Qingheng, I would like to thank you.
