Right. Have you never
seen me wear hanbok before?

Never.

104
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:06,800
I see. I just came
from my mom's 80th birthday party.

105
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:08,800
I was just about to sing a song.

106
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:11,139
Gosh.

107
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,139
The official statement we sent,

108
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,009
won't be enough to end the scandal.

109
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,939
It was just a vague statement
saying the rumor wasn't true.

110
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,779
Suspicion is also growing.

111
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:22,509
So what would be enough to end it?

112
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,949
We would have to reveal...

113
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,250
that Eun Si Woo isn't Tae Sung's lover,
but his mom.

114
00:07:30,089 --> 00:07:33,120
- But...
- Tae Sung would never agree to that.

115
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,430
Yes.

116
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,589
What did "The World of Stars" team say?

117
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:38,199
They said to first wait
and see how things go.

118
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,860
Advertising agencies also said the same.

119
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,500
They might cancel the commercial deals
if public opinion gets worse.

120
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,370
We have to think
of the cancellation charge then.

121
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:51,310
Well, it's not a big deal
if it can be solved with money.

122
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:53,879
It's more important
that Tae Sung's feelings aren't hurt.

123
00:07:54,649 --> 00:07:58,250
I earned a lot of money so that I could
use it in times like this.

124
00:07:58,279 --> 00:08:00,420
I don't think there will be
any big issues...

125
00:08:00,449 --> 00:08:02,250
with cancellation fees
for Tae Sung's contracts...

126
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:04,560
as long as he's not legally charged
with anything.

127
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:07,689
He hasn't done anything wrong
in this case.

128
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,689
Ultimately, public opinion is the issue.

129
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,629
I'll do my best.

130
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,870
Yes. Let's all do our best.

131
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,899
- Yes.
- Yes.

132
00:08:21,339 --> 00:08:23,370
Tae Sung, are you okay?

133
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:27,980
I'm like a father to him.

134
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,149
You see, I'm the director of his agency.

135
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,789
You saw me earlier, right? I'm his...

136
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,690
I'm the manager
of his agency's PR department.

137
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,159
I came because I was worried.

138
00:08:43,389 --> 00:08:45,600
Is anyone else coming?

139
00:08:57,309 --> 00:09:01,649
Was it a mistake to come back to Korea?

140
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,779
I want to tell the truth,
no matter what.

141
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,120
Please let me do that.

142
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,220
First, we'll have to see
how this all pans out.

143
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:13,259
He probably won't like it, right?

144
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:15,759
But even so.

145
00:09:16,129 --> 00:09:19,429
I cannot harm Tae Sung's reputation
in any way.

146
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,470
We'll decide carefully
and let you know soon.

147
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,669
It's our job to do everything
in our power to protect Tae Sung.

148
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,870
So please don't worry.

149
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,879
Give us some time.

150
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,980
Stay strong and patient...

151
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,350
for Tae Sung's sake.

152
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,320
Ji Hoon, can't I just go home now?

153
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,519
No, you cannot.

154
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,259
Didn't you hear what the doctor said?

155
00:09:46,289 --> 00:09:48,460
You need absolute rest. Lie back down.

156
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,970
By the way,
I've been meaning to ask you.

157
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,429
What's with your outfit?
Why are you wearing that costume?

158
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:02,409
My mother must be so upset right now.

159
00:10:03,309 --> 00:10:05,309
He had to leave
his mother's 80th birthday party.

160
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:09,149
Anyway, rest up. I have to go.

161
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:11,649
Okay. You should hurry.

162
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,220
- Take good care of him.
- Bye.

163
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:27,159
I'll go check what kind of facilities
they have here at the hospital.

164
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,269
All right, see you.

165
00:10:29,299 --> 00:10:31,299
Yes, I'll be back.

166
00:10:58,399 --> 00:10:59,460
Han Byeol.

167
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,169
Look at me.

168
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,009
You must've been so scared.

169
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,480
Yes. I was scared.

170
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:22,019
Are you sure you're okay?

171
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,159
Of course, I'm fine.

172
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,289
My goodness.

173
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,129
I'm sorry it scared you so much,
my pretty girlfriend.

174
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:42,740
(Warning!
Don't be fooled by a kind face.)

175
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,610
I got these text messages.

176
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:55,620
I was shocked,
so I came outside in a daze.

177
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:57,820
But the reporters flocked over to me,

178
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:00,019
and the camera flashes
started to go off.

179
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,759
Seriously,
I felt trapped in that moment.

180
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,830
Kang Yu Sung.

181
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,000
Do you not trust him now?

182
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:18,340
I do.

183
00:12:20,179 --> 00:12:21,309
I trust him.

184
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,490
I'm sure Yu Sung...

185
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,250
had his reasons.

186
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,389
Tae Sung. Are you all right?

187
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:42,299
What took you so long? I waited for you.

188
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,769
What?

189
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:47,940
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

190
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,539
Yes, you'd better be sorry!

191
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:03,549
Hey, Mr. Byun Jung Yeol. I can see you.

192
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:06,419
Get back in here if you're done
checking out the facilities.

193
00:13:08,259 --> 00:13:09,289
Yes.

194
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:12,429
They have fully equipped facilities
for everything.

195
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:15,970
- Is it nice?
- Yes, it's great.

196
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,779
(What is the real reason
you came to Korea?)

197
00:13:31,179 --> 00:13:33,220
You came running here surprised.

198
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,419
I have something to say...

199
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,429
before it's too late.

200
00:13:43,429 --> 00:13:44,659
Before it's too late?

201
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,070
I'm not telling you.

202
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:54,440
Bye, I'm off.

203
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:00,840
(Eun Si Woo)

204
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:03,080
(Calling Eun Si Woo)

205
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,750
- Hey, Si Woo. Are you okay...
(- What?)

206
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,350
(Are you calling to cancel on me?)

207
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:09,990
(Did something happen again?)

208
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,360
- Cancel on you?
(- What? Did you forget?)

209
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:14,159
(We were supposed to meet for dinner.)

210
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:15,559
What are you talking about?

211
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,960
(What? Seriously? So you really forgot.)

212
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,330
(You told me you even made
a reservation at a restaurant.)

213
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,970
Where are you now?

214
00:14:26,539 --> 00:14:27,610
Hey.

215
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:28,840
What was that call about?

216
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,210
It was a joke.

217
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,340
A joke?

218
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,879
Now of all times?

219
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,379
You're making no sense.

220
00:14:40,649 --> 00:14:41,820
Right.

221
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:43,789
There's no point
in keeping this from you.

222
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,519
So it turns out,

223
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:51,000
I'm losing...

224
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,000
my memories.

225
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,269
Hey.

226
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:02,970
How could you break this news to me
with a smile?

227
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:06,679
If I don't smile, then what?

228
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,350
Will it change anything?

229
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:12,080
Is that why you contacted Yu Sung
behind my back and came back?

230
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:15,490
You should have told me instead!
Why did you do that?

231
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,649
Because you...

232
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:20,389
I knew you would make that face.
That's why.

233
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:24,059
Because seeing that face...

234
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:27,059
will make me feel sorry for myself.

235
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:29,769
You see,

236
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,100
I have a lot more money than you do.

237
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,740
And I'm being treated
in the best hospital in the world.

238
00:15:36,539 --> 00:15:38,509
Then stick to your treatment.
Why are you here?

239
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,649
To apologize.

240
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,889
I failed him as a mother.

241
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:54,830
I left him all alone and lonely.

242
00:15:57,929 --> 00:15:59,100
I want to apologize...

243
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:02,769
before I forget those memories too.

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,940
(Will Eun Si Woo Be First Asian Actor
to Win Noble Award?)

245
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,940
How do you feel?

246
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:13,779
This isn't a dream, is it?

247
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,279
It sure isn't.

248
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,919
I can't believe
this day is actually here.

249
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:21,690
(Ladies and gentlemen.)

250
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:24,250
(We will be taking off shortly.)

251
00:16:27,389 --> 00:16:28,559
Hello?

252
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,730
(I need your help,)

253
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,429
Mom.

254
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,470
Mom.

255
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,570
I have to go.

256
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,799
Hey, are you crazy?

257
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:40,340
- I have to go!
- Ma'am.

258
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:41,509
We're taking off soon.

259
00:16:41,539 --> 00:16:43,139
- Please take your seat.
- I'm sorry.

260
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,580
Si Woo, let's sit down.

261
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,539
Si Woo, please sit down.

262
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:48,309
Si Woo.

263
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:50,409
Sit down. I'm sorry.

264
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,289
You just can't help being you,

265
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,400
can you?

266
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,230
You should feel sorry for yourself.

267
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,740
The police finished questioning
Kang Min Kyu.

268
00:17:17,779 --> 00:17:20,740
He admitted sending two emails
to the reporters.

269
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:22,509
It looks like he'll be fined.

270
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,680
I've also looked into the nature
of his employment at Starforce,

271
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,490
but there's no proof
that it was ill-intentioned.

272
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:33,289
His employment with DS Actors
will be terminated, but that's about it.

273
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,789
That's too light a punishment.

274
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:36,430
It is.

275
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:39,259
As for All Gong Downhill,
the anti-fan club,

276
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:40,730
he denied any knowledge.

277
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,970
It's a member-only site,
so we'll have to look for another way.

278
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,240
Okay. Thank you
for staying late to take care of this.

279
00:17:53,109 --> 00:17:54,650
(It was Eun Si Woo
in the dating scandal photo!)

280
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,450
(Compare it with the photo
from the department store. It was her.)

281
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,450
(They must be having an affair.)

282
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,049
(They can't deny it now.)

283
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,519
(Eun Si Woo also attended
Tae Sung's first movie screening.)

284
00:18:01,549 --> 00:18:03,150
(Their relationship is coming to light.)

285
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,390
(So much love in that gaze.)

286
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,490
(This is nuts. They have no shame.)

287
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:08,029
(Eun Si Woo's loving gaze
at her secret lover.)

288
00:18:08,059 --> 00:18:09,759
(She's happy to just look at his photo.)

289
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,400
(My gosh, she made it so obvious.)

290
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,029
(This is insane. Everything checks out.)

291
00:18:13,059 --> 00:18:14,670
(Eun Si Woo cheated!
"My wife had another man in her life.")

292
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,130
(He is devastated after the divorce.)

293
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,670
(This movie is based on a true story.)

294
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,470
(When I found out that my wife...)

295
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,039
(I was in despair
and had the hardest time mentally.)

296
00:18:21,069 --> 00:18:22,740
(I didn't know about this interview.)

297
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,339
(I'm appalled that she had an affair.)

298
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,079
(It's disgusting.)

299
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,380
This is nuts.

300
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,789
Ta-da!

301
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,900
Take a break and have some food.

302
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,109
I was starving.

303
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,670
You're so thoughtful!

304
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:57,740
Shocking news!

305
00:18:57,769 --> 00:19:01,109
It melts away like cotton candy.

306
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:03,509
- It's really delicious.
- Thanks for this, Ho Young.

307
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:04,750
I was starving.

308
00:19:04,779 --> 00:19:07,250
No problem, it's just
a little pick-me-up for you all.

309
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:09,089
- I appreciate it.
- Enjoy then.

310
00:19:09,119 --> 00:19:11,190
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

311
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:14,829
- Dip it in the sauce.
- This is so yummy.

312
00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,359
Are you still working?

313
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:18,730
I just got done. I'm on my way home now.

314
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:21,130
Are you sure
you can go into work tomorrow?

315
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,430
I told you I'm feeling fine.

316
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,670
You know I hate being a nuisance.

317
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,799
Gosh, you can be so stubborn.

318
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:30,369
Let me know if you're not well.
Canceling is not a problem.

319
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,079
(All right.)

320
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:35,079
Hurry up and sleep.
You need energy for tomorrow.

321
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,480
Okay, Yu Sung.

322
00:19:38,450 --> 00:19:41,549
- I'll see you tomorrow...
(- Yes, I'll see you on the set.)

323
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,589
All right, Yu Sung. See you tomorrow.

324

394
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,599
Did you see the guilty look he had?

395
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,069
He left without a single complaint.
It's definitely true.

396

Gosh, what a nuisance.

397

They have to replace the male lead.

398

399

- Gosh.

400

My gosh, you're so cute.
Whose kid is it?

401
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,900
He's my nephew.

402
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,400
I brought him because he wanted
to check out my workplace.

I'm not your mom.

No, I'm not.

to not call me mom today, okay?

409
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,759
How can you do this?

410
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:33,460
If you're thinking of dropping Tae Sung,
you'll have to replace me too.

411
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,930
Gosh, you're scaring me.

412
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,599
At the very least,
shouldn't his coworkers trust the actor?

413
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:42,009
Instead of some stranger's claims?

414
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,740
We trust him.

415
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:46,680
- But the public's opinion...
- Is their opinion a fact?

416
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:48,240
It will only last for a few days.

417
00:26:48,279 --> 00:26:50,849
This situation will be resolved well.

418
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,480
Book me for all the empty schedules,

419
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:54,750
so that no one suffers loss from this.

420
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:56,420
I don't mind pulling all-nighters.

421
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:59,190
I'll do my best so the filming schedule
is not affected.

422

(Gong Tae Sung had an affair with Eun
Si Woo. He also dated that male lawyer.)

423

I guess that's why there's no response.)

(I thought it was strange that
he stayed in Africa for a year.)

428
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,109
(He didn't go for charity, he went to go
see his son. It says, "PAPA" there.)

429
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,279
(I knew something felt off.)

430
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,650
(No way. To think how he pretended
to be the nicest guy in the world.)

431
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,750
People are actually believing this?

432
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,289
Believing it or not isn't important.

433
00:27:33,259 --> 00:27:35,230
Write about the possibility
of an Asian male...

434
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,960
- fathering a Black child, okay?
- Okay.

435
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:39,059
You find out the kid's age.

436
00:27:39,099 --> 00:27:42,069
Connect his age to whichever show
Gong was starring in at that time.

437
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,730
Don't make any conclusions though, okay?

438
00:27:44,769 --> 00:27:46,900
- End everything with a question mark.
- Okay.

439
00:27:47,670 --> 00:27:50,109
Cho Ki Ppeum. Let's see.

440
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,279
Why don't you write up
a speculative news about the mother?

441
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,609
What? What's your problem?

442
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,509
Reporters must fact-check.

443
00:27:58,279 --> 00:28:00,380
How are you going to check the facts?

444
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:03,519
What's wrong? Will he get us
a DNA paternity test result?

445
00:28:04,119 --> 00:28:06,220
Father is Gong Tae Sung.
Then where's the mother?

446
00:28:06,259 --> 00:28:07,990
What so hard about
writing an article about this?

447
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,259
This is...

448
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:12,500
what the company says.

449
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:14,960
How are you going to check the facts?

450
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,130
What's wrong? Will Lee Yoon Woo
get us a certificate...

451
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:18,130
saying that he cut ties with his father?

452
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,240
Possibility of him being an accomplice.

453
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:21,670
What so hard about
writing an article about this?

454
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:25,839
Mr. Yang. Are you happy about this?

455
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,779
Happy?

456
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,049
Why would I be happy?

457
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,619
Our job is to let people know
what they are curious about.

458
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,190
Even if we don't,
someone will write about it anyway.

459
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:38,890
Will you be happy if someone mistook
a boy who you took a photo with...

460
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,789
when you were on voluntary work
as your son?

461
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,490
Gosh. My goodness.

462
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:45,829
That's why I don't do
any voluntary work.

463
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
Hey, Ki Ppeum.

464
00:28:49,599 --> 00:28:50,900
Do you think you're the only one
who's detached?

465
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:52,799
Oh, right.

466
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,869
Is it awkward to write about it
because you have your best friend...

467
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,140
working at Starforce Entertainment?

468
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,339
Then you should go get an exclusive
interview with Gong Tae Sung.

469
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,549
Oh, right.

470
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:07,319
It's not Gong Tae Sung,

471
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,890
but I can get an exclusive interview
with someone.

472
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,089
Hello, Mr. Do Soo Hyuk.

473
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,099
I'm Cho Ki Ppeum from On Star Daily.

474
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:22,029
I'd like to interview you via phone...

475
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,599
about reckless reports
regarding Mr. Gong Tae Sung.

476
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,369
Sure.

477
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,170
I can do an interview with you.

478
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,039

There's a rumor saying that
a kid who Mr. Gong Tae Sung was close...

480
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,450
when he was doing voluntary work
in Africa is actually his son.

481
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:39,079
I want to know how Starforce
will deal with this media...

482
00:29:39,119 --> 00:29:41,180
that spread this rumor
without checking the facts.

483
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:44,150
We will make sure it gets punished
without mercy.

484
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,160
That will be our protocol.

485
00:29:45,259 --> 00:29:46,660
It will pay a fine if it has money.

486
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,859
If they have enough time,
they'll serve their time in the prison.

487
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,259
(I was dealing with the media that
were spreading groundless rumors...)

488
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:53,829
(without checking the facts.)

489
00:29:53,859 --> 00:29:55,569
(I might have to work overtime
because of them.)

490
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:59,940
I was expressing my discomfort
in the petitions.

491
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,170
I see.

492
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:03,109
So you're telling me that
if one doesn't want to go to prison...

493
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:05,940
or lose all the money that he earned
because of the fine,

494
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,349
he must write articles
after checking the facts, right?

495
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,019
(Yes. You got it right.)

496
00:30:12,049 --> 00:30:15,150
Okay then. I hope you work overtime
like a bulldozer.

497
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,289
Thank you.

498
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:19,490
So...

499
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:20,890
Do you want me to write the article?

500
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,500
Since you did
an amazing exclusive interview,

501
00:30:27,029 --> 00:30:29,869
you should write about it,
Ms. Cho Ki Ppeum, the great reporter.

502
00:30:31,369 --> 00:30:33,769
Gosh. You're so righteous.

503
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,869
I can't believe I hired you
thinking that you were a reporter.

504
00:30:38,839 --> 00:30:40,240
I had a hollow dream.

505
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:47,150
A boy from Africa is his son?
That's just ridiculous.

506
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:49,250
People are not interested in the truth.

507
00:30:49,289 --> 00:30:50,890
They want to bad-mouth someone.

508
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,220
Tae Sung is the target this time.

509
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,789
People were praising him
for doing voluntary work for a year.

510
00:30:55,829 --> 00:30:57,089
Now they're saying he's so pretentious.

511
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:00,099
How can someone so pretentious
do voluntary work for a year?

512
00:31:01,029 --> 00:31:02,099
Goodness.

513
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,869
The best we can do is...

514
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,410
one of these two options.

515
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:17,150
Hiding his relationship with Eun Si Woo.

516
00:31:18,619 --> 00:31:19,750
Or revealing it.

517
00:31:22,089 --> 00:31:23,220
Right.

518
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:26,089
Either way, he'll get hurt.

519
00:31:26,319 --> 00:31:29,029
Tae Sung will be able to keep his
reputation as a star if we reveal it,

520
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,960
but as an individual, it will hurt him.

521
00:31:35,829 --> 00:31:37,329
What's your call as the team manager
of the PR department?

522
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,839
Revealing the truth.

523
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:43,740
Then...

524
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
What's your call as Oh Han Byeol?

525
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,349
All right.

526
00:31:59,890 --> 00:32:01,519
I'll talk to Tae Sung.

527
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,000
(Gong Tae Sung must be
really promiscuous.)

528
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:11,930
(Gong Tae Sung had an affair with Eun
Si Woo. He also dated that male lawyer.)

529
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:12,900
(He's so promiscuous.
I guess that's why there's no response.)

530
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:20,410
(Do you know about this?)

531
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:21,539
(Did you know that
Gong Tae Sung has a beating habit?)

532
00:32:21,579 --> 00:32:22,480
(Many staff members were beaten by him.)

533
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:27,250
(More evil deeds of Gong Tae Sung
come up.)

534
00:32:37,190 --> 00:32:38,130
(We should've known
when he went to Africa for a year.)

535
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:38,960
(It wasn't a voluntary work,
but he went to see his son.)

536
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:39,829
(It says "Papa" in the picture.
He can't get away with this.)

537
00:32:42,869 --> 00:32:44,130
(- I knew something was off.
- I think they look alike.)

538
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,470
(- He's the worst. Does he have a son?
- A son? Gosh, this is so shocking.)

539
00:32:56,279 --> 00:32:58,450
(Help me, Mom.)

540
00:33:03,450 --> 00:33:04,619
(If you were going to be like this,)

541
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:07,559
(why did you give birth to me?)

542
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,490
(My dream...)

543
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:12,859
(wasn't...)

544
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,430
(becoming a mother.)

545
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,009
(Make me...)

546
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:26,309
a bigger star than she is.

547
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:06,519
Tae Sung.

548
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:13,960
Yu Sung.

549
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:20,699
Do you think this is because I didn't
reveal my relationship with Eun Si Woo?

550
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,070
Do I have to tell people that
she's my mother?

551
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,940
Is it something...

552
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:28,809
that I have to do?

553
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:35,340
Why are you not answering me?

554
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,650
Do you think I should reveal it too?

555
00:34:43,949 --> 00:34:45,289
I know it will hurt you,

556
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,719
but I think you should.

557
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,159
You know it will hurt me?

558
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:03,039
You know it will hurt me,
but you think I should do that?

559
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:07,440
Tae Sung. Listen carefully.

560
00:35:08,179 --> 00:35:09,949
You're not the only one
who'll go down with this.

561
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,949
All the efforts we've done so far...

562
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,650
will go down with this.

563
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,119
Right.

564
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:24,429
I forgot about it.

565
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:29,400
You're right.

566
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,809
After all,

567
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,510
you were just a manager.

568
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,250
Tae Sung.

569
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,389
Did you bring Eun Si Woo
to do this to me?

570
00:35:55,389 --> 00:35:56,989
That's not true. Listen to me.

571
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,130
Why?

572
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,000
Did you want to become her manager?

573
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:04,369
She has been denying my existence
for her whole life. Do you know that?

574
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:06,539
Does she want to use me
so that she can make a comeback?

575
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:08,800
Good for her.
She's getting all the attention now.

576
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,869
- Tae Sung.
- What!

577
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:14,280
I told you everything
that I couldn't tell anybody else.

578
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,309
You know me better than anyone else.

579
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,480
But how...

580
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,289
How can you do this to me?

581
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:25,690
- But I had to tell you this.
- No.

582
00:36:27,289 --> 00:36:28,619
I don't want to hear it.

583
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,219
You should go and rest
since the shooting is over.

584
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:57,889
Why are you here again?

585
00:37:00,489 --> 00:37:02,219
Because I have a lot on my mind.

586
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,429
The set is unsettled too, right?

587
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:09,000
Yes. A little bit.

588
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,070
I'm worried about Tae Sung.

589
00:37:13,369 --> 00:37:15,199
Jae Hyeon can't sleep because of him.

590
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:19,179
Tae Sung is okay, right?

591
00:37:21,179 --> 00:37:23,449
Don't worry about it.
Everything will be fine.

592
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:25,820
Our company always protects our actors.

593
00:37:25,849 --> 00:37:27,550
Especially when they did nothing wrong.

594
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:30,320
That's good to hear.

595
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,789
Do you remember the day
I decided to work with you?

596
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,460
Of course. I remember it vividly.

597
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,900
You said...

598
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:45,000
you will protect me until the end.

599
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,239
I think...

600
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:50,170
now I know what you meant by that.

601
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:53,380
You don't need to worry about it.

602
00:37:53,610 --> 00:37:55,480
I'm really good at protecting things.

603
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,579
And here.

604
00:37:59,619 --> 00:38:00,449
("Time for Unrequited Love")

605
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,090
It's the best one out of the scripts
we received for your next project.

606
00:38:04,889 --> 00:38:07,289
My gosh. I'm already getting offers
for my next project?

607
00:38:07,489 --> 00:38:08,719
Of course.

608
00:38:08,989 --> 00:38:11,460
I guess you still don't realize
how popular you are, Si Duk.

609
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:14,530
Oh, I haven't heard that name
in a while.

610
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,730
Right, sorry.

611
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,670
I mean, Yu Sung.

612
00:38:23,909 --> 00:38:27,179
Can't you just call me Si Duk
when it's just us?

613
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,579
No, I can't. It'll confuse me.

614
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,579
It's a romance drama called
"Time for Unrequited Love".

615
00:38:33,619 --> 00:38:35,449
You'll be the second male lead.

616
00:38:35,889 --> 00:38:37,750
You're already getting
a big role like this.

617
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:39,460
My gosh, this feels so surreal.

618
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:43,090
You're a romantic who's been in love
with a girl for a long time,

619
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:44,789
but she has no idea.

620
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:53,840
I think I can nail it.

621
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,139
What? Really?

622
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:58,940
Oh, well...

623
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:01,809
Years ago, I had a crush on a neighbor,
so I know what it's like.

624
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:04,980
Nice, talk about method acting.

625
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:53,599
Well...

626
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,130
Why did you let them beat you up?

627
00:39:57,429 --> 00:39:59,239
You said you were a good fighter.

628
00:39:59,639 --> 00:40:03,110
If I hit them even just once,
it becomes mutual assault.

629
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:06,039
You shouldn't get involved in this.

630
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,409
I'm resilient to physical pains.

631
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,820
Okay. I'll get going.

632
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,590
Okay. Get home safely, Tae Sung.

633
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:27,300
I...

634
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,900
I'll come back tomorrow,

635
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:38,670
Yu Sung.

636
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:42,849
(After all,)

637
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:45,150
you were just a manager.

638
00:40:45,179 --> 00:40:46,119
Tae Sung.

639
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:47,780
Did you bring Eun Si Woo
to do this to me?

640
00:40:47,849 --> 00:40:50,449
I told you everything
that I couldn't tell anybody else.

641
00:40:50,889 --> 00:40:53,960
You know me better than anyone else.
But how...

642
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:56,489
How can you do this to me?

643
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:29,960
Ho Young.

644
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:32,360
Well...

645
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:35,099
I'm not hitting on you right now.

646
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:38,030
I'm just trying to comfort you.

647
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:41,469
You can...

648
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:45,980
lean on me like I'm a tree.

649
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,469
Hey, you're here.

650
00:42:17,739 --> 00:42:20,079
I'll be drinking solo today.

651
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,579
I bet it costs a lot
to open a place like this.

652
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,750
Why? Do you want to open a bar?

653
00:42:33,019 --> 00:42:34,760
Running a business isn't easy.

654
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,889
Just stay at your job.

655
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:40,429
I might get fired soon.

656
00:42:40,530 --> 00:42:41,630
Why?

657
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:44,099
I snapped at my boss...

658
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,840
after biting my tongue for years
like a coward.

659
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:49,269
Today, I just couldn't hold it in.

660
00:42:57,309 --> 00:42:59,480
Well done. You'll explode
if you keep things bottled up.

661
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:01,550
Let me work here part-time
if I get fired.

662
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,920
As if. You're cut out to be a reporter.

663
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,519
I'll be honest.

664
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,289
I thought you were born to be a manager.

665
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,389
You had everything going for you.

666
00:43:12,429 --> 00:43:14,530
Mr. Yoo Gui Nong,
the former chief director of Starforce.

667
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,760
No.

668
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:18,730
The job never suited me.

669
00:43:20,170 --> 00:43:21,800
I'm much happier with my life now.

670
00:43:23,269 --> 00:43:27,010
I second that. My life is much better
with Organic Bar.

671
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:29,579
Thanks a lot. But I feel bad.

672
00:43:30,309 --> 00:43:33,650
It's my father's death anniversary,
so I have to close up early and go.

673
00:43:33,679 --> 00:43:35,250
Really? I'm sorry.

674
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,849
No, I'm sorry
for not keeping you company.

675
00:43:37,889 --> 00:43:39,860
- No worries. Just hurry home.
- Our last shot.

676
00:43:45,059 --> 00:43:46,460
(Lawyer Do Soo Hyuk)

677
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:49,130
(I read the interview article.
It was a good one.)

678
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:52,329
(You helped lessen my workload,
so I can leave earlier than expected.)

679
00:44:00,239 --> 00:44:01,440
Mr. Do.

680
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:05,780
I didn't think you'd actually come.

681
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:09,050
I could really use a drink today.

682
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:12,519
We have different jobs,
but could the reason be the same?

683
00:44:12,590 --> 00:44:13,690
Probably.

684
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,460
Thanks for being my drinking buddy.

685
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:19,329
Well, I'd like to thank you
for the same reason.

686
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,300
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

687
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,800
When I said that, my boss was like...

688
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,739
"That's why
I never do any charity work."

689
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:32,409
Gosh, it left me speechless.

690
00:44:33,139 --> 00:44:34,940
It's awful but true.

691
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,409
What should I do
when I hate my boss to death?

692
00:44:37,449 --> 00:44:38,980
Have you ever been in this situation?

693
00:44:39,179 --> 00:44:41,750
Well, does anyone
really like their boss?

694
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,219
Oh, right.

695
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:47,559
Come to think of it,
I told my mom on my boss.

696
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,659
- Your mom?
- Yes.

697
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,860
I used to work at a very big law firm.

698
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,130
And my mom taught my ex-boss.

699
00:44:55,829 --> 00:44:58,630
Right, my mother is a law professor.

700
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:00,500
So I said to my mom,

701
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,309
"Mom, couldn't you have
taught your student better?"

702
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,570
"He's a total scumbag."

703
00:45:05,610 --> 00:45:08,309
My gosh. You're on another level.
So what did she say?

704
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,579
Well, I quit right after that...

705
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:12,050
and opened my own firm.

706
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,179
Good for you.
You really are on another level.

707
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,949
I'm scared to go in tomorrow
and find out that I'm getting fired.

708
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,219
My family is proud of me
for even just passing the bar...

709
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:24,559
and becoming a lawyer.

710
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:28,260
They'll be very surprised if they
find out how hard I work these days.

711
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,469
Gosh. You were born
with a silver spoon...

712
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,769
No. You're telling me that you were born
with a diamond spoon in your mouth.

713
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:36,940
Which is why
some people find me obnoxious.

714
00:45:36,969 --> 00:45:39,710
No, not at all. I think you're cool.

715
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,880
- Really?
- Yes.

716
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:46,219
I thought you were cool today.

717
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,320
And your article too.

718
00:45:49,949 --> 00:45:51,920
It's the only article
I ever clicked "like" on.

719
00:45:56,789 --> 00:45:59,289
I should pick up the bill today.

720
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:02,500
What? You weren't going to?

721
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,489
Oh, boy. People might think
they're actually dating.

722
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,099
Was I talking to myself just now?

723
00:46:38,769 --> 00:46:40,670
Yu Sung is so busy.

724
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:44,070
And I fired Min Kyu.

725
00:46:46,210 --> 00:46:47,409
I'm so lonely.

726
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:51,750
Oh, dear. I feel so lonely.

727
00:46:55,219 --> 00:46:56,949
If our shoot ends early,

728
00:46:57,449 --> 00:46:59,019
Shall we go eat ramyeon at Han River?

729
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:02,590
Ramyeon?

730
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:05,289
Stop it.

731
00:47:05,329 --> 00:47:06,500
Stop what?

732
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:13,139
- Yu Na.
- You brat!

733
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,699
Hey, stop!

734
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:16,409
Let him go. What's wrong with you?

735
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Gosh, your grip is strong.

736
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:22,010
Yu Na. Didn't I tell you
not to pull his hair?

737
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,780
What if Jae Hyeon loses all his hair?

738
00:47:23,809 --> 00:47:26,420
Will you pay for his hair transplant?

739
00:47:27,449 --> 00:47:30,349
I'll apologize in her stead. I'm sorry.

740
00:47:31,619 --> 00:47:32,650
It's okay.

741
00:47:32,690 --> 00:47:34,789
Not even fighting dogs
fight as much as you two.

742
00:47:36,489 --> 00:47:38,130
No, forget it.

743
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:40,230
Just go ahead and fight.

744
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:42,329
Go on. Fight as much as you want.

745
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,599
Think about Mr. Gong.

746
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:47,139
It was one scandal.
Look where it got him.

747
00:47:48,139 --> 00:47:50,239
I'm sure that would never happen
with you two though.

748
00:47:50,639 --> 00:47:52,170
Just the thought of you guys dating...

749
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,940
gives me chills.

750
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:55,179
Keep it going.

751
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:57,010
Never stop hating each other.

752
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:58,079
Got it?

753
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:00,849
- Yes, I understand.
- Good.

754
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,349
Come down when you're ready, Yu Na.

755
00:48:05,389 --> 00:48:06,920
Don't pull his hair, okay?

756
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,389
Yes, sir.

757
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,590
I'm so glad you called me.

758
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,429
Right now? Sure.

759
00:48:15,829 --> 00:48:16,900
What's wrong?

760
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,230
Were you scared?

761
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:20,340
No.

762
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:23,739
It's a mess at the agency these days.

763
00:48:24,369 --> 00:48:27,280
Tae Sung was my role model as an actor.

764
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:31,280
Seeing how one article
caused such an uproar...

765
00:48:31,309 --> 00:48:33,050
upset me a lot. I can barely sleep.

766
00:48:34,349 --> 00:48:35,480
Seriously?

767
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:37,219
You fall asleep in an instant.

768
00:48:39,019 --> 00:48:40,690
I'm a little scared too.

769
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:01,809
Now that I think about it,

770
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:07,219
I only just started earning enough
to buy myself an Hermes bag.

771
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:10,590
It'll become a problem
if I get photographed with you.

772
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,559
- Let's break up.
- What?

773
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,329
Eat the ramyeon by yourself.

774
00:49:18,389 --> 00:49:19,590
Bye.

775
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:25,969
We're always ready.

776
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,199
All right, goodbye then.

777
00:49:27,239 --> 00:49:28,469
Thank you.

778
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:30,409
I'll call you often.

779
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:31,940
Okay, bye.

780
00:49:37,679 --> 00:49:39,210
What's wrong, Yu Na?

781
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,079
Gosh, are you crying?

782
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:43,889
You couldn't buy
Hermes' limited edition bag?

783
00:49:44,349 --> 00:49:45,619
That's not it.

784
00:49:45,719 --> 00:49:46,789
Then what?

785
00:49:47,019 --> 00:49:48,420
Did your father freeze your card?

786
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:51,289
That's not it.

787
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,260
Gosh, what is it then?

788
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,300
Did Yun Jae Hyeon pull your hair
after I left?

789
00:49:58,630 --> 00:49:59,800
Did he really do that?

790
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,409
Yun Jae Hyeon, that punk.
I'll teach him a lesson.

791
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,670
Don't cry. It's okay.

792
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,210
Next time I see him,

793
00:50:07,239 --> 00:50:08,940
I'll give him a good beating.

794
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:10,110
So don't cry.

795
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:13,820
No, don't do that. Don't beat him.

796
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:16,690
He's done nothing wrong.

797
00:50:19,489 --> 00:50:20,719
You want to do it yourself?

798
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,559
Gosh, please don't cry.

799
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:25,530
I won't beat him up, okay?

800
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:29,059
Min Kyu was the most patient person.

801
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,400
Why did he have to turn out
to be a psycho?

802
00:50:31,429 --> 00:50:32,900
Gosh, this is exhausting.

803
00:50:39,940 --> 00:50:41,010
To be honest,

804
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:44,010
I thought it was impossible
even until yesterday.

805
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,809
But I'm getting scared.

806
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:49,320
I'm worried Mr. Gong
might never recover from this.

807
00:50:50,590 --> 00:50:51,550
Shocking.

808
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:55,190
We thought he was indestructible,
but were we fooling ourselves?

809
00:50:55,489 --> 00:50:58,190
Every Starforce staff feels hopeless.

810
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,659
The most viewed article today was,

811
00:51:01,329 --> 00:51:04,429
"Gong Tae Sung's
Hard-Earned Empire Crumbles."

812
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:07,039
It's so upsetting.

813
00:51:07,570 --> 00:51:09,199
People who used to praise him...

814
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:10,610
are turning their backs on him.

815
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,909
How could they do that?

816
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:14,010
They have no idea
who Gong Tae Sung really is.

817
00:51:14,610 --> 00:51:15,739
"Nation's Sweetheart"?

818
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:18,210
More like "Nation's Enemy".

819
00:51:24,789 --> 00:51:27,159
I have a question though.

820
00:51:28,889 --> 00:51:31,059
I'm asking purely out of curiosity.

821
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,630
What is the truth behind Mr. Gong...

822
00:51:35,929 --> 00:51:38,230
and Eun Si Woo's relationship?

823
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:41,570
I'm curious too.

824
00:51:42,369 --> 00:51:46,110
I'm confused as to why we're
just sitting ducks regarding this issue.

825
00:51:46,309 --> 00:51:48,340
What if it's true?

826
00:51:48,380 --> 00:51:49,849
I can't help but think that too.

827
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:52,309
Maybe there's something we don't know.

828
00:51:52,579 --> 00:51:54,880
Honestly, this is confusing me.

829
00:51:55,179 --> 00:51:57,050
The rumors just keep growing.

830
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,489
I end up imagining things.

831
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:01,219
I don't know what's what now.

832
00:52:29,719 --> 00:52:30,820
Hello.

833
00:52:47,139 --> 00:52:50,369
Eun Si Woo's emergency
press conference will begin now.

Hello.

836
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,239
It's been a while.

837
00:53:22,170 --> 00:53:23,440
I'm Eun Si Woo.

(It's the anniversary
of his death soon.)

843
00:54:12,219 --> 00:54:14,320
(Who knew he'd go down so easily?
Yoon Woo would be smiling, right?)

(Comment)

845
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:03,340
Just as I expected.

846
00:55:04,139 --> 00:55:06,679
You were a pretty well-known fan,
Smile Boy.

847
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,809
Gosh, I'm honored you remember me.

848
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:14,449
But pretending to be a fellow fan...

849
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,190
was a low move, Ms. Oh.

850
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:18,820
Low move?

851
00:55:19,050 --> 00:55:21,190
I don't think you have the right
to say that.

852
00:55:21,659 --> 00:55:22,920
Why did you call me here?

853
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:25,360
The police are done investigating me.

854
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:27,530
I'll be receiving
my due punishment soon.

855
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:33,199
Isn't it so funny?

856
00:55:33,869 --> 00:55:34,940
You know what?

857
00:55:34,969 --> 00:55:37,869
I don't know what Gong Tae Sung's
relationship is to Eun Si Woo.

858
00:55:37,909 --> 00:55:38,869
Nor do I care.

859
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:40,309
I simply said,

860
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:43,309
"I bet they're having an affair."

861
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,809
But they went ahead
and made up the story themselves...

862
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:46,949
to blow it up.

863
00:55:49,050 --> 00:55:50,320
Oh, that African kid.

864
00:55:50,989 --> 00:55:52,349
That wasn't my doing.

865
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,860
It means besides me,
many others hate Gong Tae Sung too.

866
00:55:56,659 --> 00:55:57,829
People...

867
00:55:58,230 --> 00:55:59,760
who want to see Gong Tae Sung go down.

868
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,199
Why did you do it?

869
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,800
Gong Tae Sung was best friends
with Lee Yoon Woo.

870
00:56:08,099 --> 00:56:09,239
Best friends?

871
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,380
(A best friend who doesn't even
attend his funeral?)

872
00:56:20,519 --> 00:56:24,420
(I watch TV during my free time.)

873
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:29,489
(I like to lay around in bed
like any other person.)

876

(How could he smile like that
the day after his friend died?)

877
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:41,639
(He's inhuman.)

878
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,110
If he's human,

879
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:50,510
he can't smile like that.

880
00:56:51,510 --> 00:56:54,380
Didn't you just need someone
to hate and resent?

881
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:58,949
Do you know what kind of person
Yoon Woo was?

882
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:01,320
You have no idea.

883
00:57:02,360 --> 00:57:04,090
Do you think Yoon Woo will be happy...

884
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:06,190
to see you do this?

885
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,769
I don't have to know that.

886
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:12,900
I'm satisfied with what I've done.

887
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,269
I've done my revenge in my own way.

888
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:19,909
All right. Be satisfied with that.

889
00:57:20,710 --> 00:57:22,539
But don't go any further.

890
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,880
Why? Are you scared that
I might do something more?

891
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:28,820
I'm sure Yoon Woo will be sad.

892
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:34,889
Don't put on an act.

893
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:38,329
You couldn't protect Yoon Woo.

894
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,469
Why didn't you try like this
to protect Yoon Woo?

895
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:56,579
I know.

896
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:02,449
