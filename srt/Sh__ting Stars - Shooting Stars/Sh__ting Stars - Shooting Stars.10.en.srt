- Tiffany.
- What?

And if you do that
to Ms. Kwon suddenly...

22
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,039
I should have caught her.

What?

24
00:02:53,509 --> 00:02:55,650
Ms. Kwon.
The housekeeper at Tae Sung's place.

25
00:02:57,349 --> 00:03:00,289
That woman is not
an ordinary housekeeper.

26
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,050
What do you mean?

27
00:03:03,789 --> 00:03:06,520
I saw her in the luxury goods stores
of the department store a few days ago.

28
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:08,830
She was completely insane.

29
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,300
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

30
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,400
No. I'm sure.

31
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,800
She kicked the store manager
in the shin...

32
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:18,139
because they sold
the only limited edition watch to me.

33
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,870
She eventually took it from me.

34
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,879
I was so baffled
that I stared at her face for a while.

35
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,780
Didn't you notice
anything weird about her?

36

(It's not for sure,)

40
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:47,000
(but her soups are way too salty
these days.)

41

to have her get it checked out...)

(- for the time being.)
- I got it.

44

Do you remember the housekeeper
who was recommended for Tae Sung?

49
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,990
Jin Woo's mom recommended her, right?

50
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:45,519
(What's with the random question
so late at night?)

51

Hurry up and think about it.
This is urgent.

(Isn't she the housekeeper that all of
the rich Gangnam ladies wanted?)

55
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:56,000
Is she someone
that Jin Woo's mom personally knows?

56
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:58,800

I forget things from just yesterday.)

that she comes to my house.

62
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,060
But she even grabbed Ms. Kwon
by the hair.

63

Grandma?

67
00:05:53,689 --> 00:05:56,490
Whenever I was having a hard time,
my grandma would...

68
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,199
pat me on the back like this,
and it always made me feel better.

69
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,069
So do you feel a bit better now?

70
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,480
Yes. Completely.

71

to call me grandma.

72

laughing like that?

- What?
- He never really gets off work.

He'll probably lounge around somewhere.

I wasn't planning on agreeing
to other interview requests anyway.

It doesn't look like

If it'd make you uncomfortable,
I can run the story without it.

Well, even my yearbook photos
are circulating online already.

But the thing is,

I don't like those photos.

Be honest. He really isn't

false rumors like that,

Look who's here.

165
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,340
It's my boyfriend.

166
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,809
Hey, babe.

167
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,509
Are you taking the stairs again?
Isn't it such a hassle?

168
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,090
Why don't you just take the elevator?
It's much easier.

169
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,720
No.

170
00:11:58,789 --> 00:12:01,690
You and I should be enjoying
a secret rendezvous in the staircase,

171
00:12:02,259 --> 00:12:03,659
audaciously.

172
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,730
I'm so happy to see you.

173
00:12:12,299 --> 00:12:13,440
So you two...

174
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,009
would've been happy without me.

175
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,340
I was too dense.

176
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,179
I'll give you some privacy
and take the elevator instead.

177
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,409
Tae Sung.

178
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:26,220
I'll wait for you in the parking lot.
Take your time.

179
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:27,919
I'm rooting for you.

180
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,289
He left us alone because he wanted
to take the elevator, right?

181
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:37,860
Yes.

182
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,529
I think so.

183
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,200
He's smarter than he looks.

184
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:51,409
Keep going up then.

185
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:52,710
Okay.

186
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:54,309
Keep going down then.

187
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:55,379
Thanks.

188
00:12:58,379 --> 00:12:59,480
Wait.

189
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:03,750
Yes?

190
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,529
Are you happy with Ms. Oh?

191
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:14,470
Yes.

192
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,169
What a cruel way
to ditch your rumored boyfriend.

193
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,769
You hurt my feelings.

194
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,980
With that said,

195
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,210
I'm going to take the elevator
from now on.

196
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:42,429
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

197
00:13:44,059 --> 00:13:46,259
It's on me today,
so eat as much as you want.

198
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,700
Especially you, Ms. Oh.

199
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,100
Your article helped us too.

200
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,470
Everyone was talking
about your article today.

201
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,169
Hey, it almost blew up our server.

202
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:56,039
My boss complimented me for once.

203
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,340
By the way, did you know that
Mr. Do got a fan forum overnight?

204
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,649
Even my co-worker, Ms. Jung, signed up.

205
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,049
She said he awakened
her fangirl spirit...

206
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,919
- or something.
- My gosh.

207
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:06,620
He's practically a celebrity now.

208
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:09,320
- We'll sign him at this rate.
- Guess what his fan forum is called.

209
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,019
It's so original. Take a guess.

210
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,529
Do-Crows!

211
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,600
The scarecrows who protect Do Soo Hyuk!

212
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:20,899
Wrong! But it wasn't bad.

213
00:14:20,929 --> 00:14:23,029
I want to get this right.
This is my specialty.

214
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,039
Do-Variant!

215
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,799
Mr. Do spreads fast
like a virus variant!

216
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:30,039
You do have an original mind,
but it's wrong.

217
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:31,980
Do Tan Boys. DTS!

218
00:14:32,009 --> 00:14:33,779
Hey, you took it too far.

219
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,450
I was just guessing.

220
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,009
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:38,049 --> 00:14:39,120
Who are you apologizing to?

222
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,149
You don't need to know.

223
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,850
Then what is it?

224
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,549
The answer is...

225
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,559
Do Therapy.

226
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:48,230
Seeing Do Soo Hyuk heals them.

227
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,889
My gosh!

228
00:14:50,230 --> 00:14:52,629
Koreans are so good
at coming up with creative names.

229
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,700
My co-worker would do anything
to get that therapy.

230
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,169
I'm suddenly...

231
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,039
reminded of a noncelebrity
who has a fan club.

232
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,110
Are you talking about Yusungwoo?

233
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,850
Kang Yu Sang's fan club.

234
00:15:10,009 --> 00:15:13,450
Kang Yu Sung is
all you ever think about.

235
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:16,220
It's killing me too.

236
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,759
Here.

237
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,460
Ho Young.

238
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:22,730
Don't you have a new Band-Aid?

239
00:15:22,860 --> 00:15:24,330
That looks very old.

240
00:15:25,029 --> 00:15:26,159
Should I get you a new one?

241
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:27,429
I have one. Take mine.

242
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,799
No! It's fine.

243
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:30,970
This...

244
00:15:31,870 --> 00:15:34,100
Yu Sung put it on me.

245
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:42,809
That's right!

246
00:15:42,879 --> 00:15:45,350
How was your dinner with Mr. Do?

247
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:47,690
That was a long time ago.

248
00:15:48,389 --> 00:15:50,549
I already turned him down.

249
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,559
When?

250
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,659
Gosh. That's too bad.

251
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:56,129
Then you can't get the Do Therapy.

252
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:57,960
Hey, Ho Young.

253
00:15:58,059 --> 00:15:59,929
Don't just pay attention
to your Yu Sungs.

254
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,600
Pay some attention to me too.

255
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,500
- Okay.
- Yes. Give her some attention.

256
00:16:05,539 --> 00:16:07,539
- Read the room.
- It's fine.

257
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,690
Today, it doesn't look pretty at all.

258
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,889
I got rejected by a woman...

259
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:31,230
and got into a dating scandal
with my next-door neighbor.

260
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:37,000
Does this place have bad energy
or something?

261
00:16:44,009 --> 00:16:45,980
Hi, Mom. You read the interview, right?

262
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,450
Right. I told you it wasn't true.

263
00:16:49,809 --> 00:16:51,779
Even if I were to date men,
it wouldn't be him.

264
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,950
He's not my type at all.

265
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:00,460
Come on, Mom.
You can't even take a joke?

266
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:03,789
What? Why should I move?
That's a hassle.

267
00:17:05,059 --> 00:17:06,130
It's fine.

268
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,069
(Who Is Eun Si Woo,
the Legendary Actress?)

269
00:17:15,539 --> 00:17:17,410
(Eun Si Woo's filmography)

270
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:22,809
("Night of the Sky",
Starring Eun Si Woo)

271
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:29,690
(Eun Si Woo's Last Film,
"Night of the Sky")

272
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,140
(Many things...)

273
00:18:24,339 --> 00:18:26,480
(Truly many things happened.)

274
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,410
(I want to remember everything.)

275
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,289
(Including this very moment.)

276
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,619
He's really sick, isn't he?

277
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:44,289
Yes. He's been sick since dawn.

278
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:47,759
I was planning on canceling,
but he didn't want to be a nuisance.

279
00:19:56,829 --> 00:19:57,900
Thank you for today.

280
00:19:58,569 --> 00:20:00,470
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

281
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,009
Thank you.

282
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:06,380
- Thank you. Good work today.
- Well done.

283
00:20:37,609 --> 00:20:39,380
I hope he's doing all right on set.

284
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:49,319
- Did you look into it, Dae Soo?
- Look into what?

285
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:51,859
Jin Woo's mom, what else?
The housekeeper.

286
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:52,990
Oh, that.

287
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:55,589
- I think I'll need more time.
- Why?

288
00:20:55,630 --> 00:20:58,059
She's traveling abroad
with her high school friends.

289
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:01,900
Cut me some slack.
She's not even my mom.

290
00:21:01,930 --> 00:21:03,900
I can't call her on vacation for this.

291
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:06,670
I would be crossing a line,
don't you agree?

292
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,569
What's wrong? Is it bad?

293
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,980
No, it's nothing.

294
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,710
Just tell me, I'm curious now.

295
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,079
Don't leave me hanging.

296
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:20,980
What's the problem now?

297
00:21:21,019 --> 00:21:22,789
It's Yu Na and Jae Hyeon.

298
00:21:22,819 --> 00:21:24,349
What is it? Are they at it again?

299
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:26,359
- No, that's not it.
- Are they cursing each other out?

300
00:21:26,390 --> 00:21:28,490
No. They won't even look at each other.

301
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:29,660
- What?
- What was that?

302
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:32,259
They didn't say a word
to one another today.

303
00:21:36,869 --> 00:21:38,900
So they've switched over
to ignoring each other?

304
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:42,309
Gosh, I was wondering
why it was so peaceful.

305
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:44,940
I guess the physical altercation
really took a toll on them.

306
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,150
What a bunch of brats.
They're so darn immature.

307
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,819
(You're so annoying!
Why are you so pretty?)

308
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:55,119
(I almost screamed again.)

309
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:57,750
(Your handsome face
is more infuriating.)

310
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:58,990
(I almost screamed.)

311
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,190
(Nation's Fairy.
Did you see the script?)

312
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,859
(We have another kissing scene.)

313
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:06,960
(Kissing scenes are so hard for me.)

314
00:22:07,529 --> 00:22:09,069
(I need practice.)

315
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:12,740
(Practice today then? Are you down?)

316
00:22:12,769 --> 00:22:15,710
(Practice today then? Are you down?)

317
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,079
(I'm down!)

318
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,089
Hello, Mr. Kang?

319
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:33,160
Yes, I'm feeling under the weather.

320
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,730
I must've been really startled that day.

321
00:22:36,259 --> 00:22:38,460
I'll come back
after one more week of rest.

322
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:40,460
Okay. I'm really sorry.

323
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,470
Tae Sung is very worried too.

324
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,970
He actually called me.

325
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,900
I wasn't hurt but he sent so much money

00:32:46,099 --> 00:32:48,039
Gosh, since when were you married?

492
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,210
Nice. I didn't have to give you
any congratulatory money.

493
00:32:50,269 --> 00:32:51,869
Just let it slide.

494
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,809
Oh, right.

495
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,180
Jin Woo's mom is in Korea,
so I asked her...

496
00:32:56,309 --> 00:32:57,680
- about the housekeeper.
- You did?

497
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,779
She said that...

498
00:32:59,819 --> 00:33:02,049
she didn't know
the housekeeper in person.

499
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:03,349
What was it?

500
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,759
A friend in her golf club
introduced the housekeeper to her.

501
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,730
She said the housekeeper
worked at her place for a long time.

502
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:10,930
That friend...

503
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,529
is a super rich lady
who owns a bunch of condos in Gangnam.

504
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:16,869
She used to live in the countryside,

505
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,599
but she became rich
when the area was developed.

506
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:21,539
Hey, by any chance,

507
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,339
do you know that lady's name?

508
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,269
Gosh, I did hear her name.

509
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:28,750
Was it Myung Hee?

510
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:31,210
Right. It was Myung Hee.

511
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,750
Sorry. I have to go.

512
00:33:34,779 --> 00:33:36,549
Where are you... Gosh.

513
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,789
- Pay before you go.
- Later.

514
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,019
Gosh.

515
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:43,160
What is he up to?

516
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,829
(Kwon Myung Hee)

517
00:33:57,839 --> 00:33:59,309
(Kwon Myung Hee)

518
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,049
(Caller ID Restricted)

519
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,030
(A special time)

520
00:34:16,059 --> 00:34:18,329
(A special steak)

521
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:21,329
(Limited edition special sports car)

522
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:25,599
(A special dinner)

523
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:28,869
(A special massage)

524
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:37,079
(But this time,
this necklace isn't special at all.)

525
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,989
- Is this the PR Team?
- Yes.

526
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,090
You have a delivery.

527
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,429
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

528
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:54,000
(But this time,
this necklace isn't special at all.)

529
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,159
What is it?

530
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,570
(From Oh Han Byeol)

531
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:01,199
Ms. Oh sent these?

532
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:03,710
Ms. Oh? Are these for us?

533
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,170
Goodness.

534
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,110
I'm about to cry.

535
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:10,710
What a surprise.

536
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,949
Breaking news.

537
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:14,280
Ms. Oh bought necklaces
for the PR Department.

538
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,949
They are expensive ones
from a designer brand.

539
00:35:16,449 --> 00:35:17,920
I can't believe this.

540
00:35:18,019 --> 00:35:20,090
I've never received a necklace
as a present.

541
00:35:21,159 --> 00:35:24,929
♪ Twinkle, twinkle, little star ♪

542
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:27,030
It's not small. It's big.

543
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,070
(To Oh Han Byeol)

544
00:35:30,099 --> 00:35:31,369
- Gosh.
- How do I look?

545
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,969
You look so beautiful.

546
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,239
What about me?

547
00:35:37,639 --> 00:35:38,670
It looks great on you.

548
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,510
It's flipped.

549
00:35:40,539 --> 00:35:41,809
(Do you think you're so special?)

550
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,050
(Don't get the wrong idea.)

551
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:44,610
(You're as common as that necklace.)

552
00:35:53,389 --> 00:35:54,519
Ms. Kim.

553
00:35:55,059 --> 00:35:56,889
I'll take the afternoon off.

554
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,070
(Yu Sung)

555
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,670
Ms. Kwon.

556
00:36:10,139 --> 00:36:11,739
I thought you were coming
from next week.

557
00:36:12,409 --> 00:36:14,539
Are you feeling okay now?

558
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,780
I'm here...

559
00:36:15,949 --> 00:36:17,409
to say goodbye.

560
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:22,320
If this is about what happened that day,

561
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,219
I apologize instead.

562
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:27,159
No need. I was going to quit anyway.

563
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:29,289
I've gotten tired of working here.

564
00:36:31,329 --> 00:36:32,460
Pardon?

565
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,659
Can I give you a hug?

566
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,000
To say goodbye?

567
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:02,389
(Yu Sung)

568
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:16,940
Mr. Kang! Good to see you.
I thought I wouldn't get to see you.

569
00:37:16,969 --> 00:37:18,809
What is this?

570
00:37:20,039 --> 00:37:22,079
What do you mean?

571
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,849
Why did you do such a thing?

572
00:37:23,949 --> 00:37:26,980
Me? All I did was work hard.

573
00:37:27,179 --> 00:37:30,519
You know, people say work is sacred.

574
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:32,619
And your resume was fake.

575
00:37:32,659 --> 00:37:35,590
What? No. That really is my address.

576
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,429
Well, I own the whole building.

577
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,369
Why are you glaring at me like that?

578
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:47,440
People might think
I committed a crime or something.

579
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:51,710
Is it against the law for rich people
to work as housekeepers?

580
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,349
Just be grateful
that I didn't sue Eun Si Woo.

581
00:37:57,010 --> 00:37:58,909
How dare she pull my hair?

582
00:38:00,019 --> 00:38:03,489
Mr. Kang. It's been fun.

583
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,699
I guess you find all these things
amusing.

584
00:38:14,829 --> 00:38:17,170
Do you know what people call me?
Polite Nutcase.

585
00:38:18,269 --> 00:38:20,699
If you do anything to harm Tae Sung,

586
00:38:21,469 --> 00:38:23,170
I will not let you get away with it.

587
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:25,940
Sure, suit yourself.

588
00:38:27,309 --> 00:38:28,309
Let's go.

589
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:49,630
Tae Sung.

590
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,070
Are you all right?

591
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:05,550
Ms. Kwon.

592
00:39:08,449 --> 00:39:09,690
You saw her too, right?

593
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,489
I wasn't mistaken, was I?

594
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,329
No.

595
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:28,639
I really can't wrap my head around this.

596
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,579
I'm going to get some sleep.

597
00:39:57,769 --> 00:39:59,440
(Special Present)

598
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:02,440
(Here's my special present.)

599
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:11,980
(3 years ago)

600
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:15,480
(I feel like these shoes will take me
somewhere special.)

601
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,550
(I feel like these shoes will take me
somewhere special.)

602
00:40:20,219 --> 00:40:21,590
(I really love them.)

603
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:27,929
(Park Dae Il sent you a photo.)

604
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,599
(Park Dae Il)

605
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,000
(So special. How did you get
this limited edition? I love you.)

606
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:35,969
(Baek Jung Hoon: I miss you.)

607
00:40:36,409 --> 00:40:38,539
(You bought me a supercar.
You're the best!)

608
00:40:43,710 --> 00:40:44,780
Ma'am.

609
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:49,619
The limited-edition watch
you sent to Gong Tae Sung...

610
00:40:49,719 --> 00:40:51,019
Is he stoked?

611
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:53,320
I'm booked out this week though.

612
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,519
All these boys want
to take me out for dinner.

613
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:56,860
He doesn't want it.

614
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,559
Again?

615
00:41:02,429 --> 00:41:04,130
Does he even know...

616
00:41:05,369 --> 00:41:06,500
how much it costs?

617
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:09,210
I was told that
he never accepts gifts...

618
00:41:10,409 --> 00:41:11,710
from his fans.

619
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:17,550
Never?

620
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,349
How dare he say no to my kindness?

621
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,920
He turned down
such a special gift from me?

622
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,829
How dare he?

623
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,860
Who does he think he is?

624
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:54,449
Hello. My name is Kwon Myung Hee.
I'll be working here starting today.

625
00:41:58,619 --> 00:42:00,360
You must've been going through a lot.

626
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,860
I've also lost someone dear to me,
so I know how that feels.

627
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,039
But you see, it's important to go out
and get some sun from time to time.

628
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:26,550
You should have accepted my presents
when I sent them to you.

629
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,619
You'll think of me whenever
you eat something salty from now on.

630
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,929
So what do you say?

631
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,230
I'm special now, aren't I?

632
00:43:01,849 --> 00:43:03,119
(Special Present)

633
00:43:03,150 --> 00:43:04,650
(Here's my special present.)

634
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,889
(What a special picture. Thank you.)

635
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,519
(Is that Gong Tae Sung's place
in the photo?)

636
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:28,239
- You're here.
- Hey, Han Byeol.

637
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,710
That woman, Kwon Myung Hee,

638
00:43:29,750 --> 00:43:32,179
sent the same necklace
to everyone on my team.

639
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:33,650
The exact same necklace.

640
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,119
She even sent me one.

641
00:43:36,250 --> 00:43:37,889
She's so weird.
Something's wrong with her.

642
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,690
Did anything else happen?
Are you all right?

643
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:40,820
I'm okay.

644
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:43,760
- Was she here?
- Yes. She was already here.

645
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,130
She wanted to be special to Tae Sung,
so she fed him salty food on purpose.

646
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:48,199
What?

647
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:51,070
Tae Sung even looked for a doctor
in case she had dementia.

648
00:43:51,099 --> 00:43:53,739
- What do we do now?
- Stay with Tae Sung for now.

649
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,369
I need to do more digging.

650
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:57,710
I'll text you the new door code.

651
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,059
- Mr. Do.
- Hello.

652
00:44:16,289 --> 00:44:17,659
- Please take a seat.
- Thank you.

653
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,429
I checked the security footage.

654
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:25,400
The woman
who left with the wristwatch...

655
00:44:25,429 --> 00:44:27,570
is Mr. Gong's housekeeper, right?

656
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,969
Yes, that's right.

657
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:31,570
I looked over her resume as well.

658
00:44:31,909 --> 00:44:33,739
But I can't say
she put down false information.

659
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,409
We can't forcefully seize
her cell phone either.

660
00:44:36,449 --> 00:44:38,849
Yes, I think she checked the legal side
beforehand.

661
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:41,920
She actually said to me that
she didn't do anything illegal.

662
00:44:41,949 --> 00:44:44,119
My, how thorough.

663
00:44:46,159 --> 00:44:48,519
This may not be a good solution,

664
00:44:48,889 --> 00:44:51,090
but we can file for a restraining order.

665
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:53,500
Okay. Please proceed with it, then.

666
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:54,730
Okay.

667
00:44:56,829 --> 00:45:00,269
I have to say,
being a celebrity isn't easy.

668
00:45:01,570 --> 00:45:03,869
Nothing scars you more
than finding out you knew nothing...

669
00:45:04,769 --> 00:45:06,340
about someone you thought you knew well.

670
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:08,940
I checked on my way here.

671
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:12,949
She's famous for sending expensive gifts
to celebrities to befriend them.

672
00:45:14,219 --> 00:45:17,920
A few years ago, a fan sent
Tae Sung a really expensive present.

673
00:45:18,289 --> 00:45:19,789
I think it was her.

674
00:45:20,789 --> 00:45:23,460
I never thought she would apply
to work as his housekeeper.

675
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,429
It's my fault.

676
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:31,099
No, it's not. Who would've thought
someone would do such a thing?

677
00:45:31,869 --> 00:45:33,269
Don't beat yourself up for it.

678
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:45,079
Yu Sung.

679
00:45:45,750 --> 00:45:46,920
Hi, Ho Young.

680
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:50,119
How do you feel about
your first awards show?

681
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,219
I'm not sure.

682
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,219
I've never worn a tuxedo.
It's uncomfortable and suffocating.

683
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,690
You have to get used to it.

684
00:45:56,730 --> 00:45:58,630
This will be the beginning
of many award shows.

685
00:45:59,159 --> 00:46:01,199
- Are you done?
- Yes, I'm coming out.

686
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,610
Do I look okay?

687
00:46:11,739 --> 00:46:13,309
- Don't I look awkward?
- Not at all.

688
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:14,840
You look amazing.

689
00:46:15,179 --> 00:46:17,179
You're going to look the best out there.

690
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:39,940
You had fuzz in your hair.

691
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:41,469
I did?

692
00:46:42,369 --> 00:46:44,469
That's weird.
I washed my hair today though.

693
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,210
I guess I wasn't thorough.

694
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,579
Anyway, don't be nervous
and do a good job, okay?

695
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:51,480
I will.

696
00:46:53,219 --> 00:46:55,179
Gosh, you look great. Stunning.

697
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,119
Yu Sung.

698
00:47:31,050 --> 00:47:32,190
Yes, Ho Young?

699
00:47:32,449 --> 00:47:33,659
Why are you here so late?

700
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:36,760
I just got done
with Yu Sung's awards show.

701
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:38,360
I had some unfinished work too.

702
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:41,329
I'm impressed by how fast
a rookie got an award.

703
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,800
It's nothing really.

704
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:44,730
It wasn't anything prominent.

705
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:48,739
Were you drinking alone?

706
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:50,739
Yes.

707
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:53,639
It's been a rough day.

708
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,150
Yu Sung.

709
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,119
Would you like to grab a drink with me?

710
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,889
It's on me today.

711
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,889
Here.

712
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:18,099
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

713
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,440
It's been a while since we did this.

714
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:30,449
Yes, it has.

715
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:33,119
We've been too busy, right?

716
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,619
Yes, that's right.

717
00:48:34,949 --> 00:48:37,219
Especially you. You've always been busy.

718
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:38,889
True.

719
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:41,019
I've just been busy all the time.

720
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:50,329
Did something happen?

721
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,800
Nothing much.

722
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,699
I just have a lot on my mind.

723
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,769
I guess I'm taking time...

724
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:58,440
for some self-reflection.

725
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,920
I'm asking myself
if I deserve to be a manager...

726
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,750
and other questions of that manner.

727
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,559
That makes me sad.

728
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:16,090
It breaks my heart to hear you say that.

729
00:49:16,590 --> 00:49:18,429
You're the colleague
whom I respect the most.

730
00:49:22,599 --> 00:49:23,769
I appreciate it, Ho Young.

731
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,030
That comforts me a lot.

732
00:49:34,039 --> 00:49:35,510
I'm not comforting you.

733
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,010
It's just the truth.

734
00:49:41,719 --> 00:49:43,849
Gosh, Park Ho Young.

735
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:46,420
Look at you, all grown up now.

736
00:49:46,460 --> 00:49:48,190
Proud of you, kiddo.

737
00:50:14,650 --> 00:50:16,150
From now on,

738
00:50:16,989 --> 00:50:19,760
please don't pat my head.

739
00:50:23,690 --> 00:50:25,429
Gosh, I'm sorry, Ho Young.

740
00:50:26,159 --> 00:50:27,329
I guess it bothered you.

741
00:50:27,559 --> 00:50:28,730
I had no idea...

742
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,199
It makes my heart flutter.

743
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:33,940
What?

744
00:50:43,949 --> 00:50:45,610
I like you, Yu Sung.

745
00:51:04,929 --> 00:51:06,030
Goodbye.

746
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,409
Here you go.

747
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:45,969
Long time no see.

748
00:51:46,010 --> 00:51:48,610
It really has been.
You haven't aged one bit.

749
00:51:49,309 --> 00:51:50,679
I can't say the same to you.

750
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:52,949
You're just a vampire who never ages.

751
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:55,380
How is it possible you look that way
after all these years?

752
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,750
Impressive.

753
00:51:56,789 --> 00:51:58,590
You know how to sweet talk now.

754
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,320
You've leveled up, Mr. Choi.

755
00:52:00,690 --> 00:52:02,059
You used to be clueless before.

756
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:06,159
Did you forget how you bawled
about wanting to quit acting...

757
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:08,929
because you missed your son,
Ms. Kim Bok Soon?

758
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,469
I've been hearing
my real name often recently.

759
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,340
It still startles me.

760
00:52:14,739 --> 00:52:16,400
Please call me Eun Si Woo.

761
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,570
Do you remember I gave you that name?

762
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:22,980
I do. Do you plan to milk that forever?

763
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:29,719
Are you ready to order?

764
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:31,619
- I'll order for the both of us.
- Sure.

765
00:52:32,519 --> 00:52:34,090
Is your spice tolerance still low?

766
00:52:35,889 --> 00:52:37,059
We'll go with Set C.

767
00:52:37,389 --> 00:52:39,559
Instead of the dishes
coming out as a course,

768
00:52:39,590 --> 00:52:41,400
could you bring them out all at once?

769
00:52:41,530 --> 00:52:43,500
Yes, of course.

770
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,139
I see you're still impatient as ever.

771
00:52:48,269 --> 00:52:50,769
It's because you don't eat well
when people come in and out.

772
00:52:50,909 --> 00:52:52,840
Gosh, you remember that too?

773
00:52:54,239 --> 00:52:55,510
I'm surprised too.

774
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,690
You should've told me
that you're here to see your son.

775
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,719
Why did you bother Yu Sung?
He's already swamped as is.

776
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,530
Because Yu Sung
is more handsome than you.

777
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:16,769
Then why didn't you do as he said?

778
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:19,800
Why did you defy him and go to Tae Sung?
You put us in a bad spot.

779
00:53:20,670 --> 00:53:21,940
I just wanted to see him.

780
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:25,409
You could've been nicer then.

781
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:27,940
Why are you always out to torment him?

782
00:53:28,980 --> 00:53:30,110
You're right.

783
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:32,110
You know me.

784
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:35,420
My words and intentions
never seem to match.

785
00:53:36,179 --> 00:53:37,590
It's not easy.

786
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:39,050
I can't seem to fix it.

787
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:47,000
Si Woo.

788
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,400
Yes?

789
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,000
I'm telling you this
as your first manager.

790
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:53,230
Tae Sung.

791
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,409
He's going to need a lot of time
to let you back in.

792
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:58,710
To be honest,

793
00:54:00,239 --> 00:54:01,440
it may never happen.

794
00:54:04,650 --> 00:54:06,619
So stop rushing things.

795
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,320
What if...

796
00:54:08,849 --> 00:54:10,820
you get photographed with him?

797
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,519
If that happens,

798
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:14,389
I won't let you off easy.

799
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:16,889
Gosh, how scary.

800
00:54:17,389 --> 00:54:20,230
I guess this is the sad reality
of not having a manager.

801
00:54:20,329 --> 00:54:22,199
You're raking in big money
thanks to my son.

802
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:24,400
So stop with your constant nagging.

803
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:28,269
Fine.

804
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,039
Thanks for giving birth
to such an amazing son.

805
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,809
Do you know...

806
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,780
how shocked I was to hear
that Tae Sung was your son?

807
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,179
I was shocked too.

808
00:54:41,679 --> 00:54:43,050
To hear he was working with you.

809
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,860
I've always been grateful.

810
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:56,699
How you protected him.

811
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:03,369
I didn't do anything.
It was all Tae Sung.

812
00:55:11,550 --> 00:55:12,679
Do you know...

813
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:15,050
who Oh Han Byeol is?

814
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,050
Yes, Ms. Oh.

815
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:19,449
She's the PR department's manager.
How do you know her?

816
00:55:22,019 --> 00:55:23,119
Oh Han Byeol!

817
00:56:19,949 --> 00:56:21,820
Are you awake?

818
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,829
It's really you, Han Byeol.

819
00:56:33,429 --> 00:56:34,659
I'm relieved.

820
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:38,400
When I woke up,

821
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:42,940
you were here.

822
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,429
Yoon Woo was in my dream last night.

823
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,070
He rarely comes to my dreams.

824
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:22,679
I guess I missed him so much.

825
00:57:34,889 --> 00:57:36,889
(Rest in peace, our shining star.)

826
00:57:52,139 --> 00:57:54,039
No one knows...

827
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,880
because you're always smiling like that.

828
00:57:56,909 --> 00:57:58,780
(Rest in peace, our shining star.)

829
00:58:02,519 --> 00:58:03,690
I will...

830
00:58:04,789 --> 00:58:06,590
take your revenge...

831
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:10,119
on Gong Tae Sung.

Look forward to it.)

(Stardiss: An employee?
I give you credit for that.)

848
00:59:35,409 --> 00:59:38,510
(Stardiss sent you a message.)

849

We look forward to your activities.)

853
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:20,250
(I'm worried because bad things
are happening to Tae Sung these days.)

854
01:00:20,289 --> 01:00:21,420
(Something happened, right?)

855
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,460
(Someone sent me this message.)

scandalous photos taken?)

in a really dangerous situation?)

860
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,969
(I was thinking
if I made a mistake or not.)

861
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,639
(That's who you are to Gong Tae Sung.)

862

(You're going to break up soon anyway,
so just enjoy the moment.)
