Are you in a relationship

Do you want me to introduce you
to a good lawyer?

23
00:01:54,349 --> 00:01:56,590
Here you are.
I had something to discuss with you.

24

I'm Do Soo Hyuk,

29
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,710
So you're the legal advisor.

30

Yes.

31
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,550
Which graduating class were you
at the judicial training institute?

32
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,219
- The 46th.
- I was in the 44th.

33

- Well then. I'll see you next time.

I don't know. I never...

51
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,610
I never thought about that.

52

00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,639
isn't it better
to just make him wear a hat?

167
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,440
A hat?

168
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,309
That's a great idea.

169
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:49,519
Hear me out too.

170
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:51,120
As for Se Mi...

171
00:10:51,159 --> 00:10:52,360
Well, how should I put this?

172
00:10:53,389 --> 00:10:55,429
She can be one of those wizards
in "Harry Potter".

173
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:57,730
Like a magic spell
that changes her outfit.

174
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,000
What do you think...

175
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,750
Gong Tae Sung is here.

176
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:31,289
Yu Na.

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,889
(30 minutes before the shoot)

178
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,059
Yu Na.

179
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:41,029
You're probably getting sick
of this outfit by now.

180
00:12:42,669 --> 00:12:43,899
You think so?

181
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:46,000
Right? Of course, I knew it.

182
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,070
This is the kind of outfit...

183
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:50,610
that you'd get sick of very quickly.
Right?

184
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,409
You think so?

185
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:54,879
Then I should get changed.

186
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,389
She's coming.

187
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,620
Here she comes.

188
00:13:03,649 --> 00:13:05,620
My, she looks even prettier up close.

189
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:08,730
Let's go shopping
so I can buy a new outfit.

190
00:13:10,789 --> 00:13:11,960
Darn it...

191
00:13:13,529 --> 00:13:14,870
Sir.

192
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,399
- Min Kyu.
- Yes.

193
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:22,440
- I must have a lot of bad karma, right?
- No, don't say that.

194
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,039
I'll go tell the director...

195
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,809
that Yu Na...

196
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:30,610
has acute diarrhea and beg on my knees.

197
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:33,779
So you stay right here, okay?

198
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:35,820
Diarrhea? I'm fine.

199
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:37,990
Come on. That's gross.

200
00:13:39,389 --> 00:13:40,460
Then what do I do?

201
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,929
I can't go to the director and say,

202
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,990
"Yu Na is refusing
to put on the outfit."

203
00:13:44,029 --> 00:13:45,899
I can't say that, can I?

204
00:13:46,230 --> 00:13:48,200
Why not? What's wrong with that?

205
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:50,399
Shall I go then?

206
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:56,909
Gosh, I'm about to have a stroke.

207
00:13:57,309 --> 00:13:58,309
Don't just look.

208
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:01,309
Call an ambulance. Now.

209
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,519
She's sleeping.

210
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:17,129
Gosh, Sin Ha.

211
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,600
You are glowing.
I don't think you need any lighting.

212
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:22,399
Shall we practice again?

213
00:14:22,429 --> 00:14:24,639
No, it's fine. I have everything down.

214
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:28,509
- All right, let's go then.
- Okay, we'll start shooting.

215
00:14:36,409 --> 00:14:39,120
I'm hanging in there.
I was dying earlier though.

216
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:41,690
You have it better than Yu Na's manager.

217
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,149
I guess. At least I'm still on set.

218
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,029
What is it? Did something happen?

219
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,029
Sun Young gave birth.

220
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:53,129
She did?

221
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,169
- I'll be back.
- Go on.

222
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:57,970
Yes, hello?

Please look over here.

Look here, please!

229

230
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,629
You looked fantastic, Sin Ha.

231
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:05,100
- Jung Ro.
- Let's go in for the tight shot.

232
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,110
Wait, where did she go?

233
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,039
Let's get ready.

234
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,379
Thank you for the kind words.

235
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,480
Yes, I'll get back to you.

- Are you all right?
- Yes.

240

- Are you okay, Sin Ha?
- Yes, of course.

241

Are you kidding me?

245

Who would drink and drive
in this day and age?

246
00:18:11,759 --> 00:18:13,000
What's the blood alcohol content?

247
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,869
He'll have his license revoked for that.
There's no excuse for this.

248
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,369
Just tell him to stay home
and reflect on his actions.

249

Hey, Han Byeol.

250
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,940
You should just leave.

251
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:27,440
Really? You said it yourself,
so don't hold it against me.

252
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,710
I'll talk to Mr. Do later.

253
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,650
All right.

254
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,150
Oh Han Byeol.

255

(Are you in a relationship
with Gong Tae Sung?)

258
00:18:54,569 --> 00:18:57,069
Pardon? Me? With Gong Tae Sung?

259
00:18:57,609 --> 00:18:59,410
Do you think I was shot in the head
or what?

260
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:23,269
Are you feeling unwell these days?

261
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:24,839
Pardon?

262
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,670
Why do you ask?

263
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,109
It's past 6pm.

264
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,309
Oh, you're right.

265
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:34,710
Let's all go home then.

Yes, Ms. Oh?

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:51,960
(Mr. Do. I'm sorry to call so late.
It's about a DUI case.)

269
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,670
Don't worry, it's fine.

an article immediately...)

(stating that he admits it
and will be reflecting.)

272
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,769
I figured you should
be kept in the loop too.

273
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,769
(I see. Okay.)

274
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,480
Can we meet tomorrow?

275
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:07,980
(We have to discuss commercial
and drama terminations and more.)

276
00:20:08,009 --> 00:20:11,180
How about we get started now?

277
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,380
(No, it can wait. You need to go home.
I'll see you tomorrow.)

278
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,650
This is a serious issue.

279
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,420
We're talking about a DUI here.

280
00:20:18,519 --> 00:20:22,430
You're right. Are you at your office?
I'll head over now.

Yes, I'll see you in a bit.

on his wrongdoings and lays low.

(Modeling Contract)

289
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,519
I reviewed everything beforehand.

290
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,420
The commercial was a one-time thing.

291
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:51,589
So there's about a week left to it.

292

As long as we discuss things amicably,
I don't think it'll be a problem.

Gosh, what a relief.

I see, that's good.

I'm sorry I'm keeping you
here at this hour.

for someone else's mistake?

303
00:21:17,950 --> 00:21:20,519
You were apologizing
to the reporter earlier.

It's a little annoying,
but it's a part of my job.

there are many happy moments too.

Sorry. My apologies.

00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:11,329
Baek?

330
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:12,700
It's Baek Da Hye.

331
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,700
- Baek Da Hye?
- Yes.

332
00:23:22,009 --> 00:23:24,609
(Baek Da Hye's Waiting Room)

333
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,309
Hello, Mr. Kang.

334
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,609
- Hello.
- Hello.

335
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,009
- You're here, Yu Sung.
- Yes.

336
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:34,049
Gosh. Do you like it that much?

337
00:23:35,119 --> 00:23:36,390
This isn't a dream, right?

338
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,720
Why? Do you think it's a dream?

339
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,890
Yes. I can't believe this is happening.

340
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,059
You should try to believe it
from now on.

341
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,859
My life changed
after the fan sign event.

342
00:23:45,099 --> 00:23:46,500
Gosh, my Tae Sung.

343
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,799
He even got a job for his fan.

344
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:50,569
Don't you think he's so gracious?

345
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,099
Although he has no idea about it, right?

346
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,740
But that upsets me a bit.

347
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,109
I'm the one who cast you.

348
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,440
Oh, come on.

349
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,839
I shouldn't even have to say it.

350
00:24:00,839 --> 00:24:02,710
I'll be good to you
for the rest of my life.

351
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,750
All right.

352
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,049
It still feels like a dream that
I'm in the same company as Tae Sung.

353
00:24:09,589 --> 00:24:12,359
But I got the leading role in a drama,

354
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,589
and I'll be working with
the one and only Tae Sung.

355
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,029
Does this even make sense?

356
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,160
It does make sense.

357
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,359
- You've tried so hard until now.
- You're right.

358
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,529
- Don't get intimidated.
- Yes.

359
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:21,630
- Don't show off.
- Okay.

360
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,029
- Do as you always do.
- Right.

361
00:24:23,069 --> 00:24:24,470
All right then.

362
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,970
Actress Baek Da Hye,
the lead in "The World of Stars".

363
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,440
- Let's go.
- Okay.

364
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,509
- Yu Sung
- Yes?

365
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,509
You'll stay
until my shoot is over, right?

366
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:36,680
Of course.

367
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:39,519
What if I faint
because I get too nervous?

368
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,190
Don't worry. If you do,
I'll carry you on my back.

369
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:44,990
- Really?
- Let's go.

370
00:24:47,289 --> 00:24:48,660
We shake our hands.

371
00:24:49,059 --> 00:24:51,390
We look into each other's eyes
like this.

372
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,200
After that,

373
00:24:53,599 --> 00:24:54,759
we need to...

374
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,170
Let's do this first.

375
00:25:01,609 --> 00:25:02,640
Yu Sung!

376
00:25:02,769 --> 00:25:03,809
You can do it!

377
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,279
I can do it!

378
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,210
I'm so nervous.

379
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,279
It's okay.

380
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:17,650
Action.

381
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,930
Hello. I'm Yoon Sin Ha.

382
00:25:24,589 --> 00:25:25,660
Hello.

383
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,329
I'm Han Yu Young,
a reporter at TV Daily.

384
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:30,500
Cut.

385
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:32,200
Goodness.

386
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:33,599
Our drama is going to be a hit.

387
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:35,140
Just the handshake
makes my heart flutter.

388
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,009
- Let's move on.
- Okay.

389
00:25:48,049 --> 00:25:49,390
Tae Sung. What's wrong?

390
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:50,650
Nothing.

391
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,160
Go check on him.

392
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,190
Tae Sung. Would you like some water?

393
00:25:58,230 --> 00:25:59,829
No, I'm okay. You can go.

394
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,029
You can go over there.

395
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,569
Go already.

396
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:04,500
- You're so cool.
- Thank you.

397
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:17,809
Gosh, Oh Han Byeol.

398
00:26:17,849 --> 00:26:19,480
Did you seriously not come
because I said so?

(Badeo Entertainment
Team Leader Cho Seo Yu)

402
00:26:53,119 --> 00:26:54,220
What's this?

403
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,220
Are these from the latest tabloids?

404
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:00,920
Yes. I've never seen them anywhere else.

405
00:27:01,059 --> 00:27:02,859
I took a screenshot as soon as I saw it,

406
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:05,059
but it was deleted
from the website right away.

407
00:27:05,299 --> 00:27:07,059
But I think it will spread soon.

408
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:09,529
There were three of our actors
mentioned in the rumor.

409
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:11,940
We should check the facts
and respond fast.

410
00:27:12,099 --> 00:27:13,369
The first one is...

411
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,539
Jang Seok Woo.

412
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,670
(Womanizer A has been seeing
three women at once.)

413
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:17,740
(He's about to get slapped.)

414
00:27:17,769 --> 00:27:19,210
(A is known to have
many women around him.)

415
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,339
(He's about to get slapped by B,
his official girlfriend.)

416
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,980
(A was already seeing three women
at the time...)

417
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,710
(when he admitted his relationship
with B to be true.)

418
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:27,380
(B recently found out about it
and totally lost it.)

419
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,819
(They will soon break up officially.)

420
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:30,650
He got...

421
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:32,319
slapped already.

422
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,390
What?

423
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,519
- What did you say?
- Gosh.

424
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:37,990
How did they find out
about him getting slapped?

425
00:27:38,829 --> 00:27:40,599
We can't let them break up right now.

426
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,230
It will look like
we're admitting the tabloids are true.

427
00:27:42,269 --> 00:27:43,329
That's right.

428
00:27:43,369 --> 00:27:45,369
They have a drama promotion abroad,
a joint photoshoot,

429
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,599
and commercials lined up.

430
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,000
It's difficult for them to break up now.

431
00:27:48,039 --> 00:27:49,369
And the two of them know about this.

432
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,309
We'll expose images of them
being close to each other...

433
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:53,039
to silence the tabloids.

434
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:54,710
The PR Department
will follow up on them.

435
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,250
Jang Seok Woo, that punk.

436
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,650
If he tries to leave his house,

437
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:00,920
you should jump-kick him
and knock him out.

438
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:02,690
I can't do that.

439
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,150
I'm a martial artist,
so it's disadvantageous for me...

440
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,420
- if he sues me.
- My goodness.

441
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,690
Is he addicted to seeing women?

442
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:09,289
- Who's next?
- Okay.

443
00:28:09,329 --> 00:28:11,089
Next is Baek Da Hye.

444
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:12,630
(A-list actress C is a drug addict?)

445
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,329
(A-list actress C is a drug addict.)

446
00:28:14,359 --> 00:28:16,769
(C who's the most popular actress
these days is a drug addict.)

447
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,130
(She recently started to use drugs.)

448
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,640
(It's shocking because she's known for
her bright and cheerful image.)

449
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:22,069
(She's suffering because
she couldn't quit...)

450
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,140
(even when her acquaintances
told her to.)

451
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:24,769
This is crazy. Drugs?

452
00:28:24,809 --> 00:28:26,210
That's so random.

453
00:28:26,309 --> 00:28:27,539
Da Hye and drugs?

454
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:29,680
We should check
where the rumor started...

00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:31,609
and respond to it strongly.

almost every night.)

461

(There will be a big issue soon.)

462
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:45,630
(Also, the top of D's head
smells so bad...)

463
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,259
(that people around him are suffering.)

464
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,500
Clubbing?

465
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,500
He's a famous homebody.

466
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:53,000
He won't get off of his sofa
when he has no work.

467
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,369
Weird rumors must be spreading
because he's making a comeback soon.

468
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,809
We'll check and respond fast
to this issue too.

By the way,

470
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:00,339
what's up with the smell
from the top of his head?

471
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,509
I can hear the shampoo commercials
dropping like flies!

472
00:29:03,549 --> 00:29:05,650
He has mysophobia, right?

473
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,119
It's not like we can show his head
to the entire country.

474
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:10,420
I'll report again soon
after checking on it.

475
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:11,619
- Okay.
- Oh, right.

476
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:14,819

this matter quickly.

00:30:38,269 --> 00:30:40,680
Right. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay.

495

Don't you know I hate loud places?

500
00:31:19,450 --> 00:31:20,920
Of course I do.

501
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,420
I'm checking just in case.

502

And Tae Sung,

503
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,190
don't mind that stuff
about the top of your head, okay?

504
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:30,529

and make them go to prison, okay?

Where is it? Here?

It's here, right?

509
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,660
I think it did smell a little before.

510
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,359
My goodness.

511
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,799
It smelled...

512
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:13,500
It's done, right?

513
00:32:16,869 --> 00:32:18,740
Gosh! It's so cold. Why is it cold?

514
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,809
Goodness. All right.

515
00:32:38,259 --> 00:32:39,430
Does it...

516
00:32:40,630 --> 00:32:41,559
smell?

517
00:32:48,269 --> 00:32:49,640
Yes. I can smell it.

518
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:53,940

It smells nice.

Drugs?

526
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:34,079
Well, if being Tae Sung's fan
is like a drug,

527
00:33:35,049 --> 00:33:36,849
then yes. I am a total addict.

528
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:38,920
I've been on such a high these days!

529
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:49,230
Right. She's not exactly normal either.

Hello, everyone.
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

545
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:13,079
My name is Oh Han Byeol.
I entered this school in 2012.

546
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:16,550
I currently work for
Starforce Entertainment in the PR team.

547
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:39,780
Ms. Hong.
No one followed you here, right?

548
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,409
Of course not, Mr. Byun.

549
00:35:49,889 --> 00:35:50,949
I'll be off, then.

550
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,329
When you're doing PR
at an entertainment agency,

551
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,800
you're promoting people, not objects,

552
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:05,840
which is why
you have to be more mindful and careful.

553
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:08,909
All right. That's it for my lecture.
I'll take some questions now.

554
00:36:12,039 --> 00:36:14,280
Do celebrities read all the comments
about them?

555
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,980
Well, let me ask you a question.

556
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:19,219
- The school has an anonymous forum.
- Yes.

557
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:22,389
Let's say someone posted something
about you on the forum.

558
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,420
It could be a compliment or criticism.

559
00:36:24,449 --> 00:36:27,559
Then would you try to read
the post and comments?

560
00:36:27,789 --> 00:36:29,460
Of course, I would.

561
00:36:29,489 --> 00:36:31,789
- Why is that?
- Because I would be curious.

562
00:36:31,829 --> 00:36:34,630
Right. Celebrities are just the same.

563
00:36:34,829 --> 00:36:37,369
Most of them want to know
what people have to say about them.

564
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,829
I hope that answers your question.

565
00:36:39,139 --> 00:36:40,539
All right. Next?

566
00:36:41,039 --> 00:36:42,039
Yes.

567
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,469
Are all the tabloids true?

568
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:47,780
There are times when they're
surprisingly accurate, albeit not often.

569
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,510
But most of them
are exaggerated and untrue.

570

I'm sure you've all experienced
something like that too.

in the truth.)

579

(They won't take responsibility
for the pain caused by the gossip.)

581
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:21,940
A while back, we caught someone...

582
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,050
who spread false rumors
about one of our actors.

583

I can't even bring myself to tell you
what the rumors were about.

And they were completely false.

585

When I asked for the reason behind
spreading such groundless rumors,

586
00:37:31,289 --> 00:37:32,460
that person smiled and said,

587
00:37:32,489 --> 00:37:36,230
"I think all the tabloids are true.
That way, it's fun."

588
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:39,360
The truth didn't matter to that person.

589
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:41,099
So what happened?

590
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,699
It looked like
fun was all this person cared about,

591
00:37:43,730 --> 00:37:45,530
so I took the fun away.

649
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,849
Should we ask who's lucky to date whom?

650

Hey, show them your true colors...

651
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:52,860
Nice. Stay like that
and just look at the camera.

652
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,119

655
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,869
I nearly died after this photoshoot...

656
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:08,440
because everyone thought
I was his girlfriend.

657
00:41:09,039 --> 00:41:11,469
I don't even want to think about it.
My gosh!

658
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,840
I can take this, right?
I want to burn it to ashes.

659
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:17,780
Hey, weren't you two
actually dating at the time?

660
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,809
No.

661
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:21,050
Never!

662
00:41:21,219 --> 00:41:23,650
Really? That's odd.

663

Tae Sung said...

664
00:41:26,489 --> 00:41:29,019
You want me to destroy
all of the promotional brochures?

665
00:41:29,590 --> 00:41:31,230
Yes, please do it for me.

666
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,630
Sorry. Even for you, I can't do it.

667
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,440
Protecting its students...

668
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:42,269
should be
the school's number one priority, right?

669
00:41:42,639 --> 00:41:45,809
Because of those brochures,
Han Byeol can't even come to school.

670
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:51,110
The printshop has probably started
on the second print run already.

671
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,050
I'll pay for the costs
of discarding and reshooting them.

672
00:41:59,190 --> 00:42:01,920
If that's not enough,
I'll be in the posters every year.

673
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,260
Even after I graduate.

674
00:42:15,639 --> 00:42:18,010
(And he still does it every year.)

675
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:20,880
(He's a man of his word.)

676

of our promotional brochures.)

So...

684
00:43:13,829 --> 00:43:16,670
There's this guy I always thought
was completely self-centered.

Yes.

686

This was from a long time ago.

687
00:43:20,539 --> 00:43:24,710
But I learned that
he did a very big thing for me.

688
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:25,869
Okay.

689
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:27,110
But then again,

690
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:29,650
He wouldn't do something like that
for me.

- What are your thoughts?
- What?

If he really was self-centered,

693
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:35,780
then maybe he liked you.

694
00:43:36,849 --> 00:43:38,090
- He liked me?
- Yes.

695

As if. Not in a million years.

696
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:44,130

he's self-centered.

I met Yoo Kyung Jin
at the press release today.

706
00:44:12,449 --> 00:44:15,159
He made my life miserable.

He's the one who spread rumors about
you beating up actors, right?

00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:20,199
Yes, that's him.

709
00:44:20,429 --> 00:44:21,929
You know what that punk said?

710
00:44:22,199 --> 00:44:24,230
"Are you still doing jump kicks
nowadays?"

711
00:44:24,269 --> 00:44:26,000
- He had the nerve to ask that.
- My gosh.

712
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:29,039
You didn't actually hit anyone, right?

713
00:44:30,070 --> 00:44:33,780
I never even touched a hair on him.

714
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,679
I have my pride as a martial artist.

715
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:38,050
I never hit anyone weaker than me.

716
00:44:38,150 --> 00:44:40,650
It's true, she never hit him.

717
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:43,849
She just nicely dropped him off
in the middle of the highway.

718
00:44:44,949 --> 00:44:46,059
Well,

719
00:44:46,090 --> 00:44:49,929
that's because he was cursing me out.

720
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:53,199
I went back around two hours later
to pick him up.

721
00:44:53,329 --> 00:44:55,030
Actors avoided her for some time.

722
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,170
They thought any form of interaction
would lead to a jump kick.

723
00:44:58,300 --> 00:45:00,099
I feel so wronged.

724

Do you have a new boyfriend?

00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:28,730
No, I don't.

733
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:33,639
The state of your cheekbones
seems suspicious.

734

That's enough.

735
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:38,309
It's unfair. She's the only one
who gets boyfriends or gets to date.

- It's so annoying.

I'm Oh Han Byeol,

743

According to the intel I gathered,

744
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:56,730
Da Hye is...

745
00:45:57,230 --> 00:45:59,159
- This is seriously so delicious.
- It really is.

Da Hye's rumors about drugs...

755
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:18,550
started exactly from here.

- Goodness.
- Even her menu is an issue.

757

What about the rumors
of Tae Sung being a clubbing maniac?

Gosh, you've gotten even more fit.

759
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,630
I've been going
to the health club a lot.

760
00:46:33,659 --> 00:46:35,900
I basically live there.

761
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:37,070

00:46:37,099 --> 00:46:39,000
Maybe I should go
to the same club as you.

763
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,869
Please do.

764
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:43,409
- The club just got renovated...
(- I've got big news.)

765
00:46:43,769 --> 00:46:45,710
(Gong Tae Sung must be
a clubbing maniac.)

766
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,679
The crowd is great too.

767
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,480
Gosh, if the crowd's too young...

768
00:46:49,980 --> 00:46:51,349
An oldie like me wouldn't fit in.

769
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:54,619
(He said he only goes to clubs
with a young crowd.)

770
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,150
- Can I really go?
- Absolutely.

771
00:46:57,190 --> 00:46:58,920
(I heard him myself just now.)

772
00:46:59,019 --> 00:47:00,659
(- Man, I thought better of him.)
- He likes young crowds?

773
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,860
(He's going on about
how great his club is.)

774
00:47:03,289 --> 00:47:04,090
(Emergency Meeting)

775
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:06,199
The staff talked about him
going to the health club.

776
00:47:06,360 --> 00:47:08,599
But eventually, "health" got dropped.

777
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,429
Isn't that too important a word
to get dropped?

778
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:11,900
Clubs have a bad stigma nowadays.

779
00:47:12,599 --> 00:47:14,940
He couldn't even join a book club
at this rate.

780
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:16,869
He can't even speak out of fear
of rumors.

781
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:19,340
Every little comment gathered
and blew up to this.

782

Only our actors fall victim to it
in the end.

783

It seems like it won't
grow into anything bigger.

784
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:27,380
I've requested an investigation
to find out who started the rumor.

785
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,079
Mr. Do is hard at work.

786
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,519
I saw to it that we get this resolved
as soon as possible.

787
00:47:32,550 --> 00:47:35,420
Tabloid rumors about celebrities
made headlines recently.

788
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:39,190
It was about the hottest stars,
so all eyes were on it.

789
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,000
In the process of finding out
how these rumors started...

790
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,969
everyone couldn't help but laugh.

791
00:47:45,670 --> 00:47:47,639
In the case of Actress C, the picture
she posted about "Drug Tteokbokki"...

792
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:48,840
(Drug Tteokbokki, Can't stop myself)

793
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,139
led to her becoming a drug addict.

794
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:54,079
Actor D was working out
at the health club for his new drama,

795
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,110
(Actor D, Club?)

796
00:47:55,210 --> 00:47:56,809
but people forgot to mention "health".

(Health club)

798
00:47:57,679 --> 00:47:59,110
- That's ridiculous.
- It is.

799
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,250
So the representing agency...

800
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,820
requested an investigation
to find the person...

801
00:48:03,849 --> 00:48:06,050
who spread these thoughtless rumors.

802
00:48:06,460 --> 00:48:07,860
There are times like these...

803
00:48:07,889 --> 00:48:11,289
when a fire starts for no reason.

804
00:48:11,789 --> 00:48:12,860
Good job.

805
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,429
One more thing.

806
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:16,300
What's the thing about Tae Sung's head?

807
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,630
I'm stumped about that too.

808
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,039
I haven't gotten any leads.

809
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,300
I think it's just slanderous gossip
to tarnish his name.

810
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,010
Shin Ju Hyun.

811
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:27,340
Did his company start it?

812
00:48:30,079 --> 00:48:32,480
Let's dig up all the dirt on him
and release it all.

813
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:34,880
We can say his breath stinks of feet.

814
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,179
He'll lose every single
toothpaste commercial deal.

815
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:37,349
Mr. Choi.

816
00:48:37,389 --> 00:48:38,690
You might end up in jail.

817
00:48:38,719 --> 00:48:40,619
Trust me when I say I won't be visiting.

818
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,059
Not even once?

819
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,130
We'll see.

820
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:46,190
Tae Sung is known for his hygiene,
so it's not a big deal.

821
00:48:46,659 --> 00:48:48,159
- But...
- But?

822
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:52,170
Gong is washing his hair
like ten million times, isn't he?

823
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:54,269
Yes. I think
his scalp will disappear soon.

824
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:56,639
He's supposed to come in today.

825
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,869
Try to get him to stop.

826
00:48:57,909 --> 00:48:59,510
Gosh, no one can stop him.

827
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,260
Goodness. He has no energy.

828
00:49:14,019 --> 00:49:15,119
Hey, Gong.

829
00:49:26,199 --> 00:49:28,769
The top of your head
doesn't smell at all.

830
00:49:30,269 --> 00:49:32,170
Well, of course.

831
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:33,880
What's with the tough act?

832
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,809
I'll get rid of
all the ridiculous rumors.

833
00:49:36,849 --> 00:49:38,179
So stop washing your hair.

834
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:40,280
Okay.

835
00:49:43,849 --> 00:49:44,949
Another thing.

836
00:49:46,090 --> 00:49:47,489
You should've asked for credit.

837
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:49,559
About what?

838
00:49:50,789 --> 00:49:52,659
I only just found out
about the brochure.

but thank you.

841
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,380
What was that?

842
00:50:06,539 --> 00:50:07,710
That was ages ago.

843

- Yes?

Do I have to take care of this
when I'm on set?

- Well...
- Take this to Oh Han Byeol.

856

She knows me best.

857
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:06,429
She'll take care of it.

I agree that you're such a nice person.

869

Thank you.

870

But you know what it means
when a manager is too nice?

871
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,599
A nice manager?

872
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:24,369
It means he's a pushover. He's useless.

873
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:27,079

You can just fill it in and send it.

It's for a famous media outlet abroad.
I can't just send it like this.

Hey. Get up.

Hurry. Wake up.

893
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,900
This is so bothersome.
Can we make this quick?

894
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:37,670
First question.

895
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:40,139
Any changes after returning from Africa?

896
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,179
I had to go to Africa...

897
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:46,349
because of a certain someone,
and it was so hard.

898
00:55:46,510 --> 00:55:49,079
I've become the world's best
when it comes to...

899
00:55:49,449 --> 00:55:51,420
shoveling and digging wells.

900
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:54,320
How very classy of you.

901
00:55:54,690 --> 00:55:56,420
I thought you might say
something important.

902
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,559
In your press conference,
you said something about...

903
00:55:58,590 --> 00:56:00,500
precious things in life
and all that cheesiness.

904
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:01,760
I'll write it based on that.

905
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,570
Okay.

906
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,500
(Check answers from press conference.)

907
00:56:06,170 --> 00:56:08,800
Next question.
When did you cry recently?

908
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:12,239
I never cry.

909
00:56:13,409 --> 00:56:15,239
You're good at being so pretentious.

910
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:17,380
If you're a human being,

911
00:56:17,409 --> 00:56:20,949
you must have cried when you said bye
to the kids in Africa.

912
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:24,989
Yes. Just write it as you want.

914
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,059
All right, last question.

915
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:33,260
What is the most dramatic moment
in your life?

916
00:56:36,429 --> 00:56:37,929
Hey.

917
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,929
I'll make it multiple choice for you.
Just pick one.

When you graduated college.
When you first sold ten million tickets.

919
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:44,469
When you got
your first best actor award.

920
00:56:45,139 --> 00:56:46,469
When you went to Africa.

921
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:54,420
It's so interesting.

922
00:56:55,619 --> 00:56:57,449
You were by my side
for all those things.

923
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,260
What?

924
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,860
Stay by my side.

925
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,199
