(- and he was the opposite of me.)
- I'll tag along.

00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,150
Yes, Mom.

Don't you need to go home?

56

No, I don't.

57
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,879
- What about you?
- Me neither.

58

67
00:04:34,449 --> 00:04:36,050
was when I was in Africa.

for celebrities to get weird letters,

70
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,350
so I didn't think much of it.

71
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:44,990
But the thing is,

72
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,759
it kept coming
even after I returned to Korea.

73
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:49,529
I found this on the floor by the door.

74
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,699
But how did you know it was that person?

75
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,509
I checked.

76
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:07,110
I saw the security footage.

77
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,920
But...

78
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,589
why are they saying
you killed Lee Yoon Woo?

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,620
From what I know,

80
00:05:19,189 --> 00:05:20,459
he took his own life...

81
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,959
Are you doing okay?

82
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:25,060
You know, I'm just...

83
00:05:26,629 --> 00:05:27,800
hanging in there.

84
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:35,509

00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,480

00:13:59,909 --> 00:14:03,279
(Hi, Tae Sung. I'm healthy and well.
I love you.)

167
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:07,019
(Luca)

168
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:20,759
Do you think Mr. Yoo is okay?

169
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,470
I am worried.

170
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,370
He should be, right?

171
00:14:27,769 --> 00:14:30,309
Come on, let's just go in.

172
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,940
Let's stay until the day breaks today.

173
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,710
- Yes.
- Okay.

174
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:38,580
Come on.

175
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,690
Please enjoy.

176
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,820
Welcome.

177
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,759
- Ho Young.
- Yu Sung.

178
00:14:45,789 --> 00:14:48,860
So this was the place you had to go to?

179
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,500
Yes. I figured I could help Gui Nong
since I'm already here.

180
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:53,100
He's cooking in the kitchen.

181
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:54,299
I see.

182
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:57,100
The apron suits you really well.

183
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,769
Do you mean it? Do I look all right?

184
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:01,169
Yes, you look like
a handsome part-timer.

185
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,240
Gosh, that's nonsense.

186
00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,210
Excuse me, I'm here too.

187
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,649
- Me too.
- Oh, hi there.

188
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:12,620
- Hello, Ms. Cho.
- Yes, hello.

189
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:14,289
- Excuse me?
- Yes?

190
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:15,690
Go sit over there.

191
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,600
Goodness, it's great to see you here,
Han Byeol.

192
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,799
Ms. Cho Ki Ppeum.
Your articles always make me cry.

193
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,139
Why? Because it's so moving.

194
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,610
Are you serious, Ho Young?

195
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,940
Your senior colleague is working
his butt off, but you're not helping?

196
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,539
I ought to just break your legs.

197
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:43,009
Don't forget to breathe too.
Are you a rapper or something?

198
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:45,879
I support this career change.

199
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:48,990
- Go on and order.
- Okay.

200
00:15:53,659 --> 00:15:54,860
What brings you here?

201
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:58,759
I made myself a latte.

202
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:01,029
But I made too much.

203
00:16:02,070 --> 00:16:03,429
It's a waste to throw it out.

204
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,169
A latte?

205
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,169
- At this hour?
- It's decaf.

206
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,809
You must be going somewhere.

207
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:16,549
I'm going to go meet that friend.

208
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,320
Will you be okay going alone?

209
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:24,690
Why do you ask?
Are you offering to go with me?

210
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:28,389
Gosh, I'm not your dad.

211
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,169
What's wrong? Are you afraid to see him
now that you're here?

212
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,840
Yes.

213
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,179
A little.

214
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,679
What was that raw honesty just now?

215
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,679
Maybe I should come back later.

216
00:16:49,710 --> 00:16:51,750
Oh, Tae Sung.

217
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:53,549
Hi.

218
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,950
Are you here to go to Organic Bar too?

219
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,460
Yes. You too?

220
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:01,860
Yes. I wanted to see Director Yoo.

221
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:04,130
I see.

222
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,900
Wait, aren't you
Tae Sung's lawyer neighbor?

223
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:13,970
Yes, I'm Do Soo Hyuk.

224
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,039
Hi, I'm Baek Da Hye.

225
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:20,380
Did you two come together?

226
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,279
Yes, well,

227
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,079
he insisted on coming with me.

228
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,349
But...

229
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:30,450
we drove separately.

230
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,690
I see, you came separately.

231
00:17:33,859 --> 00:17:36,390
- Yes.
- Shall we go in then?

232
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:38,460
All right.

233
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,539
Let's go.

234
00:17:48,170 --> 00:17:49,210
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

235
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:52,839
Oh, my gosh.

236
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:55,309
What's that strange trio?

237
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,950
Those two play a couple in a drama.

238
00:17:58,049 --> 00:18:00,450
While those two are a rumored couple.

239
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,619
Shocking! He makes a great couple
with either of them.

240
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:05,789
Mr. Gong sparks chemistry with anyone.

241
00:18:10,930 --> 00:18:12,599
It's been a while, Da Hye.

242
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:15,500
Have you been well? I missed you.

243
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,170
Thank you for coming.

244
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:19,400
- You're here, Tae Sung.
- Hi, Gui Nong.

245
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,170
Hey.

246
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,940
- Hello.
- Yes, hi.

247
00:18:25,410 --> 00:18:26,440
Sit down.

248
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,220
I didn't know you were coming.
We could've gotten a ride.

249
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,450
It was a surprise.

250
00:18:36,349 --> 00:18:38,690
When did you two get so close though?

251
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:41,259
I can't answer that
because it's the wrong question.

252
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:42,789
We are not close at all.

253
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,630
Sit down. Come on.

254
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,269
Say hello. This here is my best friend.

255
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:53,240
Reporter Cho Ki Ppeum
from On Stair Daily.

256
00:18:53,269 --> 00:18:55,940
Yes, hello. I heard a lot about you.

257
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,109
And I read many of your articles.

258
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:00,140
Yes, I heard a lot about you
and wrote a lot about you too.

259
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,109
Let's meet up more often from now on.

260
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,779
Sure, I would love that.

261
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,519
I didn't expect to see you here.

262
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:08,990
Me neither.

263
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,859
You're the most unexpected face here,

264
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,589
but also the best.

265
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:14,829
Is that so?

266
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:17,160
- Would you like a beer?
- Yes, please.

267
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:19,230
Here's the seafood tteokbokki.

268
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:22,630
Wait, Byun Jung Yeol? Why are you here?

269
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:25,269
Let me explain.

270
00:19:26,069 --> 00:19:28,269
You punk, you said
you were meeting your girlfriend.

271
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,869
You said you were going to sleep.

272
00:19:29,910 --> 00:19:31,380
Did you lie to me?

273
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,240
Your girlfriend is here, isn't she?

274
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:35,980
No.

275
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,619
No, she's not.

276
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:44,519
What is this? Everyone was here but me.

277
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,089
Hey, Choi Ji Hoon.
Why are you here again?

278
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:48,529
Because I want to.

279
00:19:49,859 --> 00:19:52,200
Let's have our gathering now
since we're all here.

280
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,130
Everything is on me today.

281
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,099
Let's make it rain today!

282
00:19:57,369 --> 00:20:00,539
- Awesome!
- You're the best! Eat up, guys.

283
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,470
- Hold on.
- Let's party.

284
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:05,539
I just noticed Mr. Big Shot over here.

285
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,410
Have you gotten richer
after going independent?

286
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:13,220
DS Actors' CEO
will be buying all the drinks today.

287
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,119
No, I won't. Don't get the wrong idea.

288
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,859
I won't be buying today. No.

289
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,690
Come on, Director.

290
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:24,089
I barely made enough
to pay for utilities.

291
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:26,730
Nobody forced you to leave.

292
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:29,170
I'm physically far from you.

293
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,200
But my heart will forever be yours.

294
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,009
Get off me, you punk,
or I'll punch you in the mouth.

295
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,609
- Come here.
- I'm sorry.

296
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,680
- I know you're a kind person.
- Am I?

297
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,380
Come on, I know you love me.

298
00:20:42,609 --> 00:20:44,049
All right, drink up.

299
00:20:44,079 --> 00:20:45,880
Has it been a year
since we gathered like this?

300
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:46,880
You're right.

301
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,089
Let's make a toast for Organic Bar...

302
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:50,549
and Yoo Gui Nong.

303
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:51,920
- That sounds good.
- Great.

304
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,920
All right.

305
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,990
Cheers to Gui Nong and Organic Bar!

306
00:20:55,029 --> 00:20:57,029
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

307
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:58,559
Let's drink.

308
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,859
Okay.

309
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,630
- Hey. Let's drink.
- All right.

310
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,099
- That's cute.
- Okay.

311
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,369
- Great job.
- Okay.

312
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,569
Hey, Ji Hoon. This is tasty.

313
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,009
- You did great.
- Goodness.

314
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,210
That's right.

315
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,339
I'll get going.

316
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:15,710
I'll call you.

317
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,019
We should have that again.
What are you talking about?

318
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:21,079
- Okay.
- All right.

319
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:25,859
Okay. Thank you.

320
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,259
- Have this.
- Gosh.

321
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,029
That's too much.

322
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,289
Hey.

323
00:21:31,329 --> 00:21:32,660
Why are you drinking so fast?

324
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:33,930
Drink slowly.

325
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,630
We have plenty of time, so drink slowly.

326
00:21:35,869 --> 00:21:37,029
Is this song okay?

327
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,609
Ms. Cho.

328
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,309
Mr. Do.

329
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,079
Why are you leaving early?

330
00:21:51,579 --> 00:21:53,380
I don't think I belong there.

331
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:55,420
What about you?

332
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,019
Well, me too.

333
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,190
But you're the legal advisor
of Starforce Entertainment.

334
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:04,390
I hate to be with people I work with...

335
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,329
after 6pm.

336
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
If it's okay with you,
why don't we go have a drink?

337
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,589
Is your brother's wedding preparations
coming along well?

338
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:32,289
I'm sure he'll take care of it.

339
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,390
They always made such a fuss,

340
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:35,859
so I'm already sick of them.

341
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,710
Did something happen?

342
00:22:52,509 --> 00:22:53,640
Can you tell?

343
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,009
Yes.

344
00:23:01,589 --> 00:23:04,789
I don't really
regret anything that much.

345
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:08,930
But around this time of the year,
I regret something.

346
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:12,029
What do you regret?

347
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,599
It's about Lee Yoon Woo.

348
00:23:19,539 --> 00:23:20,500
I guess you were close with him.

349
00:23:20,539 --> 00:23:22,140
Not at all.

350
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:24,710
I did an interview once.

351
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,210
Then why?

352
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:34,279
I wrote an exclusive article...

353
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,250
when he got the lead role in a drama.

354
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,960
But the incident happened the next day.

355
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:45,559
Does that have anything to do
with his death?

356
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,099
It wasn't bad news.
It was a good article about him.

357
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,569
I don't think
there's any causal connection.

358
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:56,210
Yes.

359
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:58,279
That's right.

360
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,079
But...

361
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,680
I keep thinking like this.

362
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:05,680
What if...

363
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,950
my article...

364
00:24:09,319 --> 00:24:12,519
was one of the many reasons
he decided to die?

365
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,990
That...

366
00:24:24,029 --> 00:24:25,839
Do you think
it would have been different...

367
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,039
if you hadn't written that article?

368
00:24:32,779 --> 00:24:34,279
You know that's not true, right?

369
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,220
You just did...

370
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:40,349
what you had to do for your job.

371
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,019
You don't have to regret anything...

372
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,190
about this ever again.

373
00:24:55,799 --> 00:24:56,970
Are you...

374
00:24:57,369 --> 00:24:59,339
trying to console me?

375
00:25:03,410 --> 00:25:04,980
I was making a judgment for you.

376
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:06,779
I guess it consoled you too.

377
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,109
Yes.

378
00:25:09,250 --> 00:25:10,279
Quite a bit.

379
00:25:12,549 --> 00:25:13,650
Then...

380
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:15,220
let's say it was a consolation.

381
00:25:23,460 --> 00:25:24,559
Thank you.

382
00:25:27,529 --> 00:25:29,329
I think I've been wanting to hear that.

383
00:25:35,269 --> 00:25:36,339
What's wrong with me?

384
00:25:37,009 --> 00:25:38,109
I'm sorry.

385
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:57,259
It's okay to cry as much as you want.

386
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,130
I will look the other way.

387
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,019
Gosh, what's this?

388
00:26:22,019 --> 00:26:23,349
My goodness.

389
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:24,690
That's right.

390
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,390
- Gosh.
- Let's stay for another hour.

391
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:27,990
- Goodness.
- We can do that.

392
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,329
All right.

393
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:31,130
That's right.

394
00:26:32,759 --> 00:26:33,799
Goodness.

395
00:26:33,829 --> 00:26:35,000
Da Hye, are you okay?

396
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:36,630
My goodness.

397
00:26:36,670 --> 00:26:38,400
- Be careful.
- You didn't drink that.

398
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,869
- Let's drink slowly.
- Gosh.

399
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,039
- That's not it.
- What?

400
00:26:41,069 --> 00:26:43,109
Drink this and let it go.

401
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:45,710
But you said...

402
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,880
Listen to me, will you?

403
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,349
Let's go.

404
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,609
I'll take you home.

405
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,549
Drink slowly.

406
00:26:55,319 --> 00:26:56,349
Okay.

407
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,440
What happened?

408
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,710
Did I sleep the whole time?

409
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,849
I drove safely
since I had my girlfriend here.

410
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,490
Shall we have another drink?

411
00:27:35,829 --> 00:27:38,230
Gathering like this
on Yoon Woo's death anniversary...

412
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:41,299
was touching and strange
at the same time.

413
00:27:43,299 --> 00:27:46,099
We held out well, right?

414
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,210
We did.

415
00:27:52,579 --> 00:27:53,779
We held out well.

416
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:00,720
Truth is...

417
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:03,549
I blamed myself a lot.

418
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,359
If I didn't catch cold back then...

419
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,490
If I had answered that call...

420
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:14,829
Me too.

421
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:19,500
I was closest to Yoon Woo.

422
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:25,140
I sometimes think,
"Did I miss the signs that he sent me?"

423
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:30,079
"I should've looked into him more."

424
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,680
I regretted it a lot.

425
00:28:36,019 --> 00:28:37,589
I couldn't even go to his funeral.

426
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,359
You went to Africa because of that,
right?

427
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,130
Because you couldn't deal with things
in Korea.

428
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,400
So you knew.

429
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:49,970
Of course.

430
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:52,839
Mr. Choi and Yu Sung probably knew too.

431
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:55,039
That's why they let you go
without saying anything.

432
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,109
You left for Africa,

433
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,549
and I now answer all my calls.

434
00:29:08,019 --> 00:29:10,819
I'm worried I might miss anything
that passes so quickly.

435
00:29:11,289 --> 00:29:14,220
Mr. Choi thinks that Yoon Woo
might've done it because of money,

436
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:16,160
so he became obsessed with profits.

437
00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:18,289
Not to mention Gui Nong.

438
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,630
He quit being a manager which he loved.

439
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:24,000
They didn't talk about it,

440
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,339
but they must have blamed themselves.

441
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,440
And that made it even more painful.

442
00:29:32,779 --> 00:29:33,839
But you know what?

443
00:29:35,349 --> 00:29:37,309
Yoon Woo left us like that,

444
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:40,619
but that doesn't mean
all of his life was sad.

445
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:44,150
Yoon Woo shined,

446
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,990
was loved,

447
00:29:47,589 --> 00:29:49,829
and was a precious person to us.

448
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,359
So...

449
00:29:55,269 --> 00:29:57,200
I don't want to feel sad
when I think about him.

450
00:29:59,099 --> 00:30:00,940
I want to feel the warmth
when I think about him.

451
00:30:09,950 --> 00:30:10,910
Right.

452
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,390
Let's remember him like that.

453
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:33,170
Hey, Tae Sung.
What brings you here at this hour?

454
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,269
Things were so hectic last night.

455
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,180
I was sad
we didn't get to have a proper chat.

456
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,950
I know it was you.

457
00:30:50,450 --> 00:30:51,990
You sent this, didn't you?

458
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:01,500
(All Gong Downhill)

459
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,470
Is it really someone at Starforce?

460
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:06,269
(Here's my proof.)

461
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,569
Two, one, zero.

462
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,569
(Prove that
you're Gong Tae Sung's anti-fan.)

463
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,769
Two, one, zero.

464
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:13,980
February 10?

465
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,309
That's Yoon Woo's birthday.

466
00:31:20,849 --> 00:31:23,589
Ms. Oh, you need to see this.

467
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:27,359
I wanted to make sure,
so I used a program...

468
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,190
to restore the photo as much as I could.

469
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,700
(Here's my proof.)

470
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:36,099
(Yoo Gui Nong)

471
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,200
"Yoo Gui Nong"?

472
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:39,900
(Yoo Gui Nong)

473
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:44,339
Yoo Gui Nong...

474
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,339
(Yes.)

475
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,180
It was me.

476
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,549
So what?

477
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:55,519
It's true.

478
00:31:56,619 --> 00:31:58,089
It's your fault that Yoon Woo died.

479
00:32:03,529 --> 00:32:04,890
(Lee Yoon Woo
Cast as Lead in "Poetry of Lovers")

480
00:32:04,930 --> 00:32:08,059
(Actor Lee Yoon Woo has landed
the lead role in "Poetry of Lovers".)

481
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:16,269
(Wasn't Gong Tae Sung
the number 1 choice for this role?)

482
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,640
(If it weren't for you,)

483
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:19,509
(The character suits
Gong Tae Sung better.)

484
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:20,740
(Yoon Woo wouldn't be dead.)

485
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:21,779
(I know they're close, but is
Lee Yoon Woo taking advantage of him?)

486
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,880
Yoon Woo should be where you are now.

487
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:27,680
You kept him by your side
calling him your friend...

488
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,819
while feeling superior to him
and getting a kick out of it.

489
00:32:30,589 --> 00:32:32,759
What? Am I wrong?

490
00:32:33,319 --> 00:32:36,559
Yes. I beat myself up a lot.

491
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,299
Even though we were best friends,

492
00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:43,529
I didn't realize
how much pain he was in.

493
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,140
I felt like that was why he did it.

494
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,170
"Had I been a little more attentive,
things would've been different."

495
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,640
I regretted it
hundreds of thousands of times.

496
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,950
Here in Korea, I just couldn't take it.
So I ran away to Africa...

497
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,220
and just took one day at a time
because that was...

498
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:05,519
the only way I could hold out.

499
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:12,430
I figured
you probably felt the same way.

500
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:14,960
So I told myself...

501
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:19,039
that I should just put up with it
if hating and resenting me...

502
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,039
was the only way you could cope with it.

503
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:26,640
So I thought I was doing the right thing
by putting up with it.

504
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:28,980
But then, I realized...

505
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,779
I wasn't the only one
with such regret...

506
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,980
and that everyone who loved Yoon Woo...

507
00:33:35,019 --> 00:33:37,150
felt the same way
and was hurting just like I was.

508
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,859
So I thought, if my memories of him
were filled with regrets and pain,

509
00:33:44,759 --> 00:33:46,730
he'd be really sad.

510
00:33:51,470 --> 00:33:52,700
So please,

511
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,369
stop beating yourself up.

512
00:34:12,019 --> 00:34:14,190
Our shrimp burger is 4.10 dollars.

513
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,760
The combo is 6.20 dollars.

514
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:19,199
Then I'll get the shrimp burger combo.

515
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,699
One shrimp burger combo.

516
00:34:20,730 --> 00:34:22,900
- With a Sprite.
- A Sprite.

517
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,099
- Yes.
(- If only...)

518
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:29,070
(I hadn't met Yoon Woo that day,)

519
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:32,110
(he wouldn't have died like that.)

520
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,449
Is your family stressing you out?

521
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,550
No.

522
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,460
You're terrible at lying.

523
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,429
Am I?

524
00:34:56,030 --> 00:34:57,869
I don't have a family.

525
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:04,269
I'm sorry.

526
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:08,179
Why are you sorry?

527
00:35:09,579 --> 00:35:11,880
It seems like not having one
might be better sometimes.

528
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:16,590
But I have someone in my life
who's even more precious than my family.

529
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:20,920
Right there.

530
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,559
- My goodness.
- Thanks to Gui Nong,

531
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:26,829
I can stay motivated and keep going.

(Yoon Woo was happy to have met you.)

533
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,469
It's not your fault that he died.
You had given him...

534
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:40,010
the strength to live and keep going.

535
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,920
So please,
it's time for us to let him go...

536
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,550
so he can rest in peace now.

Mr. Yoo Gui Nong turned himself in.

549

He admitted that
he was a member of the anti-fan club...

will be happy, right?

634
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:35,159
How else can they reconcile
after breaking up?

635
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,269
Do you expect me to go ask them
to change it to a handshake?

636
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,500
"It's so great to date you again."

637
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,239
Is that what you want?

638
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,610
I'm impressed by your undying dislike.

639
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,179
Seriously.

640
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:48,739
Wait here for a bit.

641
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:52,750
I'll go ask them firmly
to change it to a hug at the very least.

642
00:41:53,650 --> 00:41:54,949
My gosh, you're strong.

643
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:56,619
Forget it. I'll just do it.

644
00:41:57,219 --> 00:41:58,349
I'm a pro.

645

646

647
00:42:03,360 --> 00:42:04,460
Good thinking.

648
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,139
Where's the tough guy
who broke up with me?

649

You can't even drink.

650

Is this a dream?

651
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,780
I hope it's not.

652
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,719
Are you happy we broke up?

653
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:31,019
Is life good?

654
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:33,360
No.

655
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,659
I don't want to be strangers with you.

656
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,159
That's enough. It's too late.

657
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:46,440
I'm sorry.

658
00:42:47,539 --> 00:42:49,070
I will die without you.

659
00:42:51,139 --> 00:42:53,179
Don't say that.

660
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,219
Can I kiss you?

661
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,789
If you do,

662
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,630
we'll restart our relationship.

663
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:32,750
Cut. Okay.

664
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,550
Great job, Chang Kyu and Se Mi.

665
00:43:34,579 --> 00:43:36,750
- Good job.
- It's been great.

666
00:43:36,789 --> 00:43:38,619
- Nice job.
- Thank you.

667
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,429
Cut. We're done, guys.

668
00:43:43,659 --> 00:43:45,329
Cut! It's over.

669
00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:48,699
- Great job.
- All right.

670
00:43:48,730 --> 00:43:51,300
- You both did well.
- Nice work.

671
00:43:51,670 --> 00:43:52,739
All right.

672
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:54,440
- Good work, everyone.
- Let's wrap up.

673
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,369
- Good job.
- Nice work, everyone.

674
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,039
Let's get a picture of you two.

675
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,150
A little closer.

676
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,320
Okay, perfect.

677
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,719
- How can they still hate each other?
- Please smile a little more.

678
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:11,949
They bickered every time they met.

679
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:14,320
But it's finally over.

680
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,159
I'm suddenly getting emotional.

681
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,690
It's been a struggle for us both.

682
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,460
Good work, Han Dae Soo.

683
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:23,030
You too, my friend, Kang Yu Sung.

684
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,469
From now on,

685
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,570
let's never put those two together.

686
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,639
Okay.

687
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:30,110
It was terrible working with you.

688
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,440
Let's never meet again.

689
00:44:32,110 --> 00:44:33,139
On that note,

690
00:44:33,179 --> 00:44:34,940
you should decline the host position.

691
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:38,679
Are you kidding me?

692
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:41,019
You should decline it.

693
00:44:41,349 --> 00:44:44,449
This is an example of a major company
abusing its power.

694
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,090
Enough with the victim mentality.

695
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,159
Let's fight this out fair and square.

696
00:44:49,389 --> 00:44:51,590
Gosh, "fair and square"?

697
00:44:52,590 --> 00:44:54,800
My competitive side is starting to itch.

698
00:45:09,579 --> 00:45:11,150
(I'm in front of your place.)

699
00:45:11,179 --> 00:45:12,980
(Can we talk for a moment?)

700
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,579
(Please.)

701
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:21,019
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

702
00:45:21,059 --> 00:45:22,829
I almost barged into your dorm.

703
00:45:23,230 --> 00:45:24,690
Do you really want to end it with me?

704
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:25,829
No.

705
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:27,659
I don't want to be strangers with you.

706
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,570
I don't care if people find out.

707
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,369
I will try to buy...

708
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,170
all the designer bags you want.

709
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:36,940
So, please.

710
00:45:39,039 --> 00:45:41,340
Be my girlfriend again.

711
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,280
I can't live without seeing you.

712
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:46,820
Without you...

713
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:49,650
I'll die, Nation's Fairy.

714
00:45:50,949 --> 00:45:52,820
Don't say that.

715
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:55,420
Ask for my permission before you die.

716
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,260
Okay.

717
00:45:57,630 --> 00:45:59,659
Someone might take a photo. Come inside.

718
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:00,929
Can I?

719
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,699
My parents are traveling. It's just me.

720
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:05,769
Since you're here,
do you want to have some ramyeon?

721
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,539
Okay.

722
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:13,239
Did you forget to say something?

723
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,380
I love you.

724
00:46:14,579 --> 00:46:15,610
Wrong.

725
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:21,079
Let's restart our relationship?

726
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:35,000
You did all this?

727
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:37,300
Yes.

728
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:38,869
Is it not enough?

729
00:46:40,869 --> 00:46:43,010
I gave you homework
and you brought back a thesis.

730
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,469
Haven't you had shoots nonstop?

731
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,440
Did you get any sleep?

732
00:46:47,539 --> 00:46:48,610
I'm fine.

733
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:51,650
Your accent is getting better too.

734
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:55,849
I don't want to get better.

735
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,119
I want to become perfect.

736
00:46:58,519 --> 00:47:00,860
Gosh, I was just reminded of someone.

737
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:04,030
The toughest student I ever had
as an acting coach.

738
00:47:04,829 --> 00:47:07,000
My student who went from
being the worst actress...

739
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:09,429
to the queen of acting.

740
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,469
Who is she?

741
00:47:17,639 --> 00:47:18,670
Da Hye.

742
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,239
I'm sorry.

743
00:47:29,219 --> 00:47:30,219
(Don't...)

744
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:33,489
(love me.)

745
00:47:34,519 --> 00:47:35,590
(I...)

746
00:47:38,159 --> 00:47:39,929
(don't deserve to be loved.)

747
00:47:45,030 --> 00:47:46,500
(I cry at times.)

748
00:47:46,539 --> 00:47:47,639
(Crying)

749
00:47:57,849 --> 00:47:58,949
(Gesturing farewell)

750
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:00,079
(Good bye.)

751
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,489
(It's been a joy.)

752
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,159
(Don't love me.)

753
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,070
(I...)

754
00:48:18,099 --> 00:48:19,739
What? Why aren't you asleep?

755
00:48:20,769 --> 00:48:22,469
- Are you just coming home now?
(- I don't deserve to be loved.)

756
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:25,969
I was working out.

757
00:48:26,380 --> 00:48:27,440
I was at the gym.

758
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,579
I see.

759
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:30,880
(Awkwardly crying)

760
00:48:30,909 --> 00:48:33,380
Gosh, I was so into it
that time just flew by.

761
00:48:36,889 --> 00:48:38,019
Have you seen this before?

762
00:48:41,590 --> 00:48:42,820
- Oh, this?
(- I...)

763
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:44,460
It went totally viral.

764
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:46,090
(It's been a joy.)

765
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:49,099
- "Don't love me."
(- Don't love me.)

766
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:51,900
- "I..."
(- I...)

767
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,139
- "don't deserve to be loved."
(- don't deserve to be loved.)

768
00:48:57,369 --> 00:48:58,510
Right.

769
00:48:59,139 --> 00:49:01,010
Her acting was terrible in every aspect.

770
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:07,449
I think I have a role model.

771
00:49:08,349 --> 00:49:09,449
What?

772
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,760
Will you come to my world now?

773
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:28,400
- Cut, okay! Well done.
- Great job.

774
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,739
- Good job.
- Good job.

775
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:33,210
- Gosh.
- Tae Sung.

776
00:49:33,239 --> 00:49:35,079
What's this? When did you prepare it?

777
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:38,579
- Tae Sung.
- Great job.

778
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:40,820
Good job.

779
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:46,019
("The World of Stars" Forever)

780
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:48,860
All right. You should say a word.

781
00:49:51,030 --> 00:49:53,199
Well, thank you so much.

782
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:54,929
If I didn't have you with me,

783
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:57,929
I couldn't have come this far.

784
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:00,539
I won't forget this.

785
00:50:02,969 --> 00:50:04,309
- All right.
- Great.

786
00:50:07,579 --> 00:50:09,949
(Kang Yu Sung)

787
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,320
Ms. Park Ho Young.

788
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:16,920
Yes, Mr. Kang.

789
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:18,289
Where does your schedule end today?

790
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,760
I'm done after the meeting at DVN.

791
00:50:20,789 --> 00:50:23,460
Really? Then I'll pick you up there.

792
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,829
Pardon? Who are you going to pick up?

793
00:50:27,260 --> 00:50:29,099
You mean me?

794
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,369
Yes.

795
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,139
No, you don't have to.
I'll go and pick you up.

796
00:50:35,269 --> 00:50:36,809
- What?
- What's wrong?

797
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:41,579
Ho Young.

798
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:45,610
I'm talking about
picking up my girlfriend.

799
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:49,650
Gosh.

800
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:54,789
Well... If you insist, thank you.

801
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:01,559
My goodness.

802
00:51:01,960 --> 00:51:04,269
Isn't it cheating if she's that cute?

803
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:05,900
Then I will schedule a meeting...

804
00:51:05,929 --> 00:51:09,199
with our director and writers
and Actor Kang Yu Sung next week.

805
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:12,070
I think he'll read through
a couple of lines in the script.

806
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,980
Okay. We'll prepare him well
for what you've told me.

807
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:16,079
All right.

808
00:51:17,179 --> 00:51:19,510
By the way, Ms. Park.

809
00:51:19,650 --> 00:51:23,119
Can I ask you a personnel question?

810
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:26,320
Yes, of course. What is it?

811
00:51:26,349 --> 00:51:30,590
Well, you're close with
Manager Kang Yu Sung, right?

812
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:33,800
I thought so since your actor's name
is the same as his.

813
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:36,400
I see. Yes.

814
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:40,199
Does Mr. Kang have a girlfriend?

815
00:51:40,539 --> 00:51:43,610
A member of my team
really wanted to know about this.

816
00:51:44,570 --> 00:51:45,670
I see.

817
00:51:46,809 --> 00:51:49,710
Well, I don't know about that.

818
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:53,449
Thank you.

819
00:51:58,849 --> 00:52:01,559
(You know that Mr. Kang is
really popular, right?)

820
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:04,690
(There was a rumor saying
Baek Da Hye was his girlfriend.)

821
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,300
(Also there was a rumor that
the idol, Mi So, asked him out.)

822
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:10,829
(But he never really talks about
his personal life.)

823
00:52:11,969 --> 00:52:13,030
Ho Young.

824
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,840
- Yu Sung.
- Yes?

825
00:52:23,449 --> 00:52:25,150
I have a question.

826
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:26,650
Okay, go ahead.

827
00:52:27,349 --> 00:52:31,019
What do you like about me?

828
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:36,389
Well, I guess I didn't show you
my feelings enough.

829
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:38,260
No, that's not it.

830
00:52:39,090 --> 00:52:42,559
You're cool, popular,

831
00:52:42,599 --> 00:52:44,300
and excellent when it comes to work.

832
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,039
I just wanted to know why you liked me.

833
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,969
I thought it might not be
easy to answer,

834
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:52,769
so I thought about it.

835
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:54,480
Hear me out and see if I got it right.

836
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,179
Okay.

837
00:52:57,949 --> 00:53:00,579
Number One. I'm an excellent fighter.

838
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:03,420
I'm strong enough to protect you.

839
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,820
Well... You might not know about it,

840
00:53:07,219 --> 00:53:09,460
but I served in the Special Forces
and have a black belt in Jeet Kune Do.

841
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,929
You don't need to protect me.
I will protect you from now on.

842
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:13,760
Gosh. That's fine.

843
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:17,199
I thought this was right.

844
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:19,900
Then, Number Two.

845
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:22,269
Is it because I'm good at my job?

846
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:25,510
Well... I know you do a great job,

847
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:28,480
but if that's the reason,
shouldn't I like Han Byeol instead?

848
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:31,780
You're so cold-hearted
when you don't have to be.

849
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,719
Then, did you have feelings for Ms. Oh?

850
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:38,690
Gosh. Why would you say that?
That never happened.

851
00:53:38,719 --> 00:53:41,090
You're the first person that I liked
among the people I work with.

852
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,590
Is that so?

853
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:46,530
Now, are you ready...

854
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:49,829
to listen to my story?

855
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:52,429
Yes.

856
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,500
Ho Young. I love this job.

857
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:59,610
If I decide to give a role to my actor,

858
00:53:59,639 --> 00:54:01,210
I get it no matter what.

859
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,679
I know that well.

860
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,780
You wrote letters for a month...

861
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:06,449
to get Da Hye the lead role
in "The World of Stars".

862
00:54:06,849 --> 00:54:09,050
You also got hit by that guy
with a bad drinking habit...

863
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,820
to get Jae Hyeon's role back
that he lost unfairly.

864
00:54:12,820 --> 00:54:15,690
You have so many stories like this.

865
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,130
You're so cool.

866
00:54:17,230 --> 00:54:19,789
If that will help our actors do well,

867
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:21,800
that's the least I can do for them.

868
00:54:21,829 --> 00:54:24,599
Right. I will try to be just like you.

869
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:26,900
No. That's not what I meant.

870
00:54:27,099 --> 00:54:29,139
Well,
what I'm trying to say here is this.

871
00:54:29,969 --> 00:54:33,739
I'm not a pushover who gives away...

872
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,909
the script that came to me.

873
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:37,909
Pardon?

874
00:54:38,150 --> 00:54:41,380
But there was someone
who was on the run...

875
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:44,420
after telling me her feelings for me.

876
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,960
I wanted to talk to her,
so I gave away the script...

877
00:54:48,519 --> 00:54:49,690
that I had kept for Jae Hyeon.

878
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,900
This is my first time having something
more precious than my work.

879
00:54:58,599 --> 00:54:59,929
That's when I realized.

880
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:02,170
That I like you.

881
00:55:03,369 --> 00:55:05,739
I thought you were just a cute
and talented junior manager.

882
00:55:06,780 --> 00:55:08,440
But it turned out
you were someone I liked.

883
00:55:12,210 --> 00:55:13,280
Also...

884
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,019
I never pat anyone on the head but you.

885
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,460
I did it to only one person.

886
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,260
That's what I did.

887
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:30,300
Please do not pat others.

888
00:55:30,769 --> 00:55:31,929
Don't worry.

889
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:34,869
You're the only one
who looks cute to me.

890
00:55:43,909 --> 00:55:44,980
My gosh.

891
00:55:57,590 --> 00:55:58,929
Is Ho Young busy these days?

892
00:55:59,289 --> 00:56:01,760
She's busy working and dating
at the same time.

893
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,699
She says the world is coming to a stop
every day.

894
00:56:03,730 --> 00:56:05,530
She's madly in love these days.

895
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,099
Is she the queen of destruction?

896
00:56:07,199 --> 00:56:09,800
They must be happy
even when they're just holding hands.

897
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:11,139
Well, I'm in trouble.

898
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:12,510
What's wrong?

899
00:56:14,039 --> 00:56:15,679
I'm liking him even more.

900
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:18,809
Well, my Gong is...

901
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:20,980
He's more handsome than he looks.

902
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:23,150
He's more thoughtful than I expected.

903
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:28,519
You must be crazy.
I wonder how I ended up like this.

904
00:56:28,690 --> 00:56:29,960
Gosh, my pride is hurt.

905
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:32,889
You seem quiet these days.

906
00:56:37,570 --> 00:56:39,199
There's someone I like.

907
00:56:40,239 --> 00:56:41,570
I knew it.

908
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:45,110
I'm telling you
so it won't cause a stir.

909
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:47,179
It's Do Soo Hyuk.

910
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:50,250
Really? But why would it cause a stir?

911
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:52,380
What?

912
00:56:54,079 --> 00:56:56,219
I guess you don't remember it.

913
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,150
All right.

914
00:56:58,590 --> 00:57:00,159
So are you guys are having a fling?

915
00:57:00,190 --> 00:57:01,860
No, not yet.

916
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,389
You're not?

917
00:57:03,989 --> 00:57:06,389
I know. That's why I'm a bit confused.

918
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,400
I do things
I wouldn't do in front of him.

919
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:19,269
There are many interview requests
after "The World of Stars".

920
00:57:19,610 --> 00:57:21,110
I will call in the interviewers
to the office...

921
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:22,840
and let them interview
Jae Hyeon and Yu Sung.

922
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,949
Why are you reporting
these small things to me?

923
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:27,650
You can decide on your own.

924
00:57:28,849 --> 00:57:30,050
By the way...

925
00:57:31,949 --> 00:57:33,119
Ms. Oh.

926
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,960
Yes?

927
00:57:36,389 --> 00:57:38,590
- Is Tae Sung seeing someone?
- What?

928
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,030
Is he seeing someone?

929
00:57:42,199 --> 00:57:43,360
Someone told me.

930
00:57:43,570 --> 00:57:47,199
Tae Sung doesn't let go of his phone
when he's out on a shoot.

931
00:57:47,369 --> 00:57:48,940
I'm a hundred percent sure
that he's seeing someone.

932
00:57:51,039 --> 00:57:52,440
You can't say it's a hundred percent.

933
00:57:52,869 --> 00:57:56,510
He might have received an urgent call.

934
00:57:56,539 --> 00:57:58,010
Who? Tae Sung?

935
00:57:58,050 --> 00:58:00,380
What call? About what?
Something important? A call?

936
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,650
So you haven't noticed anything?

937
00:58:03,889 --> 00:58:05,150
This feeling that
something is going on with Tae Sung.

938
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:11,530
Well, I'm not that close with him,
you know.

939
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:14,860
I see. Is that so?

940
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,829
I see.

941
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:19,099
So you weren't that close with him.

942
00:58:20,739 --> 00:58:23,269
Tae Sung is really simple,

943
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:26,139
so I can figure out what's going on
by watching him for a couple of days.

944
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,039
- Okay. You can go now.
- Okay.

945
00:58:29,679 --> 00:58:31,480
Have a nice day.

946
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:35,519
So you two weren't close
with each other.

947
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,849
My gosh.

948
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:39,949
My goodness.

949
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,659
I should be careful.

950
00:58:42,219 --> 00:58:43,889
Did he ask me because he knew about it?

951
00:58:45,730 --> 00:58:46,929
Gosh.

952
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,530
It's making me feel nervous.

953
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,329
(Gong.)

954
00:58:59,070 --> 00:59:01,510
(Don't come to the office for a while.)

955
00:59:06,309 --> 00:59:08,280
Why? I missed you.

956
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:11,750
We're in the office.

957
00:59:11,889 --> 00:59:13,619
It's okay. Everyone went to have lunch.

958
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,389
- When did you come here?
- I got here a while ago to see you.

959
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:20,190
Hey!

960
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:23,000
You punks!

961
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:01,639
=Shooting Stars=

962
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,710
(This is CEO Gong Tae Sung.)

963
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:05,739
(Hey, Tae Sung. What are you doing?)

964
01:00:05,769 --> 01:00:07,539
(I'm here to give you this and that.)

965
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,909
(What if someone sees us?)

966
01:00:09,980 --> 01:00:12,050
(What else don't I know about you?)

967
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,179
(It's okay if you don't know.)

968
01:00:13,210 --> 01:00:14,280
(It's not okay.)

969
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:16,989
(I wrote everything that came to my mind
when I thought about Ms. Oh.)

970
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:18,989
(I have information
about his ideal type.)

971
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,219
(It has been a good deal.)

972
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,559
("Our Yu Sung" is me now, right?)

973
01:00:22,590 --> 01:00:24,230
(You said you wanted to know
everything about me.)

974
01:00:24,389 --> 01:00:26,389
(There's one thing about me
that you don't know.)

975
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:28,429
(You're the only one
who knows about this.)
