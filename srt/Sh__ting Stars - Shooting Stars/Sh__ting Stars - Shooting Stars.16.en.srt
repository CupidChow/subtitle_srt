8
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,219
Did you sleep well?

9
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:56,359
You're so pretty even in the morning,
Han Byeol.

10
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,569
Seriously, you're really pretty.

11
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,180
Okay.

12
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,280
See you soon, Han Byeol.

13
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:29,329
- What?
- Aren't you getting in?

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:33,129
Oh, right. I am.

15
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,640
Are you here for an interview?

16
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,209
No, I'm not.

17
00:01:49,849 --> 00:01:53,280
Then did you move...
No, that's not possible.

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,319
There are only two units per floor,
and it's not my unit,

19
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,459
so that means...

20
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,989
Yes, she was at my place.

21
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,000
I see.

22
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,270
Then are you two...

23
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:19,080
My gosh. Since when?

24
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,610
Since yesterday?

25
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,180
Yesterday? Since yesterday? Wow.

26
00:02:26,889 --> 00:02:28,719
- But...
- Lower your voice.

27
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,259
Yesterday...

28
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:32,960
What time is it now? It's morning. Wait.

29
00:02:35,259 --> 00:02:37,259
Do Soo Hyuk, you traitor.
You didn't even tell me.

30
00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:39,659
Tell you what?

31
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:43,099
Wait. Did you already have the latte?

32
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,569
- Yes. It was good.
- No!

33
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,909
Your lattes are mine.

34
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:51,539
Well, see you around.

35
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,229
I'm on my way to see my girlfriend too.

36
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,729
My dear Oh Han Byeol.

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:25,280
Hi. What's up?

38
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,879
(Gong, don't come to the office.
Go back home.)

39
00:03:27,909 --> 00:03:29,009
(Right now.)

40
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:30,449
What?

41
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,719
(Episode 16: All Sorts of People

(Tae Sung often buys snacks
for the people at his agency.)

44
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,900
(This picture tells us that
he and his manager are very close.)

45
00:03:55,139 --> 00:03:56,979
(He's also friendly with his staff.)

46
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,919
(Our top star is going home
with arms full of scripts.)

47
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,650
Oh, no.

48
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:10,819
Gosh...

49
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,259
Someone's boyfriend is
all over the portal sites.

50
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,899
I totally let my guard down.

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,370
I had briefly forgotten...

52
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,930
who Gong Tae Sung was.

53
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,069
What was the headlock about?

54
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,540
It was a hug.

55
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:29,110
My goodness. That's quite the skill.

56
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:33,310
We're flooded with calls and emails from
people who want to work for Starforce.

57
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:34,980
Why? Do they think...

58
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,850
he'd have them in a headlock too?

59
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,250
I guess.

60
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,449
So what if they blurred out my face?

61
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,850
I bet his fans already know
everything about me.

62
00:04:43,019 --> 00:04:45,620
I should watch out for a while.
I'm scared.

63
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,389
Actually, I saw your boyfriend.

64
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,129
When? Where?

65
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:51,629
How?
I haven't seen my boyfriend yet today.

66
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,459
I saw him this morning
in Soo Hyuk's elevator.

67
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:56,000
No way. What?

68
00:04:57,439 --> 00:04:59,240
My gosh! For real?

69
00:05:07,009 --> 00:05:08,050
Ho Young!

70
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,550
My gosh!

71
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,120
Hey!

72
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,319
Ho Young.

73
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,089
You could get hurt,
running with your suitcase like that.

74
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:19,860
No, it's so easy for me.

75
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:24,100
You picking me up like this makes me
want to go on work trips more often.

76
00:05:24,129 --> 00:05:26,300
No, don't. This is too hard for me.

77
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:30,899
What? Did you miss me a lot?

78
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:34,769
Well, that's...

79
00:05:36,509 --> 00:05:38,639
- What?
- I parked over there.

80
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,980
- Are you embarrassed?
- Let's go.

81
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:42,610
I've never seen you like this.

82
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,879
Why won't you tell me?

83
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,189
Did you miss me? Did you want to see me?

84
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:49,220
(This is a total catastrophe.)

85
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:53,120
(We can't see each other
because of an article?)

86
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:55,329
It's not just one article.

87
00:05:55,459 --> 00:05:56,990
Better safe than sorry.

88
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,560
(Thank goodness
they only snapped you near the office.)

89
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,430
It's good that
your building has tight security,

90
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,000
but you can never come to my place.

91
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,410
Then how about you move in next door?

92
00:06:07,439 --> 00:06:09,709
Do Soo Hyuk is always talking
about moving.

93
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,110
Let's kick him out.

94
00:06:11,139 --> 00:06:13,639
With my salary,
it'll take about 500 years.

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,779
If I buy you the place...

96
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:17,149
What? Do you think
money solves everything?

97
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,220
- What can't it solve?
- Good point.

98
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,949
Then buy me a plane too.

99
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,389
A yacht and a vacation home too.

100
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:24,920
Okay, I'll buy you everything.

101
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,689
What? My heart just fluttered.

102
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,889
It was the most romantic thing
I heard recently.

103
00:06:29,029 --> 00:06:30,230
There's nothing like money.

104
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:33,129
Then how about I move next door to you?

105
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,500
(I could buy the entire building.)

106
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,000
Don't go too far.

107
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,069
Or what do you think about
going public with our relationship?

108
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,339
It's not a crime to date.

109
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,879
Back in college,

110
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:48,949
do you know how much I suffered because
of the rumors that we were a couple?

111
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:50,920
(Back then, we weren't even dating.)

112
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,720
So if people find out now,

113
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,689
what would happen to me?

114
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,089
Right, it won't be pretty.

115
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,829
I can't let my dear Han Byeol suffer
because of me.

116
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,959
Right. I think we should be careful
for the time being.

117
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,470
(I'll call you often.)

118
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:18,980
I'll always be waiting.

119
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:22,680
Shall we fall asleep
while looking at each other like this?

120
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:24,980
Yes, let's do that.

121
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:27,550
(Video call)

122
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,720
Are there sleeping pills floating around
in the air right now?

123
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,089
I think we ate too much for lunch.

124
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,100
I could really use some caffeine
right now.

125
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,269
Let's have coffee.

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,300
I brought you coffee!

127
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:47,000
My gosh!

128
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,439
Jung Yeol, talk about perfect timing.

129
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,709
It's my treat
for the passionate PR team!

130
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,220
I didn't know what you'd like,
so take your pick.

131
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,980
You bought all this
because you didn't know what we'd like?

132
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,819
You sounded like a super cool boss
in those early morning dramas.

133
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,819
Thanks for the coffee!

134
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,490
There's an iced vanilla latte,
my favorite.

135
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:08,790
"Breaking news. My fatigue
has melted away thanks to Jung Yeol."

136
00:08:08,829 --> 00:08:10,259
(Breaking News. Jung Yeol Comes
to the Rescue on Exhausting Day!)

137
00:08:10,329 --> 00:08:12,199
The passionate PR team thanks you!

138
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,500
Thank you for the coffee, Jung Yeol.

139
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:16,069
No problem.

140
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,939
(Byun Jung Yeol showed up with coffee
right at that moment.)

141
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,310
Then who do you think his girlfriend is?

142
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,050
Eun Soo? I saw her...

143
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:32,080
wink at Jung Yeol.

144
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,350
I disagree. My hunch is telling me...

145
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,120
that it's Hong Bo In.

146
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:38,690
(Bo In?)

147
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:43,159
What? What is it?

148
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:45,799
Why?

149
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:49,970
Do you have money lying around?

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,000
No.

151
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:54,440
Are you rich? Did you win the lottery?

152
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:57,169
Do you think you're rich like Tae Sung
because you're his manager?

153
00:08:57,409 --> 00:08:59,110
No. It's not that.

154
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,009
Hey, I told you not to talk back to me.

155
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,480
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,750
You have the receipt, right? Let me see.

157
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,549
Did you pay the full price?

158
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:08,850
Of course not.

159
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,350
I got a wireless discount.

160
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,320
Good, I'm glad.

161
00:09:12,419 --> 00:09:15,090
Had you paid the full price,
I would've really scolded you.

162
00:09:15,129 --> 00:09:16,960
- Of course, I know that.
- Hey! Attention.

163
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,360
At ease.

164
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:20,559
I mean,

165
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:23,700
it's nice that you wanted to treat
my team to show your gratitude,

166
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,740
but you need to save up
to buy your own place.

167
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,210
You said you wanted to stop paying rent.

168
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,340
(Americano, 5 dollars)

169
00:09:30,509 --> 00:09:32,340
Their Americano was five dollars?

170
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:35,879
Darn it! We have coffee at our lounge.
We could have just made coffee.

171
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,419
Oh, my goodness. What?

172
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:39,879
What's he doing? He's...

173
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,850
Seriously. What would I do without you?

174
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:44,289
You're such an angel.

175
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:47,629
If you know that, do better.

176
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,289
Unless you want to die.

177
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,460
Okay.

178
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,269
All right. Let's get back to work.

179
00:09:56,669 --> 00:09:58,870
You totally look like
a professional now.

180
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,399
You're so cool, babe!

181
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,379
(No way.)

182
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,850
(They make such a cute couple.)

183
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:15,990
(They're perfect for each other.)

184
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,149
I know.

185
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:19,389
They're meant to be together.

186
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:25,059
I've never envied Jung Yeol before.

187
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,370
(I should call him over
and give him some work.)

188
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,500
Then should I make Bo In
work late tonight?

189
00:10:43,179 --> 00:10:45,580
Is this really necessary?

190
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,750
I'm in charge of delivering you.

191
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,289
Tae Sung asked me to.

192
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,620
He didn't want his precious girlfriend
to be exposed.

193
00:10:52,090 --> 00:10:53,120
It's cute, isn't it?

194
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:54,860
Well, it is cute.

195
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,629
Tae Sung must be dying to see you.
Get out already.

196
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:03,169
(Yun Jae Hyeon)

197
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,669
- It's Jae Hyeon.
- Answer it.

198
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:08,970
Hey, Jae Hyeon.

199
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,750
Okay.

200
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:25,960
Yun Jae Hyeon.

201
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:30,490
Yu Na!

202
00:11:42,970 --> 00:11:44,179
Do you want some tea?

203
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,679
Anything to drink?

204
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,149
Do you have decaf coffee?

205
00:11:49,549 --> 00:11:51,549
No, we only drink regular coffee here.

206
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,379
I'm good, then.

207
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,549
Aren't you thirsty?
Should I get you some water?

208
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,419
No, I'm good.

209
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,830
So,

210
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,059
you two have been secretly dating.

211
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,000
And...

212
00:12:07,299 --> 00:12:08,370
And she's...

213
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:11,840
- pre...
- Pregnant?

214
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:16,370
She's pregnant? Hey, Yu Sung.

215
00:12:16,409 --> 00:12:18,139
Can you pull my sideburn?

216
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,379
Ouch, stop that.

217
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:24,679
No way. I must be dreaming right now.
This has to be a dream...

218
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:28,090
Dream?

219
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,860
That dream!

220
00:12:30,889 --> 00:12:34,789
A big, milky-white, pretty pig
came into my arms.

221
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:36,389
Stop talking.

222
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:38,200
Hey, Han Dae Soo.
You're the one who will become rich.

223
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,000
Darn it. That dream...

224
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,870
I thought I would hit the jackpot.

225
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,669
It was a conception dream.

226
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:48,309
I can't believe...

227
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:51,409
I had a conception dream for Yu Na.

228
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,580
What? What was the dream about?

229
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,289
We've already made up our minds.

230
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:04,460
We're getting married.

231
00:13:16,769 --> 00:13:17,799
Okay.

232
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,870
You two are in love,
and I'm happy for you.

233
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,669
However,

234
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:24,379
you just made your debuts
and have bright futures ahead of you.

235
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:27,610
Jae Hyeon, becoming an actor
was always your dream.

236
00:13:27,649 --> 00:13:29,710
You had to go through
the difficult trainee years.

237
00:13:30,149 --> 00:13:32,320
- You finally have a chance to shine...
- Hold on.

238
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,490
Yu Sung,
I don't like where this is going.

239
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,659
I get that
you're looking out for your talent.

240
00:13:39,690 --> 00:13:41,360
But you're only worried about him?

241
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:43,929
What about my Yu Na? She also...

242
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,799
Well, she has had it easy.

243
00:13:46,299 --> 00:13:48,399
But she has a chance to shine
as an actress now.

244
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:51,399
She has finally grown a little
as an actress, so how...

245
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,539
- Dae Soo.
- You know?

246
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,070
It's okay.
My acting hasn't improved at all.

247
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:58,610
Thanks for your comforting words, Yu Na.

248
00:13:59,379 --> 00:14:01,009
Are you sure you won't regret it?

249
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,179
Wait. Get it straight, will you?

250
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:04,820
Why would Jae Hyeon regret anything?

251
00:14:05,019 --> 00:14:07,419
Yu Na could do better.

252
00:14:07,549 --> 00:14:08,919
My goodness, Jae Hyeon.

253
00:14:08,950 --> 00:14:11,019
You lucked out.

254
00:14:12,220 --> 00:14:13,419
Thank you.

255
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:14,789
Hey, Han Dae Soo.

256
00:14:14,830 --> 00:14:16,990
Jae Hyeon is such a good kid.

257
00:14:17,029 --> 00:14:19,299
What? This is nuts.

258
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,029
Yu Na is also...

259
00:14:22,269 --> 00:14:23,899
I mean, she's kind of nice.

260
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,539
She never jaywalks
or steals from other people.

261
00:14:26,570 --> 00:14:27,470
That's nice enough, right?

262
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,980
- Watch what you say.
- Goodness, sure. She's so nice.

263
00:14:31,009 --> 00:14:32,940
She deserves the Nobel Peace Prize!

264
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,980
Hey, did you get up on the wrong side
of the bed or something?

265
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:39,919
Are you belittling Yu Na's life
right now?

266
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,549
This place used to be my turf
back in the day.

267
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:45,389
Do you want to start a fight with me?

268
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:46,889
You jerk!

269
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,429
Don't worry. He didn't lift me up.

270
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:49,529
I'm just letting him.

271
00:14:49,559 --> 00:14:51,029
I should just use this...

272
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,629
- to bust my head on yours!
- You little...

273
00:14:52,659 --> 00:14:54,929
Why are you fighting?
We want to get married!

274
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,429
I love Jae Hyeon very much.

275
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:01,139
The few days I spent without Yu Na
after our breakup...

276
00:15:01,169 --> 00:15:03,009
was the darkest moment of my life.

277
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,610
It was harder to bear than
the three years when I was a trainee.

278
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,210
I love her so much too.

279
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,179
We're not here to get your permission.

280
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,649
We booked a wedding venue.

281
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,590
It's this weekend.

282
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,990
It'll take place
at my dad's friend's house.

283
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,799
What? Engaged and expecting?

284
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,870
My gosh.
Can I write an exclusive on this?

285
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:33,039
Of course, you can't.

286
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,840
Publish it just before we send out
our press release in the morning.

287
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,110
Just a minute before.

288
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:40,009
"A blessing came our way
as soon as we decided to get married."

289
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,509
Okay. I won't have to write
anything else tomorrow.

290
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,179
It'll get so many hits.

291
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:46,250
They love each other very much.

292
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,049
It almost moved me to tears.

293
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:52,889
Yu Sung seemed to be in utter disbelief.

294
00:15:53,059 --> 00:15:54,659
Shouldn't you comfort your boyfriend?

295
00:15:55,059 --> 00:15:57,700
He went out for soju with Dae Soo.

296
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,529
They're actually besties, you know.

297
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,700
They must be upset.

298
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:04,000
But what can you do?
They love each other.

299
00:16:04,029 --> 00:16:05,539
What about their honeymoon?

300
00:16:05,570 --> 00:16:06,639
Jeju Island.

301
00:16:06,669 --> 00:16:08,710
Yu Na is pregnant, so they can't go far.

302
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,110
That sounds amazing.

303
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,309
Jeju is most beautiful
at this time of year.

304
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:13,340
- Really?
- Yes.

305
00:16:13,379 --> 00:16:15,080
- I've never been to Jeju.
- What?

306
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:17,750
You should go with your boyfriend.

307
00:16:18,919 --> 00:16:20,649
We can't even see each other now.

308
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:22,820
We can't even meet now.
Jeju Island? Forget it.

309
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:25,259
I'll just go with my family someday.

310
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,230
Or why don't we go?

311
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,289
- A friendship trip.
- No, thanks.

312
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,559
I've been dating for three days now.
Count me out.

313
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:35,700
Me too.
I'm busy going on dates with Yu Sung.

314
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:36,799
Sorry.

315
00:16:37,629 --> 00:16:38,740
Fine! Leave me alone, then!

316
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,610
It's not easy to have a boyfriend
who is a top star.

317
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:43,110
You can't go anywhere comfortably.

318
00:16:43,909 --> 00:16:45,139
Well, what can I do?

319
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,080
(Add advanced search filters)

320
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,419
(Mood: For a date)

321
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,099
What's up?

322
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:08,000
You don't know if I'm alone or not.

323
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,000
I'm here because I know...

324
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,799
you're home alone now.

325
00:17:14,299 --> 00:17:17,980
I heard Ms. Cho was with Han Byeol now.

326
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:21,180
I...

327
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,650
can't see my girlfriend,

328
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,089
but she tells me everything she's up to.

329
00:17:32,589 --> 00:17:33,690
A latte?

330
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,029
Two, please.

331
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,829
I was really hoping to see her today.

332
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,740
Jae Hyeon said he admired me.
And what? He's getting married now?

333
00:17:49,009 --> 00:17:51,680
My busy girlfriend is
about to get busier because of him.

334
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,910
Watch me.
I'm not attending their wedding.

335
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,250
I'm meeting Ms. Oh tomorrow.

336
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:04,150
What? Why are you seeing her?

337
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:05,990
I guess you forgot.

338
00:18:06,019 --> 00:18:07,930
I'm the legal advisor of your agency.

339
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:10,190
I'm not just your next-door neighbor
who makes good lattes.

340
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,130
I'm so jealous.

341
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:18,470
I should have been a lawyer.

342
00:18:21,470 --> 00:18:23,339
You think anyone can be a lawyer?

343
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:27,039
Take the rest of the latte
and just go home.

344
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:30,480
You're so heartless.

345
00:18:30,849 --> 00:18:32,779
If I could,

346
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:35,650
I'd brag about Han Byeol
to the whole world.

347
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,359
But I can't do that just for my sake.

348
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:42,359
I can't believe we have to be apart
when we're so close by.

349
00:18:43,359 --> 00:18:45,900
Well, celebrities are humans too.

350
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,700
They all fall in love and get married.

351
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,299
You can't hold yourself back
when you want to see her.

352
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,970
You will have to figure out
a way to see her.

353
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:05,619
You're so pretty.
Tilt your head a little to the right.

354
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:07,779
All right. That's so pretty. Very nice.

355
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:10,619
Yu Na! You look beautiful!

356
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:13,720
- Da Hye.
- Congratulations.

357
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,930
Oh, my. Dae Soo.

358
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,859
What are you doing?

359
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,630
What does it look like I'm doing?

360
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:22,500
Have you never seen a bag holder before?

361
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:26,140
Yu Na doesn't have any friends,
so I'm doing it for her.

362
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,809
I can't believe I'm doing this.

363
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,470
Put the money gift in here and go.

364
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:33,339
Dae Soo, the bag is getting wrinkled.

365
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:35,549
What a load of nonsense.

366
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:49,589
You're here.

367
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,660
Are you nervous?

368
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,099
I really am. It's more nerve-racking
than my first drama shoot.

369
00:19:55,329 --> 00:19:58,500
Don't be nervous.
You've never looked more handsome.

370
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:00,539
Really? Thank you.

371
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,579
Yun Jae Hyeon. This is all so sudden.

372
00:20:05,609 --> 00:20:08,980
Gosh. At least you look handsome.
Congratulations.

373
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,710
Thank you, sir.

374
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,480
I thought you'd be hosting a music show,

375
00:20:12,519 --> 00:20:14,250
but you'll end up being
on "The Return of Superman" instead.

376
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:17,420
Well, as long as
you're on a show. Am I right?

377
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:18,460
Right.

378
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:22,759
- Jae Hyeon.
- Yu Sung.

379
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:30,400
Congratulations. Live happily.

380
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,299
I'll make sure to live happily.

381
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:39,180
Goodness, this is happening so fast.

382
00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,839
They're actually getting married.

383
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:44,009
I've never seen a couple get married
only a week after the announcement.

384
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,019
We look like this, thanks to that.

385
00:20:47,319 --> 00:20:49,250
By the way, we worked really hard.

386
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:50,619
Do we have to give them
the money gift too?

387
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,390
I'll do it.

388
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,390
He's so cute.

389
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:05,000
- Where is Ms. Oh, by the way?
- What?

390
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,240
- Yes, sir.
- Where is she?

391
00:21:06,269 --> 00:21:07,269
As we said in the announcement,

392
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:08,809
no reporters are allowed in
as the wedding is private.

393
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,509
Yes, no one can come in.

394
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,309
Shocking news.

395
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,680
(Shocking News. Oh Han Byeol,
Busiest Person at Another's Wedding)

396
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,809
Ms. Oh is the busiest
at someone else's wedding as well.

397
00:21:16,849 --> 00:21:20,349
It feels like she'll be working
on her wedding day too.

398
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,289
Goodness. That's scary.

399
00:21:22,319 --> 00:21:24,190
- Let's hurry inside.
- Okay. Let's go.

400
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,690
- Congratulations, Jae Hyeon!
- Congratulations, Jae Hyeon!

401
00:21:46,009 --> 00:21:47,609
Thank you for your words of blessing.

402
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,049
All right.

403
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,690
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

404
00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:01,019
You had to kiss in private before,

405
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:05,130
but now I'll give you a chance
to kiss in front of all your guests.

406
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,930
You may kiss the bride.

407
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:36,789
I missed you.

408
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,059
I missed you too.

409
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:56,210
(Lobby, Starforce Entertainment,
Management Office)

410
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,690
Are you upset?

411
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,619
No, I'm okay.

412
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:11,359
It's just that he got married
so young...

413
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:15,000
that I'm worried people might have
a bias against him as an actor.

414
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:20,339
Things never go as planned, right?

415
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:25,009
But you see, there's no right answer.

416
00:23:25,839 --> 00:23:28,009
When you think you made it,

417
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:30,049
everything could all fall apart in vain.

418
00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:33,720
When you give up on everything,

419
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,690
a new path could open up unexpectedly.

420
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:40,319
You know it well.

421
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:45,359
So you should let go of it after today.

422
00:23:47,329 --> 00:23:49,230
Right. I should.

423
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,000
Also...

424
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:55,740
Yu Sung.

425
00:23:57,710 --> 00:23:58,839
The time...

426
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:01,180
has come.

427
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:05,450
Yu Sung. I have three years left.

428
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,349
(3 years ago)

429
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,420
Sorry?

430
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,750
Are you unwell?

431
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:14,759
I think I have only three years
of energy left in me.

432
00:24:16,529 --> 00:24:17,890
What do you mean?

433
00:24:18,730 --> 00:24:21,700
I'll work hard for only
three more years. Then I'll retire.

434
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,069
I might be a director,

435
00:24:24,099 --> 00:24:26,670
but you know that I actually
own Starforce Entertainment, right?

436
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,839
I'll let you have it in three years.

437
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:31,269
I know you get a lot of offers,

438
00:24:31,309 --> 00:24:33,839
so I'm telling you this in advance
in case you start your own agency.

439
00:24:36,309 --> 00:24:39,420
- Director Choi.
- What? Are you sad already?

440
00:24:43,549 --> 00:24:45,460
We don't even know
what will happen tomorrow,

441
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,890
so telling me what will happen
three years later...

442
00:24:49,089 --> 00:24:52,799
Well, unless you have it notarized...

443
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,700
I knew it. Yu Sung.

444
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:00,240
I've raised a tiger cub, haven't I?

445
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:04,309
But I'll push you hard
for the next three years.

446
00:25:04,839 --> 00:25:07,380
You're competent enough
to become a director,

447
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:09,180
but I won't promote you.

448
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,779
Let's work hard together
for three years.

449
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:14,279
- Brace yourself.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:20,390
Are you really going to retire?

451
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,930
Thank you so much
for hanging in there all this time.

452
00:25:25,329 --> 00:25:26,730
I hope...

453
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:29,569
you'll manage Starforce well.

454
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:32,769
Sure, Director Choi.

455
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:37,309
(Why do you suddenly
want to go on a trip?)

456
00:25:37,569 --> 00:25:40,539
Did you know we don't have
a decent photo of us together?

457
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,279
(We took one in college.)

458
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:43,650
I don't mean those.

459
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,519
We've never taken a decent photo
as a couple since we became a couple.

460
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:49,220
- Gosh.
(- I'll take tons of photos...)

461
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,220
(and cover my room with those.)

462
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:52,690
Goodness.

463
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:56,529
Also, I've really wanted
to go to Jeju Island with you.

464
00:25:56,789 --> 00:25:58,259
(A trip to Jeju Island)

465
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,900
(Park Ho Young)

466
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:03,299
(I have an update on some new intel.)

467
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,240
(Ms. Oh has never been to Jeju Island.)

468
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,269
(I told her she could go
with her boyfriend,)

469
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:10,109
(but she just stared off
into the distance with sad eyes.)

470
00:26:10,170 --> 00:26:11,940
(I think she really wants to go.)

471
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:13,480
(Good luck!)

472
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,680
Is it okay to go on a trip so suddenly?

473
00:26:16,710 --> 00:26:18,349
It's not sudden.

474
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,779
I poured my everything into this trip.

475
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,349
Do you see this map? I drew it myself.

476
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,490
No way. You took it that far?

477
00:26:26,519 --> 00:26:28,359
Here. Do you see these?

478
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,529
I printed all of them out myself.

479
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,730
(Jeju Island driving tour)

480
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,529
Are we going to stay there for a year?

481
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,069
I have to be
this detailed and thorough...

482
00:26:36,099 --> 00:26:37,900
to go on a trip with you.

483
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:39,740
Gosh, Gong.

484
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:44,109
But people will recognize you.

485
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,180
I prepared something for that too.

486
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:49,150
Ta-da.

487
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,220
What are those?

488
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:55,019
Ta-da! What do you think?

489
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:56,819
You can't tell it's me, right?

490
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,390
(No, I can't.)

491
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:02,589
But I think
it'll draw more attention to us.

492
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,990
Ta-da!

493
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,230
What do you think? I'm a rocker.
You can't tell it's me, right?

494
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,670
No. I can't tell at all.

495
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:12,000
This is amazing!

496
00:27:12,039 --> 00:27:14,940
But I wouldn't want to walk around
with someone like him.

497
00:27:15,269 --> 00:27:16,309
It's embarrassing.

498
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:18,339
- Ta-da.
- Wait.

499
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,279
I can't really see, though.
Does it look okay?

500
00:27:20,309 --> 00:27:21,309
Do you think they'll recognize me?

501
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:22,650
This one looks fine.

502
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,779
(It's good, right?)

503
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,680
Okay. Let's go.

504
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,180
Now we can go to Jeju Island.

505
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,519
Let's go!

506
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,920
Hello.

507
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,390
Which drink would you like to have?

508
00:27:33,490 --> 00:27:35,390
- I'll have orange juice.
- Okay.

509
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,829
(See? There aren't that many people
since it's early in the morning.)

510
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,430
(- You're right.)
- Enjoy your trip.

511
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:47,099
(Gong, you're quite smart.)

512
00:27:51,509 --> 00:27:54,039
Hello.
Which drink would you like to have?

513
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:56,980
I'm going to Jeju Island
to get some rest.

514
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,619
Is that so?

515
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,650
- Enjoy your trip.
- Thanks.

516
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,029
Did you see it? No one knows it's me.

517
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,569
(See? No one knows it's me
because I'm dressed like this.)

518
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:22,670
(This is amazing.)

519
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:24,839
(You're right.)

520
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,349
(I'll go rent a car,
so wait for me, okay?)

521
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:31,779
(You can take your time.)

522
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:34,920
(Okay.)

523
00:28:36,049 --> 00:28:38,150
I've never been this far for a shoot.

524
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,619
Really?

525
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,519
You'll go to even farther places
from now on.

526
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:44,559
People like Tae Sung
even ride in chartered planes.

527
00:28:45,299 --> 00:28:46,799
Gosh, is that so?

528
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:53,539
("Time for Unrequited Love")

529
00:28:54,269 --> 00:28:55,869
Height is 185cm,
with outstanding physical proportion.

530
00:28:55,910 --> 00:28:57,109
His legs are so long that
I can't see the end of them.

531
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,339
His head is shaped like a chestnut.

532
00:28:58,369 --> 00:28:59,410
His eyes are like black holes.

533
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,079
His lips make me want to kiss him.

534
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,250
What?
I can't see his eyes, nose, or lips.

535
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,450
I'm sure that's Tae Sung.

536
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,720
I don't think so.

537
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,690
It's him.

538
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,490
Tae Sung.

539
00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:25,339
What brings you here?

540
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,240
Well, I...

541
00:29:28,339 --> 00:29:31,269
I fell in love with Jeju Island
and came to rest.

542
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,609
- I came here alone.
- Tae Sung.

543
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:36,849
Hello, sir.

544
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,309
Hey.

545
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:39,880
Hi.

546
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,849
Tae Sung.

547
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,490
Yu Sung.

548
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,359
Gosh, Actor Gong.

549
00:29:49,460 --> 00:29:51,759
You're here in Jeju
to get some rest, right?

550
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:53,359
You're really good at traveling alone.

551
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:55,599
- You're incredible.
- I know I am.

552
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:58,470
We're here to shoot
"Time for Unrequited Love".

553
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,039
Right. It seemed so.

554
00:30:00,069 --> 00:30:01,940
Mr. Kang Yu Sung and Ms. Baek Da Hye.

555
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:03,210
The director wanted to see you.

556
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:04,670
Okay. Keep up the good work.

557
00:30:06,609 --> 00:30:09,180
I should've told you
the schedule of the shooting.

558
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,609
I'm sorry.

559
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,220
Let's do better next time.

560
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:20,720
Why did I have to run into
the drama crew of all people?

561
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,160
It's all right.

562
00:30:23,529 --> 00:30:25,660
Jeju is a big island.
I'm sure we won't run into them again.

563
00:30:27,529 --> 00:30:31,970
To prevent that, I got
the shooting schedule from Yu Sung.

564
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,140
You did?

565
00:30:33,369 --> 00:30:36,039
Gosh, my boyfriend is so smart.

566
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,269
Good job.

567
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:39,210
All right. We'll have our first meal.

568
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,309
We're going to
an amazing but hidden place...

569
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,609
that I found with so much effort.

570
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:44,380
- An amazing but hidden place?
- Yes.

571
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:45,779
I can't wait to go there.

572
00:30:45,819 --> 00:30:47,019
- Right?
- Yes.

573
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,490
It's going to be so good.

574
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:50,619
How did he find it...

575
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,319
- if it's a hidden place?
- I can't wait to go there too.

576
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:53,619
I have a bad feeling about this.

577
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,859
Just wait and see.

578
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:06,240
If we go in there,

579
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:07,900
it might be quieter than it seems.

580
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,950
What are you doing?

581
00:31:16,849 --> 00:31:18,150
I will go and see what it's like there.

582
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,380
Don't be ridiculous.

583
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:21,349
Why?

584
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:23,319
I'll go.

585
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:34,000
You're so pretty.

586
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,230
Congratulations on your marriage.

587
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:37,869
- Congratulations.
- You look great together.

588
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,369
- We got married.
- We got married.

589
00:31:44,609 --> 00:31:46,109
Please look over here.

590
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,680
- Over here.
- Goodness.

591
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,059
- What's it like in there?
- Do you know who's inside?

592
00:31:59,089 --> 00:32:00,190
I don't.

593
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:02,490
Yun Jae Hyeon and Jin Yu Na
who just got married are here.

594
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:04,529
It's even hard to run into them
like this in Seoul.

595
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,359
Start the car already.

596
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,259
It almost made my heart drop.

597
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:09,900
Why are they here?

598
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:13,799
It's a canola field! It's so pretty.

599
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,970
- I found a great place, right?
- It's so pretty.

600
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,839
It's amazing and so pretty.

601
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,140
Look over there. My goodness.

602
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,450
- Let's take a picture here.
- Let's do that.

603
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,880
Take a picture
with all those flowers in it.

604
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,579
All of them. Okay.

605
00:32:25,619 --> 00:32:26,920
- All right.
- I love it.

606
00:32:27,349 --> 00:32:29,319
I'll take it. In 1, 2...

607
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,190
- What's going on?
- My goodness.

608
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:51,970
Are you nervous?

609
00:32:53,509 --> 00:32:55,609
Yes, a bit.

610
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:58,250
I've never shot a romantic scene before.

611
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
Is there someone you like?

612
00:33:03,119 --> 00:33:04,390
Or maybe someone you liked.

613
00:33:09,829 --> 00:33:11,390
- I'm good at those things.
- I see.

614
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,759
Yes.

615
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:13,859
There was someone.

616
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:15,930
Then, at this moment,

617
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,630
think of me as that person.

618
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,470
It will help you focus.

619
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:24,069
I'm not going to Seoul today.

620
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:25,240
("Time for Unrequited Love")

621
00:33:25,269 --> 00:33:28,210
But you always said
you wanted to go home. Why not?

622
00:33:30,609 --> 00:33:31,750
Because Jeju...

623
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,349
is so pretty.

624
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,869
(I started it on my own,)

625
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,369
(so I can end it on my own.)

626
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,539
(That's why...)

627
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,509
(I decided to call this moment
the time for unrequited love.)

628
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,880
When will they leave?
We're here to see the flowers.

629
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,480
We were almost caught.
What a relief, right?

630
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,190
But still...

631
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,059
I wanted to show you the flowers.

632
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:13,519
It's okay. We saw them.

633
00:34:18,730 --> 00:34:21,360
Gosh. You didn't even get to eat, right?

634
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:24,170
I got it from a good restaurant.
Enjoy it.

635
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:25,400
Thank you.

636
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,170
There are so many canola fields
in Jeju Island.

637
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:29,969
Why did you have to come here?

638
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,840
It's because Tae Sung knows
which one is the best.

639
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:38,510
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

640
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,420
By the way,

641
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:43,789
we will be shooting here all day today.

642
00:34:44,349 --> 00:34:45,690
The schedule changed.

643
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,699
There's a reason why it's famous.
It's really delicious.

644
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:58,800
I'm sorry.

645
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:02,340
You couldn't eat anything properly
because of me.

646
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,239
Eating comfortably in here...

647
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,679
is much better than being on edge
somewhere crowded.

648
00:35:06,510 --> 00:35:07,809
Also, I'm with you.

649
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:10,050
But...

650
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,250
Look at the canolas.

651
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
It's pretty.

652
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:20,860
This is a canola field too.

653
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,829
But there aren't that many flowers here.

654
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,829
I'm good at Photoshop.

655
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,000
I'll fill this place with flowers.

656
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:27,960
- Really?
- Let's take a picture here.

657
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:29,369
Let's take one at the center here.

658
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,400
In 1, 2, 3.

659
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,369
In 1, 2, 3.

660
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:42,650
(Gong Tae Sung)

661
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:44,150
(I saw Gong Tae Sung at Jeju Airport.
Did he come to rest after his drama?)

662
00:35:47,150 --> 00:35:49,019
(Gosh! I'm on the same plane
as Gong Tae Sung!)

663
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:50,449
(I ran into Gong Tae Sung
on my trip to Jeju.)

664
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,469
Gosh, this place is amazing.

665
00:36:07,869 --> 00:36:09,010
- Isn't it great?
- Yes.

666
00:36:09,739 --> 00:36:11,909
- Let's go.
- There's a swing too.

667
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:13,739
Let's go.

668
00:36:32,159 --> 00:36:34,130
Gosh, this place is so nice.

669
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,969
It was really hard to find this place.

670
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,099
We're the only ones using this place,
and we don't meet the owner in person.

671
00:36:39,199 --> 00:36:41,340
Gosh, you did a great job.

672
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,010
It's so comfortable.

673
00:36:45,039 --> 00:36:46,110
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

674
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,510
All right.

675
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:51,150
Let's not go anywhere
and just stay here.

676
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:52,420
Let's have dinner here.

677
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:56,750
Staying indoors is the best.

678
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,670
Oh Han Byeol.

679
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,369
Wake up.

680
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,110
What?

681
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:24,449
Did I doze off?

682
00:37:25,179 --> 00:37:26,480
What time is it?

683
00:37:26,679 --> 00:37:28,380
It's dinnertime now.

684
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:30,789
My gosh, I slept a lot then.

685
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:34,190
Hey, why did you get changed?

686
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,800
You can look forward
to our dinner tonight.

687
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:43,230
I made a reservation
at an amazing place.

688
00:37:43,269 --> 00:37:46,699
Where? I would be happy to eat here.

689
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,869
You really don't have to
worry this time, okay?

690
00:37:50,909 --> 00:37:52,210
Trust me.

691
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,409
Welcome.

692
00:37:56,010 --> 00:37:57,980
We have a reservation for 7pm.

693
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:00,380
Okay. This way, please.

694
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,769
What? What's going on?

695
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:22,539
What do you say? You can relax now
and enjoy the meal, right?

696
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,110
What? When did you get here?

697
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:53,440
Hey, Yu Sung.
What are you doing tonight?

698
00:38:53,769 --> 00:38:56,440
I'm going on a date with Ho Young.
Why do you ask?

699
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,340
You know that
my contract is ending soon, right?

700
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,150
(Do you realize that
not having dinner with me tonight...)

701
00:39:03,179 --> 00:39:05,920
(could possibly result
in the biggest crisis of your career?)

702
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:09,949
I'll text you the address.
Meet me there. And bring Ho Young.

703
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,889
(Attorney Do Soo Hyuk)

704
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,860
- Hello?
- Hi, neighbor.

705
00:39:18,059 --> 00:39:19,099
Come to Jeju Island.

706
00:39:19,130 --> 00:39:21,659
(I'll pay for your flight, hotel,
and food. All of it.)

707
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,199
What are you talking about?
Why would I go there?

708
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,769
Bring Ms. Cho.

709
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,639
I'm in!

710
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,980
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

711
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:44,420
It's so surreal to see everyone
here in Jeju, isn't it?

712
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,719
This could only happen
because of someone's hard work.

713
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:50,289
- Thank you.
- Don't thank me.

714
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:51,860
I'm Gong Tae Sung, you know.

715
00:39:54,429 --> 00:39:57,400
I'll be honest. I thought he was crazy
when he called me earlier.

716
00:39:57,829 --> 00:40:00,199
He talked as if going to Jeju was like
going over to a neighbor's.

717
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:02,269
So? Do you regret coming here?

718
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:07,380
No. I just wanted to say it's nice
to be a little crazy from time to time.

719
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,780
I agree.

720
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,409
We're here for work, but it's
even better than a pleasure trip.

721
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:15,219
Let's go on a trip soon.

722
00:40:15,889 --> 00:40:17,090
Okay, Yu Sung!

723
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,750
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

724
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:26,530
Anyway, no one will ever know
about this secret get-together...

725
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,630
if I don't write about it, right?

726
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:29,730
Well...

727
00:40:30,969 --> 00:40:33,539
Ms. Reporter, you can't do that here.

728
00:40:33,570 --> 00:40:35,639
Our legal advisor has no mercy.

729
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,809
Even with me?

730
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,039
Well, I'm not sure.

731
00:40:40,179 --> 00:40:42,380
I prefer not to file a lawsuit
against Ki Ppeum.

732
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,949
I'll give you another exclusive
when we return to Seoul.

733
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,119
Okay, deal.

734
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,590
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

735
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,860
How about a group photo?

736
00:40:56,889 --> 00:40:58,159
- Sounds great.
- Yes!

737
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:00,760
A photo? Come on.
Let's just eat. It will get cold.

738
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:02,869
I'm not even in the photo.

739
00:41:04,070 --> 00:41:05,099
Mr. Do.

740
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,539
- Oh, you want me to do it?
- Yes.

741
00:41:09,539 --> 00:41:11,639
All right, here we go.

742
00:41:11,670 --> 00:41:13,340
In 1, 2, 3.

743
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,179
We need to smile more.

744
00:41:19,679 --> 00:41:21,219
In 1, 2, 3.

745
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:25,389
Ho Young, try this.

746
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:27,119
- This is good.
- Let me give you some of this.

747
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,260
Here.

748
00:41:29,889 --> 00:41:31,559
- Try it.
- Do you want more?

749
00:41:33,559 --> 00:41:34,599
- Cho Ki Ppeum!
- Yes?

750
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:37,199
Don't laugh.

751
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:43,869
- Try this first.
- Everything is delicious.

752
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,110
I ordered more.

753
00:41:49,409 --> 00:41:50,880
It's so good.

754
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,750
- Oh, no. What do we do?
- When?

755
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,789
We couldn't get used to that.

756
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:05,789
Well, we'll head out now.

757
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:07,860
- We'll get another glass of wine.
- I see.

758
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,929
See you in Seoul.

759
00:42:09,969 --> 00:42:11,800
- Bye.
- Bye.

760
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:14,900
Then why don't we get going too?

761
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,969
What? Where are you going?

762
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,710
- We want to go on a date.
- Sounds good, Yu Sung!

763
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:23,050
Call me if anything happens.
I'll rush over.

764
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:24,579
Nothing will happen.

765
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:26,820
Right, I'm with him. Be careful.

766
00:42:26,849 --> 00:42:29,019
- I'm counting on you.
- Bye.

767
00:42:32,349 --> 00:42:33,460
Gosh, look at them.

768
00:42:34,289 --> 00:42:37,590
Then shall we spend some time alone too,
just the two of us?

769
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:40,599
Shall we?

770
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,369
It's so nice that no one is here.

771
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,579
We don't have to worry
that people might recognize me.

772
00:42:53,179 --> 00:42:54,239
What?

773
00:42:56,909 --> 00:42:57,909
I'm sorry.

774
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,250
Both Yu Sung and Mr. Do...

775
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:05,320
can take their girlfriends
to nice places.

776
00:43:06,219 --> 00:43:08,090
But I can't even do that.

777
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,699
Hey, don't say that. I was totally moved
by what you did today.

778
00:43:16,199 --> 00:43:18,900
Still, you always have to be
on your guard...

779
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,539
and be careful because of me.

780
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:24,710
Did you forget what I said?
I can't live without you.

781
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:27,309
All I need is you.

782
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:30,349
Besides,
we're not here to go sightseeing.

783
00:43:30,610 --> 00:43:32,380
We are here to make memories.

784
00:43:35,650 --> 00:43:39,590
Han Byeol, how do you know
exactly what to say every single time?

785
00:43:40,989 --> 00:43:42,659
Because I'm Gong Tae Sung's girlfriend.

786
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,260
My gosh. Look at the sky.

787
00:43:47,829 --> 00:43:50,429
It's so beautiful!
There are so many stars!

788
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:52,130
What? No way. I see so many stars.

789
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:54,070
- Isn't this beautiful?
- Unbelievable.

790
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,269
- Hey! Look over there.
- No way!

791
00:43:56,309 --> 00:43:57,769
- Wasn't that a shooting star?
- I saw it.

792
00:43:57,809 --> 00:44:01,280
- Make a wish now!
- Okay. A wish.

793
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,690
- Did you make a wish?
- Yes.

794
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,860
What did you wish for?

795
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:17,789
Please let me tell the whole world
that this beautiful girl right here...

796
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:22,099
is my girlfriend.
I want that day to come very soon!

797
00:44:24,469 --> 00:44:25,969
Is that really what you wished for?

798
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:27,199
Of course.

799
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,139
Let's go.

800
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:37,150
Let's go. Gong Tae Sung's girlfriend,
Oh Han Byeol.

801
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:44,719
By the way, there are so many stars.
I've never seen anything like this.

802
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:50,090
What do you say?
Should I get a star for you?

803
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,699
- Yes, please.
- How many do you want?

804
00:45:04,469 --> 00:45:05,510
Well...

805
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:10,409
We always spend time at your place.

806
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:14,579
So it's kind of awkward
to be in this new environment, you know?

807
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,559
Oh, really?

808
00:45:25,590 --> 00:45:26,659
What?

809
00:45:40,539 --> 00:45:42,179
I remember our first kiss.

810
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,349
You kissed me first
but got jumpy and ran away.

811
00:45:45,510 --> 00:45:49,380
Gong, why must you remember that?

812
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:52,019
How could I not?
You were unbelievably cute.

813
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:57,929
I'm not the Oh Han Byeol you remember.

814
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,400
And I'm not
the same Gong Tae Sung either.

815

The sun feels so nice.

816
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:04,320
Gosh, Han Byeol.

817
00:48:06,489 --> 00:48:08,119
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes.

818
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:13,699
How come you're so pretty
even in the morning?

819
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,969
Let's do a lot of fun stuff
outside today.

820
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,469
Okay.

821
00:48:30,210 --> 00:48:33,420
What about taking a walk
in a wild radish flower field?

822
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:39,760
What is it?

823

(Cho Ki Ppeum)

824
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:42,219
(Hey. We're at
the wild radish flower field.)

825
00:48:42,289 --> 00:48:44,360
(We want to take a walk quietly,
so don't come here.)

826

(From Cho Ki Ppeum.)

827
00:48:55,539 --> 00:48:56,639
What about the Secret Forest?

828
00:48:56,769 --> 00:48:58,170
People call it the Secret Forest.

829
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,139
Don't you think it will be
secretive and romantic?

830
00:49:00,179 --> 00:49:01,480
Let's go there.

831
00:49:01,739 --> 00:49:02,840
The Secret Forest?

832
00:49:03,349 --> 00:49:05,050
Ho Young said she was going there.

833
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:09,250
She said she wanted to go there secretly
with Yu Sung whom she loves.

834
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:12,090
(I'm sure she's already there.
She does whatever she puts her mind to.)

835
00:49:12,119 --> 00:49:13,559
This place is so nice.

836
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:15,159
I really wanted to come here.

837
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,159
Right. It's so nice.

838
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:21,199
We're on a work trip together
because we work in the same company.

839
00:49:21,329 --> 00:49:22,829
I'm so happy right now.

840
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:24,630
You're so cute.

841
00:49:25,030 --> 00:49:27,269
I'm glad that we're an office couple.

842
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:32,710
Then what about making pretty cups
as a couple?

843
00:49:32,739 --> 00:49:34,840
I think they will be so pretty.
What do you say?

844
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:35,980
No.

845
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,010
It's taken by the attention seekers.
I mean the married couple.

846
00:49:40,449 --> 00:49:42,880
(We're here to make three rice bowls.)

847

Ta-da.

848

This is for our National Fairy.

849
00:49:50,230 --> 00:49:51,929
This one is for me,
and this one is for the baby.

850
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:55,059
I'm done too.

851
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,369
It's so cute. Is it a cup for the baby?

852
00:49:57,900 --> 00:49:59,469
No, it's for soju.

853
00:50:00,969 --> 00:50:02,570
I'm so sad...

854
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:04,909
that I can't eat sashimi and soju
in Jeju Island.

855
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:07,639
It must be so hard for you,
my National Fairy.

856
00:50:07,739 --> 00:50:08,940
Honey, I mean.

857
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:10,750
Let's come again with the baby.

858
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,349
I'll let you drink as much as you want
when we're here again.

Please hang in there, okay?

860

- Okay. I'll do that.
- Good girl.

861
00:50:18,550 --> 00:50:20,920
So we can't go anywhere.

862
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,360
Is there any place you want to go?

863
00:50:24,429 --> 00:50:27,400

I love driving around like this.

Gosh, the wind!

It's the kind of wind
you can't feel in Seoul.

867
00:50:41,039 --> 00:50:43,480
Gosh, the water is so blue.
It's so pretty.

It's so pretty.

871

I guess we wandered around to come here.

872

I had it all planned out.

- Liar.
- I really did.

- It's nice.

883

will be to admit it.

I'll give you some tips for you rookies
since I'm your senior.

911
00:54:51,690 --> 00:54:54,429
One. A manager must be a skilled driver.

912
00:54:54,530 --> 00:54:57,130
Wherever and whenever,
you must drive safely and comfortably...

913
00:54:57,230 --> 00:54:58,769
so your artist can be
in great condition.

(Protect the environment!)

Two. An actor's pride is his life.

916
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,739
And we must protect it.

917
00:55:02,769 --> 00:55:03,769
And three.

918
00:55:03,809 --> 00:55:06,139
A good manager comes with a good style.

919
