that's why the rumor is not true.

00:08:40,929 --> 00:08:43,230
when you're busy, when you're not busy,

163
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:45,799
when Yu Na is here, when she's not...

164
00:08:46,730 --> 00:08:48,830
Wait, where's Yu Na? Did she go home?

165
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,769
No. She's skipping lunch,

166
00:08:50,799 --> 00:08:52,700
so she can do some online shopping
in the car.

167
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,440
Is shopping that important? Goodness...

168
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,080
Hello. Yes...

169
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,980
Thanks for calling.

170
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,179
Oh, yes.

171
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,320
Hi, Tae Sung.

172
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,120
Enjoy your meal.

173
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,690
You too.

174
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:15,830
Okay.

175
00:09:20,299 --> 00:09:21,830
Tae Sung. Don't you...

176
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,370
really like clam soup?

177
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,200
You haven't even touched it.

178
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,080
What?

179
00:09:31,409 --> 00:09:33,950
I mean, preferences can change easily.

180
00:09:34,549 --> 00:09:35,649
Right?

181
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,179
Yes, you're right.

182
00:09:39,549 --> 00:09:42,289
Yes. I also didn't like mint
chocolate chip ice cream, but now I do.

183
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,659
Sometimes I like dipping my sauce,
and sometimes I like it poured over.

184
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,529
Sometimes I crave pineapple pizza,
and sometimes I hate it.

185
00:09:47,559 --> 00:09:49,059
Things like that.

186
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,070
Yes. That can happen.

187
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,710
Enjoy your meal.
I'm going to head out first.

188
00:10:02,539 --> 00:10:04,009
You should finish your meal. No rush.

189
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:15,820
Tae Sung must have had a hard time
because of his dating scandal.

190
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,860
Right?

191
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:20,320
Yes.

192
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:30,169
I heard this is the best restaurant
around our filming location.

193
00:10:30,269 --> 00:10:32,970
I searched so hard
for our Nation's Fairy.

194
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,509
This place?

195
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,110
The food is great,

196
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:37,409
but the security is the best.

197
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,279
- This place?
- Yes.

198
00:10:40,309 --> 00:10:43,049
A close actor friend of mine
came here often with his girlfriend,

199
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,220
and they weren't caught even once.

200
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,720
Eat.

201
00:10:51,659 --> 00:10:53,090
I'm enjoying your drama.

202
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,700
All of the other actors were here.

203
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:02,730
Over there. Autograph.

204
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:03,970
(Gong Tae Sung, Kang Yu Sung)

205
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,000
You two came here secretly, right?

206
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,840
A lot of people ate here
and eventually got married.

207
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,539
Enjoy and make sure
to leave an autograph.

208
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:15,879
Don't worry.

209
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:18,350
I'll place your autographs
far apart from each other.

210
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,220
Enjoy.

211
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,259
Who is that close actor friend of yours?

212
00:11:27,789 --> 00:11:28,990
There's this person...

213
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,299
He's an extra in many films.

214
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,399
Yes.

215
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,279
Oh, Ji Hoon.

216
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:47,110
What are you doing here?

217
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:49,210
I wanted to see you, Tae Sung.

218
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,419
Suddenly?

219
00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:53,350
I had an appointment nearby,

220
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,090
and I saw you on a billboard.
A huge one.

221
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,720
And you said something.

222
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:03,230
Ji Hoon, I miss you. Come see me now.

223
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,059
I did?

224
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,629
You seemed like you really missed me,
even telepathically sending me messages.

225
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:11,070
So I came.

226
00:12:11,769 --> 00:12:13,639
- What?
- And...

227
00:12:15,309 --> 00:12:16,340
this.

228
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:18,580
What is this?

229
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,740
Open it.

230
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,950
(Peanut Caramel)

231
00:12:24,149 --> 00:12:25,250
Why are there so many?

232
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,850
Did you wipe out the whole store?

233
00:12:27,889 --> 00:12:30,419
Yes. I illegally took everything.

234
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,889
- Again?
- It's a habit.

235
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:35,789
You should share
with your friends out there.

236
00:12:36,559 --> 00:12:37,799
Do you think I'm a kid?

237
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,169
You're still a kid to me. Got it?

238
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,370
I see. You're being nice
because my contract is almost over.

239
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,539
Goodness. You figured it out.
You've gotten smarter.

240
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,179
Hey, I'm really going to be late.

241
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,549
I'll be going.

242
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,690
You remember that I promised...

243
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:04,659
to protect you, right?

244
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,159
What's gotten into you?

245
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:12,259
Just don't forget that.

246
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:14,059
I'm really going now.

247
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,080
- Tae Sung.
- Yu Sung.

248
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,620
Are you feeling okay?

249
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,820
Better than I expected.

250
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:35,019
You must've been surprised.

251
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:37,389
I'm sorry for the past couple of days.

252
00:13:37,419 --> 00:13:39,519
What do you have to be sorry about?

253
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:41,090
I checked in and around your house.

254
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,129
The apartment will improve
their security too.

255
00:13:43,559 --> 00:13:45,399
You must have run around all day again.

256
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:48,700
You seem more tired than me.

257
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:52,740
Ji Hoon also came
because he was worried about me.

258
00:13:53,269 --> 00:13:54,440
He brought that.

259
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:57,169
I thought he was Santa Claus.

260
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,580
That's so like him.

261
00:13:58,779 --> 00:13:59,980
On that note,

262
00:14:00,309 --> 00:14:02,309
- I brought a gift too.
- What is this?

263
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:04,820
You people, seriously. What...

264
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,879
(Seaweed Flavored Snack)

265
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,820
Do you think I'm a child?

266
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:10,690
Thanks.

267
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,990
You really brought my favorite items.

268
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:17,429
(Han Byeol, You worked so hard.
I had lunch.)

269
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:20,259
Yes.

270
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:26,600
What?

271
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,370
Is today my birthday?

272
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,870
Ji Hoon, Yu Sung, and now you.

273
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,409
You're so popular.
I had to wait in line to see you.

274
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:37,309
- Hey, wait.
- Don't worry. Nobody is here.

275
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,750
No. The tteobokki bag is going to burst.

276
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:41,950
Tteobokki?

277
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,059
I got just liver for sundae.

278
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:50,960
Really? Just liver?

279
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,200
No way.

280
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,129
You should eat
before the food gets soggy.

281
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,539
Did you...

282
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,610
- come here to give me this?
- Yes.

283
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,480
I mean, I was worried about you
because of the dating scandal.

284
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,409
And I missed you.

285
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,419
Why?

286
00:15:15,850 --> 00:15:17,019
You missed me?

287
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,620
Am I not allowed to?

288
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,389
You are.

289
00:15:21,429 --> 00:15:23,730
You can totally. Absolutely.

290
00:15:23,759 --> 00:15:24,860
Here. Look at me.

291
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,509
Is the first one to blink the loser?

292
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:39,840
What?

293
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,779
Oh, are we having a staring match?

294
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,379
I really want to win.

295
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:48,590
I don't want to lose either.

296
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,370
- Hey, you blinked.
- Yes.

297
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,710
I lost. What do I do?

298
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:11,009
I think I need to be penalized.

299
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,610
What would be my penalty?

300
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,480
- What? This is a penalty?
- Yes.

301
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:18,950
You don't like it?

302
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,179
No.

303
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,389
What if Jung Yeol comes in?

304
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:26,690
Jung Yeol left.

305
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,929
Hold on. What about the staff outside...

306
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:30,190
All of the staff are gone.

307
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,299
Wait. The staff...

308
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,529
They all left.

309
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,639
Come here.

310
00:16:39,139 --> 00:16:40,340
My goodness.

311
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,210
I can see Yu Sung
and act as if nothing happened.

312
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:45,879
It's not a big deal.

313
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,440
I can do it.

314
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:48,679
I can do it.

315
00:17:02,259 --> 00:17:03,360
Hey.

316
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,559
Hi, Ho Young.

317
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:16,269
Have a good day.

319
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,299

with the same name.

(Trot Singer Baek Ji Soo Getting Married
Not The Actress Baek Ji Soo)

323
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:15,200
Just a reminder. It's reporting 101...

324
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:17,500
to fact-check.

325
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,210
Fact-check?

326
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,210
No wonder why my mom
kept repeating "Top star".

327
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:29,809
That she's an amazing singer.

328
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,049
How would I have known...

00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:34,990
she was referring to trot singer
Baek Ji Soo's song "Your Top Star"?

330
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:39,220
You couldn't have.
It's obviously all my fault.

331
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,759
Gosh, I'm hungry.

332
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:44,029
I'm going to go eat dinner.

Hi, Ms. Kim.

335
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,849
Yes, Ms. Cho.

336
00:19:03,079 --> 00:19:04,380
(Yes, Ms. Kim.)

337
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:06,779
I'm truly sorry.

338
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:08,849
The article will
be taken down immediately.

339
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:12,559
I see, all right. Thank you.

(I have no excuses.)

342
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:21,829
It's nothing new. Don't worry about it.

343
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:23,769
The problem is Ji Soo.

344
00:19:23,799 --> 00:19:26,500
(I'm sure she's furious.)

345
00:19:26,539 --> 00:19:28,109
She asked why we stink at our jobs.

346
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,269
Then suggested we re-name
to Today No Tomorrow Entertainment.

347
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,049
Gosh, Ms. Baek
still hasn't lost her humor.

348
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:41,220
I know right? It's moments like this
that motivate me to work.

349
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,750
Maybe I'll legally re-name the company.

350
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,130
I am so sorry. Sincerely.

Again?

354
00:20:09,009 --> 00:20:12,450
I'll have to hang up now, Ms. Cho.

355
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,519
Ji Soo is calling me yet again.

356
00:20:14,549 --> 00:20:16,950
I see. Sure, Ms. Kim.

357
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,690
I'm really sorry.

358
00:20:32,670 --> 00:20:33,839

359
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:35,910
Yes, that's me.

I didn't expect to see you so soon.

366
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,509
The shocking 50 percent discount
was too shocking to pass over.

367
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:18,720
You seem to like 5:30pm very much.

(Complaint)

369
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,599
It'll be difficult
to finish by 5:53pm, right?

370
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:35,630
It's hard to say.

371
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,869
But it might be possible.

372
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,900
I don't think you'll need
the discount either.

373
00:21:41,569 --> 00:21:43,140
Is it really bad?

374
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,140
No, the plaintiff is my acquaintance.

375
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,910
You know Baek Ji Soo well?

376
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:53,319
Yes, sort of.

377
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,319
To be exact,
the plaintiff is someone else.

378
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,259
Come with me.

379
00:21:58,759 --> 00:21:59,789
Okay.

380
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:05,599
You know a lot of people in this field
thanks to your specialty.

381
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,660
An acquaintance from school?
Or your hometown?

382
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,500
An acquaintance by blood.

383
00:22:14,269 --> 00:22:15,309
Hey.

384
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,269
Don't bother me.

385
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,339
Apparently, Ji Soo's fiance is a doctor.

386
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,079
Does that make me one too?

387
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,150
Did you sue a reporter?

388
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,549
I did. I have a question.
Is it faster to go to med school...

389
00:22:25,579 --> 00:22:27,519
or take the CSAT to become a doctor?

390
00:22:27,849 --> 00:22:29,150
Stop being ridiculous.

391
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:31,220
And drop this complaint.

392
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,359
No.

393
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,890
Are you grateful they turned
your brother into a doctor?

394
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,230
Gosh, I'm getting sick of this.
This isn't funny.

395
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:41,160
Is that so?
Do you know her or something?

396
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:43,470
Yes, she helped clear
the dating scandal about me.

397
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,400
I see. I understand
why you're helping her then.

398
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,069
Fine, do as you wish.
I just acted out of anger.

399
00:22:51,609 --> 00:22:52,640
All right.

400
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:55,309
But she's in front of you right now.

401

- Thank you.

00:23:18,369 --> 00:23:19,539
Well,

407
00:23:19,569 --> 00:23:22,940
I'm actress Baek Ji Soo's fiancé.

408
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:24,809
Not the one who sang "Your Top Star".

409
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:26,440
I see.

410
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,809
- I'm truly sorry.
- No, it's fine.

411
00:23:29,849 --> 00:23:33,920
Thanks to you,
I lived as a doctor for a short while.

412
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:37,089
It was a hopeful and meaningful time.

413
00:23:39,359 --> 00:23:40,660
- I see.
- Hurry up and leave now.

414
00:23:40,690 --> 00:23:42,630
How much longer do you plan to stay?

415
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,599
I was about to leave.
I'm meeting up with Ji Soo anyway.

416
00:23:45,829 --> 00:23:46,829
Right.

417
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,369
Remember we have
the family dinner next week.

418
00:23:50,569 --> 00:23:52,099
Make sure to dress up.

419
00:23:52,269 --> 00:23:53,440
I always dress up.

420
00:23:53,470 --> 00:23:55,009
No, don't do that.

421
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,769
Just dress yourself like a backdrop.

422
00:23:56,809 --> 00:23:59,009
You have to be a background.

423
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,240
You need to help me and Ji Soo shine.

424
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,279
- Got it?
- Yes.

425
00:24:02,309 --> 00:24:04,349
That's your job.

426
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,849
- All right?
- Goodbye.

427
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,390
We solved it.

428
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:13,589
And it's not even 5:53pm.

429
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,930
Those two lovebirds are madly in love.
They exhaust me.

430
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,059
It seems I made a huge mistake.

431
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,769
Yes. Ji Soo's ex-boyfriend was a doctor.

432
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:29,470
I'm truly sorry.

433
00:24:29,809 --> 00:24:31,710
There's no need to apologize to me.

434
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,180
This complaint here.

435
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:36,579
Just rip it up.

436
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,880
All right. Can I go home now?

437
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:42,150
I should give you
some sort of compensation...

438
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,549
No, it's fine.

439
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,519
Then since I'm feeling grateful
and bad already...

440
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,660
could I ask you just one more favor?

441
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,400
What a great song.

442
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:04,269
How nice of Ki Ppeum
to help her climb the charts.

- Gosh.
(- This song has caused a stir today.)

I'll write up something beautiful.

464
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,559
Would that be possible?

465
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:12,039
(Make it short.)

466
00:26:12,079 --> 00:26:14,109

about you and Ji Soo, right?

467
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,250
(What are they waiting for?
They should release it already.)

468
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:18,480
Are they waiting for me
to become a doctor or what?

469
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,789
Ms. Cho. I've been thinking about this.

470
00:26:22,819 --> 00:26:24,119
What about describing me...

471

472
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,190
Of course.

473
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,130
A super attractive man.

474
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,660
Also, add this.

475
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,160

481

00:27:21,579 --> 00:27:24,079
(Baek Ji Soo is cast in
"Yellow Paper Plane".)

493
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:27,119
(Would you like to send the article?)

494
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,430
You're really fast.

495
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,329
Didn't you leave yet?

496
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,529
Well...

497
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:43,769
It's a bit tricky to lock up our office.

498
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:47,200
- And it was past 6pm?
- Yes.

499
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,839
He was waiting for me.

500
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:50,839
I almost fell for him.

501
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:52,539
You almost fell for him?

502
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:57,980
Ho Young. What's wrong?

503
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,650
Did someone beat you up or what?

504
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:00,880
Did you have a fight?

505
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,920
Did you win or lose?

506
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,549
I'm sure you didn't lose.

507
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:04,819
Were you...

508
00:28:04,950 --> 00:28:06,890
sued too?

509
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,529
Getting sued would be
much better than this.

510
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:13,700
I told him about my feelings.

511
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,269
Goodness.

512
00:28:17,730 --> 00:28:19,839
What do I do?

513
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,109
Gosh.

514
00:28:22,339 --> 00:28:25,440
You've been holding it in for years,
and that's how you told him?

515
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,740
Yes.

516
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:30,609
Why did I have to suddenly get brave
at that moment?

517
00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:32,680
Gosh. Here.

518
00:28:34,019 --> 00:28:35,920
What did Yu Sung say?

519
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:37,119
Did you see him after that?

520
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:38,349
Yes.

521
00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:40,890
I ran into him
in the company parking lot,

522
00:28:41,289 --> 00:28:42,990
but I ran away.

523
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,400
I said, "Have a nice day," and left.

524
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,500
You're so polite even in that situation.

525
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,670
What do I do now?

526
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,440
Do you think I should quit?

527
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,039
Are you going to leave the office alone?

528
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,309
Your actors still have years left
on their contracts.

529
00:28:56,509 --> 00:28:58,210
You can't.
You should at least take one with you.

530
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,410
Or you'll end up with nothing.

531
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,210
If you want to receive
unemployment benefits, you can't quit.

532
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,150
You must get fired.

533
00:29:02,250 --> 00:29:03,710
If you're fired,

534
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:05,519
I'll let you work as a part-timer here.

535
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,849
Thank you.

536
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,890
All of you are giving me
realistic and detailed advice.

537
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,359
That's so comforting.

538
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:37,309
(A relaxing time for my rough skin
after hard work.)

539
00:29:37,349 --> 00:29:38,480
(I'm here for special treatment.)

540
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,160
Goodness.
I didn't expect to see you here.

541
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,930
How did you know I was here?

542
00:29:51,630 --> 00:29:54,160
You sent me the link to
your social media so that I can see it.

543
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,500
Well, I was just sharing what I do
every day.

544
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,000
I guess you found it interesting.

545
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,369
By the way, how did you get in here?

546
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,910
Not everyone can come in here.

547
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,079
Do you think you're the only one
who's allowed to be here?

548
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,480
You just need money to come here.

549
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,220
What brings you here?

550
00:30:12,250 --> 00:30:14,349
I haven't done anything illegal.

551
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:16,519
What's wrong?

552
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:19,259
Are you worried that I might reveal
you and Tae Sung's relationship?

553
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:20,490
Not at all.

554
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:22,359
I don't think you will do that.

555
00:30:22,930 --> 00:30:24,190
That's right.

556
00:30:24,230 --> 00:30:25,900
Why would I do such a thing?

557
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,230
There's nothing special about you.

558
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,200
When he no longer has feelings for you,

559
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:31,170
you'll become nothing after all.

560
00:30:36,809 --> 00:30:40,079
You did something unnecessary.

561
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:42,579
Gosh. You're such a bad team manager.

562
00:30:42,609 --> 00:30:44,150
You took away what was given
to your team members.

563
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,119
They are not from me.

564
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,119
PR Department is working so hard.
Don't you think they deserve it?

565
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,619
It's just a common necklace.

566
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,289
Was it too cheap?

567
00:30:56,259 --> 00:30:57,960
Is that it?

568
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,460
Is it because they are the same
as yours?

569
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,769
Do you think you're special?

570
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,269
I think you have the wrong idea.

571
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,069
Someone who's special
does crave ramyeon...

572
00:31:08,099 --> 00:31:10,670
or street food from time to time.

573
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,869
But that doesn't last for long.

574
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,410
They get bored easily.

575
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:16,809
That's who you are...

576
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:18,950
to Tae Sung.

577
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,460
I've given him a special memory.

578
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:31,430
I'm sure he won't forget about me
for the rest of his life.

579
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:40,299
Ms. Kwon Myung Hee.

580
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:43,940
You know how to become special,

581
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,210
but know nothing about precious things.

582
00:31:47,579 --> 00:31:50,609
You don't give salty food
to someone who you care about.

583
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,849
Tae Sung won't remember you...

584
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,450
as a kind person anymore.

585
00:31:56,349 --> 00:31:59,559
He will only have unpleasant memories
that he doesn't want to recall.

586
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:03,430
Is this what you call special?

587
00:32:03,990 --> 00:32:05,700
Do I have to know the difference...

588
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,500
between being special
and being precious?

589
00:32:11,430 --> 00:32:12,799
You don't have to.

590
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,240
You won't be able to anyway.

591
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,339
We're done talking, right?

592
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,279
I'll throw these away.

593
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,339
Here.

594
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:21,410
Yes, ma'am.

595
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,910
Throw them into the trash.

596
00:32:25,319 --> 00:32:26,380
Yes, ma'am.

597
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,890
I hope...

598
00:32:34,289 --> 00:32:36,089
you'll be special
for the rest of your life.

599
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:38,559
Gosh. Thank you for saying that.

600
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:40,160
Let me tell you something too.

601
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,670
You're going to break up soon anyway,

602
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,039
so just enjoy the moment.

603
00:33:38,049 --> 00:33:40,259
(Let's go to the beach. Right now.)

604
00:33:51,599 --> 00:33:53,670
You must be tired
after shooting the commercial.

605
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,839
Why do you want to go to the beach?

606
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,809
I really want to go to the beach
with you today.

607
00:33:58,410 --> 00:34:00,109
What if there are many people there?

608
00:34:01,210 --> 00:34:02,809
It will be fine. Don't you trust me?

609
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:26,570
Please get in.

610
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,690
Here. Drink this.

611
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:52,500
How did you know about this place?

612
00:34:54,099 --> 00:34:56,230
There's no one here,
and it's so pretty, right?

613
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,099
Yes. It's nice.

614
00:35:03,239 --> 00:35:06,610
I was here to shoot a movie.

615
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:11,409
I wanted to come here again someday
with someone I like.

616
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,820
And that happened today.

617
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,789
This place is so pretty.

618
00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,320
It was worth doing commercials
for outdoor brands for a long time.

619
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:20,860
I can set a tent...

620
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,289
and make a fire so easily.

621
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:25,130
Right.

622
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,559
What do you think?
Your boyfriend is reliable, right?

623
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,000
I wonder if we can see stars from here.

624
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,409
It's a pitch dark night
with no starts at all.

625
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:43,179
- Gosh, look. There's a star over there.
- Where?

626
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,750
- It's so big.
- Where?

627
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,949
Here. It's my star.

628
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:49,190
Oh Han Byeol.

629
00:35:55,829 --> 00:35:57,829
There's another one.

630
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:00,929
I'll kill you if you say
that you're the biggest star.

631
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,670
Sorry.

632
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,869
You laughed.
You laughed for real this time.

633
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,809
Yes.

634
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:22,590
Something is up, right?

635
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:31,760
I actually went to see that woman,
Kwon Myung Hee, earlier today.

636
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:35,599
Hey.

637
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:38,099
And she told me...

638
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:42,000
not to delude myself into thinking
that I'd always be special to you...

639
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,710
because your feelings for me
would fizzle out very soon.

640
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:49,849
So I told her...

641
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:53,480
that she had no idea
what it meant to truly care for someone.

642
00:36:54,179 --> 00:36:56,219
I walked out,
acting like it didn't even faze me.

643
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:01,789
But I guess I was scared too.

644
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:09,030
You're always
in the center of the crowd.

645
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,599
(You sparkle.)

646
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,739
(And my job is to make sure
you can always shine.)

647
00:37:16,309 --> 00:37:18,070
So I wondered...

648
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:22,309
if I had been deluding myself
like that woman said.

649
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,489
Do you remember the day we first met?

650
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,599
In the theater?
Where we watched Eun Si Woo's movie?

651
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,429
Yes. That day.

652
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:50,639
That was my first time
watching a movie starring her.

653
00:37:51,139 --> 00:37:52,480
It was a school assignment.

654
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:58,280
I must say, her acting was so good.
To the point that it made me envious.

655
00:37:58,949 --> 00:38:01,750
I was trying my best
not to storm out of the theater.

656
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,219
But suddenly,

657
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,429
she started bawling
because her son died in the movie.

658
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:13,260
I was livid.

659
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,800
"How could she cry like that
when she abandoned her own son?"

660
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,300
"That's fake."

661
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,369
But that moment, some girl
in the theater started to wail.

662
00:38:23,409 --> 00:38:25,340
Out of the blue,
as if the world was ending.

663
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,250
So I struck up a conversation,
which I never do.

664
00:38:30,949 --> 00:38:33,380
"Was it that sad?
You cried your eyes out."

665
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:35,420
(Let's not mess with someone
who has to...)

666
00:38:35,449 --> 00:38:37,389
(- retake her exams, okay?)
- But...

667
00:38:37,989 --> 00:38:39,460
that girl said...

668
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,329
she cried because
she didn't want to retake the CSAT.

669
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,389
She couldn't even focus on the movie.

670
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,730
What?

671
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,099
You made me laugh for a while.

672
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:51,469
Even the legendary actress'
performance...

673
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,840
couldn't distract a CSAT repeater
from her desperation.

674
00:39:06,679 --> 00:39:08,320
I think that was when it all began.

675
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,690
That was the moment I fell for you.

676
00:39:15,659 --> 00:39:16,690
What?

677
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,630
Whenever I went to the theater,
I checked if that girl was there...

678
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,170
but never saw her again at the theater,
which made me so sad.

679
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,769
I prayed that she wouldn't have to
take the exam for the third time.

680
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:34,780
So when I ran into you at school,
I was really happy to see you again.

681
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,010
The name I always wanted to know.

682
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,119
Her name was Oh Han Byeol.

683
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,119
On top of that, she ended up
working at the agency I signed with.

684
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:50,530
You should've been nice to me.
Why did you always pick on me?

685
00:39:52,829 --> 00:39:54,059
That's what guys do, you know.

686
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:57,329
When they like someone,
they tease and bully them.

687
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,969
Not realizing what it is
that they're feeling, like idiots.

688
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,309
Come on.
That's what elementary school boys do.

689
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:09,480
I never had a chance to do that
when I was in elementary school.

690
00:40:30,199 --> 00:40:31,800
Having you by my side...

691
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,139
felt so natural...

692
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,610
that it took me this long to realize...

693
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,880
that you're my first and last love.

694
00:40:46,179 --> 00:40:47,719
That will never change.

695
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,989
Never, ever.

696
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:53,960
So please...

697
00:40:57,190 --> 00:40:58,559
keep liking me.

698
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,070
Okay.

699
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:14,539
Gosh, my beautiful Han Byeol. Come here.

700
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,269
(Restricted Number,
Someone around you hates you.)

00:42:22,309 --> 00:42:24,179
(Here's my proof.)

(Someone around you hates you.)

705
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:38,429
(Warning!
Don't be fooled by a kind face.)

706
00:42:57,849 --> 00:43:01,050
It makes my heart flutter.
I like you, Yu Sung.

707
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,309
Ms. Park Ho Young.

708
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:27,980
Can we talk?

709
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:31,909
Sure.

710
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:32,920
("Time for Unrequited Love")

711
00:43:32,949 --> 00:43:34,150
Here. This came in for Yu Sung.

712
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:36,789
They sent it to me by accident.

713
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,159
The thing is, I've been eyeing it
for Jae Hyeon.

714
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,989
But since they approached Yu Sung first,

715
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,590
I suggest you go over it fast and decide
before I snatch it up.

716
00:43:47,159 --> 00:43:49,869
Okay. Thank you.

717
00:43:50,230 --> 00:43:52,739
All right. That's it for work stuff.

718
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,409
Ho Young.

719
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,780
I'm sorry for everything.

720
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:07,219
I can't give you my answer right away
because I'm still not quite sure...

721
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,489
how I feel.

722
00:44:11,789 --> 00:44:14,820
I'll listen to my heart
and try to understand my feelings...

723
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,329
so I can give you my answer soon.

724
00:44:21,159 --> 00:44:22,159
Okay.

725
00:44:22,829 --> 00:44:25,829
So stop running away from me.
It breaks my heart to see that.

726
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,840
Okay. I won't run away from you.

727
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:38,650
Oh, this isn't me running away.

728
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,349
I'm just leaving the room.

729
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:43,289
Okay, all right.

730
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,030
She's so cute.

731
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:27,199
Hey, Jung Yeol!

732
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:30,269
Tae Sung.

733
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:32,099
Why are you so startled?

734
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,500
I thought you were an illusion.

735
00:45:35,739 --> 00:45:37,010
Why are you here?

736
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,869
Did something happen?

737
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,809
Did you drive yourself here?

738
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,280
What if you got into an accident?
You should've called for me.

739
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:44,550
Gosh, stop nagging me.

740
00:45:44,949 --> 00:45:46,349
You'll make my ears bleed.

741
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,039
Tae Sung.

742
00:46:08,539 --> 00:46:09,639
Aren't you coming?

00:46:09,769 --> 00:46:10,840

(Warning!

746
00:46:15,610 --> 00:46:16,679
I am.

747
00:46:20,179 --> 00:46:22,079
Hello, Mr. Gong.

748
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,289
Goodbye.

749
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,590
Oh, right.

750
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:29,559
I'm not running away.

751
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,630
I'm just rushing because of
an urgent business.

752
00:46:32,059 --> 00:46:33,199
Bye then.

753
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:40,000
You should get back to work too.

754
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,269
I came for personal matters today.

755
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:43,409
Okay.

756
00:46:43,469 --> 00:46:44,940
Call me whenever you need me.

757
00:47:11,829 --> 00:47:13,840
- Hello, Tae Sung.
- Hello.

758
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,599
Hey.

759
00:47:15,699 --> 00:47:18,039
I think it's my first time
seeing you here.

760
00:47:18,639 --> 00:47:20,710
It finally feels like we are
in the same agency now.

761
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,739
(Kang Yu Sung)

762
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,949
It's nice seeing you.

763
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:27,780
Both of you...

764
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,719
have an employee access card.

765
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,460
It's because we always use
the practice room in the basement.

766
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:35,320
Plus it gives us a sense of belonging.

767
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,829
If we lose this,
it'll cost us 10,000 won to reissue it.

768
00:47:39,929 --> 00:47:41,099
I see.

769
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:45,769
- The fourth one.
- Okay.

770
00:47:46,269 --> 00:47:47,699
It worked out... My gosh.

771
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,570
Goodness, Mr. Gong!

772
00:47:49,610 --> 00:47:50,840
- My gosh.
- Gosh, Mr. Gong.

773
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,440
It's you.

774
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,079
Ms. Oh isn't in the office right now.

775
00:47:57,210 --> 00:48:00,449
It's so nice to see you here.
You haven't come by in a while.

776
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:04,150
It's been emotionally taxing
for you recently, right?

777
00:48:04,449 --> 00:48:07,489
We're always on your side,
so don't worry.

778
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,360
Right.

779
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,599
Thank you.

780
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,190
Yu Sung.

781
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,789
Tae Sung. When did you get here?

782
00:48:40,289 --> 00:48:41,820
What are you thinking about so deeply?

783
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,659
Something happened, right?

784
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,139
The thing is...

785
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,809
Someone...

786
00:48:58,639 --> 00:48:59,840
sent me this.

787
00:49:04,849 --> 00:49:06,719
(Someone around you hates you.)

788
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,260
Long time no see.

789
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:24,269
I was slightly disappointed that I could
no longer see you at the staircase.

790
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:29,300
You're a great liar.
It must be because you're a lawyer.

791
00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:33,139
Thank you for the compliment.
Have a good one.

792
00:49:46,119 --> 00:49:48,619
Are you trying to find out
the passcode for my home?

793
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:50,090
That's not going to happen.

794
00:49:51,059 --> 00:49:53,730
What use would your passcode be to me?

795
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,929
Then what is it?

796
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,969
Do you also...

797
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:02,699
happen to have a Starforce...

798
00:50:04,309 --> 00:50:05,440
employee access card?

799
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:10,610
You mean this?

800
00:50:16,949 --> 00:50:18,489
Coffee? Tea?

801
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:21,420
Coffee.

802
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,090
Hot or iced americano?

803
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:25,789
A latte.

804
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,360
Latte, okay.

805
00:50:39,139 --> 00:50:40,440
That felt natural.

806
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,710
It's going to be good.

807
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,130
Amazing.

808
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,630
Why are you here? This isn't a cafe.

809
00:51:14,679 --> 00:51:16,949
If it's for a legal consultation
you won't get one.

810
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:18,880
It's past 6pm.

811
00:51:23,849 --> 00:51:25,750
Are you a hater of mine?

812
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,460
What?

813
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,599
That's why you're suspicious of me?

814
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:40,440
You have plenty of reasons to hate me...

815
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,969
and you own a Starforce
employee access card.

816
00:51:45,369 --> 00:51:46,980
You even moved next door to me.

817
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,510
Enough about that darned topic.

818
00:51:50,250 --> 00:51:52,010
Maybe I should just move.

819
00:51:53,380 --> 00:51:54,519
Am I wrong?

820
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:58,119
What kind of hater
would publicly announce that fact?

821
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:01,760
It seems as if you're hoping it's me.

822
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,190
But if I really was your hater,

823
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:08,860
wouldn't this be an extremely dangerous
situation for you?

824
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,280
Good point.

825
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:27,150
My gosh, I'm in grave danger. How scary.

826
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:30,949
That's lame.

827
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:33,590
Can you just go home now?

828
00:52:34,659 --> 00:52:38,159
If you don't leave in five, you'll earn
yourself a legally insightful hater.

829
00:52:39,929 --> 00:52:41,500
I was about to leave anyway.

830
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,900
Do you know what haters enjoy the most?

831
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:55,510
It's making the opponent
tremble in anxiety.

832
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:58,909
One could easily make
a fake employee access card.

833
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:02,219
I have many people who hate me too.

834
00:53:03,849 --> 00:53:06,389
They even have
an anti-Do Soo Hyuk club now.

835
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:11,289
Don't react as if that's expected.

836
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,360
Just sleep in the time
you have to worry.

837
00:53:18,329 --> 00:53:19,570
Okay.

838
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,099
Thank you, I guess.

839
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:25,539
I didn't say this so you could thank me.

840
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,360
"All Gong Downhill"?

841
00:53:48,130 --> 00:53:49,659
What a ridiculous name.

842
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,329
I'll start by investigating this first.

843
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:57,739
I feel like bad things keep happening
to Tae Sung. It worries me.

844
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:00,309
I think seeing
the employee access card...

845
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:01,679
was a big emotional hit to him.

846
00:54:01,710 --> 00:54:04,010
He's worried there may be another
like Kwon Myung Hee.

847
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:08,019
We can't assume it's our employee
from just that picture.

848
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,219
Stealing an id card isn't all that hard.

849
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:12,389
Or it might even be a former employee.

850
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:16,929
He never smiles at me.

851
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,760
But he's smiling so big in the picture.

852
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,559
I couldn't help myself.

853
00:54:22,230 --> 00:54:23,530
I was so angry.

854
00:54:27,039 --> 00:54:29,969
Even the email address used
to contact the reporters is scary.

855
00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,110
How can you use "Smile Boy"
to send a hate email?

856
00:54:34,309 --> 00:54:35,480
Hold on.

857
00:54:35,809 --> 00:54:37,010
Let me check the email again.

858
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:38,949
(A-lister Gong Tae Sung's
Steamy Midnight Rendezvous)

859
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,320
(Have a good day then.)

860
00:54:45,019 --> 00:54:48,219
(Have a good day then.)

861
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,559
I have to go somewhere.

862
00:55:06,610 --> 00:55:10,150
(I'm the one who reported
about Gong Tae Sung's secret lover.)

863
00:55:12,679 --> 00:55:14,550
(I think I know...)

864
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,050
(who the woman in the picture is.)

865
00:55:18,119 --> 00:55:19,190
(Send)

866
00:55:19,719 --> 00:55:23,059
(The mail has been sent.)

867
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,389
I'm on my way now.

868
00:55:26,659 --> 00:55:30,369
Tae Sung. I'm on my way,
but I'm caught in traffic.

869
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:32,829
Then come to the first floor
instead of the underground parking lot.

870
00:55:32,869 --> 00:55:35,139
(- Okay.)
- All right.

871
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:02,530
(Didn't I tell you not to be fooled
by a kind face?)

872
00:56:18,050 --> 00:56:19,380
(Here's my proof.)

873
00:56:21,579 --> 00:56:22,880
Someone sent me this message.

874
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,730
(Someone around you hates you.)

875
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:31,630
(Warning!
Don't be fooled by a kind face.)

(Kang Min Kyu)

879
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:40,860
Mr. Kang. Hello.

880
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:42,760
Mr. Han just left.

881
00:57:43,159 --> 00:57:44,369
I see.

882
00:57:47,639 --> 00:57:48,699
Hey.

883
00:57:49,670 --> 00:57:53,210
Why don't you stop with the act,
Smile Boy?

884
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,480
You punk.

885
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:08,090
- He's here.
- There he is.

886
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:10,190
- Please say something.
- Is it true you're dating Eun Si Woo?

887
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:13,090
Is it true that Eun Si Woo got divorced
because of you?

888
00:58:13,130 --> 00:58:14,429
Were you having an affair?

889
00:58:14,530 --> 00:58:15,960
Please say a word.

890
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,130
- Please tell us the truth.
- Please say a word.

891
00:58:21,639 --> 00:58:23,940
(Did Eun Si Woo get a divorce
because of you?)

892
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:25,769
(Tell us.)

893
00:58:25,809 --> 00:58:28,610
Is it true that you two are dating?

894
00:58:28,639 --> 00:58:31,050
- Please say a word.
- Tell us about it.

895
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:33,579
What's your relationship with her?

896
00:58:39,449 --> 00:58:41,559
- Why did you do that?
- Why did you...

897
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:44,289
smile like that?

898
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:50,269
- Tell us about it.
- What's your relationship with her?

899
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:53,400
- Please say a word.
- Were you having an affair?

900
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,539
- Is it true?
- Was it not an affair?

901
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,010
- Please tell us the truth.
- My goodness.

902
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,579
- Is it true?
- What's your relationship with her?

903
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:03,179
Is it true that you two are dating?

904
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,409
- Please say a word.
- When did it start?

905
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:22,630
I'm relieved.

906
00:59:24,170 --> 00:59:25,500
I don't think...

907
00:59:26,670 --> 00:59:28,070
you're the one, Han Byeol.

908
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:38,710
(Year 2015)

909
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:43,750
(Epilogue)

910
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:48,159
You're not staying for the preview
of your own movie?

911
00:59:49,659 --> 00:59:51,860
Don't you think you're irresponsible
as an actor?

912
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:00,500
I'm irresponsible?

913
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:03,570
What about you?

914
01:00:05,039 --> 01:00:06,739
Why did you come here?

915
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:11,380
I'm your mom. Why can't I come
and watch my son's movie?

916
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,980
Gosh. You're being so cold.

917
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:17,949
You don't deserve...

918
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:20,960
to call yourself a mom.

919
01:00:23,929 --> 01:00:26,329
Mr. Kang.
Please stop her from following me.

920
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,440
Mr. Gong.

921
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:40,880
Shall we grab a beer outside?

922
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,940
- My goodness.
- Hurry up.

923
01:01:11,969 --> 01:01:14,739
- Let's go.
- Goodness.

924
01:01:15,139 --> 01:01:16,280
It's so cold.

925
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:17,909
Hey.

926
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,820
- It's Gong Tae Sung.
- Where?

927
01:01:20,849 --> 01:01:23,349
Gosh, you're so handsome.

928
01:01:23,380 --> 01:01:26,190
Goodness. Anyone can become
a celebrity these days.

929
01:01:26,219 --> 01:01:27,489
Do you think he's handsome?

930
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:30,489
- What are you doing?
- Move. Who do you think you are?

931
01:01:30,559 --> 01:01:32,960
- What are you...
- Hey.

932
01:01:32,989 --> 01:01:34,059
Gosh.

933
01:01:35,829 --> 01:01:36,929
Come in.

934
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,670
Hello, Tae Sung.

935
01:01:43,769 --> 01:01:44,840
Well...

936
01:01:46,710 --> 01:01:48,239
Are you okay?

937
01:01:48,340 --> 01:01:50,110
I'm fine.

938
01:01:58,590 --> 01:02:01,820
Why did you let them beat you up?

939
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:03,760
You said you were a good fighter.

940
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:07,460
If I hit them even just once,
it becomes mutual assault.

941
01:02:08,059 --> 01:02:10,300
You shouldn't get involved in this.

942
01:02:10,869 --> 01:02:14,269
Also, it shouldn't affect our movie
that will be released soon.

943
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:16,599
You've worked so hard
to shoot the movie.

944
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:19,570
I'm resilient to physical pains.

945
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:26,650
Come in.

946
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,380
You're here.

947
01:02:33,289 --> 01:02:35,090
It's worse than I thought.

948
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:36,920
I'm fine.

949
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,340
Why are you laughing?

950
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,469
Did you hurt your head too?

951
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:53,570
No.

952
01:02:56,309 --> 01:02:59,610
Well, Tae Sung called me...

953
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,219
Yu Sung.

954
01:03:05,719 --> 01:03:06,920
He called me Yu Sung.

(People are not interested
in the truth.)

958

(Hating a celebrity is a crime now?)

(How can you do this?)

961

01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:17,360
(who wants to see
Gong Tae Sung go down.)

970

(I'm No Da Hyun.)

You know what?

976
01:04:31,909 --> 01:04:33,710
(It's always hard
when you do it for the first time.)

977
