00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,490
Which side of my face looks better?
Right or left?

10
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,119
You look best from the front.

11
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,359
Han Byeol. How about we sign with her?

12
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:58,259
No. She's got everything going for her
but lacks one thing.

13
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:00,030
- What would that be?
- Good character.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,729
She'll cause trouble down the road.

15
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:03,840
She says she's a sweetheart.

16
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:06,700
A sweetheart
straight out of the fiery pit.

17
00:01:06,939 --> 00:01:08,739
I got an offer from two drama projects.

18
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:11,310
For one of them,
I don't get along with the director.

19
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,010
For the other one, it's the writer.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,209
Which one should I pick?

21
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,079
You have to pick one of the two, right?

22
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,319
- Yes.
- Then I suggest you pick the first one.

23
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,150
Last time, you argued with the writer...

24
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:21,790
and got killed off in the fifth episode.

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,390
- Right.
- This time, stay alive until the end.

Oh Han Byeol's counseling service
is back in force.

28
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:31,900
Look at the long line.

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:34,700
- "Counseling service"?
- That's right. She's known...

30
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:37,299
for her eloquence
and problem-solving skills.

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,069
Look. Even people from other agencies
come to see her.

32
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:45,040
I'm done for the day. I have work to do.

33

- Goodbye.
- Bye.

35

- Let's get some work done too.
- Okay.

36
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:07,030
I seem to be in a good mood?

37
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:10,199
You seem to be in a good mood.

38
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:13,240
That puts me in a bad mood.

39
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,849
I'm such an idiot.

40
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:25,379
Why didn't I bite back right away?

41
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,050

Darn it. Why is he three days early?

45
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:42,099
I was so surprised
when he suddenly showed up.

46
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:44,840
He didn't want to be photographed

Look at all those cameras.
I guess they're not used to take photos?

Well...

51

Call it a beautiful ending
to his volunteer work in Africa.

52

(Actor Gong Tae Sung

55

Hello, I'm actor Gong Tae Sung.

56
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,639
Tae Sung,
you've gotten even more handsome.

57
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:52,500
Despite Africa's strong sun,

58
00:03:52,539 --> 00:03:54,340
your skin is still so fair and flawless.

59
00:03:54,370 --> 00:03:56,439
I always made sure
to plaster sunscreen on my face.

60
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,810
Even on my legs,
which is why they look so pasty now.

61
00:04:00,379 --> 00:04:04,150
I think the most rewarding moment
was when we found the water vein.

62
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,879
The locals finally have access
to clean water.

63
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:10,189
I was especially glad
to have helped the children there.

64
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:13,159
The biggest lesson
I learned over there was...

65
00:04:13,789 --> 00:04:16,089
the preciousness of the things
I used to take for granted.

66
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,399
Clean water. Having clothes...

67
00:04:19,529 --> 00:04:22,269
and shoes to wear
and food to fill my stomach.

68
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,839
I learned that things
I had taken for granted...

69
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:27,009
were not naturally available
to everyone.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,139
I also realized that I should be better
to everyone around me...

71
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:33,110
whom I might have taken for granted.

72
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:36,579
All your love and support.

73
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,120
I will never take it for granted.

74
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:41,990
And I will work even harder as an actor.

75
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:51,500

so I can continue...

to seeing you in your cheery mood.

Tae Sung, I've told you about him.

He's your new manager. He's a smart kid.

83

Yes, I am. I will work hard.

84
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,699
Watch me.

85
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,509

Darn it.

95
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:52,079
What? Is something bothering you?

96
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:54,509
Just relax and focus on work.

97
00:08:08,089 --> 00:08:09,129
What?

98
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,600
Was this a secret meeting?

99
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,300
Were you going to bad-mouth me?

100
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,199
Just relax and carry on.

101
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,639
You went over your lunch break
by 30 minutes.

102
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,980
Are you here to lounge around?

103
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,180
We had a meeting.

104
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,920
Then you should've informed me
beforehand.

105
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,590
Hey!

106
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,200
This is your fifth cup.
You're addicted to caffeine.

107
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:49,100
From now on,
don't go over two cups a day.

108
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,399
Nice.

I can't poop when I'm on the clock?

111

Hey, don't be a jerk
about my constipation.

112
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:10,720
I didn't say anything.

Gosh, no.

116
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:26,840
How could you ask me
to take down my article...

117
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:28,840
just because the actor is upset?

118
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,279
Are you saying we should write articles
to please your actors?

119
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,309
No. I can't take it down.

120
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,149
That's right. I can't...

121
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:40,179
Did he hang up on me?

122
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,460
Will a big sigh like that
magically bring you a big scoop?

123
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Your name means "joy,"
but you always look so miserable.

to brighten things up a little.

137
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:43,710
I heard you earlier.
You don't have to do it again.

138
00:10:43,779 --> 00:10:44,980
You can just relax.

139
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,480
Okay. Thank you.

140
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:47,549
Sure.

141
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,289
You rose to attention
immediately upon your debut.

142
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,590
How does that feel?

143
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:55,230
I'm over the moon these days.
I'm so grateful.

144
00:10:55,289 --> 00:10:58,000
All I did was put a spoon
on the table...

145
00:10:58,059 --> 00:10:59,500
when the staff did all the work...

146
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,429
I see. Lastly,

147
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,200
if you want to say something
to your fans,

148
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,740
- please go ahead.
- Sure.

149
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:09,570
I want to shower my fans
with my happy energy...

150
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:11,809
so they can feel happy when they see me.

Okay, Happy. Thank you for your time.

- Thank you.
- Thank you.

Ms. Cho.

155
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,320
You look very tired.

163
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,509
Sure. Of course.

164
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:48,710
I'll send my happy energy your way
every day.

165
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,950
Please write a nice article for me.

166
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,419
Sure thing. I'll write a good one.

167
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,580
Thank you.

168
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,049
Let's take a picture together.

169
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:01,330
I'll move forward.

170
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,490
No, it's okay. Let me.

171
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:04,659
- Okay!
- There.

172
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,230
Be happy!

173
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:07,399
(Happy!)

174
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:08,899
(Happy!)

175
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:10,500
(Happy made me smile today.)

176
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,200
(She taught me
not to be so pessimistic.)

177
00:12:18,809 --> 00:12:19,909
Min Kyu.

178
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,080
Yes, Ms. Oh.

179
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,120
Are you here for coffee?

180
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:27,379
But you already had
two cups of coffee today.

181
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:29,889
Come on.
Are you going to be like this now too?

182
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,159
Have this when he's not here.

183
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,019
Thank you.

184
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,289
You smile a lot, Min Kyu.

185
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:36,759
What? I do?

186
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,860
Yes, all the time.

187
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,970
- Isn't Gong stressing you out?
- No, not at all.

188
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,029
He's very good to me.

189
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:45,200
Goodness. It's easy for you to smile,

190
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,399
but you're not so honest.

191
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,509
I think you're truly amazing, Ms. Oh.

192
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:53,809
I can't afford the settlement money,
so I have to hold myself back.

193
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:57,149
Come on. You two seem pretty close.

194
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,889
Smiling is easy for you, but you can't
read relationship dynamics.

195
00:13:01,549 --> 00:13:03,190
When is he going home?

196
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:05,460
I think he'll stay in the office
until everyone leaves.

197
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,259
So annoying...

198
00:13:16,429 --> 00:13:18,100
- Hey.
- You sent us the press release...

199
00:13:18,139 --> 00:13:19,899
- about Jung Jin Hyuk's photoshoot.
(- Yes.)

200
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,470
It's our newbie's first press release.

201
00:13:22,309 --> 00:13:23,909
There's a problem.

Where did the eight go?

204
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,970
My gosh. I'm so sorry, Ms. Oh.
What is wrong with me?

205
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,700
Forget it.
Send out a correction email now.

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,870
Okay.

00:14:07,419 --> 00:14:09,049
It's me, Oh Han Byeol from Starforce.

211
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,289
Yes.

212
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,220
A newbie on my team made a mistake.

213
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,360
Yes. Please add in the number eight.

214
00:14:14,629 --> 00:14:15,659
Yes, that's right.

215

Bye.

Come on. Hurry.

223

224
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,919
Oh, my.

225
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,230
Look at you, Oh Han Byeol.
You're a boss lady now.

226
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:50,889
Hey, newbie.

227
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,960
Do you know what your boss did?

228
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,629
Back in the day,
she said I was the national...

229
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,809
I guess you don't want to be embarrassed
in front of them.

230
00:15:06,309 --> 00:15:08,679
Hey, Gong.
Why can't you just let things go?

231
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,649
I apologized to you
at least a thousand times.

232
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,779
It's been six years!

233

even after 600 years.

235
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:20,690
I still can't get a good night's sleep
because of that.

Is that so?

237
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,500
- Then I will...
- What?

238
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,299
I will apologize.

239
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm very sorry about what I did...

240
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,840
six years ago.

241
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,679
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

242
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:43,710
- Yes!
- Drink up!

243
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,250
I'm such an idiot.

244
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,720
I practically advertised my idiocy
with that press release.

245
00:15:53,389 --> 00:15:55,659
It's okay, Bo In.

246
00:15:55,690 --> 00:15:57,590
Then I should be called a fool.

247
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,000
A long time ago,

248
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:01,730
I was supposed to write,
"Kim Young Min, a Fool for His Son."

249
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,799
But I forgot the last part.

250
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,039
So it became "Kim Young Min, a Fool."

251
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,169
Hey, come on. My blunder trumps yours.

252
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:10,370
When I was a total rookie,

253
00:16:10,409 --> 00:16:12,340
I represented Eun Si Woo,
the legendary actress.

254
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:13,639
Okay.

255
00:16:13,679 --> 00:16:14,850
She's retired now.

256
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:17,549
I made a typo in a press release
for her travel show.

257
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:20,120
You know what I did?
Instead of "Grand Canyon,"

258
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:21,220
I wrote "Grand Crap."

259
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:23,789
"Top Actress Eun Si Woo
Goes to Grand Crap..."

260
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,120
"And Sheds Tears in Awe."

261
00:16:26,559 --> 00:16:27,620
Amazing.

262
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:29,659
- You're really something.
- Right?

263
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,990
Now, I can laugh about it.

264
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:31,830
When that happened,

265
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,429
it felt like all my blood
was being drained out.

266
00:16:34,470 --> 00:16:37,840
The comments were saying,
"How can crap be so grand?"

267
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:39,440
It was really crazy back then.

268
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:43,009
Why don't we, the fools,
take some pictures together?

269
00:16:43,039 --> 00:16:44,580
- That's a great idea.
- Okay.

270
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,909
All right. In 1, 2...

By the way,

276
00:16:57,289 --> 00:16:59,320
about Ms. Oh and Actor Gong...

277
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,019
What do you think about them?

278
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,559
I thought they were just close,

279
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:05,059
but I noticed that there was
something fishy about them.

280
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,930
There's something between them, right?

281
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,970
They look like they are bickering,
but strangely enough,

282
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,799
It feels like there's affection
between them.

283

Breaking news. What's up with
the top actor Gong Tae Sung...

(Breaking news. Top actor Gong Tae Sung
and Oh Han Byeol's relationship?)

286
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:19,579
- I don't know.
- What was that?

287
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,809
Maybe, they are secretly...

288
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,650
in a relationship?

289
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,650
Last time,

290
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:32,289
I saw Tae Sung
whispering to her affectionately.

291
00:17:33,089 --> 00:17:35,690
Gosh, it can't be. You must be mistaken.

292
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,130
Maybe he was saying bad things
but looked handsome and kind?

293
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,900
Think about it.
If they really were dating,

294
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,430
would they be doing that in our team?

295
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:42,269
It's so obvious.

296
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:43,599
- It can't be.
- Right?

297
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:45,670
- It doesn't make sense, right?
- Did they want to be together all day?

298
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,769
- What?
- No?

299
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:49,910
Right. That can't be right.

300
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,039
Oh, right.
Ms. Oh recently had a blind date.

301
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,950
On the day when
Jang Seok Woo's scandal broke.

302
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:57,480
Oh, right. I get it now.

303
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:59,650
If Gong Tae Sung is the boyfriend,

304
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,450
who would go out and have a blind date?

305
00:18:03,289 --> 00:18:05,220
Then what's their relationship?

306
00:18:05,259 --> 00:18:07,059
Are they really holding grudges?

307
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:10,029
Earlier, when Tae Sung
said something to her,

308
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:12,130
Ms. Oh was startled and took him out.

309
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,730
He was saying national something
before she stopped him.

310
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,970
National something?

311
00:18:17,970 --> 00:18:19,569
- National...
- Gosh, you startled me!

312
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:22,410
Goodness, Team Manager Han.

313
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,140
What was that? My goodness.

314
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,180
What? Team Manager Han?

315
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:30,180
Mi Nyu, you really need to
get with the times.

316
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,480
He's CEO Han Dae Soo of DS Actors.

317
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,890
He was the Team Manager
of Management 2 until 3 months ago.

318
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,490
You know Sim Jin Woo? He left with him.

319
00:18:38,789 --> 00:18:40,789
Hello. I'm Hong Bo In.

320
00:18:40,819 --> 00:18:42,460
Hong Bo In? That's your name?

321
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:45,930
Gosh, I got chills.
Your name is Hong Bo In?

322
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,029
You can introduce yourself
with your name.

323
00:18:48,069 --> 00:18:49,529
That's so amazing.

(Tae Sung looked like a mess back then.)

414

And that's when he got something
that he shouldn't have.

415
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,980
What did he get? He got PTSD.

416
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:05,480
There are people everywhere,

417
00:24:05,519 --> 00:24:08,819
and he thinks that they're all looking
at his private parts.

418

Since then, Tae Sung has been
making Han Byeol miserable.

My goodness. He held a grudge
until now because of that?

421
00:24:20,029 --> 00:24:22,200
Tae Sung can hold a grudge
for quite a long time.

422

It's been already six years.

423
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,440
In fact, this helped
the promotion of the movie...

424
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,839
- and it sold over ten million tickets.
- Right.

425
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:27,839
I know.

426
00:24:27,869 --> 00:24:29,940
I hoped he might stop talking about it
when he came back from Africa.

427
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,240
When I have nightmares,

428
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,109
Tae Sung appears
and tries to unzip his pants.

429
00:24:33,509 --> 00:24:36,710
It's a dream,
but he never fully unzips his pants.

430
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,480
He doesn't cross the line
even in a dream.

431
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:40,980
Is it rated G or what?

432
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:43,319
- Let's just drink.
- Cheers.

433
00:24:48,190 --> 00:24:51,329
By the way,
is he really staying at the office...

434
00:24:51,359 --> 00:24:53,359
as soon as he came back
because of that incident?

435
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,529
It sort of bothers me to have him
around the office.

436
00:24:56,569 --> 00:24:59,799
Isn't it consuming for him too?
He must be tired as well.

437
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,940
Well, that's...

438

You have something, right?

439
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:09,509
- What do you mean?
- Didn't you know?

440
00:25:10,750 --> 00:25:13,619
She's the reason why
Tae Sung went to Africa.

You sent not just any man
but Gong Tae Sung to Africa.

444

I've never done something like that yet.

445
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:26,400
I should work harder.

446
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,630
Wasn't that just a rumor?

447
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,269
Am I the dove of peace or what?

448
00:25:30,299 --> 00:25:31,529
How could I send him to Africa?

449

Hey, tell it like it is.

450
00:25:33,269 --> 00:25:35,009
A mere dove can't do it.

451
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,339

His next project?

462
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,789

I think he'll pick
Writer Shin Yoon Hee's new drama.

466

That's huge.

467

I'm jealous.

470

Seok Woo wanted to be
in that drama so badly.

471
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,440
It'll probably be finalized
at the meeting tomorrow.

472

This drama is awesome.

473

There's no reason for him
to turn it down.

487
00:27:00,589 --> 00:27:02,730
You should choose this drama.

488
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,690
Everyone else is dying for the role.

489

Hey, Park Ho Young.

I suppose you heard
Tae Sung turned it down.

495
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,549
Sorry to disappoint you,
but you're a tad late.

496
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:29,289
No, I'm not late at all.

497
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,720
Jin Woo will do it.

498
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,390
So don't waste your time and energy.

499
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,930
Go over there and sit in a corner
like a pretty flower.

You're the one
who's wasting your energy here.

501

513
00:28:36,289 --> 00:28:37,950

to be an actor.

514

Oh Han Byeol, this slacker!

601
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,319
I finally get a little break.

602
00:33:39,359 --> 00:33:41,259
I can breathe
now that Tae Sung is not here.

603

I wish he had a photoshoot every day.

604

Life's been so stressful these days.

605

The other day, he went on about
the archeologist thing again.

606
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:53,339
I should've gotten fired back then.

607

I've put up with him for too long.

608
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,539
I couldn't tell you this back then,

609

but Tae Sung saved you.

610
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,579
Don't you dare fire Oh Han Byeol.

611
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,809
Don't fire her, okay?

612
00:34:05,049 --> 00:34:07,049
How would I look
if you fired her over that thing?

613
00:34:07,319 --> 00:34:08,420
All right.

614
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,590
Also,

615
00:34:11,989 --> 00:34:14,190
don't scold her anymore. I'm fine now.

616
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:16,760
Okay, I won't.

617
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,630
(He did that? Why?)

618
00:34:19,829 --> 00:34:20,800
Tae Sung, you're so...

619
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:21,960
I will not let her get fired.

620
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,070
That's too easy.

621
00:34:23,469 --> 00:34:26,239
I'm going to bully her
and make her suffer.

622
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:28,809
Oh Han Byeol.

623
00:34:30,210 --> 00:34:32,039
I will make your life miserable.

624
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:37,880
I guess he did it out of...

625
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,650
- affection for his colleague?
- Affection?

626
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,980
As if.

627
00:34:41,019 --> 00:34:42,590
Are you twisting your memories?

628
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,019
What's important is that
we're still working together, right?

629
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,489
Shouldn't you be at the set?

630
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,190
No, not today.

631
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,860
I want him to get to know Min Kyu.

632
00:34:52,900 --> 00:34:55,360
I like Min Kyu.
He's smiley and cheerful.

633
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:56,670
Are they still awkward?

634
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,199
It'll take some time.

635
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:00,400
Tae Sung doesn't like that
he smiles all the time.

636
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,170
Would he prefer it if he always cried?

637
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,210
He's so picky.

638
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,840
It's hard for him to trust people,
you know.

639
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,849
Jung Yeol is so good
at printing stuff now.

640
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,820
I bet he's the best in our office.

641
00:35:14,349 --> 00:35:15,989
When will you let him work in the field?

642
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:17,690
I'll have to wait and see.

643
00:35:18,489 --> 00:35:21,019
It's very nice to meet you, Tae Sung.

644
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,960
Likewise.

645
00:35:23,829 --> 00:35:26,599
What did you want to do the most
once you returned?

646
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:30,230
Because I had such a strict routine,

647
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:32,239
I had been dying to sleep in.

648
00:35:32,639 --> 00:35:35,070
I'm not sure if it's because of jet lag,

649
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,739
but I keep waking up at dawn.

650
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,309
I feel like a farmer
waking up to work the field.

651
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:42,380
That's why I've been going
into the office.

652
00:35:42,409 --> 00:35:44,780
My gosh. Are you General Manager Gong
in real life now?

653
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:47,780
Just like the characters you played?

654
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,750
Not exactly. How do I put this?

655
00:35:49,949 --> 00:35:52,920
It's more laid back than that.
I have an open door policy.

656
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:54,389
I get coffee with people too.

657
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,159
That sounds like the dream job.

658
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,199
You must enjoy going to work.

659
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:00,730
Yes, of course.

660
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,929
Our team has it good because of him.

661
00:36:05,429 --> 00:36:09,039
Mr. Gong. Are you aware of the term
"E.S. Gong"?

662
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,269
"E.S. Gong"?

663
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:15,139
It's short for,
"Every script goes to Gong."

664
00:36:15,179 --> 00:36:17,380
Gosh, you're tooting my horn again.

665
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,219
You are too kind.

666
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,690
This term is proof that...

667
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:25,389
many are waiting for your next project.

668
00:36:25,659 --> 00:36:29,159
When will we get to see you act again?

669
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,199
My opinion is important when it comes
to choosing a new project.

670
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,869
But I also enjoy laughing and talking...

671
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,670
with my team as we discuss
potential projects.

672
00:36:38,769 --> 00:36:41,400
We believe Shin Yoon Hee's new drama,
"The World of Stars"...

673
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:42,409
I'm not doing it.

674
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,579
I want to enjoy this a little more.

675
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,750
I heard the role for the male lead
in Ms. Shin's new drama...

676
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:52,179
will either go to Seok Woo or Jin Woo.

677
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,420
Aren't you disappointed?

678
00:36:53,449 --> 00:36:55,889
I think it was because of me,
so I feel iffy about it.

679
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,289
I think Mr. Choi is upset too.

680
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,329
Tae Sung. Come on in.

681
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,230
I didn't say no because of Han Byeol,
so don't get on her case.

682
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,400
Whatever I do,
I'll make sure it pays a lot.

683
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:11,130
I don't think you have to worry.

684
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:14,769
You know how Tae Sung is.
Nobody can tell him what to do.

685
00:37:15,739 --> 00:37:18,070
There's something I learned
from this job.

686
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:19,739
Everyone has their own role.

687
00:37:19,780 --> 00:37:21,610
Being anxious won't get you anywhere.

688
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:24,210
This job has turned you into Gandhi.

689
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,550
I'm serious.

690
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:30,119
It's amazing how we all have our roles.

691
00:37:35,829 --> 00:37:39,000
(Wait for me, please.
I'm throwing out the trash right now.)

692
00:37:39,159 --> 00:37:41,099
(The store's landlord is so...)

693
00:37:43,429 --> 00:37:45,739
(He formed a band with the kids.)

694

695
00:37:48,269 --> 00:37:51,809
(believes that music will make
the children of Tonj smile.)

696
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,139
(I'm just happy.)

697
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,210
(I really am.)

698
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,280
(I never thought I'd be this happy.)

699
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,400
Luca.

700
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:24,670
I wonder if he's enjoying the shoes.

701
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,860
("The World of Stars")

702
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:05,409
Seriously? Who is it at this hour?

703

(Why did you push for
"The World of Stars"?)

704
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,900
What's with the sudden curiosity?

705
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,940
Gosh, he's exhausting.

706
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:29,269
(Why did you push for
"The World of Stars"?)

707
00:39:29,309 --> 00:39:32,170
(I was curious.)

708
00:39:38,610 --> 00:39:40,050
(What do you want?)

709
00:39:40,949 --> 00:39:41,980
Hi.

710
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:44,119
Tell me...

711
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,460
what are you curious about?

712
00:39:46,489 --> 00:39:48,519
(Your acting.)

713
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,630
(I could imagine how you'd act
in all the other projects.)

714
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:53,960
Wait, you imagined it?

715
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,469
(Hey! If you're going to joke around
I'm going to hang up.)

716
00:39:56,500 --> 00:39:59,099
Okay, I won't. Carry on.

717
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,099
(I was just curious about how
Gong Tae Sung, the actor,)

718
00:40:02,139 --> 00:40:04,369
(would interpret this role.)

719
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,179
(Happy now?)

720
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:10,250
(You were adamant about not doing it,
so what's the fuss now?)

721
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:13,619
(Ask me stuff like this during the day.)

722

(Synopsis of "The World of Stars")

723
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:33,139
Wait. This story is basically about
me and her.

724
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,380
(I was curious.)

725
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,019
Hey, Han Byeol.

726
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,619
I'll make you die of curiosity then.

727
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:57,690
Okay.

728
00:41:12,909 --> 00:41:14,079
Ta-da!

729
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:15,849
What is that?

730
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:19,010
My gosh, it looks so tasty.

731
00:41:19,050 --> 00:41:21,320
- Feed me some.
- Shall I?

732
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,449
Even the color makes my mouth water.

733
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,090
- Open wide.
- Okay.

734
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,489
It's good, right?

735
00:41:30,789 --> 00:41:33,300
Yes! It's so delicious.

736
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:35,699
Gosh, what's wrong with me?

737
00:41:37,570 --> 00:41:40,139
We trained under the same company.

738
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:42,769
Those were hungry times.

739
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:47,739
Seok Woo took real good care of me.

740
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:52,250
If Jin Woo hadn't been there,

741
00:41:52,619 --> 00:41:54,219
I wouldn't have gotten this far.

742

- Seok Woo.
- Jin Woo.

- I love you.
- I love you more.

745
00:42:01,989 --> 00:42:04,489
No, I love you more.

746

Thank you so much.

747

Did you say he'll take a pay cut?

748
00:42:08,429 --> 00:42:10,630
Gosh, what about you then?

749
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,840
Did you or did you not say
he'll work for less than Jin Woo?

750
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,570
That's a dirty move.

751
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:17,269
Answer me this.

752
00:42:17,309 --> 00:42:19,480
Where do you learn
to play dirty like that?

753
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,380
From none other than my boss
who's standing right next to me.

754
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:24,250
Well, there's more.

755
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,719
I heard you got her concert tickets too?

756
00:42:26,750 --> 00:42:28,280

Look who's talking.

759
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:36,460
You followed her as far as Busan.
That's a long drive.

760
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:38,389
Busan is far? Nobody thinks that.

761
00:42:38,429 --> 00:42:39,659
I consider it my neighborhood.

762

- Yes, let's do that.

00:54:28,039 --> 00:54:30,039
I'm not doing that drama
because of what you said.

974
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:31,139
Whatever.

975
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:33,539
You might as well say
the script fell out from the sky then.

976
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:37,380
("The World of Stars")

977
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,619
Hey, Gong. Can you stop coming in?

978
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:42,079
I hate it.

979
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,219
You're a total disruption.

980
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,619
That's my goal.

981
00:54:48,860 --> 00:54:50,489
For you to hate it and to disrupt you.

982
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,929
You little!

983
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:56,699
Han Byeol.

984
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,599
Were you happy to send me off to Africa?

985
00:55:01,070 --> 00:55:03,239
Hey, Gong. Get your facts straight.

986
00:55:03,269 --> 00:55:05,570
I didn't send you. It was your idea.

987
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:06,639
So?

988
00:55:10,179 --> 00:55:11,610
That's the reason you never called?

989
00:55:14,119 --> 00:55:15,579
(Gong Tae Sung Gallery)

990
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:16,650
(Gong Tae Sung's girlfriend!)

991
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,019
What's this?

992
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:21,489
What?

993
00:55:24,090 --> 00:55:26,389
- I have big news!
- What is it?

994
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:29,530
Tae Sung went to Africa
because of Ms. Oh.

995
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,570
What? Really?

996
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,769
- Look.
- My gosh!

997
00:55:36,239 --> 00:55:37,239
No way.

998
00:55:38,510 --> 00:55:42,340
(Gong Tae Sung's ex-girlfriend)

999
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:55,889
(Everyone knew about them
at Haesung University.)

1000
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:09,070
(Epilogue)

1001
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,510
Hold on.

1002
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:15,510
It can't be.

1003
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:23,889
Wait.

1004
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,849
(Park Han Byeol)

1005
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,190
Not her.

1006
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,889
Jang Han Byeol, Oh Eun Byeol.

1007
00:56:32,059 --> 00:56:33,829
Oh again. That's Choi Han Byeol.

1008
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:39,400
How could she not write a single letter?

1009
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:40,570
Hey, it's me.

1010
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:43,570
Yes, I put sunscreen on. Don't worry.

1011
00:56:44,309 --> 00:56:45,440
Okay.

1012
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,980
(Call History)

1013
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:52,110
Oh Han Byeol.

1014
00:56:53,179 --> 00:56:54,820
Not a single call from you.

1015
00:56:56,550 --> 00:56:59,289
I won't call you either. Why should I?

1016
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,059
I'm Gong Tae Sung for crying out loud.

1017
00:57:02,159 --> 00:57:04,260
(Connecting video call)

1018
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:06,260
(It's working!)

1019
00:57:06,289 --> 00:57:07,530
(Tae Sung!)

1020
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,030
Hey, Yu Sung. Are you at the office?

1021
00:57:10,269 --> 00:57:13,130
(What? Yes, I'm at the office.)

1022
00:57:13,739 --> 00:57:15,769
(Why do you look so skinny?)

1023
00:57:15,800 --> 00:57:17,170
(Is the food not to your liking?)

1024
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:18,840
No, I'm eating well.

1025
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:21,809
(You lost a lot of weight.)

1026
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:23,340
(Can you hear us, Tae Sung?)

1027
00:57:23,849 --> 00:57:25,780
(You're using sunscreen, right?)

1028
00:57:26,949 --> 00:57:28,150
(I don't think he can see us.)

1029
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,320
(Can he see us?)

1030
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:33,889
(- Send some sunscreen over.
- Say something, Tae Sung.)

1031
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,820
(- Tteokbokki is here!
- Hey.)

1032
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,889
(Tae Sung.)

1033
00:57:37,929 --> 00:57:39,130
(What did you say?)

1034
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:44,269
(Look over here, Tae Sung.
Can you see us?)

1035
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,300
(Please pick up when we call, you punk.)

1036
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:50,309
Okay.

1037
00:58:15,059 --> 00:58:16,730
Hey, Han Byeol.

1038
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,769
Was the tteokbokki that great?

=Shooting Stars=

1040
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,670
You should see this, Ms. Oh.

1041
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:57,670
What is this!

1042
00:58:57,710 --> 00:58:58,969
(They dated back in college?)

1043
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:01,210
(- Is Han Byeol going somewhere?
- She's going on a blind date.)

1044
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:02,110
I'm not doing it.

1045
00:59:02,139 --> 00:59:03,179
(I won't do anything...)

1046
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,309
(that Han Byeol wants from now.
Relay that to her.)

1047
00:59:05,349 --> 00:59:06,650
(They fought for real.)

1048
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:10,349
(Hey Gong. Do you really think
I sent you to Africa?)

1049
00:59:10,389 --> 00:59:12,789
(You want me to decide
whose decision it was...)

1050
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:14,360
(to send you to Africa?)

1051
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,920
(- You want to bet?
- Fine.)

1052
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,590
(- Okay.)
- It's on.

1053
00:59:18,289 --> 00:59:20,059
(Mr. Gong isn't doing
the movie anymore.)

1054
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:21,960
(Why the sudden change of heart?)
