Are you referring to your rumored affair
with Gong Tae Sung?

Ever since I was born,

(Actress Eun Si Woo

17
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:27,530
As a grew up, I started dreaming
of becoming an actress.

18
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,599
I had a plan to go out on my own...

19
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:33,299
when I became an adult
and to become an actress.

20
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:38,500
Then I met someone
who came to the orphanage...

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:40,209
to do volunteer work.

22
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:46,280

and had a child.

26
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,390
What? She had a child?

27
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,590
Is he her son?

28
00:02:01,359 --> 00:02:02,659
Yes, that's right.

29
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,299
That child...

30
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,669
is my son, Gong Tae Sung.

31
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:12,669
- What in the world?
- She was hiding it the whole time.

32
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:16,509
- Oh, that's why.
- Now that makes sense.

33
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:18,139
Not even a year...

34
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:21,550

pushed me to start a new life.

39
00:02:37,629 --> 00:02:39,330
So I left my baby...

00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,159
No, not at all.

165
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:56,659
I have a lot of energy,
so I don't get tired or stressed easily.

166
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:01,429
Still, you must've been worried.
Thank you for trusting me.

167
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,940
Of course, I trust you!

168
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,409
What?

169
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,940
Oh, I just meant...

170
00:11:11,909 --> 00:11:13,110
We're in the same agency...

171
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,509
and on the same cast.

172
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:17,210
We're the male and female leads
of the same drama.

173
00:11:17,919 --> 00:11:19,950
My gosh.
We have so much in common, don't we?

174
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,090
Yes. We do.

175
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,519
Enough to make you my sworn brother!

176
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,059
"Sworn brother"?

177
00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh, I just meant...

178
00:11:33,029 --> 00:11:34,700
I've never had a co-lead...

179
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:37,000
ask me to become her sworn brother.

180
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,570
Okay, let's do a good job
with the remaining scenes.

181
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:43,509
Okay, Tae Sung.

182
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,809
I'll let you get ready now.

183
00:11:46,379 --> 00:11:47,509
See you later,

184
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,110
Da Hye.

185
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,019
My gosh.

186
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,289
Did he just call me by my first name?

187
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,590
So sweetly like that,
without my surname?

188
00:12:08,629 --> 00:12:09,730
Mom!

189
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:13,100
I'm the luckiest fan ever!

190
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:17,240
♪ I'm a woman too ♪

191
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:20,580
♪ When I'm by your side ♪

192
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:23,679
♪ My heart gets all soft and weak ♪

193
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,379
(Byeol)

194
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,360
For now, this is the best we can do.

195
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,470
I really want to protect you.

196
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:49,570
(Byeol)

197
00:12:49,610 --> 00:12:50,740
Should I tap it for you?

198
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:51,980
You scared me!

199
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,710
How long have you been watching me?

200
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:58,450
Are you asking if I saw you hesitate...

201
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,450
whether or not to call her
about 100 times?

202
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:05,759
Should I call Ms. Oh
and see how she's doing?

203
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:06,960
No.

204
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,360
I'll call her.

205
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,759
Okay.

206
00:13:13,830 --> 00:13:15,299
We're ready to shoot Sin Ha's scene.

207
00:13:17,539 --> 00:13:18,399
- Hey.
- Yes?

208
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:21,110
Just hold on to this.
Do not call her. Okay?

209
00:13:21,139 --> 00:13:22,769
- What?
- You got that? Answer me. Okay?

210
00:13:22,809 --> 00:13:24,009
Yes. Okay.

211
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,879
Tae Sung!

212
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:39,120
(I didn't have access to the Internet
for a few days, so I had no idea.)

213
00:13:39,159 --> 00:13:41,629
(Luca wrote "Papa" because
he lost his father a few years ago,)

214
00:13:41,659 --> 00:13:44,059
(and Tae Sung cared for Luca
as if he was his own son.)

215
00:13:44,090 --> 00:13:45,960
So this boy's name is Luca.

216
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,600
Ms. Oh.

217
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,100
What are you reading?

218
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:54,639
Oh, this.

219
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,139
Too bad this wasn't posted sooner.

220
00:13:58,179 --> 00:13:59,440
It's going viral.

221
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:02,149
No. Then people would've said
this was fake too.

222
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,120
Right, that's true.

223
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,620
People like this because
we've cleared up the misunderstanding.

224
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,850
Exactly.

225
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,120
Ms. Oh.

226
00:14:12,059 --> 00:14:13,190
You knew...

227
00:14:13,659 --> 00:14:15,929
that Eun Si Woo was his mom, right?

228
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:19,799
Yes. I knew.

229
00:14:19,929 --> 00:14:22,769
But I really don't get it.

230
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:25,200
Eun Si Woo is a legendary actress.

231
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,740
So even if he'd disclosed it early on,
it wouldn't have hurt his career.

232
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,879
I don't think we can't judge
other people's pain that easily.

233
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,850
It may not seem like a big deal
to others,

234
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,149
but it could shatter your whole world.

235
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:42,350
Then...

236
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:45,159
why did you suddenly push
for the press conference?

237
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:54,059
Hey.

238
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,100
(Is Eun Si Woo Gong Tae Sung's mom?)

239
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:00,600
(I guess it's true.)

240
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,710
Do all the reporters know already?

241
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,080
No.

242
00:15:08,309 --> 00:15:10,250
I think my boss got a tip
from his friend...

243
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:11,980
that Tae Sung was an illegitimate child.

244
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,149
(The situation isn't looking good.)

245
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:16,889
(They'll do a little more digging
and publish it in a few hours.)

246
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:28,799
(The first word you hear
always leaves the strongest impression.)

247
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,399
(You couldn't let people
call him illegitimate.)

248
00:15:34,970 --> 00:15:36,110
Ms. Kim.

249
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,639
We need to do
a press conference right now.

250
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,740
Book a venue as fast as possible.

251
00:15:51,889 --> 00:15:52,960
Hey.

252
00:15:54,389 --> 00:15:56,789
Really? Ms. Oh said that?

253
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,929
(Gong Tae Sung's Dressing Room)

254
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,600
She told Ms. Kim?

255
00:16:02,299 --> 00:16:03,470
I see.

256
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,750
(Are you free this evening?
I'll drop by your place.)

257
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,580
Come in.

258
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,120
Tae Sung.

259
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,019
Hey, what is it?

260
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,259
What now? Is there another problem?

261
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,059
The PR team told me...

262
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:34,600
that Ms. Oh suddenly pushed
for a press conference because...

263
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:48,149
It was very hectic yesterday,
so I barely got to talk to you.

264
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,279
It was nerve-racking to speak in front
of that many people after so long.

265
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,250
But you did great.

266
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,990
I came to thank you.

267
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,230
Thanks to you,

268
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:11,000
I didn't have to see his career
crumble because of me.

269
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:13,869
It's all thanks to you.

270
00:17:17,009 --> 00:17:18,279
You see, Tae Sung...

271
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,509
has been in a lot of pain.

272
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,480
And this incident hurt him, yet again.

273
00:17:28,650 --> 00:17:30,019
Can you tell me the reason...

274
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:33,420
why you came back to Korea?

275
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,750
Oh Han Byeol.

276
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,470
I missed you.

277
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,299
I missed you too.

278
00:18:21,670 --> 00:18:24,440
Why didn't you tell me the reason
behind the press conference?

279
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:29,910
Even if I did,

280
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,650
it wouldn't change the fact
that I was the one who made it public.

281
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:39,619
I knew we had no other way around it,

282
00:18:40,289 --> 00:18:41,789
and I understand why you did it.

283
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:55,769
I'm sorry.

284
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,150
I'm sorry too.

285
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:05,819
That was the best I could do.

286
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,180
I found something out today.

287
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:39,119
I thought it would be best
if you heard it from me.

288
00:19:44,450 --> 00:19:46,420
It's about Eun Si Woo.

289
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,809
(Yu Sung)

290
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:13,849
It's me, Yu Sung.

291
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,890
(Yes, Tae Sung.)

292
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:19,190
Where are you? I'll head over there.

293
00:20:19,690 --> 00:20:22,329
(I'm actually driving over
to your place.)

294
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,970
It's been a while
since just the two of us drank.

295
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,670
Maybe we should've gone
to the Han River.

296
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:34,910
So you can get beat up
instead of me again?

297
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:38,240
Yes. I plan to get beat up
real good this time,

298
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:39,579
so you will call me "Sir".

299
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:43,109
Sir, my foot.

300
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:50,589
About last time.

301
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:54,259
I was pretty harsh, right?

302
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,630
I didn't mean it.

303
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,500
Don't worry. I know you didn't.

304
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:08,740
Why didn't you just tell me?

305
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,609
I'm sorry.

306
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:14,109
I shouldn't have kept secrets from you.

307
00:21:14,849 --> 00:21:16,250
I couldn't find the right time.

308
00:21:16,279 --> 00:21:19,680
It's fine.
I'm sure you did it for my sake.

309
00:21:20,549 --> 00:21:22,720
I figured...

310
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,390
you had a reason...

311
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,690
for bringing that woman back.

312
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:30,529
I appreciate your understanding.

313
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,799
I'm sure it wasn't easy to tell me.

314
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,210
I heard she is sick.

315
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,910
Yes.

316
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,480
I will hear her out.

317
00:21:51,819 --> 00:21:53,180
Properly, this time.

318
00:21:54,519 --> 00:21:55,849
But could you perhaps...

319
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:58,890
take me to her?

320
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:02,230
So I don't run away?

321
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,299
Sure, I will take you.

322
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,230
Let's go together.

323
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,880
Did you come to attend an awards show?
Why is there so much stuff?

324
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,950
You have no right to nag me.
I didn't buy it with your money.

325
00:22:27,119 --> 00:22:29,150
What if you did? Can I nag you then?

326
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:31,019
Don't be ridiculous.

327
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:34,990
But are you okay with leaving like this?

328
00:22:35,529 --> 00:22:36,759
You wanted to apologize.

329
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:41,630
They say forcefully apologizing
to someone is abuse too.

330
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,329
I don't want to harass him anymore.

331
00:22:44,569 --> 00:22:47,869
Now you don't?
After all the harassing you did?

332
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,710
That's exactly why. I know what I did.

333
00:22:51,809 --> 00:22:54,680
You're probably the most frustrating
person in this situation.

334
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:55,910
You never show your feelings.

335
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,819
That time you tried to get off the plane
after receiving Tae Sung's call.

336
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,849
I remember that clearly.

337
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,759
Also how you went to the funeral,

338
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:08,190
but couldn't step foot inside.

339
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:11,930
You made sure to set everything up
behind the scenes...

340
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:14,029
so your teen kid
could live a comfortable life.

341
00:23:16,369 --> 00:23:18,269
That was all in vain.

342
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:20,400
He was sick.

343
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:23,410
A mom who can't express herself
isn't a mom.

344
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,680
I would hate a mom like me too.

345
00:23:30,579 --> 00:23:32,380
Stay here. I'll get the door.

346
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:33,720
Okay.

347
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:38,160
- Si Woo.
- Yu Sung.

348
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:41,019
I was worried I couldn't say goodbye
before I left.

349
00:23:41,059 --> 00:23:42,990
After all the suffering
you went through for me.

350
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:07,950
There is one day...

351
00:24:09,549 --> 00:24:11,589
that I regret the most in my life.

352
00:24:15,529 --> 00:24:17,759
The day I hurt the person...

353
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,359
I loved the most.

354
00:24:21,799 --> 00:24:25,240
I never did a good job as a mom.

355
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,640
But that day, I wanted to show my son...

356
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:32,009
what I did for a living.

357
00:24:35,009 --> 00:24:36,650
I took the kid...

358
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,380
to the film festival.

359
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:42,019
- Do you like being here?
- Yes, I do.

360
00:24:43,519 --> 00:24:46,559
My gosh, you're so cute.
Whose kid is it?

361
00:24:49,359 --> 00:24:50,630
He's my nephew.

362
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:53,029
I brought him because he wanted
to check out my workplace.

363
00:24:54,099 --> 00:24:55,630
(I immediately regretted it.)

364
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:58,670
I denied my son's existence...

365
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:02,109
in front of many people.

366
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,569
(I'm not your mom.)

367
00:25:05,079 --> 00:25:06,240
(Actress Eun Si Woo)

368
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:07,880
So make sure...

369
00:25:08,279 --> 00:25:10,980
to not call me mom today, okay?

370
00:25:11,819 --> 00:25:15,890
That day you asked for my help
for the first time.

371
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:19,359
Help me, Mom.

372
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,490
- I have to go!
- Ma'am. We're taking off soon.

373
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:24,230
- Please take your seat.
- I'm sorry.

374
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,630
I could not go to you.

375
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,839
I couldn't approach you.

376
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,140
So all I could do was watch from afar.

377
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,009
Mr. Kang.
Please stop her from following me.

378
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:44,480
After you became an actor,

379
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:49,819
I thought it would be better for you
if I wasn't in Korea.

380
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:53,089
So I retired and left.

381
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,329
But then I was told...

382
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,069
that I'm losing my memory.

383
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,240
I thought...

384
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:11,980
what if I end up...

385
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:14,910
not being able
to explain anything to you?

386
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,250
I got scared.

387
00:26:25,519 --> 00:26:26,690
Tae Sung.

388
00:26:30,829 --> 00:26:32,930
It's not what you think.

389
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,130
You weren't completely abandoned
in this world.

390
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:40,869
I wasn't great at expressing it,

391
00:26:42,140 --> 00:26:43,910
but know that you were loved.

392
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:48,279
I wanted to tell you...

393
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,450
before it was too late.

394
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,289
You should have...

395
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,630
told me just a bit earlier.

396
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,200
I was really...

397
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,170
so incredibly lonely.

398
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,970
You're right.

399
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,950
I should have told you earlier.

400
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,779
I'm this bad at expressing myself.

401
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:28,349
I don't know how I was an actress.

402
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,930
You must have been lonely too.

403
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,829
The day my friend died.

404
00:27:45,569 --> 00:27:46,869
Just like you,

405
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,210
I also couldn't go running to him.

406
00:27:52,079 --> 00:27:53,309
I guess...

407
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:57,509
you felt something similar.

408
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:04,089
But I did go through so much pain.

409
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,519
So I won't try to understand you more.

410
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:13,660
But still, thank you.

411
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,339
Thank you for telling me.

412
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:24,970
Thank you...

413
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,140
for listening to me.

414
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,450
Let's get going.

415
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:38,519
I might miss my flight.

416
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,160
Can you give me a hug?

417
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:47,759
Let's not act out of the ordinary.

418
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:55,170
I've been always lacking,

419
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,640
but I loved you, my son.

420
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:07,880
Well...

421
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:11,089
Please...

422
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,190
never forget that.

423
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,730
You can forget...

424
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:17,460
all the bad memories.

425
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:25,539
I'll come see you from time to time.

426
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,529
Gosh. Tae Sung is going to kill me.

427
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,690
I didn't tell him I was your manager.

428
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,359
So why did you lie to him?

429
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,400
And what if he said he would quit
after hearing about it?

430
00:29:55,529 --> 00:29:56,630
I put a lot of effort
to make him an actor.

431
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:59,500
Gosh. Managers are unbelievable.

432
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:07,880
There's something
I didn't tell you about.

433
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,910
What is it?

434
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,279
I...

435
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,380
have a lot of money.

436
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,319
I have a lot more money than you think.

437
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:21,059
So...

438
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,759
That place where you're staying...

439
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:25,730
The best place in the world.

440
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:27,900
Come if you can afford it.

441
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:38,269
I'm really going to go!

442
00:30:40,809 --> 00:30:42,210
Remember that.

443
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,259
Ms. Oh Han Byeol.

444
00:31:27,690 --> 00:31:29,789
You're Tae Sung's girlfriend, right?

445
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,400
He must've been...

446
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,000
really lonely this whole time.

447
00:31:36,569 --> 00:31:39,900
I'm glad that he has someone he likes.

448
00:31:42,769 --> 00:31:44,039
Thank you.

449
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:07,160
Did you listen to what she had to say?

450
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:09,700
Yes.

451
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,599
I did.

452
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:13,470
Good.

453
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:17,569
Thank you.

454
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,009
Thanks to you,

455
00:32:21,009 --> 00:32:22,349
I could send her off well.

456
00:32:59,150 --> 00:33:01,279
Jae Hyeon. Why are you having ramyeon
in the middle of the night?

457
00:33:01,849 --> 00:33:03,089
Don't you have a shoot tomorrow?

458
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:07,089
What's happened to your eyes?

459
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,130
I'm fine.

460
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:11,190
My eyes need to be
swollen tomorrow anyway.

461
00:33:12,529 --> 00:33:13,900
Chang Kyu and Se Mi...

462
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,230
just broke up.

463
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:19,339
I'm eating this for my acting.

464
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,720
I did the commercial for this ramyeon.

465
00:33:34,079 --> 00:33:35,250
I did the commercial with her.

466
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:41,660
What is it?

467
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,059
Why did you break up with Jin Yu Na?

468
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,289
How did you know that?

469
00:33:45,329 --> 00:33:46,700
You talked to her
on the phone every night.

470
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,099
How can I not know about it?

471
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:57,039
You said you loved me.

472
00:33:57,069 --> 00:33:58,640
Why are you breaking up with me
when you said you loved me?

473
00:34:01,809 --> 00:34:03,150
I'm doing this because I love you.

474
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:07,049
You should meet someone better who
deserves to be with the Nation's Fairy.

475
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:10,019
Instead of being the Nation's Fairy,
I just want to be your fairy.

476
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,320
Don't come here again, okay?

477
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,619
I quit working here as of today.

478
00:34:23,969 --> 00:34:25,170
Why would you give me
a lot of whipped cream...

479
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,170
when you're breaking up with me?

480
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,400
You're making me confused.

481
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,369
This much whipped cream is a proposal!

482
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:35,110
Cut, okay.

483
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,409
Yu Na and Jae Hyeon.
What got into you today?

484
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,679
Your acting is great.

485
00:34:39,019 --> 00:34:41,349
Gosh,
I didn't know this scene was this sad.

486
00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:43,690
It was like a thousand-year farewell.

487
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,119
Gosh, it makes me cry.

488
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,659
Don't the two get back together
in the next episode?

489
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:50,059
They will get back together,

490
00:34:50,090 --> 00:34:52,230
but the breakup they're facing now
is still heartbreaking.

491
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,900
I thought she was just childish,

492
00:34:55,099 --> 00:34:56,400
but she must have had
a heartbreaking love before.

493
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,730
- Just like me.
- What are you talking about?

494
00:34:58,769 --> 00:35:00,800
You should be thankful
that any girl went out with you.

495
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:03,139
Why would I be thankful for that?
How can you say that?

496
00:35:03,170 --> 00:35:05,739
You know nothing about love.
I won't bother talking about it.

497
00:35:11,449 --> 00:35:12,679
Yu Na.

498
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:14,420
You'll gain weight if you have
all that whipped cream. Give it to me.

499
00:35:14,449 --> 00:35:16,250
Don't touch this.
I'm going to eat all of it.

500
00:35:16,750 --> 00:35:17,989
That was sharp.

501
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:21,059
"Time for Unrequited Love"...

502
00:35:21,659 --> 00:35:24,630
is the talk of the town
around me these days.

503
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:26,400
Kang Yu Sung.

504
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:28,329
Gosh, it's confusing.

505
00:35:29,369 --> 00:35:32,300
I heard that Kang Si Duk is going to be
the supporting character.

506
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,570
Is that so?

507
00:35:35,239 --> 00:35:36,409
"Is that so?"

508
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:39,210
What's up with this lukewarm reaction?

509
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,880
Wasn't that the role
you wanted Jae Hyeon to do?

510
00:35:41,909 --> 00:35:44,579
Gosh, the student has become
the master now.

511
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,050
Park Ho Young will take
all your work soon.

512
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,920
Why? Do you like him
because you have the same name?

513
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:51,889
That's possible.

514
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,719
It's good to see an actor
from my company do well.

515
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,760
Jae Hyeon will get a good role
in his next work.

516
00:35:56,159 --> 00:35:59,429
Gosh, Yu Sung.
You've become a paper tiger now.

517
00:36:00,829 --> 00:36:02,199
(You can...)

518
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:05,739
lean on me like I'm a tree.

519
00:36:16,179 --> 00:36:18,010
What is it? Why are you laughing?

520
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:21,480
Have you lost your mind since there are
so many things going on around you?

521
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:23,150
Why are you laughing while eating?
It's scary.

522
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,250
Gosh, you have no idea.

523
00:36:25,289 --> 00:36:26,789
Just eat your food already.

524
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:30,130
Don't laugh while eating. It's scary.

525
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,699
My hometown?

526
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:34,929
I'm from Igok-dong in Daegu.

527
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,070
Okay. Let's wrap it up today.

528
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,769
You're getting better every day.

529
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,039
That's not true.

530
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,840
- All right. Good job.
- Thank you.

531
00:36:46,909 --> 00:36:49,349
You're starting your next drama
right after "The World of Stars"?

532
00:36:50,179 --> 00:36:52,150
Yes. It's "Time for Unrequited Love".

533
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:55,119
I need to speak with a Seoul accent,
and there are many lines.

534
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:56,849
I'm not sure if I'll do a good job.

535
00:36:57,019 --> 00:36:59,690
You don't need to worry about it.
It's not that difficult.

536
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,960
Just practice until you feel like
you'll die.

537
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,340
I will try my best
as if my life is at stake.

538
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,610
Please help me so I can keep going on.

539
00:37:16,570 --> 00:37:18,639
- Did you do well today?
- Yes.

540
00:37:18,739 --> 00:37:20,280
I got compliments from the teacher.

541
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:21,539
Really?

542
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:23,150
Gosh, I'm proud of you.

543
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:26,250
Hello, sir.

544
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:27,820
Hello.

545
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:29,750
Yu Sung, say hello to him.

546
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:31,650
He used to work at Starforce before.

547
00:37:33,019 --> 00:37:34,159
Hello, sir.

548
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,429
Yu Sung? Goodness.

549
00:37:36,789 --> 00:37:38,559
You became a team manager
because of Yu Sung's help from behind.

550
00:37:38,929 --> 00:37:40,159
And your actor is Kang Yu Sung too?

551
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,130
What...

552
00:37:43,570 --> 00:37:45,199
do you mean?

553
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:51,909
Hey, Park Ho Young.

554
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,710
Did you forget to knock?

555
00:37:54,739 --> 00:37:55,710
Mr. Choi.

556
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,280
Was I appointed as a team manager
because Yu Sung helped me from behind?

557
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,880
Help you?

558
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,650
How can you not know if he did?

559
00:38:02,019 --> 00:38:03,719
(4 months ago)

560
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,989
Don't you think
it's too soon to promote Ho Young...

561
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,619
to manage the entire team?

562
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,889
I understand
she hasn't been a manager for that long,

563
00:38:10,929 --> 00:38:12,630
but she's certainly capable enough.

564
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,059
She's definitely qualified.

565
00:38:14,659 --> 00:38:16,329
The other managers won't like it.

566
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:18,429
Some might even quit.

567
00:38:18,869 --> 00:38:22,099
That might actually be better
to ensure Starforce's continued success.

568
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,440
She's the one
I want to work with for a long time,

569
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,679
not the other managers.

570
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,480
I might not listen to other managers,

571
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,880
but I always listen to Yu Sung.

572
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:37,119
Then why didn't you tell me?

573
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:39,719
What would that change? Besides,

574
00:38:40,219 --> 00:38:42,429
I'd never blindly promote anyone...

575
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,460
just based on Yu Sung's recommendation.

576
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,199
Look.

577
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,929
Your team had
the second highest sales this month.

578
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:53,440
That's a huge jump,
in just a few months.

579
00:38:53,469 --> 00:38:57,039
Although Team One is hard to beat.

580
00:38:59,309 --> 00:39:01,840
Sure, we could say you got the position
because of Yu Sung.

581
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:05,719
But now, I can confidently say
that you earned it fair and square.

582
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:11,820
If you have time to ask me this,
go out and make more money.

583
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,989
Go.

584
00:39:14,389 --> 00:39:15,960
Don't even say bye. Just go.

585
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:27,269
Hi, Yu Sung.

586
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,139
(Hey, Ho Young. What's wrong?)

587
00:39:31,739 --> 00:39:32,809
Well...

588
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,510
Wait. How did you know?

589
00:39:37,449 --> 00:39:38,949
(You seem a little upset.)

590
00:39:39,719 --> 00:39:41,980
(I'm right in front of you.)

591
00:39:49,489 --> 00:39:50,659
You're still working?

592
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,199
No. I'm done for the day.

593
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,730
Then do you want to have dinner with me?

594
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,369
Sure.

595
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,889
Yu Sung.

596
00:40:17,449 --> 00:40:19,860
Did you always want
to be a celebrity manager?

597
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:23,130
Yes. Always,
ever since I was very young.

598
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:26,659
Discovering hidden gems
and helping them become stars.

599
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:28,159
I thought it was such a cool job.

600
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:30,300
Which is why
I chose to major in this field.

601
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,769
My gosh. That's impressive.

602
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:36,369
Then were you...

603
00:40:36,909 --> 00:40:39,070
always so good at your job,
right off the bat?

604
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:41,039
No, of course not.

605
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:43,079
I was eager and passionate,
but that's it.

606
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,780
Actually, I even got fired
from my first job.

607
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:49,420
You were fired?

608
00:40:59,699 --> 00:41:00,760
Hello.

609
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:05,570
(Sung Woo Joo, CEO of Star Universe)

610
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:08,469
(Yoon Jang Seok,
top actor at Star Universe)

611
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,179
Oh, my bad.

612
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,519
Ta-da.

613
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:25,519
Jang Seok, your favorites.
A latte and cheesecake.

614
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,920
Don't you know that I'm on a diet?

615
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,829
Is this how you manage your actors?

616
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:31,989
Oh, that cheesecake is fat-free.

617
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,059
Fat-free?

618
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:36,829
- Jang Seok.
- All right.

619
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:38,969
Don't eat fatty foods
so you can stay healthy...

620
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:41,639
and renew your contract
and work on many more projects with me.

621
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:44,539
Gosh, my eyes! That's blinding my eyes.

622
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,110
I despise lights!

623
00:41:47,139 --> 00:41:50,050
Actors act with their eyes. Is this
the best you can do for your actors?

624
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:52,719
Here, Jang Seok. These glasses
will block out the blue light.

625
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,849
Right! Jang Seok. I'll block out...

626
00:41:55,889 --> 00:41:59,320
anything and everything
that could be harmful to you.

627
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,389
Here you go.

628
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,030
Hey, this is thick.

629
00:42:04,059 --> 00:42:06,599
Hey, you must've been
a straight-A student back in school.

630
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,860
I hate straight-A students.

631
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,230
I couldn't stand them
even back in school.

632
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,639
Well, all right. I'll begin now.

633
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:17,869
Okay, the first one.

634
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:20,679
"Tip of the Iceberg" is
a mystery detective drama.

635
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:22,809
It takes place on a snowy mountain
and has a different format...

636
00:42:22,849 --> 00:42:25,449
I hate it when things are different!

637
00:42:27,449 --> 00:42:30,190
My gosh.
Jang Seok, how is it possible...

638
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:32,349
that we're always
on the same wavelength?

639
00:42:32,389 --> 00:42:34,320
You're right.
We shouldn't try anything new.

640
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,929
Never. I'll yell at you
if you try to change things up.

641
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,789
Come on.
We want something typical and easy.

642
00:42:38,829 --> 00:42:41,659
Something familiar and predictable,
you know?

643
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:42,559
("Surviving Summer")

644
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:43,829
Okay. The next one is
"Surviving Summer".

645
00:42:43,869 --> 00:42:45,329
This drama will sweep...

646
00:42:45,369 --> 00:42:47,739
What? That reminds me of Kangta.
I hate Kangta!

647
00:42:47,769 --> 00:42:49,739
I was a SECHSKIES fan!

648
00:42:49,769 --> 00:42:51,369
Yes. Kangta, my foot!

649
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:53,210
- Don't you know "School Anthem"?
- Forget it.

650
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:56,250
Which drama will pay me the most?

651
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,750
I bet you have no idea.

652
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,119
Please look at page 56.

653
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:03,550
I listed ten production companies
that gave the highest pay increases...

654
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:04,590
in the past three years.

655
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,960
Based on the list,

656
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:08,719
we can guess
which production will pay the most.

657
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,090
Well...

658
00:43:11,289 --> 00:43:12,329
Okay.

659
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:15,929
Then which drama
will sell the best abroad?

660
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,300
My goal is to become
a world-famous actor.

661
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:22,239
Jang Seok. For that,

662
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,969
we'd have to wait until things kick off
to have a better idea.

663
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,280
Jang Seok, please look at page 62.

664
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,650
You can check their sales reports
for distribution rights abroad.

665
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:35,250
Oh, my. We can check all the data here!

666
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:39,050
Hey, Yu Sung. Come here.
Give me your cheek.

667
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:41,889
You... Great job.

668
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:44,090
I like you. Well done.

669
00:43:45,429 --> 00:43:47,230
- Thank you.
- Forget about this.

670
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:48,699
Hey, you.

671
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:52,599
What kind of drama
do you think I'd want to do the most?

672
00:43:54,269 --> 00:43:57,070
Well, that's...

673
00:43:57,110 --> 00:43:59,110
You see, this is the problem!

674
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:01,909
The agency doesn't seem to know
what the actors want.

675
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,949
You guys have no idea!

676
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:09,949
Mr. Sung. Take care.

677
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:13,489
For everything you've done for me
over the years, I'm...

678
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:15,389
not that grateful.

679
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:19,500
And you. What is this, seriously?

680
00:44:19,530 --> 00:44:21,400
Learn to save some paper.

681
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:23,269
How do you expect
the company to do well?

682
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,500
This stupid company.

683
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,500
(Yoon Jang Seok had already decided
to switch agencies.)

684
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:28,639
(I wasted my time.)

685
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:29,769
Where are you going? Hey!

686
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:31,539
You drink every night with girls!
I'll post everything!

687
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,110
Did you know he lied about his age too?

688
00:44:35,610 --> 00:44:37,480
- Yu Sung.
- Yes.

689
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,920
You should leave too.

690
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,679
You're fired.

691
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:44,719
Get out!

692
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:48,659
- Hey.
- Yes?

693
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:50,230
You know,

694
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:53,659
you need to pay...

695
00:44:54,630 --> 00:44:56,170
for the paper. Okay?

696
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,900
Do you think I run a charity here?

697
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:14,079
You can keep the change.

698
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,750
My gosh, that's insane.

699
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,619
That experience taught me...

700
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:22,860
that reading the room and people
was everything in this field.

701
00:45:23,030 --> 00:45:25,829
I learned that doing your best
wasn't always the answer.

702
00:45:27,630 --> 00:45:31,429
I can't believe that
you were once a rookie too.

703
00:45:33,769 --> 00:45:35,570
I learned
through endless trial and error...

704
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,309
and meeting countless actors.

705
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:40,380
It was only after I joined Starforce
that this new path opened up for me.

706
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:45,250
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

707
00:46:00,099 --> 00:46:01,260
Actually,

708
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:04,269
I found out today...

709
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:06,440
that you were the one...

710
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:09,340
who recommended me
for the manager position for Team Two.

711
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:11,369
Oh, you heard?

712
00:46:11,809 --> 00:46:13,409
You earned it.

713
00:46:17,409 --> 00:46:19,150
Yu Sung.

714
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:22,679
- So...
- Yes?

715
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:28,690
Please forget what I told you.

716
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:30,829
What?

717
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:36,170
My feelings for you.

718
00:46:37,530 --> 00:46:40,099
I also want to work
at Starforce Entertainment...

719
00:46:40,139 --> 00:46:42,639
with you for a long time.

720
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,369
I will put away my personal feelings...

721
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,909
- and do my best...
- I don't want to.

722
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,650
- Sorry?
- I don't want to forget it.

723
00:46:55,719 --> 00:46:56,820
What?

724
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,690
Sorry, Ho Young.

725
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,289
I should have said it before you did.

726
00:47:06,059 --> 00:47:07,460
I was such a fool.

727
00:47:08,659 --> 00:47:11,570
I like you too.

728
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:16,769
No way.

729
00:47:19,579 --> 00:47:21,239
You're so cute.

730
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:23,750
I thought...

731
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,179
I was your tree.

732
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:29,280
No, you're not.

733
00:47:56,849 --> 00:47:58,309
Gosh, time sure does fly.

734
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:00,550
It's already that day.

735
00:48:01,619 --> 00:48:02,550
Tell me about it.

736
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:03,489
(We remember actor Lee Yoon Woo.)

737
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,849
I still can't believe it.

738
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,289
I saw it on the news.

739
00:48:07,789 --> 00:48:10,230
He was best friends
with Mr. Gong, right?

740
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,789
Yes, they were a famous duo.

741
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,469
I can't imagine how hard
it must've been for his coworkers.

742
00:48:16,730 --> 00:48:18,500
Everyone was beside themselves.

743
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:21,099
I am still curious.

744
00:48:21,340 --> 00:48:22,900
Why did he make that choice?

745
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:24,739
His career was on a high.

746
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:27,639
He filmed commercials and was even
cast as the lead for a big show.

747
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:30,250
He didn't leave a will,
so we'll never know.

748
00:48:30,849 --> 00:48:32,880
He was so nice and smiled a lot.

749
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:34,849
Life felt so futile then.

750
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:38,119
Just thinking about it makes me sad.

751
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,320
He was friends with Ms. Oh.

752
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,159
I'm sure it's worse for her.
Having to work when she's sad.

753
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:48,099
- Good morning.
- Hello, Ms. Oh.

754
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:05,210
Ms. Oh. This is scheduled
to be posted tomorrow.

755
00:49:06,349 --> 00:49:07,579
(We remember actor Lee Yoon Woo.)

756
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:08,920
(He was the brightest young man
who influenced many positively.)

757
00:49:08,949 --> 00:49:10,150
(We'll cherish your beautiful heart
and your good deeds.)

758
00:49:17,059 --> 00:49:18,530
I'm sorry I'm late.

759
00:49:19,659 --> 00:49:21,400
Are you feeling unwell, Ms. Oh?

760
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:24,329
I feel a little under the weather.

761
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,869
Oh, right.

762
00:49:32,239 --> 00:49:35,710
(2 Missed Calls: Yoon Woo)

763
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:36,809
(Yoon Woo)

764
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,380
(Yoon Woo. Did something happen?)

765
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:44,219
(Sorry, I missed your call.
The medicine knocked me out.)

766
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:46,019
(Text me back when you see this.)

767
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:48,820
(Pharmacy)

768
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,230
Yes, Mr. Choi.

769
00:49:56,699 --> 00:49:57,869
(Han Byeol.)

770
00:49:58,969 --> 00:50:00,039
(It's Yoon Woo...)

771
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,809
(Yoon Woo)

772
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:15,250
Pick up, Yoon Woo.

773
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:17,449
Please, Yoon Woo.

774
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,150
Please.

775
00:50:19,789 --> 00:50:22,389
- Come on.
(- The receiver cannot be reached...)

776
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:25,389
Please, I'm begging you. Pick up.

777
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:31,969
Please pick up.

778
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,639
Please.

779
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,769
- Please.
(- The receiver cannot be reached...)

780
00:50:38,809 --> 00:50:41,309
(Please leave a message after the beep.)

781
00:50:44,349 --> 00:50:45,949
(Yoon Woo. Did something happen?)

782
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:47,619
(Sorry, I missed your call.
The medicine knocked me out.)

783
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:01,460
(Ms. Oh.)

784
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:04,769
Yes, post it as is.

785
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,800
Okay.

786
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:13,309
(We remember actor Lee Yoon Woo.)

787
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:44,840
Yoon Woo. It's us.

788
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,139
Sorry to startle you at this hour.

789
00:51:47,909 --> 00:51:50,309
We came earlier
to avoid the crowd tomorrow.

790
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,420
You're surprised
we came together, right?

791
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,380
You're surprised, right?

792
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:57,889
That's right.

793
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,289
We are dating.

794
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:03,630
I told you before
that I liked Han Byeol a lot, right?

795
00:52:03,659 --> 00:52:04,690
But you know what?

796
00:52:05,090 --> 00:52:08,329
She put me through so much misery.

797
00:52:09,199 --> 00:52:11,269
Hey, same here.

798
00:52:12,329 --> 00:52:14,539
Shall we make a bet on who had it worse?

799
00:52:14,570 --> 00:52:16,039
Stop. We're here to see Yoon Woo.

800
00:52:18,170 --> 00:52:19,210
Fine.

801
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,949
I know it doesn't look it,
but we get along very well.

802
00:52:24,579 --> 00:52:26,309
Yes, we're doing pretty well.

803
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:41,730
I...

804
00:52:44,130 --> 00:52:45,829
It's about Eun Si Woo.

805
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:56,980
As in my mom.

806
00:53:00,719 --> 00:53:02,280
I reconciled with my mom.

807
00:53:04,050 --> 00:53:05,289
Remember what you told me?

808
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:06,590
(Rest in peace, our shining star.)

809
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:09,389
How I should have a proper conversation
with her at least once.

810
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:15,929
You were right.

811
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:18,670
If you were next to me now,

812
00:53:20,139 --> 00:53:21,599
you would probably be proud of me.

813
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,019
(Rest in peace, our shining star.)

814
00:53:39,789 --> 00:53:40,860
Yoon Woo.

815
00:53:41,159 --> 00:53:42,420
How is it over there?

816
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,590
This place you left behind
is still noisy...

817
00:53:46,030 --> 00:53:47,300
and as hectic as ever.

818
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:49,929
And as for us,

819
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,469
we still miss you.

820
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,769
Very much.

821
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,599
The African boy's name is Luca, right?

822
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,030
It's the same
as Yoon Woo's baptismal name.

823
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:26,170
Yes, isn't it cool?

824
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,539
Their personalities are similar too.

825
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:30,969
They are both nice, smile a lot,

826
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,940
and make sacrifices for their families.

827
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,380
That's why you cared for him more.

828
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,179
At first, yes.

829
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:39,880
But as it turned out,

830
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,920
he helped me more.

831
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:43,820
It was as if...

832
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,619
Yoon Woo sent him.

833
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:48,320
It seems that way.

834
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:50,489
Maybe he was really sent by Yoon Woo.

835
00:55:19,789 --> 00:55:22,519
(Don't forget. You killed Lee Yoon Woo.)

836
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:40,309
Who is it at this hour?

837
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:45,880
What is it?

838
00:55:49,519 --> 00:55:50,550
Well...

839
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:52,489
Here.

840
00:55:54,119 --> 00:55:55,219
What is this?

841
00:56:01,059 --> 00:56:02,559
(Rice snacks, Monaka)

842
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,099
You're giving this to me?

843
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:07,699
But tell me,

844
00:56:09,670 --> 00:56:11,639
whose taste is this catered to?

845
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,239
Mine. Why?

846
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,880
My grandpa loved those snacks.

847
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,980
Gosh, of course.

848
00:56:18,449 --> 00:56:19,710
He had great taste.

849
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,550
Gosh, it looks delicious.

850
00:56:21,820 --> 00:56:22,920
Thank you.

851
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,019
I heard you pulled many all-nighters
because of me.

852
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,590
That is correct.

853
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:33,829
Last year, I worked overtime only twice.

854
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,300
But this year,
I already racked up four days.

855
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:37,869
And it is still early in the year.

856
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,030
It is all...

857
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,199
thanks to you, Tae Sung.

858
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:45,639
My gosh, I'm such an impressive person
in so many ways.

859
00:56:47,610 --> 00:56:49,579
I think I really have to move.

860
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:54,050
Thank you.

861
00:56:58,489 --> 00:56:59,650
Well...

862
00:57:00,690 --> 00:57:02,190
I didn't do it to be thanked.

863
00:57:09,829 --> 00:57:12,269
So, what... Do you need anything?

864
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,969
Coffee.

865
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:20,280
It was good. That latte.

866
00:57:21,579 --> 00:57:22,739
This late at night?

867
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:26,780
Then what about decaf?

868
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:28,380
Good.

869
00:57:37,530 --> 00:57:38,760
That was natural.

870
00:57:46,570 --> 00:57:49,440
So what is it
that you want to talk about?

871
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:56,110
If someone who knows you
hates you so much,

872
00:57:57,980 --> 00:57:59,380
what would you do about it?

873
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:02,750
Are you talking about anti-fans?

874
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:06,349
That's not the case. It's more like...

875
00:58:08,159 --> 00:58:09,590
someone I know.

876
00:58:11,159 --> 00:58:13,230
Well, I think ignoring that person
is the answer.

877
00:58:14,159 --> 00:58:15,860
Does this person bother you?

878
00:58:17,699 --> 00:58:19,130
It's someone...

879
00:58:20,369 --> 00:58:21,639
I care about.

880
00:58:23,969 --> 00:58:25,409
Who is this person?

881
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,809
He used to be my late friend's...

882
00:58:34,750 --> 00:58:36,219
manager.

883
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:44,760
(I think it only drew attention
for nothing.)

884
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,500
(It's been a while. How have you been,
Mr. Starforce Employee?)

885
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:54,539
(I'm not an employee anymore.)

886
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,980
(You know what?)

887
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:05,980
(Someone died because of Gong Tae Sung.)

888
00:59:07,650 --> 00:59:09,750
(Is that true?)

889
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:11,289
(I knew it. He didn't even go to
his best friend's funeral.)

890
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,289
(Gosh. That's so cruel.)

891
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,360
(- Did you see it for yourself?
- Yes.)

892
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,699
Gosh, Choi Ji Hoon.
Why would you bring liquor to a bar?

893
00:59:28,340 --> 00:59:30,969
Bring me every menu you have here.

894
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,539
You can even rip me off.

895
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,039
Okay.

896
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:36,110
How have you been?

897
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:40,050
I want to come here more often,
but it's not easy.

898
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:42,849
You don't need to come see me on
Yoon Woo's death anniversary anymore.

899
00:59:48,059 --> 00:59:49,320
Yoon Woo, Tae Sung!

900
00:59:51,590 --> 00:59:53,559
Come on. Let's take a picture.

901
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:56,929
Hurry.

902
01:00:13,849 --> 01:00:15,250
(Epilogue)

903
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:16,780
The day I collapsed...

904
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,849
There were camera flashes going off
in front of my eyes.

905
01:00:21,090 --> 01:00:24,690
Lately, when flashes go off,
my heart would start to pound,

906
01:00:25,630 --> 01:00:28,699
and I'd feel dizzy.
But it went away soon,

907
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:30,099
so I just let it slide.

908
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:36,570
Have you experienced something
or have memories regarding flashes?

909
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,369
(It happened when I was seven.)

910
01:00:41,079 --> 01:00:44,250
(I wanted to see my mom
on the red carpet.)

911
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,010
(I was jumping to see her
and fell down.)

912
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:51,250
There were flashes going off
at that moment.

913
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:54,760
Are there any other memories?

914
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:05,369
It was two years ago.

915
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:12,170
I heard that my best friend had died.

916
01:01:15,710 --> 01:01:18,380
I was on a plane and going abroad
for my fan meeting when I heard that.

917
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:23,420
I couldn't go to his funeral.

918
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:25,090
- Look over here, please.
- Please say something.

919
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,920
(I remember the flashes
at the airport...)

920
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,260
(on the day I came back from my trip.)

921
01:01:31,590 --> 01:01:32,929
What were they...

922
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:38,170
trying to capture in my face?

923
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:15,469
=Shooting Stars=

924
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:18,539
(Why are they saying
Gong Tae Sung killed Lee Yoon Woo?)

925
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:21,380
(Remembering Actor Lee Yoon Woo
who's become a star in the sky.)

926
01:02:21,409 --> 01:02:23,739
(I saw the security footage.)

927
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,280
(Everyone is wearing
a dark outfit today.)

928
01:02:26,309 --> 01:02:28,079
(- Cheers!
- Cheers!)

929
01:02:28,119 --> 01:02:29,079
Are you doing okay?

930
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:32,590
(They didn't talk about it,
but they must have blamed themselves.)

931
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,190
(And that made it even more painful.)

932
01:02:34,219 --> 01:02:35,860
(It was in front of the door.)

933
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:38,460
(Haven't you noticed anything off
with Tae Sung?)

934
01:02:39,460 --> 01:02:42,230
(Ms. Oh. I think you need to see this.)
