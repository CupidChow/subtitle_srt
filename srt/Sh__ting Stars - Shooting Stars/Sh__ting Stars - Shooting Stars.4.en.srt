Nice. Show me some more.

00:06:41,139 --> 00:06:42,970
- Did you fabricate the results?
- What?

107
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:44,879
Why would I go to such trouble
just to beat you?

108

Stop arguing.
Take a pay cut for three months.

109

Come on, Mr. Gong.

110

I have the highest sales at Starforce.

I am indisputably the number one actor.

You should have posted that clip
under our official channel.

145

It got more views than actors' videos.

146
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,879
- It would've brought in a lot of money.
- Sure.

147
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,850
Just sell me out and make money off me.

148
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,919
Can I really do that?

149

Yes. Suit yourself.

- Good work.

Why? It looks great now.

154
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:50,000
My previous characters
had similar hairstyles.

Yes, I need to get a grip.

00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:15,559
Hey, Jae Hyeon.

166
00:09:15,659 --> 00:09:17,429
Tae Sung, meet Yun Jae Hyeon.

167
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,659
I told you about him before.

168
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,830
I'm honored to meet you.

169
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,399
Right. He's playing my little brother
in the drama, right?

170
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:28,570
Let's do a good job.

171
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,309
Yes.

172
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,279
Take a seat, Jae Hyeon.

173
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:38,720
Is everyone here?

174
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,789
Almost.

175
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,350
What about Jin Yu Na?

176
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,120
There she is.

177
00:09:48,029 --> 00:09:50,389
Yu Na.

178
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,860
Say hello.

179
00:09:57,799 --> 00:10:00,399
You see, Yu Na is very shy.

180
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,210
She must be very nervous now.

181
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:04,039
Go on. Say hello.

182
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:06,379
Do it properly.

183
00:10:06,409 --> 00:10:08,779
Being polite is so important
in this industry. You know that.

184
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:10,879
Show them how polite you are.

185
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:16,120
Have a good read-through.

186
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,289
All right. Everyone is here,
so let's begin.

187
00:10:19,659 --> 00:10:20,730
Sure.

188
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,629
Let me introduce myself first.

189
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,100
I'm Director Park Han Seok.
I'm happy to work with you all.

190
00:10:35,409 --> 00:10:37,309
Hello, I'm Kang Si Duk.

191
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,940
The gukbap guy!

192
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:44,350
I heard you closed down
your successful restaurant to join us.

193
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:46,220
I wouldn't say it was successful.

194
00:10:47,049 --> 00:10:50,419
You're really good-looking,
just like Ho Young said.

195
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:51,889
Gosh, no.

196
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,419
You have an accent.

197
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,259
Pardon?

198
00:10:55,789 --> 00:10:58,159
No, I don't. I talk like a Seoul native.

199
00:10:58,460 --> 00:11:00,399
All my friends back home said so.

200
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,529
He's so cute!

201
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:05,870
Don't I sound like a Seoul native?

202
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
I don't?

203
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:10,509
- You do!
- You do!

204
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,480
He'll make it big.

205
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:14,879
He knows how to charm ladies
and keep them interested.

206
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,049
He sure learned a lot
while running the restaurant.

207
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:19,480
And he's not even aware
of what he's doing to the girls.

208
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,350
He was born to be a star.

209
00:11:21,419 --> 00:11:24,460
Let's just change his name
and fix his accent so he can get roles.

210
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,299
- Yu Sung.
- Hey, Ho Young.

211
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,870
Si Duk.

212
00:11:40,539 --> 00:11:43,440
This is Mr. Kang Yu Sung,
the head of Management Team One.

213
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,379
He's my senior colleague
who I admire the most.

214
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:49,149
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm Kang Si Duk.

215
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,179
Hello, I'm Kang Yu Sung.

216
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:53,379
Welcome to Starforce.

217
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:55,149
Thank you.

218
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:59,789
Ho Young is a very competent manager.

219
00:12:00,389 --> 00:12:01,929
You're really lucky, Si Duk.

220
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,159
I'll work hard.

221
00:12:03,659 --> 00:12:04,860
All right.

222
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,500
Ms. Kwon!

223
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:14,740
My gosh.

224
00:12:14,769 --> 00:12:17,940
- It's been so long, Tae Sung.
- Yes, I know.

225
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:20,710
- You've gotten even more handsome.
- Gosh, no.

226
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:23,850
And thank you so much for coming back.

227
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,750
Of course, I wanted to.

228
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,080
Come on in.

229
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:30,720
Gong Tae Sung.

230
00:12:30,789 --> 00:12:32,419
He won't go to counseling, right?

231
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,190
I know it was a bet,

232
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:36,990
but I'm concerned
that he scored 100 percent.

233
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,259
You know how he is.

234
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,200
He wants to focus on the drama
at the moment.

235
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:42,970
I knew he would say that.

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,200
I asked the doctor at the hospital.

237
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,940
The doctor said your stress level
could change based on your mood.

238
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,710
And a high stress level doesn't mean
there will be problems right away.

239
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:54,509
But still,
I think he should see a therapist.

240
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:56,049
I'm worried.

241
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,309
I'll talk to him again.

242
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:01,490
And...

243
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,019
about Eun Si Woo...

244
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:06,289
(Eun Si Woo Divorces
French Director Pierre Mohel)

245
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,440
(Oh Han Byeol)

246
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:34,620
What's up?

247
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,419
Well...

248
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,919
Can you just fill out
the stress assessment questionnaire?

249
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,789
I wonder if he's okay now.

250
00:13:42,529 --> 00:13:44,059
I didn't notice anything different.

251
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,899
A lot of time has passed.
Let's hope he's okay now.

252
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,600
But luckily, Ms. Kwon came back.

253
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,610
- Oh, Ms. Kwon?
- Yes.

254
00:13:55,639 --> 00:13:57,110
She took such great care of him.

255
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:07,250
Look at this feast.

256
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:10,250
I really missed your food.

257
00:14:10,289 --> 00:14:12,190
Come on. This is nothing.

258
00:14:12,889 --> 00:14:14,259
Eat before it gets cold.

259
00:14:14,289 --> 00:14:15,759
Why don't you join me?

260
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:17,559
No, I've already eaten.

261
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,700
It's been a while,
so I have a lot of work to do.

262
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,169
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

263
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,470
Thank you for the food.

264
00:14:33,409 --> 00:14:34,750
Is the seasoning okay?

265
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:38,649
Yes.

266
00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:40,850
Now that I'm getting older,

267
00:14:40,919 --> 00:14:43,620
my food keeps getting saltier.
It makes me sad.

268
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,019
No, it's perfect. It's delicious.

269
00:14:46,519 --> 00:14:47,690
I'm glad.

270
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,240
(Snaps the hand away)

271
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:03,909
(I don't need you. Get out of my life!)

272
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,830
Hello, I'm Kang Si Duk.

273
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:27,100
Hello, I'm Yun Jae Hyeon.

274
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:30,330
Where are you from? Gyeongsang Province?

275
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,570
Yes, from Daegu.

276
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,470
My gosh, you're really handsome.

277
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,710
I've never seen a celebrity before.

278
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:42,580
Gosh, I'm not a celebrity yet.

279
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,820
- Come on in.
- Thank you.

280
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:56,490
This is where you'll sleep.

281
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,129
Okay.

282
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,700
How old are you?

283
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,139
I'm 23 years old.

284
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,769
Me too. Let's cut the formalities
since we're roommates.

285
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:12,139
You are? Sure then.

286
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,759
You can't fall asleep, right?

287
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,990
I couldn't either.

288
00:16:29,059 --> 00:16:30,559
I feel like I'm in a daze.

289
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,830
I was making gukbap only a few days ago.

290
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,330
You're lucky though.

291
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,600
Our company
is notorious for being picky.

292
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,570
Is that so?

293
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,480
Starforce is every aspiring actor's
dream company.

294
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,340
Everyone dreams to enter this company.

295
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,230
Is he going on an outing?

296
00:17:08,430 --> 00:17:10,230
I guess you're seeing this
for the first time.

297
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,900
He's Eun Ha Young's manager.

298
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,700
She needs a cup of
fresh watermelon juice every morning.

299
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,740
(Cho Seok Hwan, age 36,
Ha Young's manager)

300
00:17:14,809 --> 00:17:15,940
It's for getting rid of puffiness.

301
00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,309
So it's his job
to buy watermelon every day.

302
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:20,940
Darn seeds.

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,450
He's not mad.

304
00:17:23,779 --> 00:17:26,420
He has a bad day when there are a lot
of seeds. It's a jinx.

305
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:30,119
Who's that?

306
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,019
(Lee Ji Yoon, age 27,
Shin Jae Hyung's manager)

307
00:17:31,049 --> 00:17:32,089
She's Shin Jae Hyung's manager.

308
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,160
Jae Hyung must have
freshly made stone pot rice...

309
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:35,829
for breakfast every morning.

310
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:38,730
I tried the rice once
and it was cooked perfectly.

311
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Gosh, he was a stick
when he first entered the company.

312
00:17:42,029 --> 00:17:43,430
(Jang Cheol, age 32, previously 61kg,
An So Yeon's manager)

313
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,000
The actress was on a diet,
so he ate all her food.

314
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:48,109
(Seo Sang Min, age 32, previously 82kg,
Hong Jin Seok's manager)

315
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:53,109
He lost so much weight because he went
on a diet along with the actor.

316
00:17:53,309 --> 00:17:55,150
I see they each have their sufferings.

317
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:56,680
This job isn't for the weak.

318
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,859
Jung Yeol.

319
00:18:08,829 --> 00:18:09,960
Hello.

320
00:18:10,359 --> 00:18:13,230
That bag is about to bury you.
What's inside it?

321
00:18:13,259 --> 00:18:16,230
Tae Sung is going out of town
for a shoot, so I packed some stuff.

322
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,000
I'll get going then.

323
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
Goodness.

324
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:24,069
Gosh, Jung Yeol.

325
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,410
I hope he'll stay for a long time.

326
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:38,190

Please enjoy. I'm Tae Sung's manager.

329

Yu Sung. Is our company poor?

331

That kid. He brought drinks

a buy 1 get 1 free event.

- I'm Gong Tae Sung's manager.
- What a frugal kid. He's so nice.

334
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:08,190
- I'll give you more.
- My gosh, would you look at that.

335
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,049
- Yu Na went to go take a call.
- Why did she go so far?

336
00:19:11,089 --> 00:19:12,319
She's not on vacation.

337
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,630
Hey, did you see Yu Na?

338
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:17,859
- No, why?
- I don't see her anywhere.

339
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,630
- What?
- Gosh, where did she go?

340
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:26,140
Yu Na. Where are you?

341
00:19:28,109 --> 00:19:29,240
Home?

342
00:19:30,809 --> 00:19:31,880
You went home?

343
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,920
- Hurry up and go get her.
- I'll go to her house now.

344
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,049
Hurry.

345
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:44,519
- She went home?
- Yes, she did.

To pick up a package.

347
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:48,190
It's from overseas,
so she had to receive it herself.

348
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:49,529
She has to try it on, apparently.

349
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,930
What is this circus I'm dealing with?

350
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,859
My gosh.

351
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:56,930
Please take good care of Tae Sung.

352
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,599
- What the?
- I'll give you an extra one.

353
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:02,240
You can't tell anyone, okay?

354
00:20:02,809 --> 00:20:04,269
Is he serious?

355
00:20:04,309 --> 00:20:06,940
What is he handing out?

356
00:20:09,049 --> 00:20:11,750
- I'm about to lose it.
- Seriously, me too.

(Han Seung Il, age 43,

Yes.

It's an honor. I will do my best, sir.

Goodbye.

362
00:20:53,359 --> 00:20:55,789
So Han Seung Il was
the surprising actor you mentioned?

363
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:59,230
He's a tough one. Will you be okay?

364
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,900
What? He was a total gentleman.

365
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:04,269
- I heard he's a foreigner.
- What?

366
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,069
He is? I had no idea.

367
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:10,210
Is he from America? Or Canada?

368
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,009
No, because
no one can communicate with him.

369
00:21:14,950 --> 00:21:16,549
Gosh.

370

Well, if words don't work,
then I'll use body language.

No way. He has a strong fanbase
because he used to be an idol star.

405

I'm going crazy from the angry emails

Beats me. I could never understand
that great big heart of his.

409

He never explains. It's frustrating.

given up as sacrifices then.

So I prayed it'll get low viewing rates.

But it went through the roof.
It's a new record.

417
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:10,490
Do I really have to make something up
to criticize him?

418
00:24:10,519 --> 00:24:12,819
Does he think the public is that dumb?

419
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:16,160
This isn't what I signed up for.
I feel ashamed.

He's well-mannered.

426
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:33,680
I'm a lot younger,
but he uses honorifics.

427
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:36,380
I guess you have to meet someone
in person to know them better.

it's better to be cursed out...

Yes, they gave us a lot.

00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,160

or what?

454

It makes me feel suffocated
just by hearing that.

455
00:26:11,309 --> 00:26:13,109
Tae Sung completely made a mistake.

and just get liver only."

He should've explained it like this.

00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:25,849
We'll do it again.

488
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,450
Who's the fool now?

489
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,119
(A fool)

490
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,339
(Head Attorney's Office)

491
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,150
(Head Attorney, Do Soo Hyuk)

492
00:28:02,849 --> 00:28:04,019
Mr. Do.

493
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,789
It's past six.

494
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:07,690
Really?

495
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,390
I didn't realize it was this late.

496
00:28:09,529 --> 00:28:11,089
What are you watching?

497
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,759
Oh, this?

498
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,130
Isn't it funny?

499
00:28:15,299 --> 00:28:16,670
It's a famous clip.

500
00:28:17,269 --> 00:28:19,940
Are there any legal problems
with this clip?

501
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:22,339
No. I'm just watching it
because it's cute.

502
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,509
What?

503
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,240
Do you mean Gong Tae Sung is cute?

504
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:32,619
No.

505
00:28:33,849 --> 00:28:35,019
It's just a thing.

506
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:37,519
Gosh, everyone.

507
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,829
Yu Sung, are you going to the airport?

508
00:28:50,869 --> 00:28:52,140
Yes, Jung Yeol.

509
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:54,940
Don't cause any trouble
while I'm on my business trip, okay?

510
00:28:55,069 --> 00:28:57,809
I'll pay more attention to Tae Sung...

511
00:28:57,839 --> 00:28:59,740
- so you don't have to be worried.
- Don't!

512
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,450
Don't pay too much attention to him.

513
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,420
Ask people around you
if you're not sure about anything.

514
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:07,849
Okay. Don't worry.

515
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,250
All right, Jung Yeol.

516
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,789
He has a talent for
making me feel worried somehow.

517
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,240
How much longer must we continue
this endless nonsense?

518
00:29:26,269 --> 00:29:27,369
Yesterday,

519
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,940
I released an article
with an old embarrassing picture...

520
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,009
of Do Jun Young.

521
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,380
My personal information is
all over the Internet.

522
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,849
They were saying who am I
to criticize him when I look like this.

523
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,450
I keep looking back on my way home...

524
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,920
because I think someone might
hit me from behind.

525
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:43,950
In my case,

526
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,720
I feel close to him now
after criticizing him so much.

527
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,390
I really feel sorry for him.

528
00:29:56,099 --> 00:29:57,599
(Rest in peace.)

529
00:30:03,309 --> 00:30:04,509
Is it our funeral today?

530
00:30:04,609 --> 00:30:06,210
Gosh, my heart is aching.

531
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,509
Seung Il.

532
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:13,549
Here's the cue sheet for today's event.

533
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,650
Okay.

534
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:17,950
You can come in about half an hour.

535
00:30:18,319 --> 00:30:19,420
Okay. I got it.

536
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,859
All right. See you later then.

537
00:30:28,130 --> 00:30:29,299
Ms. Park.

538
00:30:31,069 --> 00:30:32,240
Yes?

539
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,299
What is it?

540
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:36,509
Is that...

541
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:38,269
the best you can do to close the door?

542
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,410
- What?
- Close it again.

543
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,000
What was that about?

544
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,769
That was too weak.

545
00:31:03,369 --> 00:31:04,900
You need to show some effort.

546
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:09,410
Because you closed the door
so carelessly,

547
00:31:10,509 --> 00:31:12,109
my heart is closing too.

548
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,940
Very coldly, I might add.

549
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,509
Do you understand what I'm saying?

550
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,279
Yes.

551
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,049
I apologize.

552
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:24,450
I didn't mean to do that.

553
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,589
Ms. Park, the manager in the front,

554
00:31:30,259 --> 00:31:32,160
and the staff members
who are sitting behind me.

555
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,660
Listen to me very carefully.

556
00:31:34,529 --> 00:31:36,130
Imagine that you're a car.

557
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,640
It will hurt
if someone closes the door too hard.

558
00:31:39,069 --> 00:31:40,900
But what if it doesn't close properly
because you were too gentle?

559
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,740
Wouldn't it be really embarrassing?

560
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,470
Do you understand?

561
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:45,940
- Yes, sir.
- Yes.

562
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,009
- Yes.
- The way you close the door...

563
00:31:49,049 --> 00:31:51,210
shows how you feel
about the person in the car.

564
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,079
With consideration, respect, trust,

565
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:57,319
and love for mankind,
do your best when you close the door.

566
00:31:57,349 --> 00:31:58,619
Do you understand?

567
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:00,920
Yes.

568
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,859
I apologize.

569
00:32:02,890 --> 00:32:04,089
Give me my lip balm.

570
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:10,430
(- Good luck.
- Good luck.)

571
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,039
- Hello.
- Hello.

572
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,160
Tae Sung, you're here.

573
00:32:42,369 --> 00:32:44,630
The weather's so nice today.

574
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:51,970
Gosh, you crazy punk!

575
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,779
Everyone will see them
if you hang them there!

576
00:32:56,779 --> 00:32:59,319
You crazy punk!

577
00:32:59,349 --> 00:33:00,819
Do you have a death wish?

578
00:33:00,849 --> 00:33:04,049
Gosh, take them down
and get rid of them right away.

579
00:33:04,089 --> 00:33:06,059
Because of its growing presence,

580
00:33:06,089 --> 00:33:08,890
we're preparing tour products too,
which includes sightseeing.

581
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:12,200
That's why my company is getting ready
to produce dramas.

582
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,630
Excuse me for a moment.

583
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,970
Tae Sung.

584
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,640
You're crazy.

585
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,170
You must be out of your mind.

586
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,410
Why would he do laundry
when no one asked him to?

587
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:29,380
What? Laundry?

588
00:33:30,079 --> 00:33:32,220
Not you. Byun Jung Yeol!

589
00:33:34,619 --> 00:33:37,319
You stuck that punk on me.
Is that how you take care of your actor?

590
00:33:38,349 --> 00:33:39,619
He's my anti-fan, right?

591
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,420
You sent him to annoy me, right?

592
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:44,059
(My underwear was flapping in the wind!)

593
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,609
(This is strange.
I'm really busy, but I'm really bored.)

594
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,009
(It wasn't just me who felt that way.)

595
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:01,640
(Since Actor Gong went to shoot,
there's not much to talk about.)

596
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:04,180
(Gosh. What a shame.)

597
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,219
(Yu Sung)

598
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,519
Goodness. What's up with him?

599
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,659
- Hello.
(- Help me.)

600
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,119
Why? What happened?

601
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:18,059
Jung Yeol, that crazy punk. He hung
Tae Sung's underwear on the hood.

602
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:19,360
(In front of all the staff.)

603
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,659
- What?
- He's furious. He's refusing to shoot.

604
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:23,130
Things are tense there now.

605
00:34:23,530 --> 00:34:25,440
(The managers are all
at other sets now.)

606
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:27,170
Okay. You need me
to check in on him, right?

607
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,940
Yes, please help me out.

608
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,840
By the way, why did Jung Yeol do that?

609
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:34,510
That crazy punk wanted them
to dry nicely.

610
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:37,880
Okay. Don't worry.

611
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:42,650
- What's going on?
- Gosh.

612
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,730
Hello! I have an emergency.
Can I book one for today?

613
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:51,889
Please! Help me out here.

614
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,630
Yes. I have enough people.
I've got the entire PR team.

615
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:55,730
Yes, okay.

616
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,949
- Bo In. Get me those.
- Got it.

617
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:13,619
(Please take good care
of our dear Tae Sung!)

621

Who likes those grandpa snacks?

622
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:03,699
The director?

623
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,409
Well, Tae Sung.

624
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:17,780
You should go out now...

625
00:36:18,650 --> 00:36:19,750
I'm sorry.

626
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:33,130
What is that?

627
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:54,420
What?

628
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,820
Can you park it over there?

629
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,389
Like this.

630
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,469
(Please take good care of him.)

631
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,000
Hello.
Please take good care of Tae Sung.

- Sure.
- Thank you.

Ms. Oh wanted me to give this to you.

00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:23,440
Tae Sung.

652
00:38:26,510 --> 00:38:27,909
Hey, Chang Kyu.

653
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,610
This is my first day filming with you.

654
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:35,019
I feel like I'm dreaming right now.
It's an honor.

655
00:38:36,449 --> 00:38:38,019
I look forward to working with you too.

656
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:43,159
- Chang Kyu, have you eaten yet?
- Yes, I have.

657
00:38:43,190 --> 00:38:46,000
- My, what a handsome pair.
- You need to eat well.

658
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:48,559
I can feel my eyes getting clearer
just by looking at them.

659
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:53,340
Jae Hyeon seems very nervous though.

660
00:38:54,269 --> 00:38:55,639
I found you at last.

661
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,380
Cut. Hey, Chang Kyu. What are you doing?

662
00:39:07,019 --> 00:39:09,050
I'm sorry. I apologize.

663
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:11,789
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, I'm sorry.

664
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:14,260
I might have gotten
too close to his face.

665
00:39:14,289 --> 00:39:16,829
I'm really sorry.
Let's do one more take.

666
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:18,889
All right, Sin Ha. Don't get too close.

667
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:21,159
- Got it.
- Let's try again.

668
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:23,570
- We'll try again.
- Tae Sung is protecting his junior.

669
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:25,369
Look at that.

670
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:27,170
I found you at last.

671
00:39:27,469 --> 00:39:28,599
Yoon Sin Ha.

672
00:39:29,739 --> 00:39:32,940
Come on. Must you be so cold?
I'm your brother.

673
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,079
Cut.

674
00:39:38,349 --> 00:39:39,980
Hey, Chang Kyu.
You need to say your line.

675
00:39:40,019 --> 00:39:41,820
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

676
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:44,849
I messed up his hair too much.

677
00:39:45,019 --> 00:39:46,260
I'm sorry!

678
00:39:46,289 --> 00:39:48,820
It's fine. Let's try again.

679
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,730
- It's fine. Relax.
- Thank you, Tae Sung.

680
00:39:55,630 --> 00:39:58,070
There he goes again
with the nice guy act.

681
00:39:59,139 --> 00:40:00,369
I found you at last.

682
00:40:00,739 --> 00:40:01,840
Yoon Sin Ha.

683
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,969
- Hey, can you take it from here?
- Come on.

684
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,139
- Okay.
- Must you be so cold? I'm your brother.

685
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,940
Is a half-brother a real brother?

686
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:11,280
You're worse than a stranger.
Don't come find me from now on.

687
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,480
I don't need you. Get out of my life!

688
00:40:18,550 --> 00:40:20,860
Cut. My, Tae Sung.
That gaze was just perfect.

689
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:24,690
- Let's move on to the next scene!
- Next scene.

690
00:40:25,559 --> 00:40:27,260
All right. Let's do the next scene.

691
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,269
- Thank you.
- You did well.

692
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,400
It's fine.

693
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,570
All right. Let's do the next scene.

694
00:40:40,110 --> 00:40:42,579
Could you say hello to your fans?
It's been a while.

695
00:40:42,610 --> 00:40:44,880
We'll upload this
on our official YouTube channel.

696
00:40:44,909 --> 00:40:46,750
Sure. I'm good now.

697
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:53,159
- Should I start?
- Yes.

698
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,889
Hello, everyone.
I'm actor Gong Tae Sung.

699
00:40:58,929 --> 00:41:01,260
It's been so long, right?

700
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:04,730
I'm filming "The World of Stars"
at the moment.

701
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,170
Please wait just a little longer.
Thank you.

702
00:41:11,639 --> 00:41:13,840
- Thank you!
- Thank you.

703
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:17,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

704
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,349
By the way,

705
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:23,019
where's Oh Han Byeol?

706
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:26,119
Oh, they needed help
with the coffee truck.

707
00:41:26,159 --> 00:41:27,760
This was a last-minute thing.

708
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:29,289
I see, the coffee truck.

709
00:41:30,489 --> 00:41:32,260
I should go have some coffee.

710
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:37,630
Here's your Americano. Enjoy.

711
00:41:41,239 --> 00:41:43,639
- Two Americanos, please.
- Would you like it hot?

712
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:44,940
- Yes, please.
- Sure.

713
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:50,449
Two Americanos for you.

714
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:55,380
Let's see.

715
00:41:57,289 --> 00:41:59,760
What? If you're going to get in my way,
just get lost.

716
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,460
What? "Get lost"?

717
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,559
Hey. That's no way to talk to someone
who's here to help.

718
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:05,860
I guess you're not busy.

719
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:07,460
Two Americanos, please.

720
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,269
Two Americanos, got it.

721
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,199
My gosh. Will you make it yourself?

722
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:15,500
Of course. One moment, please.

723
00:42:15,539 --> 00:42:16,570
Sure.

724
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,409
Hey. Do you even know
how to make coffee?

725
00:42:20,679 --> 00:42:21,840
Don't you remember?

726
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:25,050
(I played a barista
in one of my old dramas.)

727
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:26,949
(Right.)

728
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:29,550
Yes, I remember now.

729
00:42:29,590 --> 00:42:31,820
You gave me a cup of coffee
you kindly made for me...

730
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:33,719
with some fish sauce added.

731
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,320
How nice of you.

732
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:39,900
That was when...

733
00:42:42,130 --> 00:42:44,230
you told the whole country
that I was impotent.

734
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:49,610
Well, why don't we talk about...

735
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:52,039
who's made more humiliating blunders?

736
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,639
Shall we? Do you want to play that game?

737
00:42:55,679 --> 00:42:57,980
Shall we have this debate right here?

738
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:00,019
- Bring it on.
- Shall I?

739
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:01,920
Why smile right before a showdown?

740
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,949
- Go ahead and...
- Are you selling coffee here?

741
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,489
No, we're not selling it for money.

742
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,530
Is there anything you want?

743
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,230
- He's handsome.
- I've seen you on TV.

744
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:18,699
Yes. That's right.
I'm treating everyone today.

745
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:21,440
It's not good to drink caffeine
at night.

746
00:43:21,570 --> 00:43:23,739
How about a warm cup of yuzu tea?

747
00:43:26,110 --> 00:43:27,880
Sure. Thank you.

748
00:43:27,909 --> 00:43:29,179
No problem. One moment, please.

749
00:43:47,530 --> 00:43:48,699
Here you go.

750
00:43:49,329 --> 00:43:50,530
Thank you.

751
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:52,570
Enjoy the tea and stay healthy.

752
00:44:05,349 --> 00:44:07,250
What's wrong? Honey!

753
00:44:08,219 --> 00:44:10,320
- Sir!
- My gosh. Wake up.

754
00:44:10,349 --> 00:44:13,360
- Sir!
- What happened?

755
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:15,789
- My gosh.
- Are you all right, sir?

756
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,429
Sir.

757
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:22,059
Please call for help, Ms. Oh.

758
00:44:22,099 --> 00:44:24,400
Tae Sung, bring me my black bag
from the car, please.

759
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,969
Stay with me.

760
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:29,440
I'm calling from Byeolsan Marina Harbor.

761
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:32,010
An elderly man fainted on the streets.

762
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:33,510
Yes.

763
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:34,909
Please hurry.

764
00:44:36,550 --> 00:44:38,150
Take out the defibrillator, please.

765
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,059
(Device is operating.)

766
00:44:54,159 --> 00:44:55,699
(Take off the patient's top.)

767
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,039
(Please stick the pads as shown
in the picture.)

768
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,199
(Take off the patient's top.)

769
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:06,340
(Please stick the pads as shown
in the picture.)

770
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:15,550
What happened?

771
00:45:15,579 --> 00:45:17,119
Did they call for help?

772
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,159
Is that so?

773
00:45:28,329 --> 00:45:29,969
Thank you. Okay.

774
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,400
Tae Sung. The elderly man is safe now.

775
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:39,780
I'm glad.

776
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,250
Byun Jung Yeol.

777
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:46,519
Yes?

778
00:45:47,449 --> 00:45:49,150
You're good at giving first aid.

779
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:51,320
Thank you, sir.

780
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,329
You could go back to doing that
if you get fired as a manager.

781
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,429
Oh, right.

782
00:46:05,170 --> 00:46:07,969
But why do you carry a defibrillator?

783
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,809
Just in case you faint while working.

784
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:13,110
It's not like I'm hoping for it though.

785
00:46:13,139 --> 00:46:14,280
Just to be extra prepared.

786
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:17,980
Stop blabbering.

787
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,630
Gosh.

788
00:46:49,079 --> 00:46:50,909
- Yes?
- Hey, Han Byeol.

789
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,579
You must be exhausted.

790
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:55,219
I'm fine. It was fun for a change.

791
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:59,090
Tae Sung is in a better mood now
so we don't have to worry.

792
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,320
Okay.

793
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:01,760
Another thing.

794
00:47:01,789 --> 00:47:03,659
Passionate Mr. Byun
was at it again today.

795
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:06,429
What? What did he do now?

796
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,099
No, I mean in a good way.

797
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:10,630
I'll tell you once you're back.

798
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:13,769
Okay. I'll see you at work.

799
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,039
(- Okay.)
- Bye.

800
00:47:17,539 --> 00:47:18,710
Gosh.

801
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:46,869
No presence... No.

802
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,639
(Why Do Jun Young Has No Presence
Even As the Lead)

803
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,340
Little presence?

804
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:54,480
(Why Do Jun Young Has Little Presence
Even As the Lead)

805
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:55,940
Slightly disappointing?

806
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,179
What am I doing?

807
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,190
Yes.

808
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:07,090
I found out why your director is mad.

809
00:48:07,289 --> 00:48:08,960
The directors all got together recently.

810
00:48:08,989 --> 00:48:11,090
Do Jun Young was at the next table,
so he came to say hi.

811
00:48:11,159 --> 00:48:13,800
- Okay.
- He poured a drink for everyone.

812
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,000
But he left when it was your director's
turn because of an urgent matter.

813
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:21,239
Darn it. All this nonsense for that?

814
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:24,239
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

815
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:29,010
- Ms. Cho Ki Ppeum?
- Yes?

Oh, yes.

817
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,760
- Please sign here.
- Okay.

818
00:48:42,119 --> 00:48:43,789
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

819
00:48:49,829 --> 00:48:52,699

closes your mouth shut!)

All of you.

823
00:49:04,949 --> 00:49:06,719
Why are you all so weak?

824
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:10,550
Is that all you can muster up
to chew Do Jun Young out?

- Boss!

Do you know how many polyps I have?

827
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:19,159
It's stress. That's why I have polyps.

828
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:21,329
Gosh, seriously.

829
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,730
You forced me to slander my baby.

830
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,929
What?

831
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:27,769
Do Jun Young is your son?

832
00:49:29,469 --> 00:49:30,940

00:49:30,969 --> 00:49:32,110

Hey, did you arrive safely?

837
00:49:52,090 --> 00:49:53,929
Yes, I just arrived at the airport.

I'm sorry
I didn't take better care of you.

843

844

What? Are you sure?

845
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:09,139
Well...

846
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,809
It's all over the news now.
We can't fire him.

847
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,119
It will only tarnish my image.

848
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,519
I'll keep him around for a while.

849

Just for a while.

850
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:21,289
All right. Then should we keep him?

851
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:23,730
Yes.

(Snacks for Gong Tae Sung Only)

857
00:51:09,639 --> 00:51:10,570

They're for when you get
too tired to drive, just in case.

It's sweet.

862
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,730
Well, of course. It's candy.

863
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,030
Start driving. We'll be late.

864
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,440
Okay, I'll go now.

865
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:41,869
All right.

866
00:52:41,099 --> 00:52:42,260
Did something happen?

867
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:49,000
Yes, Mr. Do?

868
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:50,940
Hi, nothing is the matter.

869
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,780
I just happen to be in front of you.

870
00:52:54,809 --> 00:52:55,940
In front?

871
00:53:01,420 --> 00:53:02,750
I almost had a heart attack.

872
00:53:06,989 --> 00:53:10,230
I understood immediately
what my call on the weekend means.

873
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:11,760
I'm sorry.

874
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,559
This leisurely feeling
was starting to make me feel uneasy.

875
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:17,369
You called me right at that moment.

876
00:53:18,099 --> 00:53:19,329
I'll be careful not to do that.

877
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:21,199
It's fine since nothing happened.

878
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:23,000
I'll just pass by
if I see you like this again.

879
00:53:23,039 --> 00:53:24,510
You can at least say hi.

880
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,309
You think I live a tiring life, right?

881
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:34,849
Can you not take calls after work hours
or on weekends?

882
00:53:35,579 --> 00:53:38,019
I would love to do that.

883
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:42,860
But there could be something I miss
in that short period of time.

884
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:50,599
Oh, right. Well...

885
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,829
Since nothing happened, coffee is on me.

886
00:53:53,099 --> 00:53:56,000
No. I gave you a scare,

887
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:57,610
so it's my treat today.

888
00:53:57,639 --> 00:54:00,840
Then I won't refuse and order
the most expensive thing on the menu.

889
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,110
I'll get some cake too.

890
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,349
What should I eat?

891
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:16,960
Gosh. They look so great together.

892
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,690
They do look good together.

893
00:54:18,829 --> 00:54:20,860
But I don't think
they're in a relationship.

894
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:23,059
Am I wrong? Are they dating?

895
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:24,699
Gosh. I have no idea.

896
00:54:25,530 --> 00:54:27,099
What's going on between these two?

897

We can't ask them directly.
This is frustrating.

Shocking news. Oh Han Byeol's mind
remains a mystery.

899
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,010

This has too much respect in it.

Okay, nice.
