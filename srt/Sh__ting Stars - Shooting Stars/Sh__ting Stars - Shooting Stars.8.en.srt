You should've given her
some flowers or a ring.

But why did she...

17

run away while screaming?

18
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,960

Oh Han Byeol? Who's that?

23

Long time no see.

24
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,729

I'm sorry. I got impatient.

29
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,399

- No.

to the hospital. I don't want that.

60
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:04,819
Hello, I'm Oh Han Byeol
from the Class of 2012.

61
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,259
I'll begin my presentation.

62
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,889
The movie
I'm going to introduce today...

63
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,829
is a romance film called "Love Affair".

64
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:16,029
"Love Affair" is a classic love story...

65
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,769
where a man and a woman fall in love
and promise to meet again.

66
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:23,269
The original version was filmed in 1932.

67
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:24,240
(Oh Han Byeol)

68
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,550
And the film
has gone through three remakes...

69
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,379
in 1939, 1957, and 1994.

70
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:34,649
The remakes from 1939 and 1957...

What are you doing here?

73
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,490
I looked for you everywhere!

74
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,340
"A rare and odd occasion."

75
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:27,809
Right.

76
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:29,809
That was so weird.

77
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,740
I like you.

78
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,279
Is that what people say these days
to pick a fight?

79
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,190
That's right.

80
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,190
He's figured out a new way
to make fun of me.

81
00:09:43,289 --> 00:09:44,860
Yes. That's it, right?

82
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,460
He's an actor after all.

83

I almost fell for his trick.

who has to retake her exams, okay?

85
00:10:05,779 --> 00:10:07,039
That was so embarrassing.

86
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,980
I should've just ignored him.

87
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:13,350
But why is he so handsome?

00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,710
Well...

91
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:37,240
This is a big school.
I'm sure I won't run into him.

92
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,840
No way.

93

He keeps missing
the team project meetings.

103
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,899
Wait until I find you.

104

00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:09,409
What are you doing here?

106
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,009

Hey, you're up. How are you feeling?

111
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,830
Oh, that.

112
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,629
I'm fine.

113
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,399
Sit. Let's have breakfast.

It's fine. It doesn't bother me.

117
00:12:29,289 --> 00:12:31,289
That's not important right now.

118
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,759
Why? Is something going on?

119
00:12:33,889 --> 00:12:35,259
I confessed my feelings...

120
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,889
- to Oh Han Byeol.
- What?

121
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:43,269
I see.

122
00:12:43,570 --> 00:12:44,539
What did she say?

123
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,240
- She ran off.
- What?

124
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,070
What exactly did you say to her?

125
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:49,740
Did you fight
while telling her you liked her?

126
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,679
No. We didn't fight.

127
00:12:51,710 --> 00:12:53,080
I just asked her...

128
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,179
- if there was something going on.
- What?

129
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,549
I asked her if anything was up with her.

130
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,919
I'll do it again properly another time.

131
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,860
I caught her off guard yesterday.

132
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,799
All right. Good luck.

133
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,299
- By the way,
- Yes.

134
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,870
you...

135
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:27,750
I hope you have no feelings or
romantic inclinations toward Han Byeol.

136
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,549
What?

137
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,580
Well, I just don't want us...

138
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,649
to end up in a love triangle.

139
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:38,159
I'm already so annoyed by Do Soo Hyuk,
my next-door neighbor.

140
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:41,129
Besides, Han Byeol is so pretty.

141
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:43,590
- How could anyone not like her?
- This is nuts.

142
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,309
Why won't you answer?
You're making me nervous.

143
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,110
Answer me now.

144
00:13:56,139 --> 00:13:58,539
Not at all. Never, I swear.

145
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:03,610
For some reason, I'm never romantically
attracted to people I work with.

146
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,620
Then why are you guys so close?

147
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:07,320
You put your arm around her like this.

148
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:09,419
What do you think? We bonded...

149
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,620
while cleaning up your mess.
I'd call it "comradeship".

150
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:14,929
Right?

151
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,259
Yes, that's it.

152
00:14:19,259 --> 00:14:20,600
I was worried for nothing.

153
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,200
My goodness.

154
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:26,000
I can't be the only one witnessing this.
This is too good not to share.

155
00:14:26,470 --> 00:14:28,970
- I should take a video.
- No. It's for your eyes only.

156
00:14:29,009 --> 00:14:30,309
- Come on.
- Put that down.

157
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:11,049
I've been lonely for so long...

158
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:14,049
and now I suddenly have
two men in my life.

159
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:17,659
Gosh, I hit the jackpot.

160
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:19,259
Jackpot, my foot.

161
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:52,389
Ms. Oh.

162
00:15:54,159 --> 00:15:55,360
Good morning.

163
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,500
Mr. Do. Yes, it's morning.

164
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,769
And it's good.

165
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:06,169
I came because Director Choi
wanted to discuss something.

166
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:09,610
- Did something bad...
- No, nothing bad happened.

167
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:11,110
So no need to get nervous.

168
00:16:12,179 --> 00:16:14,710
Nervous? I'm not nervous.

169
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:19,980
I should drink some coffee.

170
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:29,230
Gosh, the water.

171
00:16:30,129 --> 00:16:32,629
The water pressure is great.

172
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:40,169
Okay, act natural and confident.

173
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,539
Why can't I walk right?

174
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:47,580
Okay. It's not like I committed a crime.

175
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:49,809
Why is this not working?

176
00:16:54,789 --> 00:16:56,049
Thank you.

177
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:57,620
Have a good day.

178
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,220
You too, Mr. Do.

179
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,309
Hello, Ms. Oh.

180
00:17:24,349 --> 00:17:26,650
- You're here.
- Hello.

181
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:39,160
(So why do you think...)

182
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,670
(I'm here with people I work with
at this hour?)

183
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,240
Do you like someone from our team?

184
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:57,009
It's me.

185
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,480
It seems like this is news to you.

186
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,789
I will give you some time to respond.

187
00:18:12,099 --> 00:18:13,329
Yes, hello?

188
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,130
Is there something going on with me? No.

189
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:17,799
"Something going on"?

190
00:18:17,839 --> 00:18:18,900
(Is there something going on with you?)

191
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,400
There's something...

192
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,440
going on with me.

193
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:23,940
I...

194
00:18:24,839 --> 00:18:26,039
I like you.

195
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,079
Okay.

196
00:18:35,619 --> 00:18:37,049
(Has Ms. Oh gone insane?)

197
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,359
(Is the workload too much?)

198
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,359
(Shocking news.
Oh Han Byeol's three-step transition...)

199
00:18:41,390 --> 00:18:42,559
(shocks everyone!)

200
00:18:43,329 --> 00:18:44,900
(I'm so scared.)

201
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,509
Tae Sung.
Why are you scrunched up like that?

202
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:01,779
I not only failed miserably...

203
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,779
but also crawled the wall.

204
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:06,119
What? Crawl where?

205
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:08,220
I heard Do Soo Hyuk,
that punk confessed to her too.

206
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,789
Why are they so comfortable
around each other?

207
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:14,089
"Have a good day. You too, Mr. Do."

208
00:19:14,589 --> 00:19:15,930
That does look comfortable.

209
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,359
Did you stop by the office this morning?

210
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:20,599
Yes.

211
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:23,230
I went to go see Han Byeol
and ended up just staring at the wall.

212
00:19:24,069 --> 00:19:25,470
Han Byeol...

213
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,470
She probably didn't run away
when Soo Hyuk confessed, right?

214
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,869
No, she probably didn't.

215
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,579
She even screamed as she ran away.

216
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:39,049
Exactly how did she scream?

217
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:43,150
- Is that important?
- Yes, incredibly.

218
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,759
Was it this?

219
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,660
Or this?

220
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:49,089
Let me think.

221
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,400
It was this.

222
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,200
Gosh, that is unfortunate.

223
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,599
It should've been this scream.

224
00:20:01,410 --> 00:20:03,569
Did you do something wrong to Ms. Oh?

225
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:06,609
Well...

226
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,250
I shouldn't have asked.

227
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:10,880
There's too many to count, right?

228
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:12,180
Yes.

229
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,549
But nothing to the point
to justify her screaming like that.

230
00:20:16,589 --> 00:20:18,619
I personally don't get it.

231
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,390
Write them down.

232
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,359
(Argued when we first met by asking
why she was crying at the theater)

233
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:25,500
(Made her go to work
and school simultaneously)

234
00:20:25,529 --> 00:20:27,500
- I get it now.
- Me too.

235
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:29,500
It was vague at first
but now it's crystal clear.

236
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:31,940
This would cause anyone
to run away screaming.

237
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,009
But it's not over yet, Tae Sung.

238
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,410
I got you great intel.

239
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,920
Also known as, TMI about Oh Han Byeol.

240
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,190
Try to find something in common
between the two of you.

241
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,460
Okay!

242
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,259
First, Ms. Oh prefers
to dip her tangsuyuk in the sauce.

243
00:20:54,289 --> 00:20:55,390
She likes it crunchy.

244
00:20:57,359 --> 00:20:59,230
Next, she likes
mint chocolate chip ice cream.

245
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,400
"Gosh, it's so refreshing."

246
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:06,299
She also likes pineapples on her pizza.

247
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,240
"Aloha."

248
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:09,670
Darn it.

249
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:12,779
She likes chicken breast.

250
00:21:12,809 --> 00:21:14,849
Me too!

251
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:15,950
Wrong answer.

252
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,880
You should like drumsticks
so you don't fight over the breast.

253
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:19,380
It doesn't matter...

254
00:21:20,019 --> 00:21:21,650
Each person should get
one whole chicken anyway.

255
00:21:27,789 --> 00:21:29,259
Kang Yu Sung?

256
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:33,799
You mean the actor, right?

257
00:21:35,069 --> 00:21:36,630
Yes, okay.

258
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:39,500
Send me the file.
I'll review it and get back to you.

259
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,910
Okay, thank you.

260
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,869
Knock-knock.

261
00:21:44,009 --> 00:21:46,140
You're here, Yu Sung.

262
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,450
Yes, it's your colleague Kang Yu Sung.

263
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:52,579
I'm receiving a lot of calls
asking for the actor too.

264
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:54,849
It's confusing, isn't it?
I gave them your number.

265
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,920
This is also for Yu Sung.

266
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,720
Thank you.

267
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:02,589
Also, I'm sorry for causing
you a hassle.

268
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:05,000
It's not a hassle. I'm proud of you.

269
00:22:05,359 --> 00:22:06,960
Just buy me a nice Hanwoo beef dinner...

270
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,000
when Yu Sung's commercial airs.

271
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,970
Yes, I'll treat you to the best Hanwoo.

272
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,440
All right. Hang in there.

273
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,660
You still didn't give Mr. Do an answer?

274
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:36,490
No.

275
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,599
Didn't you meet at the office?

276
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,569
Yes, we did.

277
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,670
He acted like any other day though.

278
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,200
Only I was awkward.

279
00:22:45,339 --> 00:22:47,640
Gosh, he's so mature.

280
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,140
So what's your plan?
You should at least go on a date.

281
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,039
Han Byeol.

282
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,410
You don't think going on one date
leads to marriage, do you?

283
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:00,650
She does.

284
00:23:06,859 --> 00:23:08,359
Something else happened, right?

285
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,359
No, nothing happened.

286
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:12,759
I don't think so.

287
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Gosh, I'm screwed.

288
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,599
I think giving the name Yu Sung
to Si Duk was a mistake.

289
00:23:21,069 --> 00:23:23,809
Hearing it nonstop
is making my heart flutter...

290
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:25,339
and beat faster.

291
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,640
What are you going on about?

292
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:30,180
Do you like Kang Yu Sung?

293
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,880
Yes, I do.

294
00:23:34,279 --> 00:23:36,690
- You knew about this?
- Only recently.

295
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:41,259
You named your actor after the guy
you have a crush on?

296
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,859
Gosh, is this a drama or what?

297
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,099
Is this entertainment agency
the place to find love?

298
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,559
I've been meaning to ask you.

299
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:49,630
Since when did you like Yu Sung?

300
00:23:51,369 --> 00:23:52,500
Well...

301
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,740
(Gong Tae Sung Autograph Event)

302
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:56,170
(A few years ago,
when Tae Sung had a fan sign event,)

303
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:58,309
(- I was his bodyguard.)
- Tae Sung.

304
00:23:58,339 --> 00:23:59,579
This is a present for you.

305
00:23:59,609 --> 00:24:02,279
Really? Thank you so much.
Goodness. It's so pretty.

306
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:05,619
- What's your name?
- Well...

307
00:24:06,079 --> 00:24:07,519
Baek Da Hye.

308
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:08,690
Baek?

309
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,519
It's Baek Da Hye.

310
00:24:13,190 --> 00:24:15,230
- Baek Da Hye?
- Yes.

311
00:24:16,890 --> 00:24:18,759
(To Da Hye.)

312
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,339
Ms. Park. I'm stepping out for a bit.

313
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:31,710
Goodness. Is this a present for me?

314
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,809
Excuse me.

315
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,509
Hello.

316
00:24:34,579 --> 00:24:38,519
I'm Team Manager Kang Yu Sung
of Starforce Entertainment.

317
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:44,420
(Back then, I didn't think
Da Hye could become an actress.)

318
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:48,430
(I thought he got her number
because he was interested in her.)

319
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:52,059
(- And about six months later...)
- She should be here by now.

320
00:25:16,049 --> 00:25:17,190
Ms. Park.

321
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,160
Hello.

322
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,029
Did you see that?

323
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:23,829
Yes, I did.

324
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:26,660
She's the woman from
Gong Tae Sung's fan sign event, right?

325
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:28,029
You're right.

326
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,529
You have a good memory.

327
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,799
I almost didn't recognize her.

328
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:35,539
She got much prettier than before.

329
00:25:35,970 --> 00:25:38,069
Yes. Her name is Baek Da Hye.

330
00:25:38,809 --> 00:25:40,440
She'll become even more famous
from now on.

331
00:25:40,579 --> 00:25:42,410
I'm going to make sure that happens.

332
00:25:53,859 --> 00:25:55,490
You sound a bit...

333
00:25:55,759 --> 00:25:57,059
like a pervert.

334
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,299
Your heart fluttered
when he only talked about another woman.

335
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,329
It seems that
Yu Sung was too proud of Da Hye.

336
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:03,930
Goodness.

337
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:07,039
Let's just say I found him charming
because he was working hard.

338
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,539
Okay. He's so cool.

339
00:26:11,569 --> 00:26:13,109
He sure does work hard.

340
00:26:14,109 --> 00:26:15,109
Goodness.

341
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,349
The drunk fairy.

342
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,849
You're all dressed today.

343
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:24,349
Gosh. Stop teasing me.

344
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:26,460
You're shooting a commercial
because of that.

345
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,059
You got so lucky.

346
00:26:28,259 --> 00:26:29,930
You're shooting a commercial too.

347
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:33,299
But I'm shooting it with that wench.

348
00:26:34,029 --> 00:26:35,099
Gosh.

349
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:36,470
Why do I have to shoot
my first commercial with her?

350
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,640
This is so annoying.

351
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,299
Did you two fight again?

352
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:43,769
Don't get me started.

353
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,910
I don't even want to look at her.

354
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,609
Did you read the new script?

355
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:51,079
No, not yet.

356
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:53,680
- There's a kissing scene.
- Really?

357
00:26:55,049 --> 00:26:57,319
Considering the development
of the story,

358
00:26:57,349 --> 00:26:58,789
it's about time the two leads kiss.

359
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:01,220
- Is that so?
- Yes.

360
00:27:01,289 --> 00:27:04,490
That's the rule of kissing in dramas.

361
00:27:04,759 --> 00:27:05,930
Is it?

362
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:07,559
By the way,

363
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,099
you have one too.

364
00:27:10,829 --> 00:27:11,970
Me?

365
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:20,480
Yu Sung. Can't they use a substitute?

366
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:21,750
What do you think?

367
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,980
How can I kiss her
when I don't even want to touch her?

368
00:27:25,150 --> 00:27:27,119
Jae Hyeon, this isn't a kiss.

369
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,490
You're just working here.

370
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,549
It's not a big deal.

371
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,920
You guys are kissing because it's work.

372
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:34,990
That's it.

373
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:38,460
It's all right.

374
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:41,259
I'm not doing it.

375
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,599
I have to kiss that jerk?

376
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,569
Yu Na.

377
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,200
This is work.

378
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,339
Rookie actors like you must do
as you're told to do.

379
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,079
Then just let me go.

380
00:27:52,109 --> 00:27:54,109
Yu Na. How can we let you go?

381
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,980
Do I really have to kiss
in a kissing scene?

382
00:27:57,349 --> 00:27:59,150
Do I have to die if my character dies?

383
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,519
Gosh, Yu Na.
Everything you say makes perfect sense.

384
00:28:01,549 --> 00:28:03,349
You've become so smart.

385
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,720
You sound so logical.

386
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:05,960
I'm not doing it.

387
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:08,559
If they won't remove the kissing scene,
tell them to kill off Se Mi.

388
00:28:08,589 --> 00:28:11,859
How can they kill off Se Mi
all of a sudden?

389
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,829
Hello. Mr. Jin.

390
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:19,170
What?

391
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,099
Goodness.

392
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,769
I will deliver
every word you said to her.

393
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,279
Okay. Bye.

394
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,180
What is it?

395
00:28:29,309 --> 00:28:30,980
- What?
- Yu Na.

396
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:32,279
It was your father.

397
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,720
He said if you quit again,

398
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:35,690
he'll take away
all the credit cards you have.

399
00:28:36,789 --> 00:28:37,950
What do you think will happen then?

400
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:40,420
You have to say goodbye...

401
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,690
to those lovely Hermes bags as of today.

402
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,200
Hey.

403
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:53,170
I'll kill you
if you make us do a retake.

404
00:28:53,269 --> 00:28:54,440
Just do your job, okay?

405
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,339
I'll kill you if you use your tongue.

406
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:00,109
Hey, you should worry about yourself.

407
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,849
They shouldn't fight again.

408
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,450
- Let's separate them after the shoot.
- Okay.

409
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,490
- Get ready, Min Kyu.
- Okay.

410
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:18,089
Shall we kiss?

411
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:19,799
- No.
- What?

412
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:21,430
Sorry?

413
00:29:21,829 --> 00:29:24,170
I've never been rejected before.

414
00:29:25,099 --> 00:29:26,099
What's wrong?

415
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:27,769
There's nothing between us.

416
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,710
Let's date then.

417
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,869
Starting today, we're a couple.

418
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,829
Cut. Okay.

419
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
Guys, I said cut.

420
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,569
He said cut.

421
00:30:31,569 --> 00:30:32,640
Go.

422
00:30:36,309 --> 00:30:37,339
- Jae Hyeon.
- You did great.

423
00:30:37,369 --> 00:30:38,369
- Good job.
- Just go.

424
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,839
Get the car ready.

425
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,480
(Let's be together forever, Gong.)

426
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:52,960
(What is a kiss?)

427
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:56,789
(I want to meet my lover soon.)

428
00:30:58,430 --> 00:30:59,829
(I hope you meet someone to kiss.
That's all for today.)

429
00:31:07,839 --> 00:31:09,039
Da Hye.

430
00:31:10,839 --> 00:31:12,079
What's wrong?

431
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:15,779
Are you sick?

432
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,880
I was putting on a lip mask.

433
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:24,420
I thought you got sick
before your kissing scene tomorrow.

434
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,559
That won't happen.

435
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:27,059
Even if I get sick,

436
00:31:27,589 --> 00:31:29,460
I have to do the kissing scene
no matter what.

437
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:32,930
Did you get the relaxing pills?

438
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:36,029
I think I've developed a tolerance.
They don't work anymore.

439
00:31:37,099 --> 00:31:39,400
Yu Sung, I was thinking about...

440
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,339
(inviting my parents to the set.)

441
00:31:41,839 --> 00:31:42,910
What?

442
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,880
So they can see the last of me.
That will make me a filial daughter.

443
00:31:49,609 --> 00:31:51,849
You want to shoot a kissing scene
in front of your parents?

444
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,319
That's an interesting way
to become a filial daughter.

445
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,190
I didn't think that far.

446
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:01,160
I'll be there instead of your parents.

447
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:02,890
I'll keep my eyes on you.

448
00:32:03,089 --> 00:32:05,059
No ad-libs and no mistakes, okay?

449
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,460
All right.

450
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:32,490
Ms. Oh. We're ready. Let's go.

451
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,690
Gosh.

452
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,160
Are you feeling sick?

453
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:41,960
Did you catch it from Eun Soo?

454
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,099
Well, I...

455
00:32:43,829 --> 00:32:46,700
I think I have a fever.

456
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,269
You should take a day off.

457
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,779
I have to be there.

458
00:32:53,809 --> 00:32:56,079
There will be many reporters
since the set will be open to them.

459
00:32:56,410 --> 00:32:59,519
I really want to go,

460
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:02,349
but I think I have a bad fever.

461
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:03,750
Gosh. Hold on.

462
00:33:04,289 --> 00:33:06,119
I think this is bad.

463
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,029
It's 36.5°C.

464
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:11,059
You're perfectly fine.

465
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,660
I think you can go to the set.

466
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,359
What a relief.

467
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,170
What a relief.

468
00:33:17,569 --> 00:33:19,769
I'm so excited. I can go to the set.

469
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:22,440
Gosh, I'm so excited.

470
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,079
You also...

471
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:37,890
- Yes.
- want to finish up fast...

472
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,819
and rest, right?

473
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,720
Yes.

474
00:33:41,759 --> 00:33:44,289
Okay.
Let's do this fast and get it done.

475
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,259
Let's rehearse now.

476
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,430
Okay.

477
00:33:49,369 --> 00:33:51,029
I will hold you like this.

478
00:33:52,599 --> 00:33:56,269
Would it be better on this side?

479
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,039
Or this side?

480
00:33:59,109 --> 00:34:02,109
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

481
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,210
All right. Then how about this side?

482
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,920
Director, what do you think?

483
00:34:07,950 --> 00:34:10,190
- The last one has the best angle.
- The last one?

484
00:34:10,219 --> 00:34:12,260
- This side?
- Okay.

485
00:34:12,289 --> 00:34:14,119
Okay. Let's do this. Let's go.

486
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,389
Let's start!

487
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:19,030
Do you want some water?

488
00:34:19,059 --> 00:34:20,599
- No. I'm good.
- Okay.

489
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:26,300
Thank you for your answer.
That's it for the interview.

490
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:39,019
I professed my feelings to you.
When will you give me your answer?

491
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,050
Oh, that's...

492
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,619
What are you doing?

493
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,929
If you feel the same way as I do,

494
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,000
just close your eyes.

495
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:21,659
Cut. Okay.

496
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,190
My, that was so beautiful.
You're the master of kissing scenes.

497
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,599
- Well done.
- Thank you.

498
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,699
- Hey, Jung Ro.
- Yes. Let's move on to the next scene!

499
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,670
- Hey, Da Hye.
- Yu Sung, I managed to stay calm.

500
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,170
Yes, well done.

501
00:35:36,769 --> 00:35:37,809
Let's go now.

502
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,139
Good, keep going.
Alternate your arms and legs.

503
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,460
Did you see it?

504
00:36:01,300 --> 00:36:02,369
See what?

505
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:04,570
The kissing scene.

506
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:06,840
Yes.

507
00:36:08,969 --> 00:36:11,639
Did you come here
to watch my kissing scene?

508
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,110
Are you crazy?

509
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,150
Don't you know that the set will be open
to the reporters in a bit?

510
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,510
That's why I'm here.

511
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:22,019
It's just work, you know.
The kissing scene.

512
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:24,949
I didn't say anything.

513
00:36:27,159 --> 00:36:29,190
I mean, it's like...

514
00:36:29,329 --> 00:36:32,090
It's just like you
writing press releases.

515
00:36:32,559 --> 00:36:35,900
Yes. I'm going to write
in the press release...

516
00:36:35,929 --> 00:36:37,599
that you're the master
of kissing scenes.

517
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,670
Really? Thanks.

518
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,070
You're thanking me?

519
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,780
No. That came out wrong.
I just meant to say...

520
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:49,909
- That day...
- Ms. Oh.

521
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:51,079
Reporter Han is asking for you.

522
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,090
That day...

523
00:36:59,019 --> 00:37:00,090
That day...

524
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:08,530
Hey, it's Gong Tae Sung.

525
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:10,670
Who knew I'd run into you here?

526
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,639
How come I never saw you until now
when I'm filming here too?

527
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:15,940
What? Yeo Ha Jin?

528
00:37:16,210 --> 00:37:18,139
Gosh, you're still as handsome as ever.

529
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,579
I bet you're still rude and selfish too.

530
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:24,380
Can't you at least pretend to be happy
to see your ex-girlfriend?

531
00:37:24,610 --> 00:37:26,019
Ex-girlfriend, my foot.

532
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,480
Did you forget that
we were officially a couple?

533
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:30,690
We got photos taken
and had to admit it right away.

534
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:33,820
Your PR team worked so fast that
I almost wanted to join your agency.

535
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:38,730
Who admitted the relationship?

536
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,829
Who do you think? Your agency did.

537
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:44,400
Are you dating Yeo Ha Jin?

538
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,070
You're not, right?

539
00:37:46,469 --> 00:37:47,500
(I am.)

540
00:37:49,139 --> 00:37:50,239
Gosh!

541
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,980
Wait, hold on.

542
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,550
What? I was just saying.

543
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,179
I won't join your agency
even if you ask me to.

544
00:37:58,849 --> 00:38:00,679
- Move. I'm busy.
- Ha Jin.

545
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,820
Mr. Lee!

546
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:04,650
Did the shoot go well?

547
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:06,719
Yes. Are you here to pick me up?

548
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,059
Yes, of course.

549
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,190
He's on the ground.

550
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,760
Don't mind him.
He's thinking about something.

551
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,829
Hold on.

552
00:38:16,130 --> 00:38:18,000
He's Gong Tae Sung, right?

553
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,769
The news about your relationship
with him broke out three years ago,

554
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,139
on March 8 at 9:15pm.

555
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,610
Come on.
You don't have to remember such details.

556
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,150
It's not that I have a good memory.
I just can't forget things.

557
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:30,480
I told you.

558
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,980
I want to live a simple life,

559
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,420
remembering just 5 or 6 things.

560
00:38:36,389 --> 00:38:37,449
Right.

561
00:38:38,289 --> 00:38:41,389
Should we just let him stay
on the ground like that and get going?

562
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,829
Yes, let's go.

563
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,199
Tae Sung!

564
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,230
Why are you on the ground?

565
00:38:52,269 --> 00:38:53,400
Jung Yeol.

566
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,210
The shoelaces and the fish extract
weren't the problem.

567
00:38:58,039 --> 00:39:00,139
- Listen. Sit properly.
- Yes.

568
00:39:00,239 --> 00:39:01,510
- Listen carefully.
- Okay.

569
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,909
Listen up. I'm serious.

570
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,079
We happened to have dinner together
after a shoot.

571
00:39:06,119 --> 00:39:08,920
But someone took photos of us
that day of all days!

572
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:10,289
Hence, the dating rumors spread.

573
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,150
You see,
the staff were at the restaurant too.

574
00:39:12,519 --> 00:39:15,320
But Ha Jin was like,
"Since this already happened,"

575
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:16,630
"should we say we're dating?"

576
00:39:16,659 --> 00:39:18,889
And Shin Ju Hyun,
whom I absolutely hate,

577
00:39:18,929 --> 00:39:20,130
had a crush...

578
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,570
on Ha Jin at the time.

579
00:39:22,730 --> 00:39:24,170
But you guys made it official.

580
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:25,800
- Bingo.
- What?

581
00:39:27,039 --> 00:39:30,570
What I mean is, it was just official,
nothing else.

582
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:32,480
We never met in private.

583
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:34,139
We didn't even go on a single date!

584
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,579
I should have told her...

585
00:39:40,349 --> 00:39:42,349
that Ha Jin and I weren't dating.

586
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,760
I was completely out of my mind
in the past.

587
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:50,260
Tae Sung, there's no point
explaining everything to me.

588
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:51,889
Besides, it's all in the past.

589
00:39:56,199 --> 00:39:59,239
Right. It's all in the past.
But the thing is,

590
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,800
Han Byeol was the one
who had to make it official.

591
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,269
My gosh. That's the worst.

592
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,650
I can't believe I made her do that
when I liked her!

593
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,230
Oh, boy.

594
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,300
Hey, it's Gong Tae Sung.
Who knew I'd run into you here?

595
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,510
(Please watch them with kindness.)

596
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:41,179
(Thank you.)

597
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:48,050
(Gong Tae Sung and Yeo Ha Jin
Are in Love)

598
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:02,199
Great.

599
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:03,699
That's nice.

600
00:41:04,369 --> 00:41:05,400
A little more.

601
00:41:05,769 --> 00:41:07,099
Nice, that's perfect.

602
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:10,710
Yes, that's it.

603
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,710
My gosh, they look so cute together.

604
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,710
Are they really dating?

605
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,309
Darn it. I'm so upset.

606
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,050
What? If he's not dating her,

607
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,590
do you think he'll date you?

608
00:41:22,619 --> 00:41:24,949
- But still.
- Quit dreaming.

609
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,659
What a beautiful couple.

610
00:41:26,719 --> 00:41:28,360
Seriously, he's so hot.

611
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,639
We hit another record
for our monthly sales!

612
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,780
Our superstar Gong Tae Sung
is so amazing.

613
00:41:55,989 --> 00:41:58,690
By the way, he's not seeing anyone
at the moment, is he?

614
00:41:59,389 --> 00:42:01,789
No, I'm pretty sure he's not.

615
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,900
(Gong Tae Sung, Yeo Ha Jin, dating)

616
00:42:11,269 --> 00:42:13,539
(Starforce staff admitted the rumors
and asked for support.)

617
00:42:14,039 --> 00:42:15,170
Gosh...

618
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:18,239
(Starforce staff)

619
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,539
Darn it.

620
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:32,960
(Oh Han Byeol)

621
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:40,960
(Gong Fish)

622
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,940
Let's see.

623
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:48,000
(In a meeting. Will call back later.)

624
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,469
Okay. "Drunk Fairy Kang Yu Sung".

625
00:42:51,510 --> 00:42:52,679
His first commercial shoot
is this week, right?

626
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,679
The underpants commercial.

627
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:54,940
Come on, Mr. Choi.

628
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,349
Don't call it underpants.

629
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:58,650
It's a luxury underwear commercial.

630
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,880
Underwear or underpants. Same thing.

631
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:04,349
You shouted, "Kang Yu Sung
got a commercial for underpants!"

632
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:07,760
I failed to contain my excitement then.

633
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:10,929
Continue to sustain that excitement.

634
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,699
Let's try to make Kang Yu Sung
a commercial fairy.

635
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,969
Kang Yu Sung's underpants. Let's get it!

636
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,969
Yes, Yu Sung's underwear, let's do it!

637
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,539
Come on, Yu Sung's undies!

638
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:21,739
Okay underpants or whatever,

639
00:43:21,769 --> 00:43:23,269
- that's enough.
- Yu Sung's underwear, let's go!

640
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,510
Please stop, Ho young.

641
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,639
Underwear!

642
00:43:36,719 --> 00:43:38,190
(Gong Fish)

643
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:46,900
Ms. Oh.

644
00:43:48,230 --> 00:43:49,769
Yes, Mr. Do?

645
00:43:51,369 --> 00:43:53,099
It's the document
you needed my advice on.

646
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:55,769
That was fast.

647
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,940
Of course, anything for you.

648
00:43:59,309 --> 00:44:01,010
- Thank you.
- No problem.

649
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,010
See you around then.

650
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,989
Mr. Do.

651
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:21,800
Well,

652
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:23,570
the thing is...

653
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:26,840
So, you see...

654
00:44:27,840 --> 00:44:29,070
Don't feel pressured.

655
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:31,340
Okay.

656
00:44:31,739 --> 00:44:32,909
Mr. Do.

657
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,139
I...

658
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:37,679
Are you about to give an answer
to my confession?

659
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:41,780
Yes.

660
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,289
I will reject it.

661
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:47,719
- Sorry?
- I said I reject your answer.

662
00:44:48,289 --> 00:44:49,760
I don't want to hear it now.

663
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,500
I see. Then when would be good?

664
00:44:56,570 --> 00:44:58,070
Tell me...

665
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:00,500
when I want to hear it.

666
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:16,449
Shall we grab a meal together?

667
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:18,989
- Pardon?
- To be honest,

668
00:45:19,349 --> 00:45:22,860
I'm nervous and curious,
and I want to hear your answer.

669
00:45:24,159 --> 00:45:26,900
I'm maintaining this indifferent act
on purpose to seem mature.

670
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,670
It's not easy pretending to be cool.

671
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:38,369
I wished you wouldn't feel awkward...

672
00:45:38,539 --> 00:45:40,440
or uncomfortable around me at work.

673
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,179
I didn't think of the possibility...

674
00:45:45,349 --> 00:45:46,519
that we could grow apart from this.

675
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:47,849
Which is why...

676
00:45:48,349 --> 00:45:50,150
I'd like to have a meal with you.

677
00:45:57,590 --> 00:45:59,130
- Hi there.
- Hello.

678
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,570
How long has he been like that?

679
00:46:09,170 --> 00:46:11,139
Since I got here.

680
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,179
I'm worried he might be sick.

681
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:15,539
He is.

682
00:46:17,349 --> 00:46:18,710
- He is?
- What?

683
00:46:19,409 --> 00:46:20,750
Nothing.

684
00:47:11,199 --> 00:47:13,039
I'll get going now.

685
00:47:13,199 --> 00:47:14,869
Goodness, okay.

686
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:16,670
Thank you for today.

687
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:18,639
- Get home safely.
- I will.

688
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,610
Don't forget to eat the bone broth.

689
00:47:20,679 --> 00:47:22,510
Food is the best remedy.

690
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,210
Thank you. Goodbye.

691
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,579
Okay, bye.

692
00:47:25,610 --> 00:47:27,320
- Goodbye, ma'am.
- Bye.

693
00:47:32,789 --> 00:47:34,360
- Byun Jung Yeol.
- Yes?

694
00:47:34,889 --> 00:47:36,460
Try calling me.

695
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,929
Okay.

696
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:47,440
(Manager Byun Jung Yeol)

697
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,369
Gosh, what's up with this?

698
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:52,440
It was clearly broken.

699
00:47:53,039 --> 00:47:54,980
- It's ringing just fine.
- Seriously, Han Byeol?

700
00:47:55,340 --> 00:47:58,309
If she sent a text saying she was
in a meeting and will call me back,

701
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,019
isn't it common courtesy to call back?

702
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:01,679
She could still be in a meeting though.

703
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,119
I checked with Ji Hoon.

704
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:05,889
They finished a long time ago.

705
00:48:05,949 --> 00:48:07,989
Her actor called,
and not just any actor. It was me.

706
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:10,460
I'm the one
who makes the most profit here.

707
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:11,929
So when I call her,
she should call me back...

708
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:13,900
as the head of the PR team.

709
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:15,730
Then give her another call.

710
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,230
I can't.

711
00:48:20,099 --> 00:48:21,800
I am scared.
What if she rejects it again?

712
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:23,909
- Shall I call her then?
- No, don't.

713
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:25,969
Don't call her.

714
00:48:26,610 --> 00:48:27,679
Or maybe you should.

715
00:48:27,710 --> 00:48:29,210
- Okay.
- No, don't.

716
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,250
That would be better.

717
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,679
But maybe you should try.

718
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:32,909
No, don't.

719
00:48:33,719 --> 00:48:35,820
Just give her a call. Try it.

720
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:41,860
I know.

721
00:48:43,159 --> 00:48:45,429
I hate myself for being like this.

722
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,230
I like it.

723
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:52,230
You're a strange one, Byun Jung Yeol.

724
00:49:04,349 --> 00:49:05,679
(Manager Byun Jung Yeol)

725
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:11,849
Tae Sung. You have to go to work.

726
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,090
Hurry up and get ready.

727
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,260
Tae Sung, it was just a game.
You don't have to take the stairs.

728
00:49:17,659 --> 00:49:18,630
Hey.

729
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,300
You won.

730
00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:21,760
Take the elevator.

731
00:49:22,429 --> 00:49:23,869
How could I do that without you?

732
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,099
Let's take it together.

733
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:27,539
Nobody will remember the bet.

734
00:49:31,869 --> 00:49:33,039
There he comes.

735
00:49:34,980 --> 00:49:36,110
The loser.

736
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,590
You're a man of your word, I see.

737
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:48,889
Although you're bad at games.

738
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,929
Same goes for you.

739
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:56,429
Keep going up then.

740
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,139
Keep going down then.

741
00:50:17,019 --> 00:50:18,119
Hey.

742
00:50:21,690 --> 00:50:23,059
Was your meeting with Starforce...

743
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:25,030
beneficial?

744
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,800
I ask...

745
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:33,139
because I'm the face of the agency,
and I'm worried.

746
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,469
That's why I ask.

747
00:50:35,639 --> 00:50:37,340
Are you asking me about work?

748
00:50:38,510 --> 00:50:40,679
You must not know me well yet.

749
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:44,349
I don't work after 6pm.

750
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,750
If you're that curious,
you can ask Ms. Oh, your best friend.

751
00:50:51,449 --> 00:50:52,719
Right, my best friend.

752
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,960
My Han Byeol who I've known
and worked with closely...

753
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:57,460
for over ten years.

754
00:50:58,659 --> 00:51:00,760
I wonder why I didn't think to ask her.

755
00:51:01,659 --> 00:51:03,099
I should call her right now.

756
00:51:11,639 --> 00:51:12,940
Aren't you going to leave?

757
00:51:14,139 --> 00:51:15,340
Why do you care?

758
00:51:16,809 --> 00:51:18,110
I'm out of battery.

759
00:51:19,349 --> 00:51:21,050
I'll call her after I charge it.

760
00:51:24,019 --> 00:51:25,320
Why do you laugh?

761
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,760
Why do you care?

762
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:36,030
(Team Manger Oh Han Byeol)

763
00:51:40,170 --> 00:51:41,369
Yes, Ms. Oh.

764
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,510
I will send you the location
for our dinner...

765
00:51:44,909 --> 00:51:46,579
via text.

766
00:51:47,039 --> 00:51:48,780
Yes. Okay.

767
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,949
All right, I'll see you then.

768
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,590
Goodbye then.

769
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:15,539
That's 44.

770
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,409
That's 45.

771
00:52:19,239 --> 00:52:21,110
One more. Come on.

772
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:23,650
Poor guy.

773
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,849
Can't I have a sip of water?

774
00:52:28,179 --> 00:52:30,019
No, water will hide your abs.

775
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:32,449
You have to suck everything dry,

776
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:33,960
so your abs show.

777
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,519
- Got it?
- Okay.

778
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:36,530
All right.

779
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,590
No resting, let's go straight
to working your obliques.

780
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,900
- Don't rest.
- She used to train as an athlete.

781
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:43,929
- Just do ten more.
- She's going to kill him.

782
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,230
Breaking news. Kang Yu Sung,

783
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:48,369
- close to fainting before his shoot.
- Three. Four.

784
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,340
- Everyone watches nervously.
- Five.

785
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:53,510
- Gosh, Ms. Park looks so happy.
- Smile, Yu Sung.

786
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:55,280
- Don't frown.
- You know what's even more amazing?

787
00:52:55,309 --> 00:52:58,010
Because Si Duk didn't eat anything,
she didn't eat as well.

788
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,610
She didn't even drink water.

789
00:53:01,449 --> 00:53:03,849
Gosh. She's so passionate.

790
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:11,429
I'm so nervous.
What am I to shoot a commercial?

791
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,199
Do you remember?

792
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:17,300
You said, "How can I become an actor?"

793
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,039
I remember it.

794
00:53:20,070 --> 00:53:21,840
But you've become an actor now.

795
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:23,809
You'll do great in this commercial too.

796
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,769
They're all professionals here.

797
00:53:25,809 --> 00:53:27,739
There are no advertisers
who waste their money.

798
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,980
- You can come get changed now.
- Okay.

799
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:42,190
Yu Sung.
"I'm the coolest man in the world."

800
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,829
"I will win everyone's heart."

801
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:46,360
You should do it with this mindset.

802
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:47,929
You're amazing enough.

803
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:52,230
Okay, Ho Young.

804
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:05,010
I never taught you to starve
when your actor starves.

805
00:54:05,210 --> 00:54:07,750
Yu Sung. Why are you here?

806
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:09,880
It's Actor Kang Yu Sung's
first commercial.

807
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,489
I thought I should be here
since we have the same name.

808
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:16,389
I heard you didn't eat at all today.

809
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:18,829
Eat this.
You'll get sick if you starve like that.

810
00:54:22,030 --> 00:54:23,099
Thank you.

811
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:26,130
I told you to look after your actor
and yourself.

812
00:54:26,639 --> 00:54:30,239
But how can I eat
when my Yu Sung is skipping his meals?

813
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:33,780
You sound so natural
when you call him Yu Sung.

814
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:35,909
Hey.

815
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,019
- Hello.
- Yu Sung.

816
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:45,750
- Hello.
- You're awesome.

817
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,000
I think I'm not cut out for this job.

818
00:55:00,099 --> 00:55:02,300
How could I have made
such a stupid mistake?

819
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:04,170
It's okay.

820
00:55:04,739 --> 00:55:06,840
Rookies make that kind of mistake
all the time.

821
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,210
I wish you'd just scold me.

822
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,510
Dae Soo already scolded you.

823
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:16,019
You're doing great,
and you'll do even better.

824
00:55:20,489 --> 00:55:23,289
Yu Sung, I will really...

825
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:25,289
I will really do my best.

826
00:55:26,389 --> 00:55:27,559
You're so cute.

827
00:55:28,159 --> 00:55:29,230
Gosh.

828
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:43,449
You're all grown up, Ho Young.

829
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:52,789
(If you feel the same way as I do,)

830
00:55:54,519 --> 00:55:55,820
(just close your eyes.)

831
00:55:57,429 --> 00:55:59,630
("The World of Stars")

832
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:07,800
Gosh. This is crazy.

833
00:56:08,039 --> 00:56:09,869
It's thrilling and new.

834
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,840
Gosh, why does it have to end here?

835
00:56:15,809 --> 00:56:17,809
Tae Sung becomes the talk of the town
whenever he does a kissing scene.

836
00:56:18,349 --> 00:56:21,250
Don't you think someone should name him
the national kisser?

837
00:56:24,989 --> 00:56:26,960
How do you feel when you see
your friend kiss someone?

838
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,960
What do you mean?
It's a drama. He's just working.

839
00:56:31,130 --> 00:56:32,829
What a lame answer.

840
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:39,699
(Lawyer Do Soo Hyuk)

841
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:41,500
(I will see you here then.)

842
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:48,340
Who's sending you a message
at this late hour?

843
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,550
It's Mr. Do.

844
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,150
Are you finally going on a date?

845
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,079
Is this a date?

846
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:59,420
There's nothing special about a date.
It's a date when two people meet.

847
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:00,989
We're not celebrities.

848
00:57:01,019 --> 00:57:04,460
There won't be any photos
or dating scandals for having a meal.

849
00:57:04,659 --> 00:57:05,960
What are you so worried about?

850
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:08,030
Do you think so?

851
00:57:24,179 --> 00:57:25,280
Is it Mr. Do again?

852
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,750
No. It's Mr. Choi.

853
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,849
What is it? Did he ask you
to lend him some money?

854
00:57:30,889 --> 00:57:31,849
Why are you so startled?

855
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:35,360
It's because he's making me work
at this late hour.

856
00:57:36,489 --> 00:57:37,630
Gosh, it's hot in here.

857
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:39,530
Hey.

858
00:57:41,559 --> 00:57:44,269
I think there's something going on.

859
00:57:45,929 --> 00:57:48,739
This is thrilling and new.

860
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:55,880
(Gong Fish)

861
00:57:55,909 --> 00:58:00,380
(I'll be waiting.)

862
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,250
(I'm still waiting.)

863
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:01,469
Let's rehearse now.

864
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:02,900
Okay.

865
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,639
(Epilogue)

866
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,079
Would it be better on this side?

867
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,010
Or this side?

868
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:12,409
He's a professional.

869
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:27,230
I professed my feelings to you.
When will you give me your answer?

870
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:29,760
Oh, that's...

871
01:00:33,630 --> 01:00:35,000
What are you doing?

872
01:00:35,099 --> 01:00:36,840
If you feel the same way as I do,

873
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:40,480
just close your eyes.

874
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:53,650
Cut. My, that was so beautiful.

875
01:00:53,690 --> 01:00:55,159
You're the master of kissing scenes.

876
01:01:25,349 --> 01:01:28,119
=Shooting Stars=

877
01:01:28,289 --> 01:01:31,360
(I have a first love that
I can't tell anyone about.)

878
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:33,190
(It was so embarrassing...)

879
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,530
(to have feelings like that
for a celebrity.)

880
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:38,730
(I'm not a star in the sky,
but an ordinary man.)

881
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:41,500
I really miss her. Oh Han Byeol.

882
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:45,110
(Tae Sung. Act as if you're looking
at someone you love.)

883
01:01:45,409 --> 01:01:46,909
(Are you really going to avoid me
like this?)

884
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:49,280
(Hey. Do you really like me?)

885
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:50,849
(Yes. I like you.)

886
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:51,909
(You must be out of your mind.)

887
01:01:51,949 --> 01:01:54,750
(I like you so much that
I don't even know what I'm saying.)
