- What does it mean?

That's not even a question.
That means you like...

No, that's an arrhythmia.

It means you have a cardiac condition.

- Yes.

Ms. Oh. Have you seen the pictures...

- of Tae Sung online...
- I know.

43
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:00,909
I heard he ran into some foreign fans
on a tour bus...

44
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,780
and ended up having
an on-the-spot fan sign event.

45
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:05,280
Let's just say it was a nice way
for him to show his fans some love.

46
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,919
But why do you think...

47
00:04:06,949 --> 00:04:09,289
he went to the movie theater
all dressed up in a suit?

Tae Sung,
why are you lying there like that?

50
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,899
What were you doing romping...

51
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:25,069
I mean, running all over town?

52
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,600
So many people took pictures of you.

53
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,480
I was waiting for Han Byeol.

54
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:36,509
In the middle of the street?
Where everyone could see?

55
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:39,350
Were you going to confess to her
in public?

56
00:04:40,149 --> 00:04:41,389
How could it be that...

57
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,990
instead of Han Byeol,

58
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:46,420
I run into a group of tourists...

59
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:47,660
that late at night?

60
00:04:47,689 --> 00:04:49,430

62

It was an endless loop.

63
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:57,000
If Yu Sung hadn't come,
I would have spent the night like that.

64
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:59,269

65
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:02,209

66
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,279
Then how did Yu Sung...

67
00:05:04,379 --> 00:05:06,910
Someone told him on Instagram.

68
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,579
My wrist hurts
because of too many fan sign events.

69

You're such a handful.

71

When you're hurt, I'm hurt too.

72
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,730
You must be careful now.

73
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,329
But, Jung Yeol.

74
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,829
Yes?

75
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,069
I understand why my wrist hurts,

76
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,569
but...

77
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,540
why does it hurt so much here?

78
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,810
Should I put one there too?

79
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:14,379

the other day is on right now.

95
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,860

00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:15,170
- A picture, please?
- Sorry.

100
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,100
- Thank you!
- We're rooting for you!

101

Here, you have some too.

104
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,220
Cut.

105
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,120
You look like you're chewing gum.

106
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,659
Why do you guys look so grumpy?

107
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:14,230
Sorry.

108
00:09:15,529 --> 00:09:16,860
Will they fight again?

109
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:20,129
I see that they're warming up
for another fight.

110

Here, babe.

111

Here, you have some too.

112
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:33,509
Cut!

113
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,980
Are you chewing rubber?

114
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,480
Are the noodles too tough?

115

00:09:54,169 --> 00:09:55,230
Cut!

118

You two look like cows
chewing their cuds!

Sorry.

120

They are acting weird today.

121
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,049
Right?

122
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:10,250
Normally, they would've gotten
into a fight by now.

123
00:10:10,549 --> 00:10:14,120
Goodness.
They finally had a taste of capitalism.

124
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,289
They're behaving themselves for a change
because the advertiser is here.

125

Get a grip!

128
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,389
Do you want to kiss?

129
00:10:48,419 --> 00:10:49,889
- No.
- What?

130
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,019
What?

131
00:10:51,289 --> 00:10:52,789
I've never been rejected before.

132
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:53,919
Why not?

133
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,259
We're not dating.

134
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,029
Then let's date.

135
00:10:58,129 --> 00:10:59,230
Starting today.

136
00:11:10,909 --> 00:11:12,009
Jae Hyeon is late.

137
00:11:12,039 --> 00:11:13,309
He went to the restroom.

138
00:11:14,450 --> 00:11:16,080
Yu Na went to the restroom too.

139
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,320
(Yu Sung)

140
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,960
Yu Na!

141
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,500
- Jae Hyeon!
- I'd rather be a dog...

142
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:39,740
than shoot a commercial with you!

143
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,370
I'm already a dog! Woof!

144
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,409
- Hey!
- Let go of her!

145
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,440
Goodness. I wondered
why you two were so quiet.

146
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,909
Hi.

147
00:11:51,049 --> 00:11:52,750
I'm so tired.

148
00:11:52,779 --> 00:11:54,889
Why do you look so tired?
Did something happen?

149
00:11:54,919 --> 00:11:56,750
No, the traffic was so bad.

150
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,590
Right, I hear you.

151
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,419
I hate getting caught in traffic.

152
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,789
I'm so thirsty.

153
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,559
A cold beer, please!

154
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:04,629
Okay.

155
00:12:05,529 --> 00:12:06,500
So?

156
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:10,000
You've secretly been liking Yu Sung
ever since you were smitten by him?

157
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,039
No.

158
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,909
That was the first time
he made my heart flutter,

159
00:12:15,269 --> 00:12:17,070
but it wasn't a crush.

160
00:12:17,139 --> 00:12:18,440
Then when did it begin?

161
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,210
Da Hye had a fan sign event that day.

162
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:25,179
But some weirdo suddenly jumped in.

163
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,879
I did a flying kick
and knocked him down.

164
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:28,850
Yu Sung caught him
when he tried to run away.

165
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:30,960
You fell for him
when he chased and caught him.

166
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,019
Gosh, no.

167
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,389
That wouldn't impress me
because I do it all the time.

168
00:12:34,429 --> 00:12:36,960
What? I have no idea
where this story is going.

169
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:38,230
Then what was it?

170
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,269
After work, we somehow ended up
grabbing a drink together.

171
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:46,200
(That was it. It was the alcohol.)

172
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,379
- Mr. Kang.
- Yes.

173
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:55,379
When I saw you giving your business card
to Da Hye a long time ago,

174
00:12:55,409 --> 00:12:56,980
I had the wrong idea about you.

175
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,049
I thought you were hitting on her.

176
00:13:00,419 --> 00:13:02,289
I can't do that while I'm working.

177
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,090
- I'm sorry.
- Gosh, don't be.

178
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:09,159
Is it because I'm not a manager?

179
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,200
To tell you the truth, I didn't think...

180
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,259
Da Hye would be this successful
as an actress.

181
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:15,830
You sure have a good eye.

182
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,200
No.

183
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,340
I was just lucky.

184
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,669
That's not true. It's really impressive.

185
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,169
Come on.
I was so impressed by you today.

186
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,409
That kick! Oh, my.

187
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,149
It was amazing.

188
00:13:29,879 --> 00:13:31,580
It's just work, you know.

189
00:13:34,049 --> 00:13:35,120
Your hand...

190
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,720
It's nothing.

191
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:41,090
It'll heal on its own.

192
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:42,259
Hold on.

193
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,139
Do you always carry that stuff with you?

194
00:13:52,570 --> 00:13:54,840
I'm a manager, you know.
They come in handy often.

195
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,039
Let me see your hand.

196
00:14:09,019 --> 00:14:10,090
There.

197
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:13,820
All done.

198
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:16,360
Thank you.

199
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:17,960
It's nothing.

200
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:20,429
Our jobs...

201
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,799
have something in common.

202
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,799
We both...

203
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,809
have to...

204
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,909
protect someone.

205
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,950
(What are you? Protectors of the Earth?)

206
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,679
(The true guardians.)

207
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,320
Come on.

208
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:42,289
Can't you just call it
a strong work ethic?

209
00:14:42,419 --> 00:14:43,690
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

210
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,559
- How strong.
- How strong.

211
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,460
- This is Yu Sung's fault, right?
- It sure is.

212
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,399
Here.

213
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,700
Hey. What happened with the lawyer?

214
00:14:57,429 --> 00:15:00,470
Right. Are you going to have dinner
with Mr. Do?

215
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,440
Well...

216
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:05,179
Yes, tomorrow evening.

217
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:11,450
Make sure you chew well
and watch him carefully.

218
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,419
You'll know right away
if he's right or not.

219
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:15,149
Really? I will?

220
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,720
Yes, you'll know intuitively.

221
00:15:16,750 --> 00:15:20,659
A feeling of whether you will
like this man or not.

222
00:15:23,059 --> 00:15:24,559
- You know, right?
- Yes.

223
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,070
You're here. Take a seat here.

224
00:15:38,809 --> 00:15:40,080
Please enjoy.

225
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,710
I wasn't sure what you would like.

226
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,649
So I ordered one of everything.

227
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,889
The chef is my friend.

228
00:15:48,149 --> 00:15:49,350
I see.

229
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,919
- Let's dig in then.
- Okay.

230
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,860
Excuse me for a second.
I have to look over this.

231
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:00,159
Sure.

232
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,039
You seem busy.

233
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:08,309
It's fine if you have
to go back to work.

234
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:10,610
No, I'm not busy at all.

235
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,509
Nor is there a need
for me to go back to work.

236
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,610
I just thought I would bring this.

237
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,279
Pardon?

238
00:16:17,379 --> 00:16:18,919
I debated long and hard, to be honest.

239
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:22,049
Whether I should show off
my wealth, career,

240
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:24,590
or my beauty today.

241
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,389
But I realized...

242
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,389
what's most important
is that you don't feel awkward.

243
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,200
These documents are for
the meeting with Starforce next week.

244
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,000
The point is to confuse you.

245
00:16:37,169 --> 00:16:40,340
Whether this is a date
or a work meeting.

246
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,669
Gosh, that's silly.

247
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,210
You are finally smiling a little.

248
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,450
I'm relieved.

249
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,750
Mr. Do, I...

250
00:16:55,789 --> 00:16:57,860
You can always turn me down later.

251
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:02,029
It would be even better if you're giving
this a positive consideration.

252
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:06,900
I'll also treat you exactly the same
at work as always.

253
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:11,029
I want you to feel butterflies,
not put you in a difficult spot.

254
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:16,009
Just a disclaimer,
I'm not a star floating in the sky.

255
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,980
I'm a person...

256
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,039
with both feet on the ground.

257
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,960
(I'm not a star floating in the sky.)

258
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:38,829
(I'm a person
with both feet on the ground.)

259
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,000
Yes?

260
00:17:46,099 --> 00:17:47,500
How did it go?

261
00:17:47,869 --> 00:17:49,109
(It went well.)

262
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:51,940
I'm ready to hear your review.

263
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,279
Shall we meet up at Organic Bar?

264
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:55,150
(I'll just call it a night today.)

265
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,049
What's up with your voice?
Did something happen?

266
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,450
(You haven't been yourself these days.)

267
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,789
Nothing happened. I'm just tired.
Plus, I'm almost home.

268
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,859
I'll talk to you tomorrow.

269
00:18:24,170 --> 00:18:27,680
Why so gloomy when you just
went on a date with a handsome guy.

270
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:30,279
Ki Ppeum.

271
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,279
I knew you would be here.

272
00:18:34,119 --> 00:18:36,549
It seems like Mr. Do isn't the problem.

273
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:38,990
So tell me. Who is it?

274
00:18:41,059 --> 00:18:42,259
The thing is,

275
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:45,700
I never told anyone
about the first guy I loved.

276
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:47,970
It was the most embarrassing time
in my life.

277
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,599
It's Gong Tae Sung, right?

278
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:54,640
Yes. I knew you had an idea.

279
00:18:57,309 --> 00:19:00,380
You see,
I thought I was special to him...

280
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:03,779
when we hung out in the past.

281
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:07,150
He was never a diva around me,

282
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,549
nor was he fake.

283
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:10,990
I thought he acted like a regular guy.

284
00:19:11,619 --> 00:19:14,089
But three years ago,

285
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,460
I realized that was all in my head.

286
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:17,690
Three years ago?

287
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,559
Yeo Ha Jin.

288
00:19:20,599 --> 00:19:22,630
Right, they dated officially.

289
00:19:23,869 --> 00:19:25,339
I took care of it, you know?

290
00:19:25,769 --> 00:19:27,500
I received all the calls
from reporters...

291
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,009
and wrote all the press material.

292
00:19:29,470 --> 00:19:31,910
Writing stuff like,
"Please watch them with kindness."

293
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:34,480
Gosh, that's the worst.

294
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:38,079
I was doxed in university
because of the rumor...

295
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:39,619
that I was Gong Tae Sung's girlfriend.

296
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,079
People talked behind my back.

297
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:43,019
I did nothing wrong
but I had to lay low.

298
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,450
I suffered a lot.

299
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:47,559
But I must have really liked him,

300
00:19:47,859 --> 00:19:49,660
to the point that it all felt worth it.

301
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,859
The humiliation almost killed me.

302
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:57,269
The fact that I felt that way
towards a celebrity.

303
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,470
I was too embarrassed to tell anyone.

304
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:03,009
So I dealt with it alone miserably.

305
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:06,980
Your first heartbreak was a tough one.

306
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,250
But...

307
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,579
Gong Tae Sung...

308
00:20:19,619 --> 00:20:21,430
He says he likes me.

309
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:25,029
Shut the front door.
So what's the problem?

310
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,660
Why is it now of all time?

311
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,099
After the three miserable years
he put me through?

312
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,970
So what? Do you resent him?

313
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,039
If only.

314
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:36,869
I learned my lesson the hard way.

315
00:20:37,109 --> 00:20:40,410
The fact that he's a public figure
that is too loved by everyone.

316
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:43,549
He's like one of those stars
up in the sky.

317
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:53,089
(Gong Fish)

318
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,230
("Our Real Romance")

319
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:04,069
I don't want to get hurt again.
I'm scared.

320
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:06,799
Gosh, you are
so romantically inexperienced.

321
00:21:08,170 --> 00:21:10,740
You think you won't get hurt
if you like someone else?

322
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,940
Everyone gives and gets hurt.

323
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,480
Whether it be a celebrity, lawyer,
or whoever.

324
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,359
What? It's sold out?

325
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:29,190
Really?

326
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:31,089
Is there a large group or something?

327
00:21:31,829 --> 00:21:33,000
At this hour?

328
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:36,430
(Please turn off your mobile devices.)

329
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:40,869

("Our Real Romance")

333
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,890
Not a single response.

334
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,390
Let me send it one more time.

335
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:40,960
(Stop sending these.)

336
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:45,670
Do you really plan on not seeing me?

337
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,200
(I'm outside your house. Open the door.)

338
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,309
What?

339
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,509
I'm going in.

340
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:59,019
Yes, come on in.

341
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,650
Do you grow money on trees?

342
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,990
How could you buy out
the entire theater?

343
00:23:06,019 --> 00:23:07,259
For days too!

344
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,190
Oh, that? It's fine.

345
00:23:10,829 --> 00:23:12,359
I contributed a lot to this industry.

346
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,460
Just give me that money instead.

347
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,099
Don't tell me you're here
to ask for that money?

348
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:18,799
No! I'm just saying,

349
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,269
you should've just bought two tickets.
Why did you buy all of them?

350
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:22,910
I wanted to watch it alone with you.

351
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,839
Hey! Why are you so honest?

352
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,240
I have to be honest with you.

353
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,049
- Why?
- Because I like you.

354
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,390
You really like me?

355
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,519
Yes.

356
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,220
I like you.

357
00:23:39,859 --> 00:23:41,460
How much?

358
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,029
How much?

359
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:49,529
Even if you like dipping your tangsuyuk,
which is as hard as a rock,

360
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:52,269
or if you ask me to eat toothpaste-like
mint chocolate chip with you,

361
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:55,170
or you tell me to eat pizza
with pineapples, I'd still like you.

362
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,609
I like you so much.

363
00:23:59,509 --> 00:24:00,640
Goodness.

364
00:24:01,609 --> 00:24:02,910
You've gone mad.

365
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,819
Well, I...

366
00:24:09,849 --> 00:24:11,390
I prepared a lot of cool lines...

367
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:13,690
to tell you how I feel about you. But...

368
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,589
my mind is blank right now.

369
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,859
Han Byeol, I...

370
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,000
I like you so much that
I don't even know what I'm saying.

371
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:43,420
Gosh, you...

372
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,059
Why are you startled...

373
00:24:45,089 --> 00:24:46,519
when you're the one who kissed me?

374
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,970
This time,

375
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,369
don't run away.

376
00:25:56,259 --> 00:25:57,359
Hey.

377
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:00,630
Why are you trembling like that?

378
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:08,970
Because I'm nervous.

379
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,000
Who is that at this late hour?

380
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,369
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

381
00:26:43,109 --> 00:26:44,069
Oh, right.

382
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:45,680
I...

383
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,509
I'm going out of town
to shoot for a week.

384
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:49,349
Hold on.

385
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,109
Don't open the door.

386
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,480
- Don't.
- But he...

387
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,819
If I don't answer him
until he rings the bell three times,

388
00:26:54,849 --> 00:26:56,319
he punches in the code
and just comes in.

389
00:26:56,549 --> 00:26:57,849
Why are you telling me that now?

390
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,490
- What do we do?
- Goodness.

391
00:27:00,359 --> 00:27:01,490
Your shoes.

392
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:03,990
What do we do?

393
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:05,559
Right. Take your shoes.

394
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,730
- Gosh. My lips?
- Your lips.

395
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:10,670
Where are you going to hide?

396
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:11,740
All right.

397
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:20,640
Tae Sung.

398
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,950
Were you awake?

399
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,210
Of course.

400
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:25,380
I was doing some stretching.

401
00:27:25,549 --> 00:27:27,579
Gosh, Byun Jung Yeol.

402
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:31,089
You're always right on time.

403
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:33,519
Thank you. I'm trying my best.

404
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:34,619
Okay.

405
00:27:35,529 --> 00:27:36,589
Tae Sung.

406
00:27:37,089 --> 00:27:38,130
Your face...

407
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,529
What?

408
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,700
Couldn't you sleep again?

409
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,869
Ms. Oh is being too harsh on you.

410
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,839
You're lovesick because of her,

411
00:27:46,869 --> 00:27:48,299
but she doesn't know
that you have feelings for her.

412
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,769
Stop talking gibberish.

413
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,640
Go to the parking lot
and wait in the car.

414
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:53,579
- I'll be in the car, Tae Sung.
- Okay. Go.

415
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,109
- Be careful on your way down.
- Okay.

416
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,950
Are you okay?

417
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:05,660
Yes.

418
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,720
It's only a week, so wait for me.

419
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:09,730
Okay.

420
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,079
Hi.

421
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,289
Hi.

422
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,869
("The World of Stars")

423
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:56,309
Hi.

424
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:00,339
What do I do?

425
00:29:01,079 --> 00:29:03,309
This world is full of Tae Sung.

426
00:29:13,589 --> 00:29:16,460
Was the sky always pink like this?

427
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,849
Gosh, this is crazy.

428
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,529
Tae Sung. Are you ill?

429
00:29:48,589 --> 00:29:49,630
What?

430
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,690
No.

431
00:29:50,829 --> 00:29:53,000
I'm feeling so good right now.

432
00:29:53,029 --> 00:29:54,259
I mean it.

433
00:29:57,369 --> 00:29:58,599
Is Jae Hyeon okay?

434
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,740
He lost a big chunk of his hair.

435
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:02,269
He'll be fine.

436
00:30:02,569 --> 00:30:04,640
He might have a bald spot.
I'm sure we can hide it.

437
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:06,710
I'm sorry.

438
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,279
Maybe it's better for them
to hate each other...

439
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:14,779
rather than be crazy about each other.

440
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,019
Of course.

441
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:18,660
It's fine when they're together.
But when they break up,

442
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,190
it becomes a disaster.

443
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:22,059
- That's the worst.
- Right?

444
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:24,029
I managed to persuade him though.

445
00:30:24,059 --> 00:30:25,599
He said he'll work hard
for the remaining commercials with her.

446
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:27,799
Goodness.

447
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,369
They agreed with each other
for the first time.

448
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:32,000
That's what happens
when they shoot commercials.

449
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,940
Yu Na used to call herself a dog,
but she's like...

450
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:38,069
I'll just shoot the commercial.

451
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,710
I'm a professional.

452
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,980
Hermes?

453
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:42,309
I'll work hard and buy it.

454
00:30:42,579 --> 00:30:43,549
I'll buy it with my own money.

455
00:30:43,579 --> 00:30:44,779
Gosh.

456
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:47,079
That's how capitalism changes people.

457
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:48,849
Eat up.

458
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:50,289
We need to work hard.

459
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:53,819
- Ma'am. We'll have another boiled pork.
- Okay.

460
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,230
It's on you.

461
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
Ma'am. Please cancel that order.

462
00:30:58,190 --> 00:30:59,259
Goodness.

463
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,599
- Tae Sung.
(- Yu Sung.)

464
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,799
Are you on your way to the set?
Aren't you tired?

465
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:05,369
Well, the traffic is...

466
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:08,140
so slow, but...

467
00:31:08,269 --> 00:31:11,309
The weather's nice.
There's a nice view too.

468
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:12,710
(I'm not tired at all.)

469
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:15,380
Tae Sung. Something good
must have happened to you.

470
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,549
(- Can you tell?)
- Of course I can.

471
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,779
(Gosh. It's impossible to keep
something from you.)

472
00:31:21,819 --> 00:31:22,990
Do you want me to come and see you?

473
00:31:23,019 --> 00:31:24,750
(No need. Why would you come
all the way here?)

474
00:31:25,089 --> 00:31:26,289
(I'll be back in a week.)

475
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,759
All right. Good luck with the shoot.

476
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,759
(- Okay, Yu Sung.)
- Bye.

477
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,579
You look like you're in a good mood.

478
00:31:46,509 --> 00:31:47,740
I'm in a good mood too.

479
00:31:53,019 --> 00:31:54,079
What?

480
00:31:54,819 --> 00:31:56,150
Is he watching me from somewhere?

481
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,059
(I'm on my way to the set.)

482
00:32:00,089 --> 00:32:01,160
(I'll call you when I'm done.)

483
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,670
Mr. Do, hello.

484
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,640
Hello, Ms. Oh.

485
00:32:16,509 --> 00:32:17,670
Mr. Do.

486
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:20,240
Yes?

487
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:21,380
Well...

488
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:23,910
My...

489
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:25,819
My answer is...

490
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,650
no.

491
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,720
I should've told you this the other day.

492
00:32:32,119 --> 00:32:33,319
I'm sorry for that.

493
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:34,859
Also...

494
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:38,230
I appreciate that
you had good feelings about me.

495
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:42,769
All right.

496
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,569
- Let's go to the meeting.
- Pardon?

497
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:47,440
Oh, right.

498
00:32:48,569 --> 00:32:50,910
I knew I didn't have a shot.

499
00:32:51,009 --> 00:32:54,779
So you don't have to feel so guilty
about it.

500
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,480
It's not like you have to give me
a positive answer.

501
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,980
We'll be seeing each other
in the office anyway.

502
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:01,980
Let's not avoid each other, okay?

503
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:03,890
I'll take care of my feelings...

504
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:06,660
in my own way.

505
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:10,029
Okay.

506
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,329
What do you like so much about
Mr. Gong Tae Sung?

507
00:33:19,069 --> 00:33:20,039
Pardon?

508
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,940
Honestly, I look better than him, right?

509
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:25,839
Maybe not.

510
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:34,079
Mr. Do. About yesterday's case...

511
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,690
Gosh.

512
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:41,460
He's back to being precise
about his work hours again.

513
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,000
(Gong)

514
00:33:52,869 --> 00:33:53,970
Should I call him?

515
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,910
No. He might be shooting right now.

516
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,609
(Gong)

517
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:14,090
(Hello?)

518
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,829
Hey. Hello?

519
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,230
What? What happened? What was that?

520
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,960
Why did she hang up?

521
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,239
(- Hey.)
- What is it? Is something wrong?

522
00:34:34,579 --> 00:34:37,010
No. It's just awkward.

523
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,420
We used to fight all the time, you know.

524
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:41,579
So I can't get used to this.

525
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,150
I see.

526
00:34:44,519 --> 00:34:47,219
Then should we just fight?
Like we used to?

527
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:50,659
No. I don't want to do that.

528
00:34:50,690 --> 00:34:53,260
Then should I hang up?

529
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:54,360
No.

530
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,840
Who's going to talk?

531
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,510
I'll talk.

532
00:35:03,969 --> 00:35:05,210
Should we do a video call?

533
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,909
(Just look at each other
without talking...)

534
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:08,780
- No.
- Why not?

535
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:10,579
I'm going to be all shy.

536
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:13,349
This is happening all too fast.

537
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,880
Right.

538
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:17,250
- I'd feel shy too...
- How about an acrostic poem?

539
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,019
Sure. Why don't you give me the letters?

540
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,989
G.

541
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:22,659
- G?
- Let's not do that. It's weird.

542
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,730
Okay.

543
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:29,230
Oh, right.

544
00:35:30,429 --> 00:35:33,070
Do Soo Hyuk asked you out, didn't he?
And you had dinner with him.

545
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,969
How did you know?

546
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,940
He called you in front of me
so I'd hear all about it.

547
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:40,239
Did you enjoy the food?

548
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,480
It was so good.
He took me to a famous restaurant.

549
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:46,119
What?

550
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,079
But I turned him down.

551
00:35:49,519 --> 00:35:51,250
Really? I see.

552
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,960
What about you?
Did you like Yeo Ha Jin a lot?

553
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,190
That's a misunderstanding.

554
00:35:57,230 --> 00:36:00,159
We really didn't go out. I swear.

555
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,860
What?

556
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:04,969
Hey! Do you know
what I went through because of that?

557
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,469
You are...

558
00:36:06,869 --> 00:36:08,099
the only one who has my heart.

559
00:36:08,469 --> 00:36:09,909
Really?

560
00:36:10,909 --> 00:36:12,070
I mean it.

561
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,309
I really like you.

562
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:21,250
Hey, why are you telling me that
all over again?

563
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,750
You...

564
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,260
like me too, right?

565
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,289
Must you ask me?

566
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,960
I want to hear your answer.

567
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:36,730
I like you.

568
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:39,300
(- Whatever. Bye!)
- Wait. Don't hang up.

569
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:42,170
She already hung up. That was so fast.

570
00:36:45,610 --> 00:36:47,980
Get a grip. She likes me.

571
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,079
Of course, she does.

572
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,219
Cut. Okay. Good work!

573
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,690
Let's move!

574
00:37:06,099 --> 00:37:07,260
Where's my phone?

575
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm good.

576
00:37:13,969 --> 00:37:16,010
Ms. Oh, this is the press release
for tomorrow.

577
00:37:16,869 --> 00:37:17,940
Thanks.

578
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,610
(It's so beautiful here.
We should come here together sometime.)

579
00:37:30,019 --> 00:37:31,190
Gosh, I'm tired.

580
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,360
(Gong)

581
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:37,530
It will stop raining
in about ten minutes.

582
00:37:37,559 --> 00:37:38,860
- Let's rehearse the scene.
- Okay.

583
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,000
This isn't right.

584
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,500
You didn't even fact-check.
How could you publish this?

585
00:37:43,530 --> 00:37:45,500
You've done this three times
this month alone.

586
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:47,239
I know you have to do your job, but...

587
00:37:47,739 --> 00:37:48,769
Oh Han Byeol.

588
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:52,239
What are you doing?

589
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:53,340
Hey.

590
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,409
I don't know.

591
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:57,679
My gosh.

592
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,179
I'm going to read the script now.

593
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,219
I see you here too.

594
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,519
You're much prettier.
You're so gorgeous.

595
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,320
(You're so pretty
that I'm about to go crazy.)

596
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,090
(Byeol)

597
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,329
- Bacon.
- You like bacon?

598
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,829
(The tteokbokki looks so tasty.)

599
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:23,010
I should go to sleep now.

600
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,369
When is your call time tomorrow?

601
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,710
Han Byeol.

602
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,210
I miss you so much.

603
00:38:29,809 --> 00:38:32,849
Finish the shoot quickly
and come back soon,

604
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,420
so we can have a nice dinner together.

605
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:36,519
Let's eat lots of delicious things.

606
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,750
We'll pig out together.

607
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,909
Ho Young.
Why are you grinning from ear to ear?

608
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:59,480
Oh, Yu Sung is already getting
a lot of offers for his next project.

609
00:38:59,539 --> 00:39:01,980
Look. It's still coming.

610
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,980
Oh, my. I should work even harder...

611
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,079
to make sure you can't outperform me.

612
00:39:07,849 --> 00:39:09,519
No, come on.

613
00:39:09,989 --> 00:39:12,190
Don't work too hard.

614
00:39:12,219 --> 00:39:13,289
Really?

615
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,159
- Gosh.
- Hey.

616
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,269
You're bleeding.

617
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,570
Wait here.

618
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:41,719
This really is your fault.

619
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,789
- What?
- What?

620
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:48,119
Oh, nothing.

621
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,190
- Thank you.
- All good.

622
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,159
Don't get hurt. Have a good day.

623
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,510
("That Year, Our Autumn")

624
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,460
Ho Young.

625
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:29,900
Oh, hey.

626
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:32,070
Are you done with your practice?

627
00:40:33,969 --> 00:40:35,070
You must also have...

628
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,570
an arrhythmia.

629
00:40:38,639 --> 00:40:39,710
What?

630
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:51,389
It's only a week,
but it feels like forever.

631
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:54,420
Why is time going so slow?

632
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,730
Let's see.

633
00:41:25,690 --> 00:41:29,360
I mean, just look at him.
He's one handsome boyfriend.

634
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,559
"Boyfriend"!

635
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:40,469
Gosh. He texted me again.

636
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:45,269
What? He's so bad at taking selfies.

637
00:41:47,539 --> 00:41:48,880
He's so cute.

638
00:41:49,309 --> 00:41:50,449
(Send me yours too.)

639
00:41:51,150 --> 00:41:52,250
I look ugly right now.

640
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,530
Something is missing.

641
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:09,769
My skin doesn't look that good.

642
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:18,010
Which one should I choose?

643
00:42:18,969 --> 00:42:22,849
No, wait! Don't look! Stop!

644
00:42:23,849 --> 00:42:25,349
Darn it.

645
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,179
(Byeol)

646
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:29,019
Nice, she doesn't disappoint.

647
00:42:29,789 --> 00:42:32,050
Han Byeol doesn't hold back.

648
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:44,000
She's so cute.

649
00:42:47,699 --> 00:42:48,900
I must do something about this.

650
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:54,309
Come on. Why isn't he saying anything?

651
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,079
Did he already fall asleep?

652
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:02,550
My skin is so dehydrated
because I've been working late.

653
00:43:24,909 --> 00:43:26,139
It's so hydrating.

654
00:43:27,139 --> 00:43:28,579
Should I send him another selfie?

655
00:43:30,179 --> 00:43:32,679
Forget it. He didn't even text me back.

656
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:35,079
Gosh. This is so annoying.

657
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,329
Are you already sick of me
because I sent a bunch of selfies?

658
00:43:45,889 --> 00:43:48,260
How could your heart change so quickly?

659
00:43:56,809 --> 00:43:58,269
(Gong)

660
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:08,019
- Were you sleeping?
(- No.)

661
00:44:08,050 --> 00:44:10,619
I'm in front of your home.
Can I go up?

662
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,889
What?

663
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,670
Okay. Come on up.

664
00:44:26,469 --> 00:44:29,039
Darn it. Hold on, what do I wear?

665
00:44:29,170 --> 00:44:30,940
Hold on, my clothes...

666
00:44:31,139 --> 00:44:33,139
Darn, he'll be here soon.

667
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:53,230
Come inside.

668
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:55,099
Okay.

669
00:45:06,179 --> 00:45:09,079
Did you come straight from the set
in the van?

670
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,250
Are you here with Jung Yeol?

671
00:45:11,650 --> 00:45:12,980
I came alone.

672
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:15,119
I'm good at driving.

673
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,420
I can drive stick shift.

674
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:19,789
So can I.

675
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:26,400
You were scheduled to drive up
tomorrow anyway.

676
00:45:26,429 --> 00:45:27,900
Why did you come when it's so far?

677
00:45:29,730 --> 00:45:30,829
I just...

678
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:34,269
missed you.

679
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:36,909
What?

680
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,210
What is it?

681
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:41,739
Do you not like it?

682

I do.

683
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:46,150
Well then,

684
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:49,750
can I get a hug?

685
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:58,059
I missed you.

686
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,699
Me too.

687
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,070
Oh, right.

688
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:08,070
I wanted to give you this
the day I confessed.

689

It's so pretty.

690
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:41,739
You...

691

are so pretty.

692
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:09,460
You're getting a call.

693
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,800
I don't have to take it.

694
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,000
This punk...

695
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
Just a second.

696
00:47:20,139 --> 00:47:21,539
- Hello?
- Tae Sung.

697
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:22,780
Where are you?

698
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,650
(Well, I'm...)

699
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,079
I'm at home. I forgot something.

700

(What? Home?)

701
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,050
Yes, I won't be long.

702
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,019
It's only a three-hour drive. Bye.

703
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:39,260
I'll have to get going.

704
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,329
I need to be on stand-by at dawn.

705
00:47:44,170 --> 00:47:45,269
Okay.

706
00:47:47,570 --> 00:47:48,699
I'll get going.

707
00:47:49,170 --> 00:47:50,239
All right.

708
00:47:56,110 --> 00:47:57,250
I'll really get going.

709

- Yes?

712
00:48:02,989 --> 00:48:04,590
Drive safely.

713
00:48:04,949 --> 00:48:06,889
Call me if you feel sleepy.

714
00:48:08,519 --> 00:48:09,730

I'll leave now.

Bye.

717
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:39,389
Goodnight. Sleep tight. Dream of me...

718
00:48:39,590 --> 00:48:40,690

Yes.

749

You've met Tae Sung
in the stairwell before?

Yes.

He said he loved house-warming parties.

757
00:50:48,280 --> 00:50:51,119
We were just his pawns.
His goal was Tae Sung.

It's obviously a groundless rumor.

He's planning to sue them all.

Leave.

830
00:56:42,269 --> 00:56:44,710
People might be watching.

831
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,670
Are you going to make me
stand here forever?

832
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,590
Why did you come here?

833
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:02,119
I'm your mom.
What's wrong with me coming here?

834
00:57:03,659 --> 00:57:04,730
Mom?

835
00:57:05,829 --> 00:57:07,900
You say that so easily.

836
00:57:08,699 --> 00:57:10,969
You've done nothing for me.

837
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,269
Well...

838
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,099
I gave you your looks.

839
00:57:18,409 --> 00:57:20,980
We do look alike, you know.

840
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:34,559
Stop talking and leave.

841
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,190
Ms. Kim Bok Soon.

842
00:57:37,889 --> 00:57:40,500
Oh, there's one more.

843
00:57:41,030 --> 00:57:44,670
I gave you that pretty name,
Gong Tae Sung.

844
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,809
I...

845
00:57:55,739 --> 00:57:57,750
really have something to tell you.

846
00:58:06,090 --> 00:58:09,690
I'm sorry. I forgot my purse.

847
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,300
(I'll take that too.)

848
00:58:25,409 --> 00:58:27,280
(You know that
you have to hold it for me...)

849
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,809
(when you only get
one limited-edition item.)

850
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:30,780
I'll be off.

851
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,250
What is she doing here?

852
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,980
- You're that woman, right?
- Goodness.

853
00:58:36,019 --> 00:58:37,150
Are you crazy?

854
00:58:38,019 --> 00:58:39,449
I'm sorry, Ms. Kwon.

855
00:58:39,489 --> 00:58:41,420
You can go. I'll call you later.

856
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:42,690
Okay. I'll get going.

857
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,190
She's that woman.

858
00:58:46,130 --> 00:58:47,530
What do you think you're doing here?

859
00:58:48,329 --> 00:58:49,429
Yu Sung.

860
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,329
Please get rid of her.

861
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:54,039
Please...

862
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,070
You should go.

863
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,650
She caught me.

864
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,320
It was fun.

865
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:20,659
What's his relationship with Eun Si Woo?

not just an ordinary housekeeper.)

876
01:00:26,590 --> 01:00:28,300
(Are you happy with Ms. Oh?)

877

this special gift?)
