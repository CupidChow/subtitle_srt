8
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:48,149
What is the most dramatic moment
in your life?

9
00:00:50,689 --> 00:00:54,130
Hey. I'll make it multiple choice
for you. Just pick one.

10
00:00:54,859 --> 00:00:56,960
When you graduated college.
When you first sold ten million tickets.

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,799
When you got
your first best actor award.

12
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,630
When you went to Africa.

13
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:08,140
It's so interesting.

14
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,040
You were by my side
for all those things.

15
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,579
What?

16
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,219
Stay by my side.

17
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:22,450
And don't go anywhere.

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,229
Who is he to tell me to stay or go?

19
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,969
Ms. Oh,
did you ask him all of the questions?

20
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,969
Yes, roughly. Thanks.

21
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:13,969
Sure.

22
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:24,280
Tae Sung.
Why are you sleeping like that?

23
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,560
(Episode 6: Dramatic)

24
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,060
Seriously.

25
00:02:38,259 --> 00:02:39,259
Gosh.

26
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:47,069
This punk did it again!

(Jang Seok Woo and Yeon Soo Hee
on a Riverside Date?)

28
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,270
There's no backing out of this one.

29
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:50,979
Darn it.

30
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,939
Yes, Reporter Kim.

31
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,580
They just started their relationship.

32
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:57,550
Please watch them with kindness.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,150
Thank you.

34
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:04,789
Darn it. Kindness, my foot.

35
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:07,789
I don't want you to watch them!

36
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,699
- Yes, boss...
(- Hey you, Cho Ki Ppeum.)

37
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,870
(Did I not pay you your salary
or forget to cover your expenses?)

38
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,340
(Why do you never bring me
front-page news?)

39
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,610
- Sorry.
(- Did I ask you to...)

40
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:26,439
(sell ad spaces or sell your soul?)

41
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:28,050
(You can't even bring me
celebrity dating news?)

42
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,780
(I heard Yang Soo Hyun is dating
Hanyang Group CEO's second son.)

43
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,020
(Almost nobody knows about this.
Get this story no matter what.)

44
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,650
(Don't even think about coming back
to the office until you do.)

45
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:43,860
I'll just kill my boss
and end up in the fiery pit!

46
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,180
Ho Young, stay still.
You're really distracting.

47
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,780
Hey! You said it wasn't true.

48
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,780
You said she's really just a friend.

49
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:10,289
Until yesterday morning,
she was really just a friend.

50
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,930
It hasn't even been a week
since we announced that...

51
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,030
you and Mi So broke up.

52
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,399
Why did you go to the Han River
instead of quietly staying at home?

53
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,629
I just felt a bit cooped up.

54
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:25,740
But Ho Young, is love a sin?

55
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,839
Love is not a sin...

56
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:32,139
but you'll lose
so many commercial deals.

57
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,149
Love is not a sin...

58
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:37,019
but how can you star in dramas now?
You dated all possible co-stars.

59
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,779
It's okay. Many of my relationships
ended on a good note.

60
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:41,949
They'll probably work with me if I ask.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,290
So are you proud of yourself, Seok Woo?

62
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,259
Ended on a good note, is that right?

63
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,399
You wrapped things up nicely?

64
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,970
No, Ho Young.

65
00:05:03,509 --> 00:05:05,639
Don't hit him. You must not hit him.

66
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:07,810
Hitting people is wrong.

67
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,680
(Ilmiri Gold Jjimdak)

68
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,529
Enjoy.

69
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,000
First, let's eat.

70
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,329
Yes.

71
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,569
I hate dealing with dating news
more than anything.

72
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,939
Why? Because you've never dated?

73
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,740
Hey. I've also never driven while drunk,
done drugs,

74
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,779
scammed, or hit someone.

75
00:05:38,079 --> 00:05:39,279
That's true.

76
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,480
It's so stressful.

77
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,649
Is there a foolproof photo?
Is this news helpful or not?

78
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,680
Is the couple well-matched or not?

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,050
They like each other,
so why are they judging?

80
00:05:49,089 --> 00:05:51,490
You're right. I feel bad.

81
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:54,160
I scolded Seok Woo so much today.

82
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:56,689
That punk is an exception.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,370
I got told off by my boss...

84
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:06,500
for not being the first to uncover
Jang Seok Woo's story today.

85
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,740
Even though
I have two best friends at Starforce.

86
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,250
Goodness, this looks so good.

87
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,550
- Is this jjimdak?
- Gosh.

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,620
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

89
00:06:18,649 --> 00:06:20,050
Look at all this cheese.

90
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:23,189
There's pasta in the jjimdak.

91
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,660
Killing two birds with one stone.

92
00:06:24,689 --> 00:06:27,290
- Wow, it looks amazing.
- Wow.

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,899
It's so good. Seriously.

94
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,730
Oh my. We should eat then.

95
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:44,040
I also found out just this morning
while shampooing my hair.

96
00:06:44,079 --> 00:06:46,680
The suds were literally
dripping off my head.

97
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,779
Yes, that's right.

98
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:51,879
He definitely said they were
just friends until yesterday morning.

99
00:06:52,519 --> 00:06:56,220
Whatever. I'm going to start a stakeout
for Yang Soo Hyun tomorrow.

100
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:57,990
(Stakeout: a tried and true
investigation technique...)

101
00:06:58,019 --> 00:06:59,560
(that involves waiting around
for the subject as long as needed)

102
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:08,500
Let's just
send everyone who's dating to jail.

103
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:10,670
Okay.

104
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,769
Look at this cheese.

105
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,040
- It's so good.
- It is, right?

106
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,709
Hi, Tae Sung.

107
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,519
Are you not feeling well?

108
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:30,519
I didn't sleep well.

109
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,959
Hey, Sin Ha. You're here.

110
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:37,899
Hi, Director Park.

111
00:07:40,399 --> 00:07:42,100
I'm in danger.

112
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:45,339
I might die before filming is over.

113
00:07:48,069 --> 00:07:49,870
What is it that you want from me?

114
00:07:50,209 --> 00:07:51,410
("The World of Stars")

115
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:52,910
Why? Are you...

116
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:55,610
going to give me
an exclusive or something?

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,050
An exclusive.

118
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:00,149
Would the news of us dating...

119
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,189
be an exclusive?

120
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,259
Cut. Okay.

121
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,459
Sin Ha.

122
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,160
Go easy.
You're even giving me butterflies.

123
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
I'll try not to.

124
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,709
Has Oh Han Byeol called?

125
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,339
No, I haven't heard anything from her.

126
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,050
She's a pro. She only comes here
when she needs something.

127
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,250
We should look for another actor
right away.

128
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,889
Bye.

129
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,019
Sir.

130
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:37,590
Why can't you suddenly cast him now?

131
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,460
You see,
we'd love to cast him for the role.

132
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,629
But as you know, everyone thinks
Seok Woo is a player now.

133
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,860
I get that, but you already
offered it to him verbally.

134
00:08:44,899 --> 00:08:46,929
You know the storyline of the film.

135
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,169
I would cast him
if it were called "I Love You As Well".

136
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,600
But it's called "I Love Only You".

137
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:54,539
("I Love Only You")

138
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:58,639
This character loves only one woman
with all his heart his entire life.

139
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,980
Do you think that suits his image?

140
00:09:01,879 --> 00:09:03,710
Come on, seriously...

141
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,490
His image is totally ruined.
On top of that, he even lost the role.

142
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,559
Do you think we can fix this?

143
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,490
There is a way.

144
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,529
I knew you could fix it, our PR expert.

145
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,899
The queen of PR!

146
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,269
Just make him serve in the military.

147
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,830
Come on, Ms. Oh.

148
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,899
Seok Woo already fulfilled
his military service.

149
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,340
Oh, right.

150
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:31,240
Why did he do it so early?
How diligent of him.

151
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,980
No wonder he can keep up
with all the girls.

152
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,179
Tell him to hunker down at home
and do nothing for about three months...

153
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:41,149
while praying
that there will be other scandals,

154
00:09:41,389 --> 00:09:45,590
until people no longer remember
whom he's dated.

155
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,830
Do you think that day will come?

156
00:09:48,559 --> 00:09:50,659
People quickly forget things
they don't see often.

157
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:55,129
Let's pray that
Ki Ppeum's stakeout will go well.

158
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,169
Okay.

159
00:10:29,769 --> 00:10:30,899
It's been a while.

160
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,669
Yes.

161
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,639
You've been well, right?

162
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,269
Yes.

163
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,240
You?

164
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,480
Me too.

165
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,049
Funny running into you here.

166
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,720
I was in the area
for a story I was covering.

167
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,029
I had an interview too.

168
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:26,860
This reminds me...

169
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,490
of the old times.

170
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,200
Does it?

171
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,049
- Hey, you.
- Sit down.

172
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:55,950
- When did you get here?
- Only a few minutes ago.

173
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,490
- What do you want to order?
- What would be good?

174
00:12:04,029 --> 00:12:04,929
Hey.

175
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,299
Are you on a stakeout too?

176
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,169
You too?

177
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,220
Hello.

178
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,950
My name is Kang Si Duk,
and I'm 23 years old.

179
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,490
Hey, Si Duk.

180
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,019
There you go again with your accent.

181
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:35,360
Really, again?

182
00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:37,059
I practiced over a thousand times.

183
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:40,460
It's okay. Then practice 10,000 times,
and you'll be fine.

184
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,970
Have you thought of a new name?

185
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
Ho Young.
Can't I just keep my real name?

186
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,070
- No, you can't.
- Okay.

187
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,769
Let's consult some naming experts.

188
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:50,570
And visit the set sometime soon.

189
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:53,009
- You'll learn a lot.
- Okay.

190
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:54,850
All right. Try again.

191
00:12:58,679 --> 00:12:59,879
Hello.

192
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,620
My name is Kang Si Duk,
and I'm 23 years old.

193
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:33,679
Ms. Oh.

194
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:37,490
Mr. Do.
Hello. I see you often these days.

195
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:42,029
I had to take care of some things
regarding Seok Woo's dating rumors...

196
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:46,000
and some other stuff too,
so I'm here again.

197
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,669
It's been quite eventful, hasn't it?

198
00:13:48,169 --> 00:13:50,000
I like to keep busy, so I don't mind.

199
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,340
I don't like it.

200
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:53,440
As you probably know,
I don't like working either.

201
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,809
I moved into my new home
a few days ago...

202
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,879
and found out
Mr. Gong is my next-door neighbor.

203
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,080
Really?

204
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:05,480
It's important to have good neighbors.

205
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,019
I'm sorry.

206
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:11,389
You said you two weren't dating,
but I thought you guys were still close.

207
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:14,559
I was in such a good mood today,

208
00:14:14,590 --> 00:14:16,429
but you're totally spoiling it.

209
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,399
Anyway, you must be planning
a bunch of housewarming parties.

210
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,570
Housewarming parties? I...

211
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:29,970
Yes, throwing housewarming parties
is like my hobby.

212
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:34,110
I would like to invite the PR team over
sometime soon.

213
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,610
Sure, sounds good.

214
00:15:01,639 --> 00:15:02,809
Tae Sung.

215
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:04,340
We're here.

216
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:11,320
- Hey, Byun Jung Yeol.
- Yes.

217
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,750
Don't come to work tomorrow morning.

218
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:15,190
Sorry?

219
00:15:16,919 --> 00:15:17,860
Tae Sung.

220
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,889
I mean, I'm going to work out by myself,

221
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,429
so don't come here in the morning.

222
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:25,429
Still, I should be here to...

223
00:15:26,429 --> 00:15:29,200
All you do is distract me
when I'm trying to focus on my workout.

224
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,980
Just sleep one more hour
before you come to work.

225
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:44,980
Bye.

226
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,519
Don't get out. It's a hassle.

227
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,450
Hello.

228
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:22,220
Yes, hi.

229
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,620
We meet again.

230
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,759
Yes, I guess.

231
00:16:43,539 --> 00:16:45,309
Are you and Ms. Oh close?

232
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:50,080
We're besties.

233
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,350
We're super close.

234
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:53,679
Oh, I see.

235
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,889
I was with her until just a while ago.

236
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,889
Good night.

237
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,730
"Until just now"?

238
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,609
Life is no fun.

239
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,609
It's getting too dry and boring.

240
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:23,710
I want something special.
Something to make my heart flutter.

241
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:26,950
A heart-fluttering event?

242
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,519
Hearing this...

243
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:32,559
reminds me of someone.

244
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:35,559
Who? When did you meet this person?

245
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:36,859
A few years ago.

246
00:17:37,359 --> 00:17:39,299
The perfect face.

247
00:17:39,329 --> 00:17:41,029
From a good family, highly educated,

248
00:17:41,059 --> 00:17:43,970
polite, and witty.
I happened to meet a man like that.

249
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:49,140
He was so perfect that I wondered,
"How could someone like this exist?"

250
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:51,180
Sounds too good to be true.

251
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,579
I know.

252
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:54,680
He was so perfect that I...

253
00:17:56,910 --> 00:17:58,650
I signed him.

254
00:18:01,049 --> 00:18:02,720
Is this an educational story or what?

255
00:18:03,349 --> 00:18:05,660
It's too wholesome.
This story is too dry!

256
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,720
- That made your heart flutter?
- Hush.

257
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:09,230
No.

258
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,230
Then one day,

259
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,970
my phone started ringing like crazy
in the middle of the night.

260
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:17,299
Why? Did he call to say he missed you?

261
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,599
Did he profess his love to you?

262
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,799
Or did he text you something like
"Are you awake?"

263
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,269
It was the police.

264
00:18:22,509 --> 00:18:25,509
It turns out he was an actual con man.
He truly was too good to be true.

265
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,450
Gosh, when I saw him handcuffed
at the police station...

266
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:31,349
I thought my heart was going
to burst out of my chest.

267
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,079
I think you misunderstood me.

268
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:37,619
How so?
My heart was literally fluttering.

269
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,119
You forgot the most important part.
Romance.

270
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,490
Oh, that's what you meant.
Dating is not my priority now.

271
00:18:43,829 --> 00:18:46,430
I have a foreigner who I can't talk to,
a crazy womanizer,

272
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,529
and the gukbap boy who uprooted
his entire life because of me.

273
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:51,000
Gosh, I'm swamped these days.

274
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,900
I guess that comes with
the responsibility of team manager.

275
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:56,940
Seriously? I should use that line too.

276
00:18:57,339 --> 00:19:00,480
"Dating is not my priority now,
I have to work."

277
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:04,750
No, it's definitely time for you
to date. You've done enough work.

278
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,950
It's not like I don't want to.

279
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,920
Let me ask something
out of sincere curiosity.

280
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,759
Did you never feel butterflies
for anyone?

281
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,630
You know, like your heart beating faster
than normal.

282
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,759
Right. Or your pupils starting to shake.

283
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,769
Or maybe your face turning red.

284
00:19:26,569 --> 00:19:27,869
Stay by my side.

285
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,210
And don't go anywhere.

286
00:19:43,619 --> 00:19:44,759
That never happened.

287
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,059
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

288
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:49,660
Goodness, this is much more serious
than I thought.

289
00:19:54,259 --> 00:19:55,400
Hang in there.

290
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,339
Cheers.

291
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:04,809
Poor thing.

292
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:11,380
("The World of Stars")

293
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,220
"The fans are adamant it's not true."

294
00:20:16,789 --> 00:20:19,519
"But a man and woman
were alone together."

295
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,259
"What else would they be..."

296
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,160
"but lovers?"

297
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:25,759
(Is that so? Then...)

298
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:28,269
"Is that so?"

299
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,200
"Then since we were together just now,"

300
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:37,170
"are we dating?"

301
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,710
I was with her until just a while ago.

302
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:50,849
What kind of stupid line is this?

303
00:20:56,529 --> 00:20:58,430
("The World of Stars")

304
00:21:26,359 --> 00:21:28,359

306
00:21:34,869 --> 00:21:37,299
I'm sure they were working. Definitely.

307
00:21:38,670 --> 00:21:39,900
That's all they did.

308
00:21:40,839 --> 00:21:42,640
They were working!

309
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,339
Being physically together
doesn't make them a couple.

310
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:47,240
Who said that? They're wrong.

311
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,180
Let's sleep. It's fine.

312
00:22:02,859 --> 00:22:04,029
I can't fall asleep.

313
00:22:20,079 --> 00:22:22,750
- Hello.
- Hi.

314
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:27,549
Did you not sleep well, Ms. Oh?

315
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,089
No, I had a bad dream.

316
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:33,720
I was chased by something all night.

317
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,029
But I can't even remember by what.

00:23:30,509 --> 00:23:31,720
(Hyekang Naming Center)

327
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:34,079
You got all these names
from the naming center?

328
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:36,119
Yes. We spent big money on this.

329
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,789
- Go ahead, Si Duk.
- Okay.

330
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,089
Hello, I'm Kang Ji Hoon.

331
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,460
No, there are too many by that name.

332
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,500
True.

333
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,130
Hello, I'm Kang Ha Da.

334
00:23:51,099 --> 00:23:52,700
That sounds a bit lame.

335
00:23:52,839 --> 00:23:55,609
I agree. It sounds like ta-da.

336
00:23:55,769 --> 00:23:57,940
He'll be teased for his name
without a doubt.

337
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:00,180
"Actor Kang Ha Da,
His Acting Chops Not So Ta-Da"

338
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,009
It doesn't suit his image either.

339
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:08,519
Hello, I'm Kang Tae Gong.

340
00:24:09,289 --> 00:24:11,859
Seriously?
Is he supposed to be a fisherman?

341
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,019
Is this a joke? Next one.

342
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:17,160
Hello, I'm Kang Si Yoon.

343
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,660
That's not bad.
He only needs to change one syllable.

344
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,869
- No, we can't use that.
- Why not?

345
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,400
It's my scumbag ex-boyfriend's name.

346
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,710
If he ever finds out, he'll think
I still have feelings for him.

347
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,539
That just sent a chill down my spine.
I forbid it.

348
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:31,579
(Kang Si Yoon)

349
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,480
Anything but this.

(Top Star Gong Tae Sung,
Voted Best Boyfriend Material)

351
00:24:49,789 --> 00:24:50,859
She saw it but didn't respond.

352
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:54,970
How dare she?

353
00:24:56,029 --> 00:24:58,099
I was voted best boyfriend material.

354
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,319
- Hey, PR gals.
- Yes, sir?

355
00:25:12,950 --> 00:25:14,079
What's wrong?

356
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:16,519
What does that look like to you?

357
00:25:17,619 --> 00:25:18,789
Isn't that Da Hye?

358
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:20,490
No, I mean this.

359
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,359
Is that a person?

360
00:25:23,390 --> 00:25:25,700
- Munch?
- The guy from "The Scream"?

361
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,029
It's Gong Tae Sung.

362
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:30,170
How did people make him out?

363
00:25:30,269 --> 00:25:33,470
I've seen him for years
and even I can't tell.

364
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,069
How could you not?

365
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,269
Look.

366
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,910
His round, chestnut-like head.

367
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,849
His dark, black hole-like eyes.

368
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,349
His perfect nose.

369
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:45,619
And those kissable lips.

370
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,490
It's clearly Tae Sung
even from a mile away.

371
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:53,319
That aside, who took this?

372
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,430
I can't believe
I caused Tae Sung trouble like this.

373
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,759
It's already all over social media.

374
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,670
The picture looks like
they could be alone.

375
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,769
Seeing how there are comments
asking if they're dating,

376
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:07,900
I think we'll end up with
a dating scandal.

377
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,970
But they ate together with the staff.

His reflection was
on a giant bowl of naengmyeon too.

379
00:26:14,009 --> 00:26:16,579
Not a fork or a knife.
But a stainless steel bowl.

380
00:26:17,009 --> 00:26:18,619
At least it's original.

381
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,579
Did you just laugh?

382
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,019
I'll get a hold of the restaurant's
security footage.

383
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:25,819
Gosh, what's all this ruckus
right before the drama premiere?

384
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:27,559
Isn't it the biggest eyesore
to see a real couple...

385
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:29,529
in a romantic comedy together?

386
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,630
Even if they're really dating,
deny it at all costs.

387
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,200
Yes, sir.

388
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,029
Gosh.

389
00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:54,450
Man, I can't even recognize myself.

390
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,220
This led to a dating scandal?

391
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,250
Yes.

392
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,690
(Oh Han Byeol)

393
00:27:09,769 --> 00:27:11,269
Right, sorry.

394
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:16,240
- Yes, hello?
- Are you dating Da Hye?

395
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:17,839
Why do you ask?

396
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:20,009
What do you think?
You saw the picture, right?

397
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,809
You heard that there's going to be
a dating scandal, right?

398
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,710
Yes.

399
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,650
We're going to say it's not true
even if it is,

400
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,150
but I still need to check the facts.

401
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,279
We're not dating.

402
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,849
Really? What a relief.

403
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:31,589
- It's a relief, right?
- It will be easier to respond...

404
00:27:31,619 --> 00:27:32,690
since I don't have to lie.

405
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,890
All right. Bye.

406
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,190
Hey, Han Byeol.

407
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:36,630
What? I'm busy.

408
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,089
I need to settle down
somebody's dating scandal.

409
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,900
Why...

410
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:43,000
Why are you so businesslike to me?

411
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,200
What do you mean?

412
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,339
I'm businesslike
because I'm doing business here.

413
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:46,339
Should I be crying?

414
00:27:46,369 --> 00:27:48,339
- Ms. Oh. I got the security footage.
- Okay.

415
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:49,609
Bye.

416
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:52,680
She hung up.

417
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,250
The director, Jung Yeol,

418
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,180
Ji Hyun, Yoon A...

419
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,920
Min Kyu was there too.

420
00:28:05,019 --> 00:28:06,819
(Save screenshot)

421
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:10,190
Okay. Let's settle down the rumor.
This is a piece of cake, right?

422
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,259
- Right.
- Right.

423
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,099
Yes, sir.

424
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,829
You saw the photo
from the security cameras, right?

425
00:28:17,869 --> 00:28:21,069
I know. I didn't expect this to happen
before the premiere.

426
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,309
Yes. We laughed a lot too.

427
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,779
I say they're not dating.

428
00:28:26,809 --> 00:28:27,910
I agree.

429
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:31,009
Ms. Oh asked Tae Sung,
"Are you dating Da Hye?"

430
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:33,480
If they were dating,
that would be ridiculous.

431
00:28:33,619 --> 00:28:35,589
How can someone deal...

432
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:38,559
with her boyfriend's dating scandal
so calmly like her?

433
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,319
That doesn't make sense.

434

(Gong Tae Sung and Baek Da Hye's

439
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:04,450
You need to go now.

440
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,920
Han Byeol isn't coming today either?

441
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:11,319
No. She's busy dealing
with the dating scandal.

442
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:16,730
Why is it so hard to deal with
a dating scandal that we laugh about?

443
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,700
All right.

444
00:29:26,339 --> 00:29:28,170
I still have to work.
I'm a professional.

445
00:29:32,109 --> 00:29:33,210
Gosh.

446
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,220
Tae Sung!

447
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:49,589
Why did she dump you?

448
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:01,069
Whose name do I call most often
these days?

449
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:06,609
Jin Yu Na has been going around
doing such ridiculous things.

450
00:30:06,839 --> 00:30:09,079
So I call her, "Yu Na."

451
00:30:09,509 --> 00:30:11,180
"Jin Yu Na."

452

"Jin Yu Na."

453
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:17,119
I called her name thousands of times.

454
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,789
And it became a habit.

455
00:30:19,819 --> 00:30:20,920
Did you call Eun Ji by the wrong name?

456
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:23,730
It's driving me crazy.

457
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,930
- I called her name wrong three times.
- You crazy punk.

458
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,700
Gosh. Here.

459
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:30,269
Drink this up and die.

460
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,599
I'm sorry, Eun Ji.

461

I'm sorry, Eun Ji.

462

Eun Ji.

463
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:41,579
I'm calling her in that same tone.

464
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,880
I'll be back.

465
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,220
What? Hey.

466
00:30:48,690 --> 00:30:49,890
Gosh, look at him.

467
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,460
Are you dating someone?

468
00:30:54,490 --> 00:30:57,089
Okay. In 1, 2. Action.

469
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,759
Don't you know who I am?

470
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:00,930
Are you from
a mountain village or something?

471
00:31:01,329 --> 00:31:02,700
Why do I have to know who you are?

472
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:04,470
If you don't know, you'd better learn.

I'm sorry.

- I'm sorry.
- Hey.

477
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,910
- What's so funny?
- Gosh.

478
00:31:15,079 --> 00:31:17,049
You said you were the national fairy.
How can I not laugh at that?

479
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,180
We'll go again.

480
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,450
Don't you know who I am?

481
00:31:23,119 --> 00:31:24,720
Are you from
a mountain village or something?

482
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,119
Why do I have to know...

483
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,690
Se Mi. Why are you laughing?

484
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:32,460
His nostrils were flaring.

485
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,160
Hey, stop it.

486
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,069
Gosh. I have a bad feeling about this.

487
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:38,099
They're at it again.

488
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,369
Let's do it again.

489
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,700
Don't you know who I am?

490
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Why do you keep asking me that?

491
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,640
Cut.

492
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:46,680
The national...

493
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,349
Cut!

494
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,680
I'm so sorry.

495
00:31:57,119 --> 00:31:58,190
For the last time...

496
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,890
We'll go for the last time.

497
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,720
We'll go for the last time, okay?

498
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,289
In 1, 2. Action.

499
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:05,859
Don't you know who I am?

500
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,559
Are you from a mountain village or...

501
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,400
Cut. We'll take a break.

502
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,369
We'll take a break.

503
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:20,910
Jae Hyeon.

504
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,509
When was the saddest moment
in your life?

505
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,480
When my grandmother passed away.

506
00:32:29,250 --> 00:32:30,390
Then...

507
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,859
think about that moment
and try not to laugh, okay?

508
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,829
Yu Na.

509
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:42,599
When was the saddest day in your life?

510
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:45,400
Yesterday.

511
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:47,400
I didn't get to buy the limited edition
from Hermes yesterday.

512
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:50,609
Gosh. You must be so sad.

513
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:53,839
I can't hear about it without tears.

514
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,009
Then...

515
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,809
think about that.

516
00:32:57,609 --> 00:32:58,950
When you're about to laugh,

517
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,849
try to hold it with that thought.

518
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:04,920
That's it.

519
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:07,359
Don't you know...

520
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:09,589
who I am?

521
00:33:10,789 --> 00:33:12,700
Are you from
a mountain village or something?

522
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,799
Why do I have to know who you are?

523
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:19,200
If you don't know, you'd better learn.

524
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,740
I'm...

525
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:25,809
the national fairy, Yoo Se Mi.

526
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:29,950
Cut.

527
00:33:30,450 --> 00:33:31,710
Are you guys trying to mock me?

528
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,920
The national fairy
just doomed this planet.

529
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:37,920
Why do they always have to
go to extremes?

530
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:39,789
- They're driving me crazy.
- You have some cigarettes?

531
00:33:40,089 --> 00:33:41,559
- I got plenty.
- Let's go.

532
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:46,730
- Let's do it again.
- We'll go again.

533
00:33:46,859 --> 00:33:47,960
Yu Sung.

534
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:49,200
Ho Young.

535
00:33:49,529 --> 00:33:51,930
Why is everyone sighing here?

536
00:33:51,970 --> 00:33:52,970
Well...

537
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,970
- Hello.
- Si Duk. You're here too.

538
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,309
Gosh, you're so handsome.

539
00:33:57,339 --> 00:33:59,009
If Ho Young gets on your nerves,

540
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,309
call me at DS Actors, okay?

541
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:02,809
You can ignore that, Si Duk.

542
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:05,250
You have no respect for your senior.

543
00:34:05,819 --> 00:34:07,180
It's your first time
visiting the set, right?

544
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:10,389
Watch carefully.
You never know when you'll be there.

545
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,320
Yes, sir.

546
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:15,760
- See you later.
- Cut, okay.

547
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:18,090
Now, the next scene.
Get the actors ready.

548
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:23,130
- Hello, Ho Young.
- Hi, Jae Hyeon.

549
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,699
Si Duk, you're here.

550
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,940
Yes, I am.

551
00:34:30,670 --> 00:34:31,869
Did somebody die?

552
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,809
My grandmother passed away.

553
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:39,019
Ten years ago.

554
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,519
It's a bit late,
but I hope she rests in peace.

555
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,260
Thank you.

556
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,989
You look so cool
now that I'm seeing you here.

557
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:50,260
You look like a real actor.

558
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:51,960
Really?

559
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:53,429
Gosh.

560
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,429
You can become one too if you work hard.

561
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,530
- You punk.
- Really?

562
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:58,099
What? Are you crazy?

563
00:34:59,869 --> 00:35:00,940
What?

564
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,340
Well...

565
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,409
What is it? Where's Park Jo Eun?

566
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,579
He's leaving to see his girlfriend
who's studying abroad.

567
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,780
He turned off his phone
to get on the plane.

568
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:11,750
Gosh, is he shooting a drama or what?

569
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:13,820
Bring a substitute right away.

570
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:15,179
- Right now!
- Okay, sir.

571
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:18,289
Hello? We need to find an actor
to play Hyun Dong.

572
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:19,420
Find one as soon as possible.

573
00:35:19,889 --> 00:35:21,559
He needs to speak with
the Gyeongsang dialect.

574
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:23,929
- Park Jo Eun went abroad.
- You have an actor here!

575
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:33,039
Do you know how to speak
with the Gyeongsang dialect?

576
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:35,840
I'm from Daegu.

577
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,110
What's your name?

578
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:43,909
Kang...

579
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:49,420
He's Kang Yu Sung.

580
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:56,059
Yes. It suits him well.

581
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,429
They say actors make it big
if they use a manager's name.

582
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,230
Seo Kang Jun was actually
Ha Jung Woo's manager's name.

583
00:36:01,329 --> 00:36:03,570
Right. Yu Sung also gave permission
to use his name.

584
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:05,570
Isn't it so dramatic?

585
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,269
(I raised my hand, saying,
"You have an actor here!")

586
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,340
(And Si Duk wasn't intimidated
by the director.)

587
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,110
When the director asked him
if he could speak with a dialect,

588
00:36:12,139 --> 00:36:14,079
he spoke so fluently.

589
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:15,809
Gosh, he was so amazing.

590
00:36:17,050 --> 00:36:18,710
It's so fascinating.

591
00:36:18,750 --> 00:36:20,050
There are ones
who always get their chances like that.

592
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:21,619
It's as if they're destined for it.

593
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:22,920
(Are you still working?)

594
00:36:22,949 --> 00:36:24,449
Yes. I have a live broadcast
of "The World of Stars" tomorrow.

595
00:36:24,519 --> 00:36:25,590
("The World of Stars" Live Cue Sheet)

596
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,360
(I hope you don't work too hard.)

597
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,489
Okay. You did great too.

598
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,429
("The World of Stars")

599
00:36:35,329 --> 00:36:36,400
We've sent you...

600
00:36:36,469 --> 00:36:37,730
- these interview questions before.
- Right.

601
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:39,269
Question number four
is off the list, right?

602
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:41,269
- We'll leave that out.
- Okay, thank you.

603
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:44,739
- We'll start in ten minutes.
- Okay, thank you.

604
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,480
Hey!

605
00:36:50,679 --> 00:36:52,050
What?

606
00:36:56,250 --> 00:36:58,019
- Excuse me.
- Hello.

607
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,389
Hey. How have you been?

608
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:09,130
The drama we've been waiting for
is premiering soon.

609
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,000
We have the lead actors
from "The World of Stars".

610
00:37:11,199 --> 00:37:13,699
The two stars that shine so brightly.

611
00:37:13,739 --> 00:37:16,340
We'll meet
Gong Tae Sung and Baek Da Hye today.

612
00:37:16,369 --> 00:37:19,280
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

613
00:37:19,309 --> 00:37:22,409
Tae Sung, I really wanted
to meet you in person.

614
00:37:22,650 --> 00:37:24,079
Thank you. Same here.

615
00:37:24,110 --> 00:37:26,619
My gosh! You just made my heart skip.

616
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:30,449
- You've gotten even more handsome.
- Gosh, thank you.

617
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:34,059
You're finally back with a new drama
after your volunteer stint.

618
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,289
How do you feel?

619
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:38,789
I have to say,
it doesn't feel quite real yet.

620
00:37:38,829 --> 00:37:42,230
Sometimes, I feel like
I'm back to being a total rookie.

621
00:37:42,269 --> 00:37:45,500
Come on.
What kind of rookie actor is this good?

622
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:49,409
Right. When we're filming,
he often stares at the ground.

623
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,869
- Pardon?
- "That's an easy spot to dig."

624
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,579
"This spot will be very hard to dig."
He mumbles to himself.

625
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,610
Well, it's become a habit of mine.

626
00:37:56,650 --> 00:37:59,019
I've become really good at shoveling.

627
00:37:59,179 --> 00:38:01,619
You could call me
the master of shoveling.

628
00:38:01,750 --> 00:38:04,050
I should ask the director
to add a shoveling scene.

629
00:38:04,090 --> 00:38:07,090
- No, we won't do that.
- What are you two doing?

630
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:11,030
You guys are already showing
excellent chemistry.

631
00:38:11,090 --> 00:38:13,199
Tae Sung, you were recently named...

632
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,400
the actor women want to date the most.

633
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:18,369
- Seriously?
- Yes.

634
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,440
- I had no idea.
- Really? You didn't know?

635
00:38:20,469 --> 00:38:22,070
- No.
- Then...

636
00:38:22,239 --> 00:38:25,780
could you tell us
what kind of woman is your type?

637
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,409
My type?

638
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,820
A good friend
who makes me feel comfortable?

639
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,289
Someone I can talk to.

640
00:38:36,519 --> 00:38:39,690
Someone I want to tease
when we're together.

641
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,559
(It's her, right?)

642
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:41,389
(Obviously!)

643
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:42,219
(It's her.)

644
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:43,260
I see. I love being teased.

645
00:38:43,289 --> 00:38:44,329
You do?

If you're a fellow human too,

812
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,789
then you must've felt
romantic feelings at least once.

813
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,590
Absolutely not.

814
00:51:58,719 --> 00:52:00,219
Not even once.

815
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:02,289
The more one denies it, the truer it is.

816
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,690
No, it simply means it's not true.

817
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:07,860
I can't work if I view celebrities
as a romantic object.

818
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:13,739
Hurry up and eat.

819
00:52:13,769 --> 00:52:16,199
I need to go to the office to watch
the premiere of "The World Of Stars".

820
00:52:17,170 --> 00:52:19,039
Together with Gong Tae Sung?

821
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:20,409
Of course not.

822
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:22,210
It'll just be my boss and colleagues.

823
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:25,579
Really? It's not like a watch party?

824
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:29,349
There are times when actors join us.

825
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,119
But sometimes they are filming.

826
00:52:31,789 --> 00:52:34,590
More than anything, Gong Tae Sung
likes to watch the first episode alone.

827
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:36,730
He says he can't concentrate...

828
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:38,460
if others are with him.

829
00:52:39,489 --> 00:52:41,900
Don't you think
you know him a little too well?

830
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,530
Stop teasing and just eat.

831
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,610
My goodness.

832
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,940
Our Da Hye is so pretty.

833
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:57,610
Her paycheck, even more so.

834
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,320
You must be over the moon.

835
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,889
You have Gong Tae Sung,
Bae Da Hye, and now Yun Jae Hyeon.

836
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,320
Well, you have Kang Yu Sung.

837
00:53:09,889 --> 00:53:11,190
Yes, right.

838
00:53:11,889 --> 00:53:13,059
My Yu Sung.

839
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,300
I'm still not used to calling him that.

840
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:18,099
Make sure he becomes a top star.

841
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,969
Yes, sir.
I'll try to shoot your name to fame.

842
00:53:22,599 --> 00:53:23,710
You cutie.

843
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,980
Hey, Ms. Oh. What took you so long?

844
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:35,449
It's about to begin.

845
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,550
Sorry, I'll come faster next time.

846
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:51,829
You're here.

847
00:53:52,469 --> 00:53:53,969
My gosh, Tae Sung.

848
00:53:54,269 --> 00:53:56,170
Did you pop out from the television?

849
00:53:56,199 --> 00:53:59,170
What an honor to watch the drama
with its main character.

850
00:53:59,309 --> 00:54:00,440
Sit down.

851
00:54:00,610 --> 00:54:02,780
I thought you'd be watching from home?

852
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:07,119
My TV broke.

853
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,489
How bad is it?

854
00:54:12,619 --> 00:54:13,789
It's beyond repair.

855
00:54:14,489 --> 00:54:15,659
I see.

856
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:25,900
("The World of Stars")

857
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,110
Tae Sung. You're so handsome.

858
00:54:31,010 --> 00:54:32,469
It's nothing new.

859
00:54:46,989 --> 00:54:49,090
Your action scenes are on point.

860
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,730
I'm nothing compared to you.

861
00:55:32,369 --> 00:55:34,139
(What is it that you want from me?)

862
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,599
(Why?)

863
00:55:38,340 --> 00:55:40,239
(Are you going to give me
an exclusive or something?)

864
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:45,380
(An exclusive.)

865
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,380
(If you're a fellow human too,)

866
00:55:47,679 --> 00:55:49,280
(then you must've felt
romantic feelings at least once.)

867
00:56:11,170 --> 00:56:13,480
Would the news of us dating...

868
00:56:18,909 --> 00:56:20,219
be an exclusive?

869
00:56:33,699 --> 00:56:35,960
- Gosh, great.
- Good job.

870
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:37,869
Great.

871
00:56:40,170 --> 00:56:42,440
Yes, sir.
Did you watch the first episode?

872
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:50,110
Yes, hi.

873
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,650
Yes, I think the response is good.

874
00:56:52,679 --> 00:56:55,179
Right. Thank you.

875
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,650
Yes. I'll look forward to it.

876
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,519
Okay.

877
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:02,719
Gosh.

878
00:57:13,099 --> 00:57:14,239
Hey, Han Byeol.

879
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,699
What?

880
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:21,639
What? Are you nervous
because of the premiere?

881
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,480
Gosh.
I didn't expect you to get nervous.

882
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,949
Goodness. Who says I got nervous?

883
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:31,090
So how was it?

884
00:57:31,389 --> 00:57:32,989
The reporters are positive about it.

885
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:34,460
I'm not asking about the reporters.

886
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:38,159
What did you think?

887
00:57:43,769 --> 00:57:47,070
Well, Yoon Sin Ha was cool.

888
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:00,349
What about me?

889
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:37,650
(Epilogue)

890
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,400
It's so cool.

891
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:09,980
Could you tell us
what kind of woman is your type?

892
00:59:11,690 --> 00:59:15,090
I guess... A good friend
who makes me feel comfortable?

893
00:59:16,159 --> 00:59:18,329
A good friend
who makes you feel comfortable?

894
00:59:19,460 --> 00:59:22,059
(Someone who makes me
feel comfortable and amuses me.)

895
00:59:22,659 --> 00:59:25,030
(Someone I want to tease
when we're together.)

896
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:27,500
(I like someone who makes me laugh.)

897
00:59:55,730 --> 00:59:57,099
- Hello?
(- Is it true that...)

898
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:59,170
(Gong Tae Sung is dating Yeo Ha Jin?)

899
00:59:59,199 --> 01:00:01,099
Pardon? What are you talking about?

900
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,599
(Did you not see the article?)

901
01:00:04,909 --> 01:00:08,440
I'll call you after checking with him.

902
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,480
(Gong Fish)

903
01:00:21,489 --> 01:00:23,090
Are you dating Yeo Ha Jin?

904
01:00:23,460 --> 01:00:24,760
You're not, right?

905
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:26,190
I am.

906
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,630

(The Couple in the Drama
Became a Real Couple)

908
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:40,210
(Yes, he's dating Yeo Ha Jin.)

909
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,980
They're just getting to know each other.

910
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:45,480
Yes.

911
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,420
(Please watch them with kindness.)

912
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:48,579
(Please watch them with kindness.)

913
01:00:48,619 --> 01:00:49,949
(Okay. Thank you.)

914
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,619

if it's right not to like her.)

921
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:16,400
(Is Tae Sung free these days?)

922

(Are you finally going to tell her
how you feel?)
