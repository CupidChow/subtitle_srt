00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:50,120
What?

166
00:10:50,149 --> 00:10:51,590
(I came to the set to see you today.)

167
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:53,190
Wait, hold on. That little...

168
00:10:53,559 --> 00:10:54,990
You're going to join her too?

169
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,559
- Yes, Tae Sung.
- You'd better get here now!

170
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,570
- I'm here.
- Byun Jung Yeol.

171
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,370
Why are there so many men
around Han Byeol?

172
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,779
So it was her.

173
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:14,279
The one you were curious about.

174
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:15,809
Yes.

175
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:17,820
I'm very curious about her.

176
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,389
They wrote such nice articles
about Kang Yu Sung, the actor.

177
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,590
Kang Yu Sung is our lucky charm.

178
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,759
Yu Sung.

179
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,159
From now on,

180
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:33,259
- put your arm around only me.
- What?

181
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,230
Okay.

182
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:42,110
What was that? I was talking to him.

183
00:11:49,179 --> 00:11:51,049
- Hello.
- Hello.

184
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,950
Is she the CEO of your agency?

185
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,620
She's my mother.

186
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:57,960
Hello.

187
00:11:58,289 --> 00:11:59,690
I see. She's your mother.

188
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,889
Please have a seat.

189
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,360
Could you tell me why you decided
to become an actor?

190
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:07,399
- I...
- My son was...

191
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:10,470
extremely shy growing up.

192
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:13,539
So naturally,
I was very worried about him.

193
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:16,809
I did some research and sent him to
the best acting schools in the country.

194
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,379
But you know what happened?

195
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,909
He was so bad at acting.

196
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,080
But that only made us more determined.

197
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:24,450
You became determined.

198
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,950
No, me.

199
00:12:28,090 --> 00:12:29,320
Anyway,

200
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:32,220
- I took some acting classes with him.
- I see.

201
00:12:32,289 --> 00:12:33,590
And you know what?

202
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:35,259
It was just perfect.

203
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,159
For you?

204
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,429
My gosh!

205
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:41,169
I see that you love telling jokes.

206
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:43,500
I mean, it was perfect for my son,
actor Han Yu Seok.

207
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,269
That's great.

208
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:49,240
I was worried,
but when he's in front of the camera,

209
00:12:49,309 --> 00:12:51,039
he does method acting.
You've heard of it, right?

210
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:54,909
On top of that,
he has such a nice voice just like me.

211
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,149
A handsome face, a great voice...

212
00:12:57,179 --> 00:12:59,049
Hey, why are you all quiet?

213
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,580
You're doing all the talking.

214
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,019
You need to flaunt your charms.

215
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:03,720
- Sorry, please excuse me.
- Sure.

216
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,519
Hi, Mom. I'm working right now.

217
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,190
I met someone. I think the two of you
will hit it off right away.

218
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,929
Yes, she's right here. Hold on.

219
00:13:11,929 --> 00:13:13,259
Would you like to speak with her?

220
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,769
- What?
- Go ahead.

221
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:18,600
- Hello?
- I'll make it quick.

222
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,440
What made you decide
to join your new agency?

223
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,379
What is it? A present?

224
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,549
You don't accept presents
from your fans.

225
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,620
Oh, this one is special.

226
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,149
The kids in Africa sent me this.

227
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,429
Isn't he so talented?

228
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:46,500
He should be a painter.

229
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,529
"Papa"?

230
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,429
His name is Luca.

231
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:53,070
His father passed away
when he was little,

232
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,570
so I told him I'd be his dad.

233
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,179
Oh, no! I'm so absentminded.

234
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:02,710
My goodness.

235
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,230
Tae Sung! Take this.

236
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,629
This must be a lot of work for you.

237
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:22,970
No, it's really nothing.

238
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,370
You rarely get to eat well on set.

239
00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:27,370
- Thank you.
- Oh, here.

240
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,139
I found this on the floor by the door.

241
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,110
I'll take that.

242
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,750
- I should get going.
- All right.

243
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,320
(Will you be all right alone?)

244
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:44,720
(Why don't I accompany you?)

245
00:14:44,919 --> 00:14:46,820
I can shop fine by myself.

246
00:14:47,289 --> 00:14:50,059
It's been a while,
so no one seems to recognize me.

247
00:14:50,159 --> 00:14:51,429
I feel very comfortable.

248
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:00,570
There's another Gong Tae Sung here.

249
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,110
There's one on every floor.

250
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,190
(How to confess your feelings)

251
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,789
(A 100-percent foolproof way
to tell her how you feel)

252
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:25,730
(Just look like this.)

253
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,909
I like you.

254
00:15:40,779 --> 00:15:42,080
Are you all right?

255
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,179
Yes.

256
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,649
Byun Jung Yeol, sit down.

257
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:47,279
Okay.

258
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,490
Have you...

259
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:54,120
confessed your feelings to a girl?

260
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:58,159
Are you finally going to ask Ms. Oh out?

261
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,429
Yes.

262
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,169
Hey.

263
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:07,269
You haven't told anyone, right?

264
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,269
Come on, Tae Sung.

265
00:16:08,309 --> 00:16:10,110
I know my vocational ethics
as a manager.

266
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:12,009
I didn't even tell my girlfriend.

267
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:14,139
Look at you. Impressive.

268
00:16:14,179 --> 00:16:16,149
Yes. Vocational ethics...

269
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:18,779
Enough about that. Have you ever
confessed your feelings to a girl?

270
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,019
Oh, that.

271
00:16:22,919 --> 00:16:24,090
That's...

272
00:16:25,919 --> 00:16:27,059
What?

273
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:29,330
Don't tell me you've never done it.

274
00:16:30,789 --> 00:16:31,929
No.

275
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,100
Surprisingly,
there's demand for guys like me.

276
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,299
"Demand"?

277
00:16:37,299 --> 00:16:39,870
You sound very smart today,
Byun Jung Yeol.

278
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,610
Thank you.

279
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,110
What about you?
You've never done it either?

280
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,580
Well...

281
00:16:46,179 --> 00:16:48,049
There's a lot of demand
for a face like this.

282
00:17:01,659 --> 00:17:03,259
Tae Sung, this looks delicious.

283
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:05,230
I was starving.

284
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,069
Dig in.

285
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:15,109
You go ahead.

286
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:17,369
Thank you.

287
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:28,849
Right?

288
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,049
You find it salty too, right?

289
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,789
Hello, ma'am.

290
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:45,740
I'll take it.

291
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,900
Sure.

292
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,680
I'll take that too.

293
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,250
Ma'am, I'm sorry.

294
00:17:57,279 --> 00:18:00,650
It's a limited edition,
so this is the only one we have.

295
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,190
We're really sorry.

296
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:09,160
You know that
you have to hold it for me...

297
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,759
when you only get
one limited-edition item.

298
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,700
My apologies, ma'am.

299
00:18:25,539 --> 00:18:27,079
(How I tied a girl's shoelace
and asked her out)

300
00:18:28,549 --> 00:18:30,609
(I tied her shoelace
when it came undone.)

301
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,619
(And she became my girlfriend that day.)

302
00:18:37,349 --> 00:18:40,559
Pull this and tie it like this...

303
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:42,029
Tae Sung.

304
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:43,259
Ms. Oh is here.

305
00:18:44,089 --> 00:18:45,859
Hello, Ms. Oh!

306
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:00,779
- Hello.
- Hello.

307
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,819
Goodness.

308
00:19:08,589 --> 00:19:09,789
This bed.

309
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:12,359
It is so soft.

310
00:19:13,289 --> 00:19:14,319
We'll shoot until here.

311
00:19:29,369 --> 00:19:32,039
Why did you go live after your surgery?

312
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,940
Do you want to go viral?

313
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,319
Please stop making my life difficult.
Give me a break.

314
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:44,559
Do none of her shoes have laces?

315
00:19:47,619 --> 00:19:50,289
Tae Sung, look. Ms. Oh is here.

316
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,759
(Actor Gong Tae Sung)

317
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:01,240
Yes!

318
00:20:01,769 --> 00:20:03,970
- Okay, be calm. It's all good.
- Okay.

319
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,589
What in the world?

320
00:21:22,619 --> 00:21:24,859
You were trying to tie
my shoes together, right?

321
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,019
I won't fall for it again.

322
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:28,730
You're the reason
I'm scared to wear shoes with lace.

323
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,960
Gosh, how could you be so evil?

324
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:34,559
- Don't go along with him!
- I'm sorry.

325
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,299
- It's warm, right?
- Yes.

326
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:44,039
She's coming, hurry.

327
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,349
(I gave her a warm cup of coffee.)

328
00:21:51,849 --> 00:21:54,819
(We felt a spark
and became a couple that day.)

329
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:01,460
Goodness, that was close.

330
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,130
- You mixed fish sauce in, didn't you?
- What?

331
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:07,130
I almost let my guard down.

332
00:22:10,569 --> 00:22:11,599
What?

333
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:17,670
Eye drops. Quickly.

334
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:22,579
Are my eyes teary?

335
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:23,680
Okay.

336
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:35,859
(No words are needed.)

337
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:38,059
(I stared at her lovingly
with all my heart.)

338
00:22:38,259 --> 00:22:40,160
(We became a couple that day.)

339
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,970
What's with the glare?

340
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,900
You want to go another round?

341
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,140
Can't you see I'm busy?

342
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,309
Move.

343
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:02,690
What kind of life have you led?

344
00:23:13,029 --> 00:23:13,900
Yu Sung.

345
00:23:13,930 --> 00:23:15,799
Why are you still working at this hour?

346
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,170
I'm a little behind with work.

347
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,910
Look at you all grown up now, Ho Young.

348
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:24,609
You used to stand stiffly like this,
asking me to teach you.

349
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:25,980
I remember it like yesterday.

350
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:29,349
Gosh, I'm still miles behind you.

351
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,450
How cute.

352
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,880
- Don't strain yourself too much.
- I won't.

353
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:48,230
Kang Yu Sung.

354

The actor's manager, Ms. Park.

355
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:53,470
Ouch.

356
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,269
Yes, that's me.

357
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,880
Why are you still here?

358
00:24:01,009 --> 00:24:03,150
I'm swamped with work.

359
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,349
We already had two big issues this week.

360
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,279
Hand-written apologies all day.

361
00:24:08,789 --> 00:24:10,519
Hey. Kang Yu Sung.

362
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,519
How cute of you, Ho Young.

363
00:24:15,089 --> 00:24:18,059
You thought to name your actor
after your crush.

364
00:24:18,089 --> 00:24:20,859
No, that wasn't my intention. Really.

365
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,869
I may be single,

366
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,500
but my dating radar is spot on.

367
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:27,039
Don't try to fool me.

368
00:24:30,869 --> 00:24:32,839
Yes, you are right.

369
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:37,880
Yu Sung is so dense
when it comes to this stuff.

370
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,079
Any plans to tell him?

371
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,920
None. I like how it is now.

372
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:48,160
Yu Sung, that man. What a heartbreaker.

373
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:52,430
Now is the time
to focus on Kang Yu Sung, the actor.

374
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,349
- Would you like a bag?
- Yes, please.

375
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,690
Wait. Mr. Poison?

376
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,759
Hello.

377
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:24,930
My gosh.

378
00:25:26,529 --> 00:25:29,000
Can I have your autograph?

379
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,670
I don't have one yet.

380
00:25:35,009 --> 00:25:36,009

(Yu Sung)

382
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,140
One, two, three.

383
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,519
You're that young man on TV.

384
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:51,490
- Hello.
- Goodness.

385
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,619
You're that guy.
Gosh, what was his name?

386
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:57,630
Whatever. Come sit down.

387
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:59,930
I'm sorry, I can't. Enjoy your drinks.

388
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:02,529
You just remind me of my son.

389
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:05,539
He works far away from here.

390
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:08,569
What? He's way more handsome
than your son.

391
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:12,210
My son is handsome too.

392
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,980
- Here.
- Have a drink.

393
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:16,750
I'm sorry. I can't drink.

394
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:19,579
Gosh, drinks that adults give you
won't get you drunk.

395
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,680
Take it.

396
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,420
Perfect.

397
00:27:02,029 --> 00:27:03,190
I'm home.

398
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,630
I'm done.

399

400
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,529
Ho Young.

401
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,200
(Hey. Where are you?)

402
00:28:47,230 --> 00:28:48,470
I'm at the dormitory.

403
00:28:50,630 --> 00:28:51,900
No, you're not.

404
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:53,500
Where did you go?

405
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,369
(I'm not at the dormitory?)

406
00:28:57,970 --> 00:28:59,039
Hey.

407
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,079
What's going on? Are you drunk?

408
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:05,619
Gosh, Si Duk.

409
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:07,150
What do you see around you?

410
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,019
(A slide.)

411
00:29:09,589 --> 00:29:10,619
A slide?

412
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:12,319
Hello?

413
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,490
Hello? Si Duk?

414
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,630
Is there a playground around here?

415
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,259
I think he's sleeping there.

416
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,359
Si Duk sleeps in his underwear.

417
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:23,400
Underwear?

418
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,579
Why? What happened?

419
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,150
Something happened.

420

(Video of rookie actor Kang Yu Sung
sleeping at a playground drunk)

421

(- What a crazy punk!
- Is he an actor?)

422
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:47,089
(- Is he really an actor?
- It's over for him.)

423
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,589
(He's in trouble.)

424
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,289
(- That's the worst.
- He's unbelievable.)

425
00:29:51,759 --> 00:29:54,029
(- What is he going to do now?
- What a scene.)

Ms. Kim. What are they saying
about the security footage?

Good. We have more positive comments...

than negative comments.

Eun Soo. What about you?

445
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:32,730
We have great comments here.

He became the talk of the town
since he cleaned the streets on his way.

450
00:31:43,509 --> 00:31:45,809
The stores are putting up posts
about him.

Good.

452

It's good here too.

453
00:31:49,109 --> 00:31:50,880
At first, they called him a crazy punk.

454
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,650
Now they're calling him a Greek deity.

455
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:55,519

this kind of drinking habit.

Yes.

Make sure this is your last mistake
caused by drinking.

There will be no excuse
if this ever happens again.

a handwritten apology too?

00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:57,429
What about Jae Hyeon?

496
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:59,269
He's getting
a lot of positive responses.

497
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,539
He also has an official fan club now.

498
00:35:01,139 --> 00:35:02,909
- What about commercials?
- He's shooting most of them...

499
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,909
with Jin Yu Na.

500
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:05,340
Is there a chance
that they fall for each other?

501
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,139
No.
They bicker whenever their eyes meet.

502
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,909
I'm embarrassed to face the staff.

503
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:18,420
Kang Yu Sung, the drunk fairy
who said that he couldn't drink at all.

504
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:21,289
I'm sorry, sir.

505
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,889
Thankfully,
people's opinions have changed.

506
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:26,599
Well done, Ms. Oh.

507
00:35:28,199 --> 00:35:30,730
Gosh. Look how haggard she looks
after all that.

508
00:35:32,469 --> 00:35:36,070
By the way, what if we lose
all the potential commercials we had?

509
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,949
Excuse me.

510
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:47,880
Hello?

511
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,519
What?

512
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,219
Yes.

513
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,489
Okay.

514
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,960
Thank you.

515
00:36:02,269 --> 00:36:03,429
Kang Yu Sung...

516
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,440
got a commercial for an underwear brand!

517
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:11,110
A commercial?

518
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,079
- Underwear.
- Underpants?

519
00:36:13,110 --> 00:36:14,179
Underwear.

520
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:15,780
An underwear commercial!

521
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:19,650
- A commercial!
(- A commercial?)

522
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:34,659
Ms. Oh Han Byeol.

523
00:36:37,329 --> 00:36:38,730
Mr. Do. What's up?

524
00:36:40,469 --> 00:36:42,809
I'm planning to have
the housewarming party...

525
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,239
that I told you about.

526
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,880
I guess you really enjoy
having housewarming parties.

527
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,809
You really don't have to invite us.
We're fine.

528
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,610
Throwing housewarming parties
is my hobby.

529
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:52,449
I move houses
just to throw housewarming parties.

530
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,550
I also...

531
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,590
I went too far.

532
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:01,059
When would it be good for you?

533
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:02,389
I'll bring my team.

534
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,630
I'll let you know.

535
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,929
I'll be waiting for you
with delicious food.

536
00:37:08,630 --> 00:37:10,530
You can act like
you have feelings for me.

537
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:12,800
That's what actors do, right?

538

("The World of Stars")

539
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,210
Actors...

540
00:37:18,469 --> 00:37:20,409
also have feelings.

541
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,480
I have feelings too. Can't you see?

542
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,489
Did I fail to show you my true feelings?

543
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,489
My heart is fluttering...

544
00:37:39,099 --> 00:37:40,400
because of you.

545
00:37:47,869 --> 00:37:49,710
Cut. What are you doing, Yu Young?

546
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:52,039
Are you that nervous?

547
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:56,179
Gosh, I'm really sorry.

548
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,650
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,880
No, don't be.

550
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,079
We'll try that again.

551
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,619
Okay.

552
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:12,559
Hey, why is he suddenly throwing
a housewarming party? It's so random.

553
00:38:12,760 --> 00:38:14,300
According to Ms. Oh,

554
00:38:14,329 --> 00:38:16,630
he's a housewarming party enthusiast.

555
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,599
Is there such a thing?

556
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:21,199
I don't know. I'm here because he's hot.

557
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,769
Anyway, aren't the apartments
in this building very expensive?

558
00:38:24,469 --> 00:38:26,940
Breaking news. Mr. Do is
young, rich, tall, and handsome.

(Breaking News, Lawyer Do Is
Young, Rich, Tall, and Handsome!)

560
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:30,480
And Tae Sung is his next-door neighbor.

561
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:32,849
This building must have good energy.

562
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,980
It attracts all the handsome guys.

563
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,650
(It brings out the garlic aroma.)

564
00:38:58,070 --> 00:38:59,510
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da!

565
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:03,380
- Hello.
- Hello!

566
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,409
We brought you a housewarming gift.

567
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:07,650
- Oh, thank you.
- No problem.

568
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:09,090
- Come on in.
- Okay!

569
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,090
- Oh, my!
- This apartment is huge.

570
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,059
I'd lose weight
if I lived in such a huge place.

571
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:17,989
- Come on.
- My gosh, look at this!

572
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,230
I've never seen this before!

573
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,429
Bo In, come in already.

574
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,929
- Let's check it out together.
- Okay.

What if she's seeing someone?

No way.

585
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:55,530
Han Byeol, then let me be...

586
00:39:56,070 --> 00:39:57,230
your honorary firefighter.

invited the PR team over
for a housewarming party.

I'm invited too.

Yes.

How can they leave me out
and have a housewarming party...

when I live right next door?

I won't go even if I'm invited.

I wonder what's taking Ms. Oh so long.

I guess her meeting with the director
is running late.

parties. This is so awkward!

640
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,349
Why did you call me here?

641
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,320
I thought it'd be better
with more people.

642
00:44:10,389 --> 00:44:11,849
Shocking news! It's still so awkward...

- even with Jung Yeol here!
- I know.

644
00:44:13,619 --> 00:44:15,460
I think I'm going to get indigestion.

645
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:16,630

What's this?

649
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:37,650
A welcome gift.

650
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:39,619
You gave me those rice cakes
the other day.

651
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,480
But I forgot to thank you.

652
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:44,619
Well, this is too big of a gift
in return for the rice cakes.

653
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,690
You don't have to do this.

654

Oh, I guess you were
in the middle of something.

655
00:44:49,219 --> 00:44:50,829
Like a housewarming party?

656
00:44:50,860 --> 00:44:52,760
I had no idea.

659
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,400
- Join us!
- They want me to join them.

660
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:46,650
What? Did I come to the wrong place?

661
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,889
You've come to the right place.

662
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:51,320
Come on in.

663
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:53,519
I'm sorry I'm late.

664
00:45:53,559 --> 00:45:55,920
But I brought you a nice bottle of wine.

665
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,429
Thank you.

666
00:45:58,389 --> 00:45:59,429
You can put those on.

667
00:46:00,559 --> 00:46:01,960
Hey, what are you doing here?

668
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:04,099
Oh, me? I stopped by to give him a gift.

669
00:46:04,670 --> 00:46:06,969
I wanted to give him a warm welcome
as a good neighbor.

670
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,010
Good neighbor, my foot.

671
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:14,340
- My, what a nice place.
- Could you close the door?

672
00:46:16,179 --> 00:46:18,480
I have to close the door? Fine.

673
00:46:21,519 --> 00:46:23,389
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

674
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:31,530
All right. These days,

675
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,230
- self-promotion is so important!
- Self-promotion!

676
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:35,929
Let's play an upgraded version
of the Son Byong Ho Game.

677
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:37,630
Say things no one else would've done.

678
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,070
The one who folds
all five fingers first wins.

679
00:46:39,099 --> 00:46:40,400
I'll go first.

680
00:46:40,699 --> 00:46:44,739
Fold a finger if you've been
in more than ten relationships.

681
00:46:45,269 --> 00:46:47,739
Ten? That's a lot.

682
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,380
Who's been in that many relationships?

683
00:46:51,010 --> 00:46:52,449
My gosh, Jung Yeol.

684
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:55,480
I didn't know you were that experienced.
I'm impressed!

685
00:46:55,519 --> 00:46:56,650
It just turned out that way.

686
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:57,849
I'm next.

687
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,619
Fold a finger if you kissed someone
within a week.

688
00:47:07,829 --> 00:47:10,599
What? You always say you're too busy,
but you had time for this?

689
00:47:11,699 --> 00:47:13,440
I should work you guys harder.

690
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,300
For some things, there's always time.

691
00:47:18,039 --> 00:47:19,110
It's my turn.

692
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:25,510
Fold a finger if you own a unit
in this building.

693
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:34,960
My mother owns this apartment.

694
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,429
Fold a finger if you own a yacht.

695
00:47:42,099 --> 00:47:44,070
I hate the ocean.

696
00:47:44,969 --> 00:47:47,070
Fold a finger if you have won
the Best Actor Award.

697
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,409
Fold a finger
if you passed the bar exam.

698
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:55,880
Fold a finger if you were voted...

699
00:47:55,909 --> 00:47:58,110
best boyfriend material and have
shoulders wider than 55cm.

700
00:47:59,619 --> 00:48:00,980
Fold a finger if you were voted
most popular...

701
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:01,949
at the judicial training center.

702
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,489
And I'll fold because my shoulders
are wider than 55cm too.

703
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:07,619
Are you sure about that?

704
00:48:07,659 --> 00:48:10,090
It doesn't look like it.
It obviously falls short.

705
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,130
All right, that's enough.

706
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:14,599
Did both of you never play games before?

707
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:16,300
You don't know the rules
and you're bragging nonstop.

708
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,230
How about we play again?

709
00:48:19,269 --> 00:48:20,469
With a different game this time.

710
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:22,639
What's that?

711
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,039
My hobby is playing board games.

712
00:48:26,809 --> 00:48:28,309
I'm still at the housewarming party.

713
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,710
I don't think I can make it today.

714
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,250
- Drink without me.
- Loser has to take the stairs...

715
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,119
- Tae Sung is here too.
- and not the elevator.

716
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:35,380
Beats me. He must be bored.

717
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:41,019
- They're soulmates.
- You have a slow reflex.

718
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,489
I never thought Mr. Do was that type.

719
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,329
- Too slow!
- Okay, bye.

720
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:49,460
- You're so good at this.
- Let's go again.

721
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,329
Mr. Do, you lost. Move over.

722
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:56,039
What's happening? Why are we so good?

723
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:57,239
I'll be back.

724
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,250
Ms. Oh.

725
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:06,780
Are you here to cool off?

726
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:08,750
You were so passionate about winning.

727
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:11,920
I can be that way sometimes.

728
00:49:12,219 --> 00:49:13,260
I can see.

729
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:14,960
I saw a different side of you.

730
00:49:18,829 --> 00:49:20,599
Gosh, your view is beautiful.

731
00:49:20,829 --> 00:49:23,099
It must be so nice
to see this view every day.

732
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,639
It's not as impressive
when you see it every day.

733
00:49:29,769 --> 00:49:31,670
But it's more beautiful today...

734
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:34,639
because I'm watching it with you.

735
00:49:45,019 --> 00:49:47,590
Your house is really nice.

736
00:49:47,719 --> 00:49:48,860
Wait.

737
00:49:49,059 --> 00:49:51,030
Don't tell me you threw this party
to show off?

738
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:56,199
Actually, I don't like
housewarming parties.

739
00:49:57,269 --> 00:49:58,199
Pardon?

740
00:49:58,730 --> 00:50:00,539
I never threw a housewarming party
in my life.

741
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:03,070
As you already know,

742
00:50:03,539 --> 00:50:06,380
I hate working past 6pm.

743
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:09,750
So why do you think...

744
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,579
I'm here with people I work with
at this hour?

745
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,289
Do you like someone from our team?

746
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,800
It's me.

747
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,179
It seems like this is news to you.

748
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:43,679
I will give you some time to respond.

749
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,590
Okay! It's mine.

750
00:50:51,889 --> 00:50:53,920
- This is how you play.
- Just hurry up.

751
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:00,929
You're here, Ms. Cho.

752
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:02,260
Yes, hello.

753
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,429
Where's Ms. Song Ji Hee?

754
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:05,570
She'll be here in a moment.

755
00:51:06,699 --> 00:51:07,940
Just to give you a heads up,

756
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,010
Ms. Song isn't feeling too well today.

757
00:51:33,659 --> 00:51:36,300
Hello, I'm Cho Ki Ppeum
from On Star Daily.

758
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:38,400
Thank you for coming.

759
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,099
Let me rest my head for a bit.

760
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:48,039
Go ahead. I can still speak.

761
00:51:58,420 --> 00:51:59,650
Go ahead.

762
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:01,360
I can still listen.

763
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:06,460
"To the Witch’s Diner" is over now.

764
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:07,599
How do you feel about it?

765
00:52:12,969 --> 00:52:14,800
Did something happen again?

766
00:52:17,269 --> 00:52:19,139
Did your boss throw another fit?

767
00:52:19,610 --> 00:52:21,840
No, I'm mad from an interview.

768
00:52:22,840 --> 00:52:24,409
I'm sure Song Ji Hee was more upset.

769
00:52:24,449 --> 00:52:26,309
I heard you sprawled out on the couch.

770
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:27,579
How did you know?

771
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,019
(Entertainment Agency PR Departments
Group Chat)

772
00:52:29,849 --> 00:52:31,289
Word sure does travel fast.

773
00:52:31,889 --> 00:52:34,360
I hear you had Han Yu Seok's mom
talk to your mom.

774
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,530
Gosh, you're truly a legend.

775
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:38,730
I have a mom who likes to brag
about her kid too.

776
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:40,599
They actually had a long conversation.

777
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:44,230
I've always thought this,

778
00:52:44,269 --> 00:52:46,099
but I'm so glad you're my friend.

779
00:52:46,570 --> 00:52:48,199
- You complete lunatic.
- Thank you.

780
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:50,340
You want to hear something worse?

781
00:52:50,369 --> 00:52:52,340
- Worse than this?
- Yes.

782
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,280
Do you have a role model, Yu Na?

783
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,380
Not really.

784
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:01,679
Meaning,

785
00:53:01,719 --> 00:53:04,920
she thinks there's no need
to single someone out, right?

786
00:53:05,119 --> 00:53:07,960
She has so many
respectful veteran actors around her.

787
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:09,320
They're all her role models.

788
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,030
That's what she meant to say.

789
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:14,800
What's your goal as an actress?

790
00:53:14,929 --> 00:53:16,059
I have no goals.

791
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:18,369
No goals? None.

792
00:53:19,170 --> 00:53:20,500
No goals.

793
00:53:20,539 --> 00:53:22,340
Meaning she doesn't want
to limit herself.

794
00:53:22,639 --> 00:53:24,710
There are infinite potentials waiting.

795
00:53:24,739 --> 00:53:27,309
I think you could interpret it that way.

796
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,210
Our Yu Na is really nice.

797
00:53:30,909 --> 00:53:33,010
But she's incredibly introverted.

798
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,360
Hats off to Han Dae Soo.

799
00:53:40,389 --> 00:53:42,420
I let her off because of him.

800
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,630
She can't be a celebrity
being that introverted.

801
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,929
Hey. What will you do about Do Soo Hyuk?

802
00:53:50,969 --> 00:53:52,070
What?

803
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:55,369
He's competent, handsome, and rich.

804
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,440
- He's the total package.
- Right.

805
00:53:57,469 --> 00:53:58,440
You're right.

806
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:01,510
So?

807
00:54:03,179 --> 00:54:05,349
It's so frustrating. If I were you,
we'd already be dating.

808
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:07,019
You said you felt butterflies.

809
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,420
That your heart beat faster.

810
00:54:09,019 --> 00:54:10,190
It did.

811
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:12,889
I'd be crazy not to feel that way
in that situation.

812
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:15,019
What is the issue then?

813
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:18,289
I can't tell if I felt that way
because I was surprised,

814
00:54:18,329 --> 00:54:21,159
or because I have feelings for him too.

815
00:54:21,199 --> 00:54:22,659
I don't know either.

816
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:25,000
I don't know, okay?

817
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:27,070
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

818
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,570
Han Byeol.

819
00:54:28,869 --> 00:54:30,110
You have guy problems?

820
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,710
I never heard you
talk about a guy before.

821
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:35,480
Seriously. We should be celebrating.

822
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:37,650
Your bill is on me today.

823
00:54:40,849 --> 00:54:42,820
- Thank you.
- Eat up.

824
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:57,829
Mr. Gong.

825
00:54:58,269 --> 00:55:00,269
I think there's something
you want to tell me.

826
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,940
You're not hiding anything from me,
right?

827
00:55:06,809 --> 00:55:07,840
What?

828
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:14,280
I like someone.

829
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,190
I didn't want to hide it from you.

830
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,230
It's Han Byeol, isn't it?

831
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:30,329
What? How did you know?

832
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:32,230
Of course I would know.

833
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:33,539
I've known you for years.

834
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:39,139
But would it be okay for me to date?

835
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,579
Yes, it's okay.

836
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:43,039
Are you speaking as my manager
or as my friend?

837
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:44,650
Both, of course.

838
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,050
I'll try to hide it.

839
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,150
I have a problem.

840
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,389
I tried to confess my feelings,

841
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:55,920
but I failed every time.

842
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,730
Han Byeol is so dense.

843
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,460
You have to express yourself clearly
for her to get it.

844
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,030
Yes, she's dense.

845
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:11,369
What does she like?

846
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:13,480
I'm sorry, Tae Sung.

847
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,280
I'll have to get going first.

848
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,710
- Okay.
- Thanks for the food.

849
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,119
One more thing, Tae Sung.

850
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,519
You should hurry up and confess.

851
00:56:22,980 --> 00:56:24,349
Mr. Do.

852
00:56:24,389 --> 00:56:25,650
He confessed his feelings to Han Byeol.

853
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,130
I'm rooting for you.

854
00:56:31,329 --> 00:56:33,559
Are you serious?

855
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,480
(Oh Han Byeol)

856
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:00,860
(Oh Han Byeol)

857
00:57:20,139 --> 00:57:21,840
What are you doing here?

858
00:57:22,739 --> 00:57:24,510
Gosh, you tell me.

859
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:27,650
Do I really have to come here
after work?

860
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:30,889
Yu Sung told me to give this to you.
He said it was really important.

861
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,920
He said you would make a fuss
if you didn't have it.

862
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:36,360
("We'll Meet Again")

863
00:57:38,630 --> 00:57:39,730
Thank you.

864
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:42,760
Gosh. I think I've lived long enough.

865
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:44,800
I didn't expect to hear that from you.

866
00:57:46,699 --> 00:57:48,199
- I'll get going.
- Hold on.

867
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:50,340
Han Byeol.

868
00:57:51,539 --> 00:57:52,510
What?

869
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,539
Is there something...

870
00:57:57,750 --> 00:57:59,110
going on with you?

871
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,050
- What do you mean?
- Well...

872
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,480
There's something...

873
00:58:04,449 --> 00:58:05,550
going on with me.

874
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,460
I...

875
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:24,969
I like you.

876
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:38,920
What?

877
00:58:39,889 --> 00:58:40,960
What was that?

878
00:58:42,090 --> 00:58:43,360
Gosh.

879
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:46,260
She left.

880
00:58:49,730 --> 00:58:52,000
Gosh. What do I do now?

881
00:58:56,869 --> 00:58:59,170
"There's something going on with me?"
What's that?

882
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:02,039
You should've given her
some flowers or a ring.

883
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,539
But why did she...

884
00:59:03,809 --> 00:59:05,780
run away while screaming?

885
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,380
Gosh.

886
00:59:08,750 --> 00:59:10,619
What have I done?

887
00:59:14,519 --> 00:59:15,760
It's Han Byeol.

888
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:18,190
Han Byeol!

889
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:37,449
(Oh Han Byeol.)

890
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:38,280
(Epilogue)

891
00:59:38,309 --> 00:59:40,179
(I remember the day I first met you.)

892
00:59:40,210 --> 00:59:41,320
(I remember the day I first met you.)

893
00:59:41,349 --> 00:59:43,280
(Please give me a moment.)

894
00:59:44,889 --> 00:59:46,320
(My baby.)

895
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:50,190
(I still have so much to do for you.)

896
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:53,829
(My goodness.)

897
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:56,429
(My poor baby.)

898
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,530
(I'm sorry that you were born sick.)

899
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:01,440
(I'm so sorry.)

900
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:03,170
(When...)

901
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:06,440
(we meet again,)

902
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,139
(I hope you're healthy.)

903
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:11,679
(Thank you...)

904
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,349
(for coming to me, my son.)

905
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:24,389
(I thought I was watching a movie
in the theater alone.)

906
01:00:25,329 --> 01:00:26,929
(But you were there.)

907
01:00:33,369 --> 01:00:36,570
(You cried your eyes out,
thinking you were alone.)

908
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,610
(Do you remember that?)

909
01:00:44,849 --> 01:00:45,849
Excuse me.

910
01:00:48,579 --> 01:00:51,789
Was it that sad?
You cried your eyes out.

911
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:55,789
I'm sorry.
I thought no one else was here.

912
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:58,460
No. I'm asking what was so sad about it.

913
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,659
Did you like the acting?
Were you able to relate to it?

914
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:04,929
I'm sorry for crying out loud.

915
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:08,199
But I didn't cry because of the movie.

916
01:01:10,539 --> 01:01:13,639
I cried because I was sad.

917
01:01:14,809 --> 01:01:17,480
I wasn't even watching the movie.

918
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:19,679
My grades dropped,
so I cried because I was worried...

919
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:21,019
I might have to retake the CSATs.

920
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,949
Let's not mess with someone
who has to retake her exams, okay?

921
01:01:35,929 --> 01:01:39,000
(You were so feisty.)

922
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:40,840
(You were so feisty.)

923
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:46,809
(You were...)

924
01:01:47,739 --> 01:01:48,940
(You were...)

925
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,750
(You were so cute.)

926
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:53,050
(So cute.)

927
01:02:30,590 --> 01:02:33,349
=Shooting Stars=

928
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:35,289
(I'd like to have a meal with you.)

929
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:37,230
(- Are you finally going on a date?
- Is this a date?)

930
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,030
(I'm the one
who makes the most profit here.)

931
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:40,090
(So when I call you,
you should call me back...)

932
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,000
(as the head of the PR team.)

933
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,030
(It works just fine.)

934
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:44,070
(Why are they so comfortable
around each other?)

935
01:02:44,170 --> 01:02:46,000
(How do you feel when you see
your friend kiss someone?)

936
01:02:46,030 --> 01:02:47,300
(He's a professional.)

937
01:02:48,300 --> 01:02:49,940
(Has Ms. Oh gone insane?)

938
01:02:50,170 --> 01:02:52,969
(There's nothing special about a date.
It's a date when two people meet.)

939
01:02:53,010 --> 01:02:54,079
(Do you think so?)

940
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,780
(This is so weird.)

941
01:02:55,809 --> 01:02:57,880
(Why? Is something going on?)

942
01:02:58,010 --> 01:03:00,409
(I confessed my feelings
to Oh Han Byeol.)
