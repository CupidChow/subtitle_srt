Right. I wonder what he's doing too.

He's doing volunteer work in Africa,

went to Africa to volunteer for a year.

Ms. Oh.

324
00:18:49,529 --> 00:18:50,529
Goodness.

325
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,240
Yesterday...

326
00:18:52,269 --> 00:18:53,970
Do you really have to ask?

327
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,170
I didn't call you.

328
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,509
Thank you.

329
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:58,579
- See you later.
- Okay.

(Weekly Work Report, PR Department)

331
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,309
Hey, Park Ho Young.

332
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:05,180
How many times did Jang Seok Woo
get involved in dating rumors?

333
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:06,150
(Choi Ji Hoon, age 51,
Director at Starforce)

334
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,779
Those rumors are going to be
his best works.

335
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:09,490
- I'm sorry, sir.
- All right.

336
00:19:09,519 --> 00:19:10,490
So what will he do about Cho Mi So?

337
00:19:10,519 --> 00:19:11,690
(Do Soo Hyuk, age 32,
Legal advisor at Starforce)

338
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,319
Is he going to see her no matter what?

339
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:15,559
Is he so affectionate
because the drama just ended?

340
00:19:15,589 --> 00:19:17,690
Does he have no affection for
the commercials he's losing?

341
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:20,359
That's not true. They had a fling,

342
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,470
but yesterday, they decided
not to see each other.

343
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,970
Gosh, they are so cool.

344
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Their relationship will be
Hollywood-scale in no time.

345
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,440
I'm saying this just in case.
Tell him to be careful...

346
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,269
not to get caught with
more intimate photos.

347
00:19:30,309 --> 00:19:32,740
Reporters and his fans have
their eyes on him right now.

348
00:19:32,779 --> 00:19:34,680
Okay. You don't need to worry about it.

349
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,880
What about Sung Min's new drama?

350
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:37,680
We're having the final meeting, but...

351
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:39,650
Goodness.
We're still having the final meeting?

352
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,180
Those punks of the station.

353
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:44,119
Don't they know he's the best
in the foreign market?

354
00:19:44,349 --> 00:19:46,319
If it seems like a dead-end,
let's move on right away.

355
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:49,589
Sung Min has to keep working.
He shouldn't have breaks, okay?

356
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,130
I've already made a list.

357
00:19:52,630 --> 00:19:54,329
Gosh, how many are there?

358
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,400
As expected from Kang Yu Sung. Great.

359
00:19:57,529 --> 00:19:58,900
If reporters ask about Sung Min,

360
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,339
I'll tell them it's one of the works
he's thinking about doing it.

361
00:20:00,369 --> 00:20:01,509
("Thinking about it" means "hesitating".
May also say "considering it".)

362
00:20:01,539 --> 00:20:02,609
Okay.

363
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,910
Gosh, our Tae Sung...

364
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,950
Everyone is making a fuss already.

365
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,809
When he comes back...

366
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,150
I guess we don't have to worry
about our sales for a while.

367
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:16,950
But didn't he say that
he won't read new scripts?

368
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:19,190
No. He said he wanted to focus on
his volunteer work.

369
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,460
He'll read them once he's in Korea.

370
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:22,559
I see. Right. Judging by his character,

371
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:26,059
making the well 1mm deeper is
the most important thing to him now.

372
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,869
By the way, is he wearing sunscreen
when he digs those wells?

373
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,500
Yes, a lot.

374
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,440
Of course. He's a professional indeed.

375
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:36,210
There are a lot of malicious comments
on our actors these days.

376
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:38,680
My team captured all of them
to keep them as evidence.

377
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,509
Mr. Do, there's no exception.

378
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,480
Okay. I'll get rid of them.

379
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:44,410
Good. Take all of them down.

380
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:45,650
Okay.

381
00:20:48,089 --> 00:20:50,519
By the way, I have something to say.

382
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,259
I'm a corporate lawyer
for Starforce Entertainment.

383
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:56,960
It means that
I'm not your personal lawyer.

384
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,799
If you need to discuss your divorce,
debt, division of property, and so on,

385
00:21:00,829 --> 00:21:04,099
please go through the formal procedure
to request a consultation.

386
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,900
Also...

387
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,309
"Can I still receive
unemployment benefits..."

388
00:21:08,339 --> 00:21:09,609
"if I beat up my boss and quit?

389
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,410
"A car behind me filmed me
doing an illegal U-turn."

390
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:13,210
"Is there any way I can avoid
paying the fine?"

391
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,579
Questions like these...

392
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,319
Ask people on the Internet.
They are much better than me.

393
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,019
I prefer working from 9am to 6pm.

394
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:25,660
Especially, when it's past 6pm,

395
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,230
I won't be taking these calls.

396
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:29,630
That's all.

397
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:35,829
Everyone heard him, right?

398
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:38,670
Let's draw a line between
work and private matters.

399
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:41,470
And...

400
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:43,809
You guys...

401
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,980
Please get regular checkups.

402
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:51,009
How many times do I have to tell you?

403
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,819
I'll be fined
if you don't get them by this week.

404
00:21:53,849 --> 00:21:56,250
If there's anyone
who doesn't get it until the end,

405
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,519
I'll reduce their salary.

406
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,160
What's wrong?
Do you think I won't do it?

407
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,130
You know that
I'm a man of my words, don't you?

408
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:06,829
Don't you?

409
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:25,619
Don't you think Mr. Do is
full of himself?

410
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:29,750
So it was you who asked him.
We caught you.

411
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:32,019
Well, I was in a hurry.

412
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,359
Why? I liked it.

413
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:35,990
He does his job well. Nice and clean.

414
00:22:36,029 --> 00:22:38,500
I agree. Doing his job well is the best.

415
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,500
I envy that he can say that
he won't receive calls after 6pm.

416
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,500
I heard that he's really rich.

417
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,299
They say that he's working as a hobby.

418
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:47,470
I see.

419
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:52,140
Anyway, when are you going to
get your medical checkup?

420
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,509
I was so busy, I forgot.

421
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:55,109
I looked it up,

422
00:22:55,150 --> 00:22:57,480
and we can only get it on Friday
since they're all booked.

423
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,750
Then let's go on that day together.

424
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,180
- All right.
- Okay.

425
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,220
What happened?
Weren't there five people?

426
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,819
Yes, but they ran away.

427
00:23:05,859 --> 00:23:06,890
Again?

428
00:23:07,259 --> 00:23:09,859
I guess they thought managers just go
to great restaurants like on TV.

429
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,829
My goodness. Right.

430
00:23:11,859 --> 00:23:14,230
If they're going to leave,
it's better to leave early.

431
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,470
So how are the ones who are left?

432
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,730
Except for one.

433
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:21,099
Gosh.

434
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,210
Hello.

435
00:23:26,009 --> 00:23:27,940
I've never seen a copier doing that.

436
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:32,450
It's the worst
when a fool is full of passion.

437
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:36,450
I hope my newbie is smart enough.

438
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:38,119
When will she be here?

439
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,190
Tomorrow.

440
00:23:39,890 --> 00:23:41,059
Her name is...

- Welcome.
- Welcome, Bo In.

445
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:50,170
- Mi Nyu, can you...
- Yes?

446
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,599
No, I'll do it. Follow me.

The Management Department
and our team are on this floor.

it's the International Development,
Finance, and Legal Affairs Teams.

movie and drama productions, right?

Gosh, another one quit.

453
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:11,119
Pardon?

454
00:24:11,319 --> 00:24:12,460
Nothing.

455

This is the Management Department.

We work closely with the managers,
so be nice to them.

- Bo In.
- Yes?

Don't get surprised or overreact
when you see the actors, okay?

462
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,680
They always see people
who are surprised to see them.

463
00:24:35,079 --> 00:24:36,910
But we're people who work with them.

464
00:24:37,079 --> 00:24:40,380
I see. Then should I pretend like
I don't know them?

465
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:42,150
Gosh. That's even worse.

466
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,650
Just act moderately.

467
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,930
Have you been a big fan of anyone?

468
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:50,890
I was a big fan...

of his.

470

Gosh.

I just can't get used to your face
no matter how often I see you.

474
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,529
I've seen you for a year now, but...

Goodness.

476
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:32,569

When I first heard that
you were coming here,

478

I didn't think you'd stay here
for a year.

479

I thought I'd leave the next day.

00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,910
Gosh, that's so...

481
00:25:45,079 --> 00:25:48,049
I'm sure people will love it
when you go back to Korea.

482
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:49,819
I heard that they all miss you there.

483
00:25:50,049 --> 00:25:53,660
Who is the person you miss the most
in Korea?

484
00:25:58,029 --> 00:26:00,759
Well, I don't know.

485
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,140
Many kids here will cry
on the day you leave.

486
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:14,039
I have a favor to ask.

487
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:23,450
It's something I want to say properly.

488
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:25,259
Okay.

489
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,960
I'll translate this
and teach you how to say it.

490
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:28,990
Thank you.

491
00:26:29,490 --> 00:26:31,359
I'm realizing once again...

492
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,529
that you're such an angel.

493
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,170
Are you hiding your wings?

494
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,799
- Come on.
- Why are you so sweet?

495
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:40,470
If someone in Korea heard that,

496
00:26:40,869 --> 00:26:42,769
they'd give you the evil eye.

497
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,240
(Gong Tae Sung, Worldwide Angel)

498
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:50,349
(He plans to return next month.)

499
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,750
(Next month)

500
00:26:53,549 --> 00:26:56,190
I should find another job next month.

501
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:00,319
(Sad)

502
00:27:00,690 --> 00:27:02,289
(Sad: 1 vote)

503
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:04,190
Welcome, Mr. Kang.

504
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:07,130
My gosh.
You've gotten even more handsome.

505
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,500
Forget my daughter.

506
00:27:08,529 --> 00:27:10,829
- You should be an actor yourself.
- Oh, please.

507
00:27:11,329 --> 00:27:12,869
Find her some work soon.

508
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,109
She's a couch potato these days.

509
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,440
Which is why I brought some work.

510
00:27:19,579 --> 00:27:21,480
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

511
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,579
Did you stay up all night again?

512
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:25,220
Yes. I was talking to the fans online.

513
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,980
(Baek Da Hye, age 27, The nation's
first love and queen of commercials)

514
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,890
(I missed Tae Sung so much
that I cried.)

515
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,589
(I really miss him. I'm lovesick.)

516
00:27:35,630 --> 00:27:36,690
(I'm already in the ICU.)

517
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:39,730
(My boyfriend, Tae Sung)

518
00:27:39,759 --> 00:27:41,500
(The smiley eyes were so cute.)

519
00:27:46,039 --> 00:27:47,970
You know the shoot
begins tomorrow, right?

520
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:49,269
I sure do.

521
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:52,809
I'm not sure if I can be there.
I have a full checkup tomorrow.

522
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,049
It's not my first commercial,
and I'm not a kid.

523
00:27:56,079 --> 00:27:58,049
Why worry when I have a manager?

524
00:27:58,079 --> 00:28:00,319
I know, but this is your first job
with the agency.

525
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,319
You worry too much.

526
00:28:03,789 --> 00:28:04,920
Here.

527
00:28:05,259 --> 00:28:06,920
I picked out some dramas
and films for you.

528
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,059
Pick your next project.

529
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,960
I've come a long way.

530
00:28:11,529 --> 00:28:13,299
People used to criticize
my terrible acting,

531
00:28:13,529 --> 00:28:15,000
but I get to pick projects now.

532
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,170
I know. I'm really proud of you.

533
00:28:18,369 --> 00:28:19,569
Then...

534
00:28:20,099 --> 00:28:21,970
I'll do whatever Tae Sung is doing!

535
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,640
I knew you'd say that.

536
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:29,109
I will become his most successful fan.

537
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:31,109
Anyway,

538
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,019
don't you think Tae Sung is so amazing?

539
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,549
He's the fastest in the world
with a spade.

540
00:28:36,589 --> 00:28:38,789
The wells are so deep
and produce such clean water.

541
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,660
I should've gone with him
to taste the water!

542
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:44,859
The kids there love him more
than their own parents.

543
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,500
They always follow him around for hugs.

544
00:28:46,529 --> 00:28:47,930
(I wish he'd hug me too.)

545
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,500
I want a hug too!

546
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:52,700
Oh, he plays foot volleyball
with the locals often,

547
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:57,269
and I heard it looks straight out of
a movie about young sports stars.

548
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,809
(I'd love to watch that movie.)

549
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,240
How do you know these things?

550
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,549
We know everything.

551
00:29:02,609 --> 00:29:05,380
You'll find his fans even in
the most remote region in the world.

552
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:07,750
Right, that is true.

553
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,690
But the thing is,

554
00:29:10,049 --> 00:29:11,819
one of the other volunteers...

555
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,859
is mean to Tae Sung.

556
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:15,089
So I did some digging.

557
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,690
Apparently, his ex left him for someone
who looks like Tae Sung.

558
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,400
Gosh, what a loser.

559
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:21,599
So what? Do they not get along?

560
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,630
Come on.

561
00:29:22,670 --> 00:29:23,869
Tae Sung is...

562
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:25,500
very nice to that mean loser.

563
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,000
My gosh, what an angel.

564
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,269
- Hold on.
- Okay.

565
00:29:32,579 --> 00:29:34,480
- Hello.
(- Mr. Kang.)

566
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,710
(- Do you think I'm a joke?)
- Sorry?

567
00:29:43,519 --> 00:29:44,589
Ms. Song.

568
00:29:48,259 --> 00:29:49,960
Do you need to save paper that badly?

569
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,329
I suppose...

570
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,759
you value me less
than a few sheets of paper.

571
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,039
I apologize.

572
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:04,970
You don't need
to be good to me anymore...

573
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,480
because I'm a washed-up actress.

574
00:30:06,509 --> 00:30:09,579
Mr. Kang! How could you do this to me?

575
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:11,509
You're basically telling me to quit.

576
00:30:11,549 --> 00:30:14,420
- You're dropping hints!
- No, that is not true at all.

577
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,890
I'm not doing this drama.

578
00:30:16,119 --> 00:30:18,519
I can't work when I feel this insulted.

579
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:19,990
Eun Sim.

580
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:21,619
Please don't say that.

581
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:23,789
Your fans are all waiting
to see you in a new drama.

582
00:30:23,829 --> 00:30:24,829
Forget it.

583
00:30:26,029 --> 00:30:27,400
You idiot!

584
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:29,930
Do you know
how important Eun Sim is to us?

585
00:30:30,299 --> 00:30:32,670
If she drops out,
the production company will have a fit.

586
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,470
Do you want this drama to get canceled?

587
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,740
I'm sorry.

588
00:30:35,769 --> 00:30:37,640
I don't want to hear it.
Just pack your things.

589
00:30:38,579 --> 00:30:39,740
Well...

590
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:41,109
Mr. Kang.

591
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,750
You don't have to go that far.

592
00:30:44,779 --> 00:30:45,920
I do, Eun Sim.

593
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,519
He printed your script
on the back of scrap paper.

594
00:30:47,549 --> 00:30:48,480
I must fire him.

595
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:49,650
How dare he?

596
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:50,990
Hey, get moving.

597
00:30:51,119 --> 00:30:52,420
No, wait.

598
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:56,490
Well, I just...

599
00:30:56,890 --> 00:30:59,160
I'll read the script again
and think about it.

600
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,269
How old are you?

601
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,099
I'm 26.

602
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,440
Oh, dear.

603
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:13,240
Go print out a new copy for me.

604
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,480
Yes, ma'am.

605
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,579
I apologize.

606
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,480
Do better.

607
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:20,849
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:24,250
Hey, Byun Jung Yeol.

609
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,619
To actors, their pride is everything.

610
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,059
And we must protect their pride.

611
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:32,130
Would you be happy if your contract
was printed on scrap paper?

612
00:31:32,759 --> 00:31:33,859
I apologize.

613
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,869
From now on,
report even the littlest things to me.

614
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,299
Don't make any decisions yourself.

615
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:39,400
- Understood.
- You can go.

616
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:40,940
Goodbye.

617
00:31:48,079 --> 00:31:50,150
(Ms. Song must've been furious.)

618
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:52,380
She played along in the end,

619
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:54,049
but it was my fault.

620
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,589
I had been neglecting her.

621
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:57,490
It must've hurt her feelings.

622
00:31:57,890 --> 00:31:59,960
You should be more attentive.

623
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,460
- I'll give her a call too.
- Okay.

624
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,059
Anyway, are you going to fire Jung Yeol?

625
00:32:09,099 --> 00:32:10,930
Well, I'll wait and see.

626
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,569
You know, there are times...

627
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,980
when you want to do so well that
you can only see what's in front of you.

628
00:32:20,009 --> 00:32:21,039
What?

629
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:25,480
I bet Jung Yeol...

630
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,180
really wanted to save paper.

631
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,119
How about a drink tonight?

632
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,559
We have our checkup tomorrow.

633
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,859
- Do you want to get chewed out?
- Oh, that's right.

634
00:32:38,829 --> 00:32:41,559
He might cut our pay, you know.

637
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:47,799
(The day before your colonoscopy)

638
00:32:50,109 --> 00:32:51,740
It's so complicated.

639
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,289
How am I going to drink this?

640
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,460
Darn it.

641
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:04,309
What was inside my stomach?

642
00:34:05,779 --> 00:34:08,789
I might die

What happened to your feet?

673
00:36:21,519 --> 00:36:22,590
Let me see.

By the way, when will you join
my company, Ms. Han Byeol?

694

Pay back what you owe me first, mister.

695
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:05,219
Why would you talk about money
to my face so early in the morning?

696
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,260
Hey, Park Ho Young.

What do you do
when you meet your senior?

698

Aren't you going to say hi?

Hello.

700
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,460
Hey, Dae Soo.

701
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,769
Are you still going on about seniority
when you quit the company?

702
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,840
Once a senior, always a senior.

even when you see him, okay?

704
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,679
He's not in our company,
and he won't be helpful anyway. Got it?

705
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,840
Okay, I got it.

706

- Yes.

- Wait.

Sorry for the late reply.

I just confirmed it with people
in Africa.

Hello, Mr. Cho.

- I'm sorry. It's a false report.
- It was an accident.

871
00:48:57,139 --> 00:48:59,309
- I finally reached people in Africa.
- That would never happen.

872
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,079

after every drama.

888
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,090
Maybe he's that attractive.

889
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:26,190
Maybe he's a playboy.

890
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:28,400
Oh, right.
Have you heard about Gong Tae Sung?

891
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,829
I knew it.

892
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:31,730
A kind person like him
would never do that.

893
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:34,039
How do you know
if he's kind or just pretending?

894
00:50:34,139 --> 00:50:35,869
It's obvious.

895
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:38,070
How can someone volunteer
for that long if he's pretending?

896
00:50:38,210 --> 00:50:40,210
He probably makes so much in a year.

897

After giving all that up?

898

Haven't you seen him paying
for valet parking so politely?

899
00:50:44,809 --> 00:50:47,150
That's not something you can pretend.

900
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,250
I'm glad it was a false report.

901
00:50:49,349 --> 00:50:51,389
I was so worried.

902
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,659
Worrying about celebrities is
the biggest waste of time.

903
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,860
- You think so?
- Gosh.

904
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:03,369
My goodness.

I guess Ms. Oh trusts Gong Tae Sung.

910
00:53:02,750 --> 00:53:03,820
Right?

911
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,559
When she was like,
"Gong Tae Sung would never do that,"

912
00:53:06,590 --> 00:53:08,960
I got goosebumps.

913
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,630
- They went to the same college, right?
- Yes.

914
00:53:11,059 --> 00:53:12,429
They must be close.

915
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:14,699
They went to university together
and graduated together.

916
00:53:17,530 --> 00:53:18,699
I'm jealous.

917
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,869
He did that on purpose, didn't he?

918

You don't play foot volleyball
with your face.

924

925

- Nice.
- Okay.

on the other end of the country.

935

He got me in big trouble.

936
00:54:19,889 --> 00:54:21,929
The other end of the country?
That's crazy.

937
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,769
So, did all the newbies leave?

938
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,440
No. I still have one left.

939

There he is.

940
00:54:34,739 --> 00:54:36,139
Really?

941
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,409
He has an amazing talent.

I have to print a script for Ms. Song.

961
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:02,329
Should I use new paper or scrap paper?

962

(Protect the environment!)

963
00:56:06,130 --> 00:56:08,340
You should protect the environment.

964
00:56:09,639 --> 00:56:11,139
Isn't it better to use scrap paper?

965
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,909
You think so?

966
00:56:16,849 --> 00:56:17,909
Thank you.

967

You're welcome.

Let me know if you're struggling.

969

00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,260
Have you heard the saying that
worrying about celebrities...

972
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:36,619
is the most pointless thing to do?

973
00:57:36,659 --> 00:57:40,130
When I think about it,
that's what I do for a living.

974
00:57:40,230 --> 00:57:42,500
I'm worried every day
about our actors...

975
00:57:42,530 --> 00:57:43,670
acting badly,

976
00:57:43,699 --> 00:57:45,130
saying something wrong,

977
00:57:45,170 --> 00:57:47,170
posting something weird on social media,

978
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:49,039
or getting involved in trouble.

979
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:51,210
It turns me into a worrywart.

980
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,980
Why wouldn't I?
I think about quitting every day.

981
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,840
I wanted to quit even yesterday.

982
00:57:56,409 --> 00:57:59,510
I think about turning this off
and just disappearing.

983
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:02,650
(Sorry and thank you every time.)

984
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:03,789
(My name was trending thanks to you.)

985
00:58:03,820 --> 00:58:04,849
(Good job, Ms. Oh.
You're our ace employee.)

986
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:05,949
(I've seen the video. It's awesome.
I love you.)

987
00:58:05,989 --> 00:58:07,059
(You're my biggest support.
You know I love you, right?)

988
00:58:07,090 --> 00:58:08,219
(Thanks for taking good care
of my guys. Let's grab a drink.)

989
00:58:08,260 --> 00:58:09,360
(The press release was pretty good.
Organic Bar tonight?)

990
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:10,429
(Thank you for your work.
See you later.)

991
00:58:11,329 --> 00:58:13,389
Isn't it fun...

992
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,099
to do something pointless for a living?

993
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:49,630
=Shooting Stars=

994
00:58:49,699 --> 00:58:51,829
(Why is he three days early?)

995
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:54,099
Oh Han Byeol. 28 seconds late.

996
00:58:54,139 --> 00:58:56,670
(Ms. Oh and Tae Sung
clearly hate each other.)

997
00:58:56,699 --> 00:58:59,239
(But they look like
they also like each other.)

998
00:58:59,269 --> 00:59:00,280
(This drama is awesome.)

999
00:59:00,309 --> 00:59:02,179
(- No reason for him to turn it down.
- Not doing it.)

1000
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:03,579
(I don't like your face.)

1001
00:59:03,610 --> 00:59:04,880
(Too pretentious.)

1002
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,250
(Hey, Gong.
Why can't you just let things go?)

1003
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,650
(I think there's a problem.)

1004
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:11,349
(Nothing's going right
since Gong Tae Sung came back!)

1005
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,619
(- Turn me into what?)
- Who was it!

1006
00:59:13,659 --> 00:59:16,590
(Oh Han Byeol?
I'll make your life inferno.)
