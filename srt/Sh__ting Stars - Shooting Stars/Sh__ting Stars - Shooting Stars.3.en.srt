Han Byeol.

00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,820
Were you happy to send me off to Africa?

10
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:53,390
Hey, Gong. Get your facts straight.

11
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,829
I didn't send you. It was your idea.

12
00:00:55,859 --> 00:00:58,729
So? That's the reason you never called?

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,329
(They dated back in college?)

14
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:03,799
There's no denying it.

15
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:05,299
Breaking news. Oh Han Byeol...

16
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:07,140
turns out to be
top actor Gong Tae Sung's ex?

17

(Breaking News. Oh Han Byeol is
Gong Tae Sung's ex-girlfriend!)

18
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:09,769
Everyone in shock!

19
00:01:10,579 --> 00:01:13,040
What does that mean?
Is he coming into the office...

20
00:01:13,079 --> 00:01:14,609
because he still has feelings for her?

21
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:17,819
Could this mean that
they are dating again?

22
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:20,920
My heart fluttered when
he whispered in her ear.

23
00:01:21,189 --> 00:01:24,920
That's why he came running
as soon as he came back to Korea.

24
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:27,760
That's right.
That's not just any recliner.

25
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:30,629
It means he wants to
comfortably lie in front of her.

26
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,569
That's why they are acting
as if they don't like each other.

27
00:01:33,769 --> 00:01:34,829
They're faking it.

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,609
Ms. Kim.
Then what's the Africa thing about?

29
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,409
How can she send him to Africa?

30
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:45,040
I just heard that she sent him.

31
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,280
Why aren't you saying anything?

32
00:01:55,489 --> 00:01:57,689
What? Were we...

33
00:01:57,959 --> 00:02:00,430
close enough
to personally contact each other?

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:09,500
That's right!

35
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:12,240
I wouldn't have answered
even if you contacted me.

36
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,969
Oh, is that so?

37
00:02:14,009 --> 00:02:16,740
- That's good, then.
- That's good, of course.

38
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,639
Since it's all fine, I'll be on my way.

39
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,080
- Go.
- I will. Don't follow me.

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,750
Go. I'm going to go too.

41
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:25,650
She's coming.

42
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:30,719
Gosh.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,719
Ms. Oh.

44
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
Here.

45
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,560
(Everyone knew about them
at Haesung University.)

46
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:05,990
What is this?

47
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,430
It was deleted
as soon as it was uploaded.

48
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,229
It's not on any other sites,
and it hasn't gone viral.

49
00:03:09,259 --> 00:03:10,759
But I thought you should know.

50
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,330
Ms. Kim, if you see this uploaded again,
tell me immediately.

51
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,099
I'm going to kill the punk
who uploaded this.

52
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,740
Seriously!

53
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,310
Nothing is working out
since Gong Tae Sung came back.

54
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,810
Darn it.

55
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,379
That's fine. I wasn't going to answer...

56
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,520
Tae Sung.

57

Jun Ho!

58
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:38,520
Hey.

59
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,860
It's been a while, right?

60
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:44,229
Yes.

61
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,400
Gosh. I...

62
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:49,099
didn't even contact you once.

63
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,840
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:57,139
You don't need to be.

65
00:03:59,909 --> 00:04:01,080
I'm...

66
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:05,449
going to die soon.

67
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:08,050
What?

68
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,389
- Die?
- Oh, dear.

69
00:04:11,659 --> 00:04:13,930
Why did you come all the way here?

70
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,289
Have you eaten?

71
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:16,790
I have no appetite.

72
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,399
Let's get you hooked up to an IV.

73
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,300
- It hurts.
- Careful.

74
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:24,269
Are you okay?

75
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,769
It's making me tear up.

76
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,779
- Oh, you must not be watching it.
- Watch your step.

77
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:32,709
It's a pretty popular drama
that's airing now.

Bend your knees.

79

Jun Ho...

80
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,980
got overly immersed in his role.

81
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:41,220
He cries even when he sees a fruit fly.

82
00:04:44,589 --> 00:04:45,620
So...

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,430
It seems like you're also
going to cry soon.

84
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,060
No, I just have very moist eyes.

85
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,300
I'll be going now.

86
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,600
Yes. Go ahead.

Cut! Okay. Good work everybody.

89
00:05:31,339 --> 00:05:33,439
- Good work.
- Good work.

90
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,240
- Gosh.
- What?

91
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,180
- What is he doing?
- Jun Ho.

92
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,779
Is he okay? What is he doing?

93
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:47,019
- Jun Ho!
- What's going on?

94
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:48,990
- Hey, hurry!
- Jun Ho!

95
00:05:49,019 --> 00:05:50,620
Are you okay?

96
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:53,019
Hurry. Hurry!

97
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,129
Hang in there!

98
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,699
One second! Somebody call 911!

99
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,730
It's overwork and malnutrition.

100
00:06:02,769 --> 00:06:04,899
He'll be fine after he rests here
for a few days...

101
00:06:04,939 --> 00:06:06,240
and eats well.

102
00:06:07,339 --> 00:06:10,339
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

103
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,410
What a relief.

104
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,480
Oh my goodness. Dong Jun!

108
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:25,720
They got hospitalized together.

109
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,759
Hey, Park Ho Young. Why didn't you
just get hospitalized with them?

110
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,829
No, that's not right.
I should've gotten hospitalized too.

111
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:34,529
I feel like I'm going to pass out soon.

112
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,899
Sorry, sir.

113

What will we do about...

114
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,439
all of the commercial shoots
and overseas promotions?

115
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:41,069
They said he will be fine
after a few days of rest.

116
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,709
Yes. I reviewed the contracts,

117
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,680
and it shouldn't be much of an issue
if we can resume things soon.

118
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,079
I'll adjust the schedule
so there won't be any big issues.

119
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,889
Okay. Let's please
take care of our health well.

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:56,120
It's all money wasted
if someone passes out.

121
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,290
Also, Jun Ho's next acting role...

122
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,459
should be very bright and healthy.

123
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:03,259
No. A super rich role.

124
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,699
No. That's also too weak.

125

Let's go for a role
where he takes over the world.

Tae Sung's very well.

Good. He is our main star.
He must be healthy.

131

He has so many commercial deals.

Actors, employees, and interns.
Everyone.

- I have to do it?
- Then what? Should I?

Couldn't you do it?

140
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,569
You know about our non-hierarchical
company culture.

141
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:49,740
Or somebody else could do it, right?

142
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,079
I can't ask Mr. Do to do it.

143
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:00,850
Okay. I'll do it.

144

You're in the same company
as Gong Tae Sung, Starforce.

149
00:08:15,129 --> 00:08:17,699
Yes. I admire Gong Tae Sung.

150
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,740
So I applied to the same school
and company as him.

151
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:23,939
People tell me I look like him
from time to time.

152
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,839
Now that you say that,
you do look a bit like him.

- Well then...

Yu Sung!

165
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,710
Hey, Jae Hyun. How did you do?

166
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:06,279
I think I did really well. The mood
in the room was great too.

167
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,649
I'm so proud of you.

168
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,320
- You guys came.
- Oh, Dae Soo.

169
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,019
Long time no see, Jae Hyun.

170
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:15,659
You became even more handsome.

171
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:16,659
Thank you.

172
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:21,429
Yu Na. You should say hello.

173
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,039
Right. Hello.

174
00:09:26,769 --> 00:09:28,870
Yu Na.

175
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,440
Go on. Do well.

176
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:36,679
Her attitude is so not great.

177
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,720
Did she get held back in kindergarten
or something?

178
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,049
She's missing basic manners.

179
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,990
Isn't it more of a problem
if she does well?

180
00:09:43,019 --> 00:09:44,519
Does it look like she will?

181
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,789
She's the daughter of a CEO I know.

182
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,299
I'm getting her a few auditions
just to look good.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,500
You are working so hard.

184
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,370
My life is exhausting.

185
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:01,039
Can't a great rookie
just fall out of the sky?

186
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,049
- You're here again.
- Yes, I am.

187
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:18,659
So? Have you given some thought
to pursuing a career in acting?

188
00:10:18,789 --> 00:10:20,360
I can't be an actor.

189
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,159
People like you should become actors.

190
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:25,129
My mother once told me...

191
00:10:25,399 --> 00:10:28,500
that streets were full of guys
who looked like me.

192
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,269
Where are these streets
that she's talking about?

193
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,940
Then do you have any siblings?

194
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:36,240
A brother, perhaps?

195
00:10:36,309 --> 00:10:37,480
No, I don't.

196
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,409
- He's really handsome.
- He's so hot!

197
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:46,950
(Flavors on a different level!)

198
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,149
He's so hot.

199
00:10:49,389 --> 00:10:50,960
(Smooth and clean taste)

200
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,360
Right there. And this one too.

201
00:10:56,159 --> 00:10:58,159
I see our artists on the wall.

202
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:02,429
I work for the biggest agency
in the country. You can trust us.

203
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,000
It's not because I don't trust you.

204
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,139
You can earn a lot of money.

205
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,269
I make pretty good money now.

206
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,409
Then don't you want
to inspire a lot of people...

207
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,009
to dream and hope?

208
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,419
I'm sorry.

209
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,889
You know,

210
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,659
I'm happy with my life now.

211
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,129
Tae Sung hasn't been coming by lately.

212
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:39,269
Why did he suddenly stop coming
to the office?

213
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,570
He and Ms. Oh must've had a fight.

214
00:11:44,309 --> 00:11:45,779
It feels empty here.

215
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:02,129
What? Is something bothering you?

216
00:12:02,389 --> 00:12:03,389
(Han Byeol.)

217
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,299
Were you happy to send me off to Africa?

218
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,629
Darn it!

219
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,240
All right.

220
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,340
I'm in a foul mood,
but I should still work.

221
00:12:17,009 --> 00:12:18,879
This is
the stress assessment questionnaire.

222
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:21,779
We need to send it back to the hospital,
so fill it out thoroughly.

223
00:12:22,679 --> 00:12:23,750
- Okay.
- Okay.

224
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:36,429
Are you crying?

225
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,559
(Sales Per Artist)

226
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:41,899
Were you watching "You Make Me Cry"?

227
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:44,539
Have you ever seen me cry
while watching a drama?

228
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:47,940
Tae Sung's sales report
moved me to tears.

229
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,909
Right, I bet.

230
00:12:50,909 --> 00:12:52,509
Hey, why the long face?

231
00:12:54,509 --> 00:12:55,610
Don't tell me...

232
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,080
Jun Ho's condition has worsened.

233
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,919
No.

234
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,480
He's getting better.

235
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,620
Goodness. Then what's the matter?

236
00:13:03,019 --> 00:13:05,889
- The thing is, I discovered a gem.
- Okay.

237
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,429
But he doesn't want to be an actor.

238
00:13:09,789 --> 00:13:11,830
You have a knack
for signing hidden gems.

239
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,799
You're Park Ho Young, known for
your perseverance and patience.

240
00:13:15,129 --> 00:13:17,200
But this one is really hard.

241
00:13:18,269 --> 00:13:20,769
How did you persuade Tae Sung
to sign with you?

242
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,309
I heard it wasn't easy.

243
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,480
You see,

244
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,919
it was the best day...

245
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:36,549
of my career as a manager.

246
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,720
Eureka.

247
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:31,940
Hello, excuse me.

248
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:36,110
I work for Starforce Entertainment.

249
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:39,149
(Entertainment Team Manager
Choi Ji Hoon)

250
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,289
(So what did you do?)

251
00:14:45,419 --> 00:14:47,730
(What do you think?
I kept following him around.)

252
00:14:48,029 --> 00:14:50,190
(Back then, he was so cold and cranky.)

253
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:51,929
Hi, Tae Sung.

254
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,370
"Tae Sung." Even your name is perfect.

255
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,139
It means a huge star in the sky.

256
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,269
You were born to be a star.

257
00:15:01,539 --> 00:15:03,269
Isn't studying so stressful?

258
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,840
There are many paths you can take
besides studying.

259
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,210
I...

260
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,279
- don't find studying stressful.
- Hey, mister!

261
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:12,750
Tae Sung has the highest grades
in our class.

262
00:15:15,019 --> 00:15:17,450
Having the highest grades
doesn't guarantee happiness!

263
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,559
Good grades do not determine
your happiness.

264
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,460
Tae Sung, do you know
how important money is?

265
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:28,000
I'll help you
so you can make loads of money.

266
00:15:33,769 --> 00:15:36,740
This guy has everything.

267
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:41,809
Do you know "Jerry Maguire"?
It's my all-time favorite movie.

268
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,679
It's about a sports agent.
It inspired me to become a manager.

269
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,149
You see, that's what actors do.

270
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,149
Don't you want to inspire people
to dream and hope?

271
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:58,830
Mister.

272
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,960
If you bother me one more time,

273
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,899
I'll call the cops on you
for stalking me.

274
00:16:08,370 --> 00:16:09,970
(That's what Tae Sung said to me.)

275
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,149
Do you want to know what made him change
his mind and decide to work with me?

276
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:19,879
That's...

277
00:16:20,879 --> 00:16:22,019
my trade secret.

278
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,190
Come on, seriously!

279
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,860
The important thing is...

280
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,460
that he must want to do it.

281
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:31,899
We can't force someone
to work in this industry, you know.

282
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,000
Right.

283
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,629
Anyway,

284
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:39,539
I wonder what Tae Sung is up to now.

285
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:43,240
(He's probably going over his script,)

286
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,840
(lying on the sofa.)

287
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,779
What? Were we...

288
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:50,210
close enough
to personally contact each other?

289
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,190
Come on!

290
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,659
You, Oh Han Byeol.

291
00:16:59,690 --> 00:17:02,590
I know we're not close.
Oh Han Byeol, you little...

292
00:17:02,629 --> 00:17:03,960
Were you working out?

293
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,559
- Kick!
- Who are you?

294
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,799
You're so disciplined.

295
00:17:20,009 --> 00:17:21,279
Hello, Do Soo Hyuk speaking.

296
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:22,950
(Mr. Do. Where are you right now?)

297
00:17:24,009 --> 00:17:25,250
I'm in the parking lot.

298
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,319
(Great. Wait just one moment.)

299
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:31,190
Mr. Do!

300
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,529
Is there another problem?

301
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:39,700
It's not like we have problems
all the time.

302
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,569
Here.

303
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:44,940
(Stress Index)

304
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:45,970
Please fill it out.

305
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,210
Well, this is...

306
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,339
The stress assessment questionnaire
we discussed.

307
00:17:52,339 --> 00:17:53,640
I'm good.

308
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,309
I'm even not an employee here.

309
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:57,950
- I don't want to add to your...
- Come on.

310
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:59,880
You're a part of our team too.

311
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,490
Besides, it must be stressful
to handle all our problems.

312
00:18:03,019 --> 00:18:04,960
Consider it a small token
of our gratitude.

313
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,119
Our mental health is important
in this day and age.

314
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,430
But make sure you fill it out
before 6pm.

315
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,859
Okay, will do. Thank you.

316
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
Han Byeol!

317
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,269
What? What now?

318
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:17,299
Apparently,
bad things will happen to Ju Hee...

319
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:19,269
- if she stars in the new drama.
- Who said that?

320
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,740
- The Baby Shaman or the General?
- The General.

321
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:25,039
Oh, dear. She can't get out of debt
if she turns down that drama.

322
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:27,009
- Bye.
- Bye.

323
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:35,349
Her stress level
probably beats everyone else's.

324
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,940
Jung Yeol?

325
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:02,849
I'm sorry.

326
00:19:05,319 --> 00:19:07,019
Tae Sung must be giving you a hard time.

327
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,250
No, he's very good to me.

328
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,190
Look at you, Jung Yeol.

329
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,990
You can even lie now?

330
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:16,559
Ms. Oh.

(Stress Index)

332
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:21,269
I'm not doing it.

333
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,599
I'm not going to do anything
Oh Han Byeol wants me to do.

334
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,140
Tell her that.

335
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,210
Why is she telling me to do things
when we're not even close?

336
00:19:31,910 --> 00:19:33,910
So? He won't do it?

337
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,480
Fine, it's his loss.

338
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,779
I'll take care of it.
You can get back to work.

339
00:19:40,119 --> 00:19:41,180
Okay.

340
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,420
Thank you.

341
00:19:44,859 --> 00:19:47,119
As if it's going to bother me.

with whom I can talk about my feelings.)

350
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,940
Darn it. He's not picking up.

(The receiver cannot be reached.)

352
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,380
Seriously? Is he rejecting my calls
on purpose?

353
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:45,049
What if this was an emergency?
He better pick up.

354
00:20:47,279 --> 00:20:49,890
(They really fought.
Was it because of the picture?)

355
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,890
(Without a doubt.)

(Breaking News.
Until when will this cold war last?)

357
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,259
(I feel like I'm watching a drama.)

358
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:01,130
So what are your stress levels?

359
00:21:01,769 --> 00:21:03,200
Mine is 60 percent.

360
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:04,470
I got 75 percent.

361
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:05,839
Is that high?

362
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:06,940
Mine is average.

363
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,069
I was told to get counseling
if my levels go up more.

364
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:10,809
I need to manage my stress better.

365
00:21:11,109 --> 00:21:13,839
Is that even possible?

366
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:16,710
Beats me. I'm always angry.

367
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,150
Thankfully, my entire team
scored average.

368
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,079
What did Jun Ho and Dong Jun get?

369
00:21:21,119 --> 00:21:23,450
They both got 90 percent.

370
00:21:24,789 --> 00:21:26,559
No wonder they fainted.

371
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:29,690
Obviously, I'm worried about Jun Ho
but Dong Jun is a bigger concern.

372
00:21:30,259 --> 00:21:33,230
He goes to bed later than the actor
and doesn't eat with him either.

373
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:36,170
His mood is codependent on his actor.
You know how it is.

374
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,599
I was the same at first too.

375
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,140
It'll slowly get better with experience.

376
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,339
Do actors actually get influenced
by their characters?

377
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,279
It depends, but it's hard not to be.

378
00:21:48,309 --> 00:21:49,880
They have to morph into the role.

379
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:51,579
If you have a method actor...

380
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,319
play a serial killer or a terrorist,

381
00:21:53,349 --> 00:21:55,190
it's a huge ordeal.

382
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Absolutely. When Park Ji Woo
was playing a psychopath,

383
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,119
I got on the same elevator once
and the tension was suffocating.

384
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,730
He had this murderous look.

385
00:22:03,859 --> 00:22:05,559
He's normally a total softy.

386
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,029
What about Gong Tae Sung then?

387
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:12,440
Why would you bring him up now?

388
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,609
He's probably in the tenth percentile
since he does as he pleases.

389
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,970
I bet he doesn't even get
stiff shoulders.

390
00:22:27,250 --> 00:22:28,549
Goodness.

391
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,849
(Gong Fish)

392
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:33,759
- Gong Fish?
- Yes.

393
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,630
Gong Tae Sung, the sunfish.

394
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:38,829
He causes 80 percent
of my shoulder pain.

395
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:42,200
For me, it's my boss.

396
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,069
That darn exclusive
he's always nagging about.

397
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,369
By the way, what about the gukbap guy?

398
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:52,779
I'm thinking of giving up.

399
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,240
After what happened to Jun Ho,

400
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:56,849
there's a lot weighing on my mind.

401
00:22:57,849 --> 00:23:01,019
I don't want to drag him down this path
when he's doing fine already.

402
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:06,619
This is a tough field even for someone
who wants it desperately.

403
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,559
Yu Sung.

404
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,740
I was really confident this time.

405
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:32,779
I had a strong feeling.

406
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:39,089
That jerk got the part, right?

407
00:23:40,859 --> 00:23:42,430
This was only his first try.

408
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,359
I've been training for three years.

409
00:23:47,029 --> 00:23:50,099
I seriously did my very best.

410
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:54,569
I think it's time I give up now.

411
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,839
No, Jae Hyeon. It's not your fault.

412
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:01,910
You're doing a great job.
It's all my fault.

413
00:24:02,549 --> 00:24:03,680
Yu Sung.

414
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,549
Goodness me.

415
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,680
Have a drink.

416
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,650
Gosh, our dear Yu Na.

417
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,589
We hit the jackpot with her.

418
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:15,460
I can't believe she scored a role
on her first audition.

419
00:24:16,430 --> 00:24:17,589
How did she get it?

420
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,569
(Open Auditions)

421
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:26,599
Hey, could you introduce yourself?

422
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:30,240
Can't you see my profile?

423
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:32,210
You already know me, so why ask?

424
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,140
(The role itself is a rude top star.)

425
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:37,279
(They thought she was acting.)

426
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,180
The role describes a rude brat.

427
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:41,519
But she's naturally a brat.

428
00:24:41,619 --> 00:24:44,390
So she just acted naturally.

429
00:24:44,490 --> 00:24:46,460
What do people call that acting?

430
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:48,630
Right, Medusa acting.
She's unbelievable at it.

431
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,289
It's Method acting, you punk.

432
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,430
Tomato, to-mah-to.
They both start with "Me".

433
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,660
You got my point.

434
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,529
Min Kyu. Come here and sit.

435
00:24:55,569 --> 00:24:57,730
Come on and sit yourself down.

436
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,170
- Oh, Min Kyu.
- Hello, Yu Sung.

437
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,200
Hi.

438
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,609
He joined my company.

439
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,109
He's in charge of Yu Na,
our good luck charm.

440
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:08,450
You did? Why didn't you go someplace
better? I'm sorry, Min Kyu.

441
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,950
"Sorry"? Why? Don't hurt my feelings.

442
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,920
What are you sorry for?

443
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,950
We all know who the leading company is.

444
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,720
It's DS Actors, so stop your nonsense.

445
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:26,759
Poor Jae Hyeon though.

446
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,670
If it weren't for that punk
with connections.

447
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,970
He's the investor's nephew.

448
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,640
Of all the relatives,
it had to be his nephew.

449
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:39,180
He'll be acting with Yu Na too.

450
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:41,509
I'm drowning in worries.

451
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:44,109
Have a drink.

452
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:48,319
- No way.
- Hey.

453
00:25:48,349 --> 00:25:50,549
- You came.
- You're here.

454
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,859
Hey. Isn't that
the punk with connections?

455
00:25:56,359 --> 00:25:58,630
That darn punk
is having the time of his life.

456
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:13,440
(What's going on with Tae Sung's
stress level test?)

457
00:26:13,509 --> 00:26:14,880
(Get a move on with it.)

458
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,980
(Oh Han Byeol)

459
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,019

(Are you watching a movie alone again
because you're stressed?)

462
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,440
Theaters are the best at this hour.
It's like I rented the place out.

463
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:16,369
I feel like a millionaire.

464
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,950
(For everyone's safety,)

465

(please be aware of the locations...)

466
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,619
(of your nearest emergency exits.)

(In an emergency, please follow
the employees for a safe evacuation.)

469
00:27:53,079 --> 00:27:55,180
- What?
- What? Why are you here?

470
00:27:55,309 --> 00:27:58,180
That's strange, I'm sure I got tickets
for an empty theater.

471
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,819
Same here.

472
00:27:59,849 --> 00:28:00,849
Whatever.

473
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:03,450
You ignore my calls
but you have time for a movie?

474
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:04,849
Hey, be quiet.

475
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:08,690
(You are now in Theater Two.)

476
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:12,460
You don't do your assignments
but you have time for a movie?

477
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,259
Let's just watch the movie.

478
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:12,519
Hey.

479
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,859
Never come here again, okay?

480
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,359
This place has always been mine.

481
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,759
What are you talking about?

482
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:19,829
I found out about this place before you.

483
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,059
Never mind.

484
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:24,369
I'll just buy this place.

485
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,400
Gosh, you're such a top star.

486
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,869
You sure know how to waste money.

487
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:30,210
You should help people in need
with that money.

488
00:29:31,809 --> 00:29:33,339
People in need?

489
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:35,650
I'm already helping them enough.

490
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,279
I'm leaving.

491
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,589
Hey, Gong!

492
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:47,619
What?

493
00:29:52,829 --> 00:29:56,529
Do you really think
I sent you to Africa?

494
00:29:56,569 --> 00:29:58,670
- You didn't?
- Ask anyone on the streets.

495
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,039
Let's ask them who's right.

496
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:03,440
Why don't we put it
to a nationwide vote?

497
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,380
Gosh.

498
00:30:05,579 --> 00:30:06,740
Follow me.

499
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,579
- Do you think I'll just follow you...
- I said, follow me.

500
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,220
Gui Nong.

501
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,029
How long has it been since I saw
the two of you together?

502
00:30:27,359 --> 00:30:28,569
Long time no see.

503
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:32,569
So...

504
00:30:32,599 --> 00:30:35,339
You want me to decide
whose decision it was...

505
00:30:35,369 --> 00:30:37,039
to send you to Africa?

506
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,809
Next, we'll have time to take
Mr. Gong Tae Sung's photos.

Tae Sung, please strike a pose.

510
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:50,849
Let's go!

511
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,990
(Hold on. Why was your finger injured?)

512
00:30:54,119 --> 00:30:56,890
(I was shooting an action scene,
and there was a mistake.)

513
00:30:58,759 --> 00:30:59,900
I apologize.

514
00:31:03,730 --> 00:31:04,799
See you later then.

515
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,000
- Okay.
- I will see you later.

516
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,569
- Good job.
- We'll see you later.

517
00:31:11,910 --> 00:31:13,680
Gosh, I just flipped everyone off.

518
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,880
It's okay. Hey.

519
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,180
I need to use the restroom.

520
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:19,279
The waiting room is
right around the corner, okay?

521
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:20,450
That's not the problem.

522
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:24,390
Goodness.

523
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:28,190

524
00:31:28,259 --> 00:31:30,490

(Tae Sung.)

and help people.)

531
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,180

535
00:31:57,019 --> 00:31:58,349
I want to go there.

536
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,859
I will dig wells for them...

537

538

Okay.

539
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,099

What are you talking about?

You're going with me.

I don't want to go.

543

Why not? Let's go together.

544

What?

Well...

549
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,390
Is volunteering in Africa difficult?

550
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,890
Why? Are you planning to do that?

551
00:32:37,829 --> 00:32:38,930
Yes.

552
00:32:39,829 --> 00:32:40,960

Calm down.

There's nothing in your face...

557
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:55,079
that reminds me of someone...

558
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:56,349
who does volunteer work.

559
00:32:56,710 --> 00:32:57,880
So calm down.

560

I'm the Gong Tae Sung.
You think I can't do it?

563

No.

565
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,700
Okay. Is that how it's going to be?

566

(It was different from the rumors.)

572
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,750
So that's how you ended up
going to Africa?

573
00:33:29,779 --> 00:33:31,009
That's right.

574

He cried out loud that
he will go to Africa.

575
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:35,349
He made a fuss saying he will leave

The company went through so much.

And who said you could stay there
for a whole year?

578

I wouldn't have done it
if you hadn't laughed at me.

What nonsense.
You really shouldn't lie, you know.

- Gui Nong.
- Yes?

581

The corners of her mouth went like this.

Do you know how irritating it is
whenever she does that?

583
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,410
All right. So whose fault is it?

584
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,339
Don't you dare take his side
just because he's a celebrity.

585

The one at fault is...

588

It's my fault.

589

That day...

590
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,460
I went to the bathroom because
of a stomachache. It's my fault.

591

No!

Is this your personal decision?

601

(My goodness.)

602
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,679
I didn't tell him exactly
where the waiting room was...

603
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,420
and went to the bathroom.
So it's my fault.

604
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:44,320
How did I become a manager?
I should just die.

605
00:34:45,289 --> 00:34:47,360
- Gosh, why would you die?
- My goodness.

606

Gosh, I'm fine, okay?

607
00:34:48,789 --> 00:34:50,860
Right. It's his fault
that he got confused.

608

Is he an idiot or what?
How can he get that confused?

609
00:34:52,559 --> 00:34:53,500
What...

610
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,059
An idiot? My gosh

611
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:57,300
- You're picking a fight, right?
- I could say the same to you.

612
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:58,670
Why did you shout out loud?

613
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,099
You're the one who said I wasn't
the volunteering type.

614
00:35:00,139 --> 00:35:01,300
You're the one who got me riled up.

615
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,539
Does everyone who gets riled up
go to Africa then?

616
00:35:02,570 --> 00:35:04,039
Well, I do. What will you do about it?

617
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:06,110
You seem riled up now.
Why don't you go to Africa again?

618
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,239
- Gosh, you...
- What?

619
00:35:07,809 --> 00:35:08,949
What!

620
00:35:09,679 --> 00:35:11,380
Keep going. Go to Africa then.

621
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:12,949
They are the same.

622
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:14,280
- You are...
- Just say it.

623
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,789
It's like they never stopped.

624
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:17,150
You seem upset, so go again.

625
00:35:17,190 --> 00:35:18,820
I will go to Africa
when I'm riled up and...

626
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,559
Keep going.
Tell me about it since you're angry.

627
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,989
You're making me really angry.

Ms. Hong Bo In.

630
00:35:41,710 --> 00:35:42,780
Hello.

631
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,750
Why are you exercising up here?

632
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,920
Tae Sung has been working out
a lot these days.

633
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,590
I've been joining him too.

634
00:35:50,219 --> 00:35:52,420
But I didn't have enough stamina,

635
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:54,519
so when we were on treadmills, I...

636
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,090
Did you fall down?

637
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:57,360
No.

638
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,760
I guess you threw up.

639
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,429
How did you know that?

640
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,670
I've done that before.

641
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,570
I see. So that happens quite a lot.

642
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,139
No, it doesn't.

643
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,170
Why did you come up here, Ms. Hong?

644
00:36:12,239 --> 00:36:13,380
It's still cold outside.

645
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:15,849
I just had a lot on my mind.

646
00:36:16,409 --> 00:36:20,480
I was writing about
Im Tae In joining our company.

647
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,750
I wrote, "Actor Im Tae In to eat
from the same bowl as Gong Tae Sung."

648
00:36:24,250 --> 00:36:25,860
But then, something came to my mind.

649
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,590

from the same bowl?"

"If so, would it be white rice
or multi-grain rice?"

651
00:36:32,659 --> 00:36:33,730
That's a unique point of view.

- Yes.

Also...

655
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:39,039
Every time when we release an article
about a new actor joining us,

656
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,639
it always says the same phrase,
"eat from the same bowl".

657
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,780
Mr. Gong must be full then.

658
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,309
This is what I've been thinking.

659
00:36:51,179 --> 00:36:53,349
Since you bring up rice,
it makes me hungry.

660
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:55,750
Shall we go have hot pot rice?

If you can digest well
after seeing this,

668

Hey.

683
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,309
I bet you're not taking it
because your stress level is zero.

684
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,150
Of course,

685
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,650
you have no idea what it's like
to be stressed like the rest of us.

686
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,280
What? Give me a break.
My stress level is through the roof.

Okay, deal.

692

Then if I win, you must take a pay cut
for the next three months.

693

Must you go after my paycheck
of all things?

694
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,599

Yes. I feel better.

it's all because of my awful boss.

be the best time to say this.

I guarantee you.
The business will go under.

811
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:25,210
That stupid owner doesn't know
why the business has been doing so well.

812
00:47:32,219 --> 00:47:33,719
By the way,

813
00:47:34,090 --> 00:47:36,889
can I really make a lot of money
if I become an actor?

814
00:47:37,989 --> 00:47:40,800
You see, I'm a very competent manager.

815
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,570
Do you really think I can do it?

816
00:47:47,139 --> 00:47:49,500
I'm telling you.
People like you should be actors.

817
00:47:49,639 --> 00:47:52,039
I'll help you make loads of money.

818
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,440
I'll make you richer
than the building owner.

819
00:47:54,610 --> 00:47:56,980
My gosh. That sounds amazing.

820
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:03,650
But is it okay to get into it
just because I want to make money?

821
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,690
Yes.

822
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:05,619
You can.

823
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:08,360
I even persuaded
a banker to become an actor.

824
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:10,090
That person is a hotshot actor now.

825
00:48:11,829 --> 00:48:15,329
You should also know I used to be
a Taekwondo athlete.

826
00:48:15,730 --> 00:48:17,269
I worked as a bodyguard before this.

827
00:48:18,869 --> 00:48:20,340
What this all means is that...

828
00:48:21,739 --> 00:48:22,940
I...

829
00:48:23,269 --> 00:48:24,369
can...

830
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,079
protect you until the very end.

831
00:49:04,909 --> 00:49:06,449
Good morning.

832
00:49:06,579 --> 00:49:08,019
- Hello.
- Good morning.

833
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:11,050
Ms. Oh.

834
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,320
Wait, what's up with your face?

835
00:49:14,489 --> 00:49:15,659
This?

836
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:17,030
A cat scratched me.

837
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:18,590
You don't have a cat though.

838
00:49:20,659 --> 00:49:21,800
Jae Hyeon.

839
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,800
He'll be in "The World of Stars".

840
00:49:24,829 --> 00:49:25,969
Really?

841
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:27,440
That's amazing.

842
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:29,400
I'll have to write up
a nice press release.

843
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,369
Please be kind, Ms. Oh.

844
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:33,840
Let's go, PR Department.

845
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:34,940
Let's go.

846
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:42,750
I heard he's a nasty drunk.

847
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:45,719
Apparently, you could buy
all the buildings in Gangnam...

848
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,789
with the money he paid
for the damages he caused.

849
00:49:51,429 --> 00:49:53,800
Look at that punk smiling.
What an eyesore.

850
00:49:58,130 --> 00:49:59,699
Hey. Yu Song!

851
00:50:00,170 --> 00:50:01,369
Hey, don't go.

852
00:50:01,969 --> 00:50:04,170
Stop, don't look.

853
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:08,210
- Hey.
- Hello there.

854
00:50:09,010 --> 00:50:11,679
I'm Han Dae Soo from DS Entertainment.

855
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:12,949
What did that lunatic say?

856
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,119
- You've got to be kidding.
- I'm a big fan of yours.

857
00:50:17,449 --> 00:50:18,889
- I see. Hello.
- Thank you.

858
00:50:19,619 --> 00:50:20,889
I like drinking too.

859
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,760
Would you mind if I joined?

860
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:24,989
- No, take a seat.
- Gosh, thank you.

861
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,360
I'm with a friend.

862
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,329
That guy over there. He's your fan too.

863
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,070
- Can he join us also?
- Sure.

864
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,739
Yu Sung! Come on.

865
00:50:38,739 --> 00:50:40,010
Drink up!

866
00:50:40,039 --> 00:50:41,340
Don't spill a drop.

867
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,309
Let's be best friends.
Drop the formalities.

868
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:44,510
We're all friends now.

869
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,980
Order some more drinks, Yu Sung.

870
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,250
Give us more drinks here!

871
00:50:50,989 --> 00:50:52,590
Pop a bottle.

872
00:50:58,489 --> 00:51:00,260
- All right.
- Drink up, everyone.

873
00:51:02,329 --> 00:51:04,170
Where are we going next?

874
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,670
Hey, what did you say?

875
00:51:09,539 --> 00:51:11,869
What did you say to me?

876
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,880
- Darn it.
- Hey.

877
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:18,150
- Don't do this, guys.
- What's wrong?

878
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,550
Gosh, hold up.

879
00:51:21,150 --> 00:51:22,320
Don't touch me.

880
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,690
Come on, man.

881
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,889
Hey, what's the problem?

882
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,590
Hey, stop.

883
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:30,260
I told you not to touch me.

884
00:51:33,429 --> 00:51:34,760
Don't do that.

885
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:36,400
Stop it.

886
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:37,969
Darn it.

887
00:51:52,179 --> 00:51:53,449
Hey.

888
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:57,150
We have to drink more, you punk.

889
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,860
This punk.
You're a total lightweight loser.

890
00:52:00,889 --> 00:52:02,019
Hey.

891
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,789
Dude.

892
00:52:04,329 --> 00:52:05,389
Your head.

893
00:52:06,389 --> 00:52:12,070
(Mission accomplished)

894
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:21,940
Gosh, my face.

895
00:52:26,849 --> 00:52:28,480
(Taerius)

896
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,420
(We've been waiting a year for this!
Tae Sung's fan sign meeting!)

897
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,059
(Yu Sung)

898
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:43,599
Hello, Yu Sung.

899
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:44,969
Da Hye.

900
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:47,869
Don't tell me you're racking your brain
about the fan meeting.

901
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:50,739
- No, I'm not.
(- Yes, you are.)

902
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,510
Gosh, there's no fooling you.

903
00:52:54,610 --> 00:52:55,739
Yu Sung.

904
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:59,210
You know about my complicated history
with Tae Sung's fan meeting, right?

905
00:52:59,349 --> 00:53:00,449
So...

906
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,389
can I go if I disguise myself well?

907
00:53:03,590 --> 00:53:05,489
(What do you think? Absolutely not.)

908
00:53:06,889 --> 00:53:09,119
Do you want dating rumors?
Right before shooting starts?

909
00:53:09,159 --> 00:53:11,590
No, of course not.

910
00:53:12,429 --> 00:53:15,599
Tae Sung can never be tied
to a lowly person like me.

911
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:18,730
I'll try to control myself.

912
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:20,699
All right, please do.

913
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:36,920

(I love Tae Sung. Every day. Handsome)

919
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:48,260
- Hello.
- My gosh.

920
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,360
Thank you.

921
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,570
In one, two.

(Gong Tae Sung's
Autograph Meeting With Taerius)

927
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:10,190
Thank you. Next, please.

928
00:54:10,289 --> 00:54:11,349
Smile.

929
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:13,360
He's so cool.

930
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:17,690
- He looks way cooler here.
- What's your name?

931
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:18,730
- What's your name?
- Maria.

932
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,900
- Maria?
- He's truly a top star.

933
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,199
I should've studied Russian.

934
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,369
Isn't that Mr. Kang?

935
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:28,500
I came from far away.

936
00:54:28,539 --> 00:54:31,570
Yes. He's famous for being
a heartthrob manager.

937
00:54:31,809 --> 00:54:34,110
He even has a fan club called Yusungwoo.

938
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:36,079
They chose that name
because it means "friend".

939
00:54:36,110 --> 00:54:38,380
It's to express how
they want to be his friend.

940
00:54:40,550 --> 00:54:41,820
That's impressive.

941
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,250
Zoom in a little more.

942
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:47,619
He almost auditioned as a new actor
in the past...

943
00:54:47,659 --> 00:54:50,530
because the guy working there
thought he was an actor.

944
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,190
I'm not surprised.

945
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:55,800
Kang Yu Sung's still got it.

946
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,599
- It's a gift for you.
- A gift?

947
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:01,170
Gosh, thank you.
I'll put it to good use.

948
00:55:01,199 --> 00:55:03,039
Can you wear this for us?

949
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,539
Wear this?

950
00:55:08,309 --> 00:55:09,510
- How do I look?
- So pretty.

951
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,550
- My gosh. Hurry up and take a picture.
- Hold on.

952
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:13,150
He's tired now.

953
00:55:13,449 --> 00:55:15,750
- Can you take a picture with us?
- Sure.

954
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:19,219
- My gosh. Thank you.
- Thank you.

955
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:22,159
He's so smiley though.

956
00:55:22,389 --> 00:55:24,489
His lips are curved higher than usual.

957
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:26,829
That's his capitalist smile.

958
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,099
Also known as GCS.

959
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,800
- What's your name?
- Sun A.

960
00:55:33,170 --> 00:55:34,539
- Sun A?
- Yes.

961
00:55:37,170 --> 00:55:38,369
Excuse me, Ms. Oh.

962

Can we take a picture?

Can you look after my bag for a moment?

964
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:43,550
I have too much stuff.

965

Sure. Leave it here.

It can't be.

00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:35,800
Did he think getting a hundred was good?

976
00:56:36,769 --> 00:56:39,199
Gosh, are you kidding me?

977
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:40,500
Darn it.

978
00:56:41,070 --> 00:56:42,699
(What did Jun Ho and Dong Jun get?)

979
00:56:42,969 --> 00:56:44,070
They both got 90 percent.

980
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:47,210
(No wonder they fainted.)

981
00:56:58,090 --> 00:56:59,190
Thank you.

982
00:57:25,650 --> 00:57:29,519
(Epilogue)

983
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,289
We'll start shooting soon.

984
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,400
Cut.

985
00:57:41,130 --> 00:57:42,260
Hit him.

986
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:44,130
Okay.

987
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,030
How is he doing?

988
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,900
- Let's go over it again.
- Yes, sir.

989
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:50,210
Why did you buy so much?

990
00:57:50,239 --> 00:57:51,440
- Okay.
- Yes, sir.

991
00:57:51,469 --> 00:57:53,739
- Let's do it one more time.
- All right.

992
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,010
Ready?

993
00:57:57,710 --> 00:57:59,409
- Tae Sung.
- Yes?

994
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,150
Aren't you tired?

995
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,719
No, I'm fine.

996
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:11,090
By the way,
is Oh Han Byeol going somewhere today?

997
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:13,530
What? Oh, I see.

998
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,360
She looks pretty today, right?
She said she has a blind date today.

999
00:58:18,099 --> 00:58:20,030
What's wrong?
Did something get in your eye?

1000
00:58:20,199 --> 00:58:23,400
Gosh. All right. I'm good now.

1001
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:43,059
We'll begin shooting now.

1002
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:45,460
Okay!

1003
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:50,530
Let's go! Come on!

1004
00:59:01,179 --> 00:59:02,280
I'll get going now.

1005
00:59:14,860 --> 00:59:16,119
Tae Sung! Are you okay?

1006
00:59:17,159 --> 00:59:18,929
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

1007
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,900
- Where did you get hurt?
- The middle one.

1008
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:22,599
Gosh, I think I sprained it.

1009
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:56,329
=Shooting Stars=

1010
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,269
(No excuses. Take the wage cut.)

1011
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:00,969
(My annual salary is much less than
what you make in an hour.)

1012
01:00:01,000 --> 01:00:02,070
Less than your hourly wage.

1013
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,139
(He was really gentle.)

1014
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:06,340
(- Welcome.
- He's indeed an amazing rookie.)

1015
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:08,210
(Did they start shooting
"The World of Stars"?)

1016
01:00:08,239 --> 01:00:09,280
(Let's do a good job.)

1017
01:00:09,510 --> 01:00:11,710
(I feel so comfortable
since I don't have to see Tae Sung.)

1018
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:13,250
(Where did Oh Han Byeol go?)

1019
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:15,619
(What's going on between these two?)

1020
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,519
(They look so great together.)

1021
01:00:18,119 --> 01:00:20,050
(Is Ms. Oh in a relationship
with Gong Tae Sung?)

1022
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,360
(Help me.)

1023
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:22,889
(Why? What happened?)
