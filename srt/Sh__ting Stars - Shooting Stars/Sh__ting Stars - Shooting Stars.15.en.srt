I'm the model for this snack.

as the model.

is the product
you filmed a commercial for.

Let's do that.

134
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,889
Do you need to be comforted again?

135
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,060
Or did you just feel like drinking?

136
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,290
Did your boss harass you again?

137
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:09,459
No.

138
00:08:10,129 --> 00:08:13,360
I don't drink
only on stressful, sad days.

139
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,129
I just wanted...

140
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,269
to have a drink with you today.

141
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:23,139
You know, the day we first met...

142
00:08:23,709 --> 00:08:25,709
- Do you remember that day?
- Yes.

143
00:08:25,939 --> 00:08:27,879
When you asked me
to finish the interview by 5:55pm,

144
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:29,509
I was pretty intimidated.

145
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:31,519
No way.

146
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:34,019
You confidently said
you would end it by 5:53pm,

147
00:08:34,049 --> 00:08:35,090
and I was impressed.

148
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,759
You see, you need to get the upper hand
to lead an interview,

149
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:39,659
so you can't show
that you're intimidated.

150
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,360
But you kept on impressing me.

151
00:08:41,830 --> 00:08:44,200
You even quashed that absurd scandal
with just one article.

152
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,129
Did I?

153
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,840
I can't believe I cried my eyes out
in front of someone...

154
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,740
who thought highly of me.

155
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,480
Did that bother you?

156
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:04,320
I wouldn't say it bothered me,

157
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,320
but I was quite surprised...

158
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,549
to see myself like that.

159
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,860
I had never cried like that
in front of anyone before.

160
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,659
Same here. It was my first time...

161
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:21,399
sticking around and waiting
for that long while someone was crying.

162
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:25,600
Then since it was the first time
for both of us, let's call it even.

163
00:09:26,970 --> 00:09:28,139
Call it even?

164
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,639
Sure. Then we're even now.

165
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,220
What do you think of this place?

166
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,450
I like it.

167
00:10:02,169 --> 00:10:05,480
Isn't it annoying that we always meet
at my place and never go anywhere?

168
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:07,750
How about we go somewhere fun
this weekend?

169
00:10:08,179 --> 00:10:10,779
On the weekend?
Gosh, what if we get photographed?

170
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:14,019
We can go to the movies.

171
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,090
That's risky too.

172
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:17,960
But we used to go all the time.

173
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,389
We went separately.

174
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,960
And we weren't dating back then.

175
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:25,429
Then I can just buy all the seats...

176
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,529
Well, then I'll get yelled at
for wasting money.

177
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,269
That's right.

178
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,269
And everyone who works at the theater
will be suspicious of us.

179
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:35,740
Across the street,

180
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:39,039
a new restaurant opened up.
It looked very private. How about there?

181
00:10:39,379 --> 00:10:40,480
That's where...

182
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:42,909
Shin Young Ji was photographed
with a guy earlier today.

183
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,779
The valet sent the photo
to a reporter he's close to right away.

184
00:10:48,889 --> 00:10:50,019
I see.

185
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:54,190
I heard celebrities go
to the Han River...

186
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,490
The Han River?

187
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,730
Dozens of reporters like Ki Ppeum
are camping out by the river.

188
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,230
She's my friend,
but she scares me sometimes.

189
00:11:01,799 --> 00:11:04,669
Going there is like
asking to be photographed.

190
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,370
Byun Jung Yeol...

191
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:13,009
told me about a secret dating spot
that's popular these days.

192
00:11:13,039 --> 00:11:14,549
How can a secret spot be "popular"?

193
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,019
There are no blind spots in Korea.

194
00:11:18,919 --> 00:11:21,090
Right, all the dashcams
and security cameras.

195
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,049
That, or we'll get caught
on Street View.

196
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,629
I always thought other celebrities
were fools for getting caught.

197
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,259
Now, I understand.

198
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:33,500
Well...

199
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:35,129
There is a way.

200
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:37,440
What is it?

201
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:40,000
Either invent an invisibility cloak
as soon as possible,

202
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,340
or we could be...

203
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,080
in a platonic relationship
and never see each other.

204
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,480
No! Platonic? No way.

205
00:11:47,549 --> 00:11:48,679
I have to kiss you and all.

206
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,879
Then in this country, there's nowhere
we can go and have worry-free dates.

207
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:57,090
I mean,
other than our homes or the office.

208
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,159
It's fine.

209
00:12:02,289 --> 00:12:05,259
I'm a hardcore homebody,
so I actually like this.

210
00:12:08,470 --> 00:12:14,870
(Home, Office)

211
00:12:14,909 --> 00:12:19,740
(Office)

212
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,950
(Gong Tae Sung Wants to Star
in Office Romance Drama)

213
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:59,149
Hey, Tae Sung.

214
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:03,190
Are you attending
an awards ceremony this morning?

215
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,490
Ji Hoon.

216
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,889
You know that
I never take back what I say, right?

217
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,830
- I sure do.
- Then what will my next drama be?

218
00:13:13,129 --> 00:13:14,230
(Gong Tae Sung Wants to Star
in Office Romance Drama)

219
00:13:14,429 --> 00:13:15,500
Office romance.

220
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:16,669
Bingo.

221
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:20,440
So I'm going to work in the office
for a little while.

222
00:13:20,909 --> 00:13:22,210
You know what method acting is.

223
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:25,279
When I played a doctor in "Doctor Zeus",
I went to the hospital...

224
00:13:25,309 --> 00:13:26,940
every single day for a month.

225
00:13:27,009 --> 00:13:29,750
Thanks to that, I looked like
a real doctor in the drama.

226
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,519
That's right.
Your acting was very realistic.

227
00:13:32,549 --> 00:13:35,250
All the male leads in office romance
dramas have high positions.

228
00:13:35,389 --> 00:13:37,320
Manager, associate director,
director, and CEO.

229
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,720
Since you're the director,

230
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,159
I'll be the CEO.

231
00:13:40,259 --> 00:13:42,330
Get me an office here.

232
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:43,960
We don't have a spare office.

233
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:49,529
Then I have no choice
but to ask you to give me yours.

234
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,470
Hey, I don't know how I feel about that.

235
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,110
Right? I know. You're the director.
You can't give up your office.

236
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,870
I took a quick look around the office...

237
00:13:56,909 --> 00:13:58,509
and saw an empty desk in the PR team.

238
00:13:58,539 --> 00:13:59,639
How about...

239
00:13:59,779 --> 00:14:01,409
I just take that desk?

240
00:14:01,450 --> 00:14:02,649
Good idea, right?

241
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,720
Attention, everyone.

242
00:14:09,889 --> 00:14:12,320
He will play the role
of a young, competent CEO...

243
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,289
who might have gotten the job
through connections.

244
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,529
Meet CEO Gong Tae Sung.

245
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:18,830
Hello.

246
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,970
I'm Gong Tae Sung.

247
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:24,070
Let's welcome him with applause!

248
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,669
That's your desk, Mr. Gong.

249
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:38,779
He's been pestering me about this.
Just play along.

250
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,580
What?

251
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:42,789
Play along to what?

252
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,730
Hey, Gong.

253
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,299
I told you not to come into the office
for a while. What is this?

254
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,899
Did you not hear what Ji Hoon said?

255
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,370
You have nothing to worry about.

256
00:14:57,529 --> 00:14:59,470
No one is suspecting anything.

257
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,169
I'll just say I need this for my acting,

258
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,370
- and it'll look totally natural.
- You wish.

259
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:04,509
You were the one who said...

260
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:06,639
our homes and the office
were the only places where...

261
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,879
we could see each other freely.

262
00:15:08,409 --> 00:15:09,450
Also,

263
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,679
a number of people at work
already know about us.

264
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,720
Yu Sung, Byun Jung Yeol,

265
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,889
and...

266
00:15:15,389 --> 00:15:17,519
my neighbor Do Soo Hyuk
who visits from time to time.

267
00:15:18,559 --> 00:15:19,820
Ho Young knows too.

268
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,490
What?

269
00:15:21,529 --> 00:15:22,990
They outnumber those who don't know.

270
00:15:23,330 --> 00:15:24,659
Hold on, then...

271
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,759
Do we just have to keep it a secret
from Ji Hoon?

272
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:28,899
- And my team too.
- The PR team? Why?

273
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:32,169
I always bickered with you
in front of them. If they found out,

274
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,840
what would they think of me?

275
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,039
It'll be so embarrassing.

276
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,509
You don't have to worry.

277
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:39,039
From what I gather,

278
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:41,509
they have no clue.

279
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,750
It's so hard to act clueless.

280
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,220
"Breaking news. Gong Tae Sung
makes it look so obvious,"

281
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:51,460
"but he thinks we don't know."
It's hilarious.

282
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:53,490
Ms. Oh makes it look
really obvious too...

283
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,789
but thinks she's being careful.

284
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,759
They say even the copy machine knows
when people date in the office.

285
00:15:57,799 --> 00:16:00,500
They might as well write
it all over the copy paper.

286
00:16:01,029 --> 00:16:03,169
- Let's just play along with them.
- Fine.

287
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,299
Okay. I'll try to keep the act up.

288
00:16:11,009 --> 00:16:13,139
Goodness, it's my neighbor Mr. Do.

289
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,110
I'm even more excited to see you here.

290
00:16:16,049 --> 00:16:17,379
Yes, sure.

291
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:19,419
Not really for me.

292
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,350
I know you like it.

293
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:25,820
All right, please tell me
what we're discussing this week.

294
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,690
Okay, so this about this week,
Tae Sung...

295
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:31,960
- CEO Gong.
- Yes, Director Choi?

296
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,500
I will begin the meeting now.

297
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,970
Team One's Mr. Kang.

298
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What is our most important agenda
this week?

299
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:41,840
- Yes, well...
(- Hey, Gong!)

300
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:44,169
(- What are you doing?)
- Mr. Gong has been offered...

301
00:16:44,210 --> 00:16:47,440
around 30 office romance dramas.

302
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:51,049
Impressive.
That's a popular idea, I see.

303
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:53,980
(- What? I like being here with you.)
- What about Team Two?

304
00:16:54,019 --> 00:16:56,649
Yes, so the biggest agenda
for our team...

305
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:59,889
is Mr. Jang Seok Woo's
fan meeting in Japan.

306
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,059
Next up is Ms. Oh
from the PR Department.

307
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:08,730
Oh, yes. Our team will prioritize
reviewing Mr. Gong's insane amount...

308
00:17:08,769 --> 00:17:11,900
of office romance drama offers.

309
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,279
Ms. Oh. You have a flower delivery.

310
00:17:25,950 --> 00:17:27,079
- Thank you.
- Have a good day.

311
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,049
My gosh. Oh, my goodness.

312
00:17:31,089 --> 00:17:36,029
Who in the world sent you
such a cute little surprise?

313
00:17:36,059 --> 00:17:38,130
Breaking news! I get a strong feeling...

314
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,799
that it was sent
by a handsome Prince Charming.

315
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:41,170
(Breaking News. Flowers Probably
From Prince Charming)

316
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,569
I am so jealous.

317
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,869
(Poor flowers.
My Han Byeol is prettier than them.)

318
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:52,910
Gosh, I love this.

319
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:54,779
Goodness.

320
00:17:57,049 --> 00:17:57,980
- Ta-da!
- Gosh.

321
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,779
Drink this, it's decaf.

322
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:05,190
You drink way too much coffee.

323
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:08,930
Gong, I think you're missing the point.

324
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:12,500
Coffee without caffeine is useless.

325
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,029
I drink coffee
because I want to feel wide awake.

326
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,309
There is a better option
to feel that way.

327
00:18:27,309 --> 00:18:30,349
Gosh, a bug. It went into my coffee.

328
00:18:30,549 --> 00:18:32,650
It's almost summer, I guess.

329
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:35,289
What do you think? Effective, right?

330
00:18:35,319 --> 00:18:37,250
It's a cliche scenario
in an office romance.

331
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:38,819
A secret kiss.

332
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,529
There's another one.
Where the male lead...

333
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,529
scolds the boss
that torments the female lead.

334
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,400
Is anyone bullying you?
Name all of them.

335
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:49,769
I will take care of them.

336
00:18:49,869 --> 00:18:52,569
Actually, yes. I do have one.

337
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,970
Who is it? Kang Yu Sung? Choi Ji Hoon?

338
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,170
Gong Tae Sung, you!

339
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,779
Can you please take care of yourself?

340
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:05,880
- Me?
- Get out.

341
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,960
Did you end up kicking him out?

342
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:15,990
Mr. Gong was pouting so much
on his way out.

343
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,200
I never knew a person's lips...

344
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,660
could stick out so much.

345
00:19:21,369 --> 00:19:24,299
It was getting too hard on me.
What if we get caught?

346
00:19:25,299 --> 00:19:28,269
I can't believe you kicked out
our highest-earning actor.

347
00:19:28,309 --> 00:19:29,470
Hats off to you.

348
00:19:29,509 --> 00:19:33,079
He was trailing me all day like a puppy.

349
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:36,049
It is pretty cute.

350
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,779
But I truly get where he's coming from.

351
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,619
The desire to be together all day.

352
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,799
All praise to office romance.

353
00:20:04,509 --> 00:20:05,539
Da Hye.

354
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:09,049
- Hello.
- Hi, Yu Sung.

355
00:20:09,079 --> 00:20:10,309
Are you here for a class?

356
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,250
No, I came to see you today.

357
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:16,319
Me? Why?

358
00:20:16,349 --> 00:20:18,059
I want to be like you.

359
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,660
What do I have to do?

360
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:22,589
Me? I'm not talented though.

361
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,630
No, I don't believe that.

362
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,970
Oh, just a second.

363
00:20:29,430 --> 00:20:30,970
I always take this.

364
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,109
Probiotics that help with gut health.

365
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:49,990
My gosh, sorry.
It's an occupational hazard.

366
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:51,690
I'm shooting a commercial soon.

367
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:53,519
Practice, and practice some more.

368
00:20:53,859 --> 00:20:56,490
Gosh, you truly are a professional.

369
00:20:57,789 --> 00:20:59,359
Here, you should take it too.

370
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:01,630
I'm not just saying this
because I'm their model,

371
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,140
but you'll actually see great results.

372
00:21:05,769 --> 00:21:06,940
Thank you, Da Hye.

373
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:11,210
A professional will hold it like this,
so that the logo is visible.

374
00:21:13,609 --> 00:21:15,710
- Professional.
- You are good.

375
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,450
So, what's the most urgent matter?

376
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:25,190
Do we have your permission to release
an article about Ms. Baek...

377
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:26,759
officially joining the cast of
"Time for Unrequited Love"?

378
00:21:26,789 --> 00:21:28,160
Yes, please go ahead.

379
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm so excited we'll get to work
with the hottest star.

380
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,660
Our team is over the moon.

381
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:35,000
Please look kindly upon us.

382
00:21:35,029 --> 00:21:36,700
We should ask the same.

383
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:44,069
Oh, I had something I've been meaning
to ask you, Mr. Kang.

384
00:21:44,109 --> 00:21:45,480
Yes, what is it?

385
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:47,140
I won't beat around the bush.

386
00:21:47,309 --> 00:21:49,710
Do you happen to have a girlfriend?

387
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,119
I ask because
so many people around me are curious.

388
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,589
I sure do. I have a girlfriend.

389
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:59,559
Oh, you do?

390
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,960
I'm in big trouble.

391
00:22:01,990 --> 00:22:04,089
My friend was ready to kill me
if I didn't introduce you.

392
00:22:05,099 --> 00:22:07,930
You don't have plans to break up, right?

393
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,500
Not at all. I like her a whole lot.

394
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,670
Of course, I hope you're happy.

395
00:22:13,269 --> 00:22:14,440
Hello.

396
00:22:15,109 --> 00:22:17,670
Yes, hello.

397
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:20,180
- Ho Young.
- Yes, Yu Sung.

398
00:22:22,779 --> 00:22:24,509
I will see you next time then.

399
00:22:24,549 --> 00:22:26,279
Goodbye.

400
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,619
Why are you chuckling by yourself?
Did something good happen?

401
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,059
Oh, nothing.

402
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:40,359
We're working together again.
I will do my best.

403
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:42,200
Yes, me too.

404
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,339
It seems my Yu Sung
will have another successful show.

405
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,880
But shouldn't you save...

406
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:56,309
"My Yu Sung" for me now?

407
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,019
Oh, sorry about that.

408
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:04,720
(Going down)

409
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:23,940
Shall we go on a date today?

410
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:26,079
Yes!

411
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,849
This is where you wanted to come to?

412
00:23:33,119 --> 00:23:34,079
Yes.

413
00:23:34,119 --> 00:23:37,150
This is a hot dating spot for actors.

414
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,559
I wanted to know
what's so special about it.

415
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:41,319
So? Do you like it?

416
00:23:41,359 --> 00:23:43,059
Yes! I love it!

417
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:47,099
But honestly,
I don't think the location is important.

418
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:51,400
As long as I'm with you,
I'll gladly walk into a fiery pit.

419
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,140
Goodness, you took it too far.

420
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:55,839
Did I?

421
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:59,710
Gosh, it's cold.

422
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:01,410
You must be cold, Ho Young.

423
00:24:02,509 --> 00:24:03,609
My goodness.

424
00:24:04,579 --> 00:24:06,950
No, I'm not cold at all.

425
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:08,789
Plus, if I get cold,

426
00:24:08,890 --> 00:24:11,660
I can just move my body like this.

427
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:14,019
Look. I just need to keep moving.

428
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:30,809
Gosh, what a big hug.

429
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,779
It feels like I'm in an igloo.

430
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,480
It's super warm.

431
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:35,950
I'm glad.

432
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:48,230
Ms. Cho said something to me.

433
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,900
"All you do is hold hands, right?"

434
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,660
I was upset but she wasn't all wrong.

435
00:24:59,569 --> 00:25:00,640
Yu Sung.

436
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,539
I know that you're good
at protecting people.

437
00:25:03,009 --> 00:25:05,579
But there's absolutely no need
to protect me at all.

438
00:25:55,730 --> 00:25:56,890
Ms. Oh Han Byeol.

439
00:25:57,690 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm here to hear about
the PR Department's complaints.

440
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:04,700
I heard that the PR Department
has a lot on its plate.

441
00:26:05,299 --> 00:26:06,900
If there's anything I can do to help,

442
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,140
please tell me without reservation.

443
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,420
You're voluntarily reviewing the scripts
that have been offered to you.

444
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:23,819
This reduces our workload so much.

445
00:26:23,890 --> 00:26:25,819
Thank you so much.

446
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:27,990
You can ask me anytime.

447
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,170
"About Greetings".

448
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,509
Hey, Mom.

449
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,710
Really? Han Yul did?

450
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,410
Okay, I'll call her.

451
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,279
All right.

452
00:26:53,319 --> 00:26:54,680
Did your sister get the early admission?

453
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,089
Yes. It was announced just now.

454
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:57,950
Han Yul is the younger one of the twins,
right?

455
00:26:58,019 --> 00:26:59,059
(Han Yul? Younger sister?
Twins? Early admission?)

456
00:26:59,089 --> 00:26:59,960
(Han Seol?)

457
00:26:59,990 --> 00:27:02,089
- When will Han Seol get her result?
- Tomorrow.

458
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,430
I hope it works out well.

459
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,369
Do you know
who Han Yul and Han Seol are?

460
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,170
Are you talking about
Ms. Oh's twin sisters?

461
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,940
What? Twins?

462
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,339
They are seniors in high school.

463
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,420
What is it?

464
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:29,019
Did you...

465
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,650
have twin sisters?

466
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:33,019
Did I not tell you?

467
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,160
No.

468
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:35,390
I had no idea.

469
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,730
Your team members
and Byun Jung Yeol knew about it.

470
00:27:37,759 --> 00:27:39,029
And I'm going to be
their brother-in-law.

471
00:27:39,259 --> 00:27:42,000
But I had no idea about your siblings
until they were seniors in high school.

472
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,670
It's okay if you don't know.

473
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,000
It's not okay.

474
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:48,099
There are two more people
who look like you in this world.

475
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:49,910
You're overreacting.

476
00:27:55,210 --> 00:27:56,309
What else...

477
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,950
don't I know about you?

478
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:59,880
I know your name is Oh Han Byeol.

479
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,750
Born in 1992, same as me.

480
00:28:01,789 --> 00:28:03,619
Your birthday is August 17. And...

481
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:07,089
- And...
- All right.

482
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:10,490
Okay. Mr. Gong Tae Sung who was
born on November 7, 1992.

483
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:12,029
Your feet are 275mm.

484
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:13,099
You hate cucumbers.

485
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,900

you know everything about me?

for years now.

I don't know about you?

494

I know everything about you.

495
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,519
I know Oh Han Byeol well too.

496

It's right next to mine.

What's my blood type?

501
00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:54,000
- It's O.
- How did you know that?

502
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:56,269
Because you're Oh Han Byeol.

503
00:28:56,369 --> 00:28:57,710

510
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:16,019
I wrote everything that came to my mind
when I thought about Ms. Oh.

I'm sure it will be helpful.

Well, my MBTI is ENFJ.

I wear 240mm shoes.

522
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:45,109
My nickname was...

523
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:48,450
Because I always ran around
the schoolyard after lunch,

524
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,220
my friends called me
Conveyor Belt Sushi.

530
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,240

I don't know about them?

599
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,239
So you knew about it.

600

What? Did you think I didn't know?

601
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:35,780
Tae Sung came to me and asked
when Han Byeol would take time off work.

602

What?

Yes.

Let's go.

608
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:54,159
Seeing him just makes me angry.

609
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:56,130
- Those guys around him are the problem.
- Let's go now.

610
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,769
Mi Nyu is encouraging him.
She's the real devil.

611
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:03,139
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

612
00:35:06,409 --> 00:35:08,710
Tae Sung follows you around 24-7.
How did you shake him off?

613
00:35:08,739 --> 00:35:10,010
I saw him...

614
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:12,050
begging her to take him along.

615
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,050
He was like a huge puppy.

616
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,590
He whimpered.

617
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:16,920
You should have brought him.

618
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:18,820
I need some quality time
with my friends.

619
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:22,059
Well, he worked really hard today,

620
00:35:22,090 --> 00:35:24,329
so he'll crash as soon as he gets home.

621
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,900
- He worked hard?
- You weren't in the office.

622
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:30,230
He removed all the stickers
on the packages that we received.

623
00:35:30,269 --> 00:35:31,269
Why?

624
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:32,869
In exchange for his labor,

625
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:37,170
he asked the PR team what your likes,
dislikes, and interests were.

626
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,909
That's true love.

627
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:43,809
I'll be honest.
I gave him some intel too.

628
00:35:43,849 --> 00:35:44,909
My gosh.

629
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,719
I know he's my boyfriend,

630
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:50,320
but he's so cute.

631
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:53,860
He's so darn cute!

632
00:35:53,889 --> 00:35:55,860
So cute!

633
00:35:56,989 --> 00:36:00,760
But he even removed the ones
on the packages we have to send out.

634
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,269
Every single one of them.

635
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:07,539
Whenever he does anything,
he goes all out.

636
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:10,070
I hope he can take it a little easy.

637
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:12,539
But you know, he's handsome.

638
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,880
Yu Sung is just as handsome as he is.

639
00:36:16,909 --> 00:36:19,349
Well, Gong is an outstanding actor,
you know.

640
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,619
Yu Sung is the best talent manager.

641
00:36:21,650 --> 00:36:23,320
He's on another level, way high up here.

642
00:36:23,349 --> 00:36:25,989
Don't get me started.
Tae Sung is the king of TV commercials.

643
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:28,789
Yu Sung was voted
the most popular guy at work.

644
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,130
Tae Sung is
the most popular guy in the country!

645
00:36:31,159 --> 00:36:34,329
Yu Sung is super popular

What do you think of this place?

648
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:44,239
I like it.

649
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,309
Things were definitely going well.

650
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:51,210
I swear, my radar is never wrong.

651
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,820
- How about that?
- No.

652
00:36:52,849 --> 00:36:54,550
- No way.
- We can't because...

653
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:55,889
we do need him.

654
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,389
Darn it. Does he not like me?

655
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,320
I do envy you.
You two can go wherever you want.

656
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,389
- You bet!
- Fine.

657
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,190
Yu Sung is a great singer. Did you know?

658
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,800
Hello, I was told to come in.

659
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,269
I heard the person who ran
Mr. Gong's anti-fan club was here.

660
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,099
Right.

661
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,570
He's not the guy. It's him.

662
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:23,809
I needed an outlet
to blow off some steam while studying.

663
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,480
I swear, I won't do it again.

664
00:37:25,750 --> 00:37:27,820
I'm sorry.
Can you let it slide just this once?

665
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:29,489
Don't apologize to me.

666
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,650
I'm just here to follow the law
and do my job.

667
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:33,320
Please.

668

I won't cause trouble anymore.

669
00:37:36,429 --> 00:37:38,489
Do you know how many people you hurt...

670
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:40,159
with what you created just for fun?

671
00:37:40,829 --> 00:37:42,199
Darn it. This is so annoying.

672
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,599
I said I was sorry.

673
00:37:45,369 --> 00:37:47,739
Let's just make this quick.

674
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,710
I'm a minor, so I'll be let off with
a few hours of community service anyway.

675
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:53,940
Be quiet.

676

My apologies.
He's still an immature kid.

677
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,619
Well, let me ask you something.

678
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:06,019
Why do you hate Gong Tae Sung?

679
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:10,989
Do I need a reason to hate a celebrity?

680
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:13,699
He should've thought of that
before becoming an actor.

Once you turn 14,
you're considered a young offender...

and can face a criminal penalty.

685
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,650
If I strongly push for your punishment,

686
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:38,320
you'll end up with a criminal record.
What do you say?

Ms. Lee. How could you send me this?

Are you crazy? Have you lost your mind?

Okay. Fine.
So you want to take it all the way.

Fine!

CEO Lee Ju Hee of Our Actors...

694

has filed a lawsuit against him.

Why?

696
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,780
The recent tabloids said
that Hyun Jin Kyu of Our Actors...

697
00:39:03,809 --> 00:39:05,380
still wet his pants.

698
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,719
Right, he wets his pants
whenever he gets drunk.

699

Right. Hyun Jin Kyu's agency,
Our Actors,

00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,079
is one of my clients,
so I'm aware of this.

have to explain all the details.

I just told my friends about it
in a group chat room. That's all.

But your "friends" are all directors
at media agencies.

I can set up a meeting.

and reveal your scandalous behavior...

What do you mean?

I mean, I thought
you weren't interested in me.

I don't drink with people
I'm not interested in.

Especially after work.
My evenings are so important to me.

- Hello.
- Hello.

774
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:48,000
Now that I've met you in person,
I know that you're perfect for the role.

775
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,369
Let's sit.

776
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:56,539
Yu Sung, your image is
just perfect for the character.

777
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,809
There's one concern.
Do you still have an accent?

778
00:44:01,039 --> 00:44:03,150
Don't worry about that.
He's doing his best to fix...

779
00:44:03,179 --> 00:44:04,480
I no longer have an accent.

780
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,519
I started it alone,
so I can end it alone too.

781
00:44:11,190 --> 00:44:15,159
That's why I decided to call this
the time for unrequited love.

782
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,659
Great job.

783
00:44:17,690 --> 00:44:19,829
- Yes, you did a great job.
- Thank you.

784

Gosh, it seems like your accent
is nonexistent now.

785
00:44:22,769 --> 00:44:25,599
Seriously. You must've practiced a ton.

786
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,369
How did you fix it in such a short time?

787
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:29,170
- Thank you.
- I'm amazed.

788
00:44:30,409 --> 00:44:31,610
What was that?

789
00:44:31,639 --> 00:44:33,010
You can't surprise me like that.

790
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,239
How did you do it?

791
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,119
(To fix your pronunciation,)

792
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,420

(My dad has a strong accent.)

803
00:45:11,449 --> 00:45:14,179
(So I naturally spoke with an accent
whenever I talked to him.)

804
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,150

for a while.)

Yes, Mother.

810
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,630
So I won't be able to call you
for the time being.

811
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:31,230
I will text you.

812

I'm sorry.

813
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:35,099
Once I fix my accent, I'll call you.

All that punk does is date women.
He has fans abroad too?

It's only for three days.

883
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,119
You mean it's a whopping three days.

884
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,190
I should go too.

885

This is the perfect opportunity then.

888
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:57,090
Nonsense.

889
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,059

I'm seriously amazed.

906
00:51:58,219 --> 00:52:01,090
He said time was crawling by,
so he needed something to do.

907

Gosh, Tae Sung.

908
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:07,329
What if he ends up fainting
from overworking?

909
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,599
Why don't you give him a hand then?

910
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,900
Goodbye.

Your bold statement
about love made headlines.

Instead of "bold"...

913
00:52:29,519 --> 00:52:31,750
can we use the term "honest"?

914
00:52:36,389 --> 00:52:38,559
I'm more honest than bold.

915
00:52:41,159 --> 00:52:42,230
Miss.

916
00:52:42,329 --> 00:52:44,829
Look into my eyes and ask me
anything you'd like comfortably.

917

But I'm very close
to breaking that principle today.

Go.

932
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,440
Stop flying paper planes.

933
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,380
Why?

934
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:34,349
My Han Byeol might come back
on this plane.

935

You must not lose your mind.

936

I've never gone this long...

937

without seeing Ho Young.

938
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,369
But...

939

Do you know what's scarier?

940
00:54:03,010 --> 00:54:04,679
It's only been a day?

941
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:08,019
Let's switch. I'll do that.

When are your parents coming?

943
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:18,559
Tomorrow.

944
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:21,360
I guess we can't see each other
at home from now on.

945
00:54:22,329 --> 00:54:24,469
It's okay. I'll get a place.

946
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:27,500
I'm not a trainee anymore,
so I have to get my own place.

947
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:29,840
I can get a place too.

948
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:31,639
Shall we get one together?

949
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,940
We can do that.

950
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,710
I want to live with the National Fairy.

951
00:54:36,679 --> 00:54:38,449
I think Dae Soo will beat you up
if we do that.

952
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:42,349
No way. He didn't seem that strong.

953
00:54:42,750 --> 00:54:44,289
I think I can beat him.

954
00:54:45,190 --> 00:54:47,119
Maybe Yu Sung will stop him.

955
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,099
I'm not feeling well.
I don't think I can finish this.

00:54:57,929 --> 00:54:59,900
- Let me use the bathroom.
- Okay.

00:55:15,650 --> 00:55:17,320
- Yun Jae Hyeon.
- Yes?

958
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:20,519
I'm pregnant. What do I do?

959
00:55:21,190 --> 00:55:22,190
What?

960
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,679
Let's get pregnant.

961
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:50,090
- What?
- No, I mean...

962
00:55:51,489 --> 00:55:52,590
Let's get married.

I had a dream like this.

00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,210

968
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:21,849
of the vicious Starforce Entertainment.

969
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,489
I was feeling great, but you ruined it.

970
00:56:24,519 --> 00:56:26,650
You ruined my mood as I came in.

971
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,989
What's up?
You're buying lottery tickets?

972
00:56:30,019 --> 00:56:31,530
That's none of your business.

973
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:34,030
I guess you had a good dream.

974
00:56:34,059 --> 00:56:36,500
Mind your own business. Get lost.

975
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,000
All right.

976
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:40,670
I don't know what dream you had,

977
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:44,869
but I'm sure it was nothing
compared to mine.

978
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:47,510
I'll be winning the first prize,
so forget about it.

979
00:56:47,539 --> 00:56:49,210
Stop overreacting.

980
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,909
You think I'm overreacting?

981
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:56,949
A big, milky-white, pretty pig
came into my arms.

982
00:56:56,989 --> 00:56:58,650
Stop talking.

983
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:00,690
Hey, Han Dae Soo.
You're the one who will become rich.

984
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,199
Is it common to dream about pigs?

985
00:57:24,309 --> 00:57:25,550
(The handshake event is almost done.)

986
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:27,550
(The handshake event is almost done.)

987
00:57:31,349 --> 00:57:33,860
(Gong)

988
00:57:33,889 --> 00:57:35,659
(These are some great places
to eat near there.)

989
00:57:35,719 --> 00:57:38,059
(Go visit them while you're there.)

990
00:57:43,429 --> 00:57:44,769
We're almost done, right?

991
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,070
Yes. I think we should wrap it up now.

992
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:50,670
Ms. Oh. We're going to a great place
for the wrap-up party.

993
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:51,869
Really?

994
00:57:56,309 --> 00:57:58,409
(I'll eat at the wrap-up party.
They say it's a great place.)

995
00:57:58,449 --> 00:58:00,519
Gosh. Will she stay
at the wrap-up party for long?

996
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,090
Gosh, she shouldn't be
around that punk, Jang Seok Woo.

997
00:58:08,090 --> 00:58:10,260
I'm Han Byeol's boyfriend anyway.

998
00:58:10,289 --> 00:58:11,429
I'm here for her.

999
00:58:12,429 --> 00:58:15,699
But Han Byeol is so pretty.
It's not safe for her to be there.

1000
00:58:17,429 --> 00:58:19,170
When will she leave the party?

1001
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:29,409
Who is it at this late hour?

1002
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,349
Is it Do Soo Hyuk?

1003
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:34,920
Gosh, another latte?

1004
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,829
What's going on?

1005
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:46,159
How did you get here?
Weren't you coming tomorrow?

1006
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:49,429
I barely managed to
get on the last plane to get here.

1007
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,969
Because I missed you.

1008
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,639
You said you wanted to know
everything about me.

1009
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,309
There's one thing about me
that you don't know.

1010
00:59:05,679 --> 00:59:07,650
You're the only one
who knows about this.

1011
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,550
I can't live without you either.

1012
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,610
=Shooting Stars=

1013
01:00:05,739 --> 01:00:07,539
(This is a total catastrophe.)

1014
01:00:07,579 --> 01:00:09,780
(We can't see each other
because of an article?)

1015
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:11,679
(It's not easy to have a boyfriend
who is a top star.)

1016
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,280
(You can't go anywhere comfortably.)

1017
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:15,679
(I don't think you can hold back
if you miss him.)

1018
01:00:15,719 --> 01:00:18,320
(I really wanted to go to Jeju Island
with you.)

1019
01:00:18,349 --> 01:00:20,489
(People might recognize you.)

1020
01:00:20,860 --> 01:00:23,159
(Do you think this is necessary?)

1021
01:00:23,190 --> 01:00:27,059
(I got a tip saying that Gong Tae Sung
went on a trip with his lover.)

1022
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:30,000
(Someone's boyfriend was
all over the portal sites.)

1023
01:00:30,030 --> 01:00:32,530
(What do you think about
going public with our relationship?)
