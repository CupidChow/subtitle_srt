1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,040
and I will be more patients if you are missing is

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,340
a

3
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:15,240
discovery

4
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,740
from us

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:29,520
Tian Yi.....

6
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,520
The sixth city

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:33,520
The second life

8
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,520
The seventh city

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,520
The third life

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,520
The third life, the world is in order

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,520
The mountain is in order

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,520
The king is in order

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,520
The one who knows is in the opposite

14
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,520
The star is in the sky

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,520
The star is in the sky

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,520
The rules are in harmony

17
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,520
The rules are in harmony

18
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,520
Your Majesty, this is the sign of the big brother

19
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,520
The immortal medicine of the heaven

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,520
Why haven't you found it yet?

21
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,520
The immortal medicine of the heaven is an ancient magic

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,520
It is said that it can turn the blood into the skin of life

23
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,520
If you want to get the immortal medicine

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,520
You need to find the one who is destined among the dukes and princes

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,520
The dukes and princes

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,520
The dukes and princes

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Do you really want me to reopen the Zhizi Camp?

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,520
Your Majesty, I think you are seriously ill

29
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,520
If you take the dukes and princes to the capital now

30
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,520
I'm afraid that the dukes and princes will be angry

31
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:50,520
Then how do you find the immortal medicine?

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,520
Your Majesty, the three-year war god

33
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,520
The battle of Dou Shou is coming

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:58,520
At that time, the dukes and princes will gather in the east

35
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
Why don't you take this opportunity

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Choose a brave prince to serve the king

37
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,520
Good, I will use Dou Shou as my name

38
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,520
To form the prince army

39
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:13,520
To find the immortal medicine

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,520
Only need to succeed

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,520
No failure

42
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,520
I have been fighting for my son

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,520
I have been lonely for my son

44
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,520
I have been waiting for you for a long time

45
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,520
I will take you to the mountain one hundred years later

46

invite you to watch Changfeng aosin

00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:57,360
China Rala is constantly free

77
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,360
Rala invites you inside the shop

78
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,520
Your Majesty, the imperial decree of the God of War is about to be sent to the city.

79
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,320
Where is the Crown Prince? Why haven't you found him yet?

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,320
Report to you, General. I've already searched the whole of Eastland.

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,720
I haven't found the Crown Prince.

82
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,120
The God of War is a big deal in Eastland.

83
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,320
He's the Crown Prince of the Eastland Marquis Manor,

84
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,120
yet he didn't show up to receive the decree.

85
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,120
He's just a fool!

86
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,520
He's always so arrogant and mischievous.

87
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,520
He's always so arrogant and mischievous.

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,120
Little brat.

89
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,720
Coming!

90
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,320
General, the letter has arrived. We should go welcome it.

91
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,120
The imperial decree has arrived!

92
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,920
I've found him this time. I'll have to skin him alive.

93
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,320
This uncivilized little bastard.

94
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,120
This uncivilized little bastard.

95
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,320
He's not in the manor because his parents aren't here.

96
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,520
He's always so arrogant and mischievous.

97
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,320
As the father, I'll make him know

98
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,920
what is the family law of the Jiang family.

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:37,120
Father, you're always saying these things.

100
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,120
You're so young and so boring.

101
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Be careful not to be a burden to your brother.

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,120
Brother.

103
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,720
Forget it. We won't wait anymore.

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,320
Pass the decree. The city is on guard.

105
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,320
We're going to welcome the new envoy of Shangshan.

106
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,720
Yes!

107
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,120
The new envoy of Shangshan

108
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:16,120
The new envoy of Shangshan

109
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
The new envoy of Shangshan

110
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,120
The power of the Qing Dynasty

111
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,720
is not dependent on the south.

112
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,720
The peace is in the four seas.

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,920
Don't forget the merits of God of War.

114
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:51,520
I'm here to help you fight the beasts.

115
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,720
Now, the Marquis of Dongwu

116
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,520
is ordered to hold the battle of God of War.

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
I'm here to welcome the new envoy of Shangshan.

118
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,520
The peace is in the four seas.

119
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,720
The decree is...

120
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,920
grains.

121
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,560
I, Jiang Wenfeng,

122
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,720
obey your orders.

123
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,320
There are assassins.

124
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,520
Protect the new envoy!

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,480
Go.

126
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
How dare you!

127
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,080
How dare you break the imperial decree?

128
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,520
If you chase them, you don't need to get the imperial decree back.

129
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,120
General, they have?

130
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:10,960
It's him.

131
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,640
Let's go.

132
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,760
Stop! Don't run!

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Don't run! Stop!

134
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:33,800
You...

135
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,960
Isn't that Mr. Jiang?

136
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,200
Yes, it's really him.

137
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,400
I'm so confused.

138
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,800
Why is there no one to help me?

139
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,340
How can you...

140
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,080
Catch him.

141
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,220
Asshole!

142
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,180
Go.

143
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:26,760
You impudent thief!

144
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:27,820
Lost your mind?

145
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,240
Stop.

146
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,360
Hurry up and catch him!

147
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,600
Hurry up!

148
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:35,100
clever

149
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,760
Four

150
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,600
Is any bully

151
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,500
Take my hand

152
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,060
Made me

153
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
How

154
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,860
Mind your family

155
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:00,940
In too much of an hour,

156
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:29,300
we must 두둠

157
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:31,300
Xiao Dong, the slave is here.

158
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,300
Arrest him.

159
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:37,900
Mr. Jiang.

160
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,900
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,900
I mistook you for someone else.

162
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,300
You're such a jerk.

163
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,500
You're still running away, aren't you?

164
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,900
You're running towards the Jinteng.

165
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,700
Take him away.

166
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,700
Go.

167
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:00,300
Come on.

168
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,300
Still trying to run away?

169
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,300
You jerk, you're still trying to run away?

170
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,300
I'll kill you.

171
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,300
Come here.

172
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:28,900
For such a jerk,

173
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
you've been nagging me for three times.

174
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
I'm making trouble for you.

175
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,300
Do you believe I'll kill you?

176
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:34,900
Give it back to me.

177
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,900
You dare to ask for it from me?

178
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,900
Fine.

179
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,900
Go get it.

180
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,900
I'll kill you.

181
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
I'll kill you.

182
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,900
I told you to go, but you really did.

183
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,900
You're late.

184
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Come here.

185
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,900
I'll kill him.

186
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:57,900
Get up.

187
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,900
I'll let you get it.

188
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,900
How dare you?

189
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:00,900
I'll let you get it.

190
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,900
I'm afraid you'll get it if you get angry.

191
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
I'll let you get it.

192
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Such a jerk.

193
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,900
He's still a coward.

194
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Yeah.

195
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:08,900
This is the escaped slave I caught earlier.

196
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,900
I'll kill you.

197
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:10,900
He was beaten so badly.

198
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,900
You really want to go?

199
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,900
Come here.

200
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,900
Come here.

201
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:55,900
Help.

202
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,900
Why is the wound so bad?

203
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:05,900
Pick it up.

204
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,900
What are you doing?

205
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
This is too dangerous.

206
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,900
What if you get hurt?

207
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:27,900
I'll kill you.

208
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:28,900
I'll kill you.

209
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,900
Don't look at the building.

210
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Go.

211
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,900
Thank god I'm lucky.

212
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,900
If I didn't recognize the wrong person,

213
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:49,900
they wouldn't have caught you.

214
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,900
We're even.

215
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,900
You're really good.

216
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
You saved me.

217
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
How can I repay you?

218
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
How?

219
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,900
With my life.

220
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,900
Mr. Jiang, are you okay?

221
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,900
How much is this slave?

222
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:11,900
I'll take it.

223
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:15,900
Him?

224
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,900
50.

225
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:26,900
How is it?

226
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:27,900
Don't worry, general.

227
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,900
He's just unconscious because of too much blood loss.

228
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,900
He'll get better after a few days of rest.

229
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:33,900
That's good.

230
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,900
The county is in a siege.

231
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,900
This is a big and small matter.

232
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:37,900
Take good care of him.

233
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Yes.

234
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,900
My parents are far away from the west.

235
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:45,900
If I hand over Donglu and that bastard to me,

236
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,900
I can't let anything happen to them.

237
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Don't worry, general.

238
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,900
I'll take care of him.

239
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:50,900
I'll take care of him.

240
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,900
I'll take care of him.

241
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,900
I'll take care of him.

242
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,900
I'll take care of him.

243
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:54,900
I'll take care of him.

244
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,900
Don't worry, general.

245
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:58,900
Report!

246
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,900
Report, general!

247
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,900
You found him?

248
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,900
I found him.

249
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:02,900
I heard he bought a slave.

250
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:03,900
What?

251
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Greetings, general.

252
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:23,900
Get up.

253
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:27,900
General, we searched the whole city.

254
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,900
We still couldn't find the thief.

255
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:30,900
But...

256
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
But what?

257
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,900
The people down there were searching the slave market.

258
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,900
I heard the crown prince appeared at the same time.

259
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:41,900
And they chased after the thief all the way.

260
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:44,900
I think the thief the crown prince chased after

261
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:47,900
might be the one who took the imperial decree.

262
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,900
It's this bastard again.

263
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
Pass my order!

264
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:54,900
Lock down the whole Eastland City!

265
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,900
Bring back the crown prince and imperial decree!

266
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,900
Yes!

267
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,900
This bastard is so cheap.

268
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,900
Has the person you're looking for

269
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,900
passed by here?

270
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:12,900
Yes.

271
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,900
This is snake paste.

272
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,900
It turns into new red after drying.

273
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,900
So, based on the color and smell,

274
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:22,900
we can find the escape route of that person.

275
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
You're good.

276
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,900
I didn't spend 50,000 yuan.

277
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:36,900
You smell like snake.

278
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:37,900
You can't smell it.

279
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:39,900
Let's go.

280
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:40,900
East Lake's mansion dungeon.

281
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll take a bath for you.

282
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
This bastard is so arrogant.

283
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
He dares to do everything by himself.

284
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I advise you not to mess with him.

285
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,900
You'd better come with me.

286
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:01,900
You want to fight again?

287
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,900
I only wanted you to use your left hand.

288
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
Since you're so good at running,

289
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,900
why don't you break your legs?

290
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,900
Don't come over!

291
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:22,900
What are you doing?

292
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,900
Are you okay?

293
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,900
Get up.

294
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:51,900
Let's go.

295
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
What are you doing?

296
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:21,900
Go.

297
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:52,900
You still want to run?

298
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,900
Tell me.

299
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,900
War God is just a normal match.

300
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
What's the point of stealing the victory?

301
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,900
You'll regret it after you've stolen the victory.

302
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,900
For what?

303
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,900
Who's the master behind you?

304
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
You're so cold-hearted.

305
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,900
If I catch you again,

306
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,900
I'll kill you both.

307
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:21,900
What's this?

308
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,900
What the hell is this?

309
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,900
Why is there only half of it?

310
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,900
Forget it.

311
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,900
Let's talk about it when we get back.

312
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,900
Ye Chu,

313
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,900
you're quite capable.

314
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,900
You're so smart and capable.

315
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,900
Why would a slave fight with you?

316
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:43,900
I'm just a slave.

317
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,900
I'm just a slave.

318
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
I'm just a slave.

319
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,900
I'm just a slave.

320
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:51,900
You're just a slave.

321
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,900
I'm just a slave.

322
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm just a slave.

323
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,900
I'm just a slave.

324
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,900
I'm just a slave.

325
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,900
Because of this?

326
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:05,900
Let me see.

327
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:07,900
You can't run.

328
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,900
You're still a baby.

329
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,900
But you know,

330
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,900
I bought you with money.

331
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:15,900
I bought you with money.

332
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,900
Even you,

333
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,900
I still love you.

334
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,900
It's a military badge?

335
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Did you

336
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,900
used to be a deserter?

337
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,900
In a war,

338
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:42,900
you can't retreat.

339
00:20:45,900 --> 00:20:46,900
I didn't expect a slave

340
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,900
to be so ruthless.

341
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,900
Alright.

342
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,900
Since you ran away,

343
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,900
you can go now.

344
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,900
What?

345
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
You don't want to go?

346
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:13,900
I don't want to owe you.

347
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,900
You're really a man of blood.

348
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,900
Alright.

349
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,900
Then you go back to my mansion.

350
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,900
With your skills,

351
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:23,900
in a few days,

352
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,900
I'll train you

353
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,900
to be the bravest warrior

354
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:27,900
of Eastland.

355
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:28,900
By then,

356
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,900
you don't need to be a slave.

357
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,900
Don't need to be a slave.

358
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,900
Master.

359
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,900
Master.

360
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,900
Ding.

361
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
You're here.

362
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:41,900
Master.

363
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,900
Ding.

364
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,900
What's wrong?

365
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:44,900
You're in a hurry.

366
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:45,900
Master.

367
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,900
Go back to your mansion.

368
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,900
Young Master has issued an order

369
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
to capture you.

370
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,900
What?

371
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,900
So angry?

372
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:54,900
Young Master even knows

373
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,900
you bought a slave.

374
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,900
I hate the way to be a slave.

375
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,900
No wonder.

376
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
I have something to do.

377
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,900
I'm afraid

378
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
I can't take you back.

379
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:11,900
But it's okay.

380
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
You go find the clue

381
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,900
of the man in black today.

382
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:16,900
Tomorrow,

383
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:17,900
wait for me here.

384
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:18,900
I'll take you home.

385
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,900
Tomorrow at seven o'clock.

386
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,900
Wait for me here.

387
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:22,900
I'll take you home tomorrow.

388
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:35,900
Ding.

389
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,900
You think,

390
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:38,900
how many of his weapons

391
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
do you have today?

392
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,900
About...

393
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:45,900
So many.

394
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:49,900
No.

395
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:50,900
I can't go back

396
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:51,900
and be beaten up like this.

397
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,900
I'm afraid

398
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:55,900
I'll be a little bit worried.

399
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,900
I'm afraid

400
00:22:58,900 --> 00:22:59,900
I'll be a little bit worried.

401
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:01,900
I'm afraid

402
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:03,900
I'll be a little bit worried.

403
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,900
Since you're in trouble,

404
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:08,900
you'd better make a bigger one.

405
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,900
Master.

406
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:11,900
What do you want to do?

407
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:16,900
The criminal who kidnapped

408
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,900
the whole city of Dongwu Hangfu,

409
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,900
Jiang Wenhuan,

410
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:21,900
is back to his mansion to ask for punishment.

411
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
He looks like a young master.

412
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,900
Ding.

413
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Take the original painting

414
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,900
and paint it again.

415
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,900
Go.

416
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:30,900
That's it.

417
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:31,900
Go.

418
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:33,900
Xiao Yanwu.

419
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Do you know each other?

420
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:36,900
We do.

421
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,900
We do.

422
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:38,900
Who am I?

423
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,900
Jiang Wenhuan is here.

424
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:41,900
Yes.

425
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,900
I'm the most beautiful man in the Eastland.

426
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:46,900
Today,

427
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:50,900
I'll perform a big engage in marriage for everyone.

428
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,900
Good.

429
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:53,900
Good.

430
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,900
Jiang Wenhuan.

431
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,900
Coming.

432
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,900
What the hell are you doing?

433
00:23:58,900 --> 00:23:59,900
Big brother,

434
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:02,140
I, the Emperor, am the one who took the imperial edict and killed the bandits.

435
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,420
I have the military rules.

436
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:06,060
I also ask for the punishment of the General.

437
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:07,660
You're asking for punishment.

438
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,140
You're really making a mess.

439
00:24:09,140 --> 00:24:09,980
Brother.

440
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,460
Anyway, you should be punished.

441
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,860
Please, I will accept the punishment.

442
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:17,460
The Demon King of the Soul Realm is the Demon King of the Soul Realm.

443
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,220
He's not at all easy to deal with.

444
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,860
Right, Xiao Tian, Xiao Tian. Come here.

445
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:24,140
Hurry up.

446
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:26,780
I've prepared the soup for you.

447
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:30,740
There's long ones.

448
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,180
The eldest son is so handsome.

449
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,380
Why did he raise such a bastard?

450
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:37,300
Exactly.

451
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,540
He's a bastard.

452
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:44,820
There are thick ones and thin ones.

453
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,620
I think it should be this one.

454
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,220
Is it this one?

455
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,380
It's this one.

456
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:53,260
Okay, it's this one.

457
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,860
It's strong and has a strong foot.

458
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,820
It can beat my ass.

459
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:57,740
Open the door.

460
00:24:57,740 --> 00:25:00,060
Bastard.

461
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:00,940
You should be punished.

462
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:04,380
Brother, if you want to be punished, you should be punished here.

463
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,020
Everyone is here. It's lively, right?

464
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,500
Yes.

465
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,180
I'll say it again.

466
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,700
Go in and be punished.

467
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,380
Brother.

468
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,860
Punish him.

469
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,700
Please accept the punishment.

470
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,980
Let's go.

471
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,220
Brother.

472
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,780
Don't be angry, brother.

473
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,620
Now...

474
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:25,260
Brother.

475
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,060
Kneel.

476
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,700
Are you done?

477
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:36,700
Where's the holy paper?

478
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,380
Hand it over.

479
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,140
No.

480
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,900
What do you mean?

481
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,740
The thief ruined it when he escaped today.

482
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,740
Ruined?

483
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:51,820
I think it's not easy behind the God of War.

484
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,060
But don't worry.

485
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:55,180
I'll find out the truth for you.

486
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:57,700
I'll get that thief back and make him pay for it.

487
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:58,660
No.

488
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,940
Why not?

489
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,420
The God of War hasn't started yet.

490
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:04,860
He was assassinated.

491
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:07,020
Someone else must have wanted it.

492
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,700
Anyway, don't worry about it.

493
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,020
Kneel.

494
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:15,700
Never be in a ROSE S in your whole life.

495
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,860
I've tells you.

496
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,340
Go to theainen hall and have something to eat.

497
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,220
Food?

498
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:36,100
In brother's eyes,

499
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,260
I'm an recordings dealer.

500
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:41,220
What did you say?

501
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:45,020
You've been injured all day.

502
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:49,020
But I can't catch that coward and help you.

503
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:54,020
Do you think I'm a good son of a noble?

504
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:58,020
Jiang Wenhuan, what are you talking about?

505
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:03,020
I said you never see us as a real family.

506
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:08,020
Since you were a child,

507
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,020
you've been thinking about your parents

508
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:13,020
and the old love you got from the battlefield.

509
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,020
You've been working hard for the Jiang family.

510
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:20,020
You've been working hard for me, the so-called successor.

511
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,020
You said you were the son of the Jiang family,

512
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,020
but you never see yourself as the son of the Jiang family.

513
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:32,020
You never see yourself as my elder brother.

514
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,020
Jiang Wenhuan.

515
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,020
You always wanted to protect me,

516
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:54,020
but you never thought I wanted to protect you, too.

517
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:59,020
There's a danger behind this battle.

518
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:02,020
You'll either give it to me or not.

519
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,020
I'll take care of this.

520
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,020
You dare?

521
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:09,020
I dare!

522
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:16,020
Okay. You dare, right?

523
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,020
Guards! Go to the house and arrest him!

524
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:26,020
Guards!

525
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:34,020
Now you're admitting your mistake. Is it too late?

526
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,020
Do you still care about the danger?

527
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Yes!

528
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,020
Do you still make trouble?

529
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,020
Yes!

530
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,020
Do you dare to act rashly?

531
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:57,020
I will teach you a good lesson today on behalf of my father!

532
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:14,020
You're back.

533
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
Enough.

534
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,020
Enough.

535
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:24,020
Huarang knows that I was wrong.

536
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
Just let him off this time.

537
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:29,020
Master, you're finally back.

538
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Brother is going to beat me to death.

539
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,020
You deserve it.

540
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
You made your brother unhappy again, right?

541
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:52,020
I'm back.

542
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:59,020
How is Huarang?

543
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,020
She's been treated.

544
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
It's just some skin wounds.

545
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
She'll be fine after a night's rest.

546
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,020
This rascal

547
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
took your money this morning.

548
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:10,020
He knew you were coming back.

549
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,020
He dared to talk back to me.

550
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:14,020
You are a tough talker.

551
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:17,020
You're a big thunder and a little rain.

552
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,020
Actually, Huarang is good.

553
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:22,020
He didn't mean to fight with you.

554
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,020
He just wants to help you as a brother.

555
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,020
To help you get rid of your troubles.

556
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:27,020
I know all of that.

557
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:29,020
But since I'm a big brother,

558
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:33,020
I should be the one to take on some things.

559
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,020
Oh, right.

560
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:37,020
You came back this time

561
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,020
for Dou Shou, right?

562
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,020
Yes.

563
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:42,020
What about Anna?

564
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,020
When we entered the mansion,

565
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,020
Ding had already arranged her in the living room.

566
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,020
That's great.

567
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,020
I happen to have something to give her.

568
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:06,020
This is

569
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,020
the horse I made for you.

570
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,020
We've grown up again this year.

571
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,020
Every year on Shier's birthday,

572
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:20,020
you would prepare a birthday gift for her.

573
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,020
Actually, you don't have to worry about it.

574
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,020
Shier doesn't know about it.

575
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:26,020
How can I wake up?

576
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
If one day,

577
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,020
Shier wakes up,

578
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,020
and sees these gifts,

579
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,020
she will know

580
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:36,020
that we never forgot about her.

581
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:43,020
Then I'll thank you on behalf of Shier.

582
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Thank you.

583
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
I'm sorry

584
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
to have made you worry.

585
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,020
I came back to Eastland

586
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,020
for Dou Shou.

587
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:01,020
I'm sure you already know about it.

588
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
The edict was issued

589
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:04,020
when we entered the city.

590
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:06,020
The edict was also destroyed.

591
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:07,020
Since the edict hasn't been answered,

592
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:08,020
it's said that

593
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,020
we should go back to the capital to receive the edict

594
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
before we can hold the God of War ceremony.

595
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,020
It seems that Dou Shou

596
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,020
can't hold the ceremony in time.

597
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,020
No need.

598
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:18,020
What do you mean?

599
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:25,020
His Majesty ordered me

600
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,020
to come back to hold the God of War ceremony.

601
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:29,020
He also ordered that

602
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:31,020
no matter what happens,

603
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,020
Dou Shou should hold the ceremony in time.

604
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:46,020
Master, you're awake.

605
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,020
Master,

606
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:52,020
your wound hasn't healed yet.

607
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:53,020
Don't move.

608
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,020
Ding,

609
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,020
what time is it now?

610
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,020
It's five o'clock.

611
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,020
What's wrong?

612
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:08,020
Five o'clock?

613
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
This guy

614
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,020
is going to starve me to death.

615
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Master, there's another one.

616
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,020
Give it to me.

617
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Give it to me.

618
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:19,020
Master, where are you going with this wound?

619
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:20,020
Where are you going?

620
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,020
This should be

621
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,020
the other half of the bronze bar.

622
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,020
I seem to have seen this

623
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,020
in the slave market.

624
00:33:49,020 --> 00:33:50,020
This is the one.

625
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,020
You bastard.

626
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,020
You escaped again, didn't you?

627
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,020
What's wrong?

628
00:34:24,020 --> 00:34:26,020
Where's your new master?

629
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,020
He's not here.

630
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Wait.

631
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
You're so arrogant

632
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:34,020
that you don't recognize me, right?

633
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,020
Move aside.

634
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,020
Okay.

635
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:42,020
Come here.

636
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,020
What are you doing?

637
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,020
You're all here.

638
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:46,020
Come here.

639
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,020
Come here.

640
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,020
Come here.

641
00:34:48,020 --> 00:34:49,020
Listen up, guys.

642
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,020
Kneel down.

643
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,020
Kneel down.

644
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,020
You want to leave?

645
00:34:58,020 --> 00:34:59,020
Sure.

646
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,020
Go through here.

647
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,020
I'll let you go.

648
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:06,020
This is so pitiful.

649
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,020
Close it.

650
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,020
Let him go.

651
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,020
So ignorant.

652
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,020
Go.

653
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:14,020
Go through here.

654
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
He's a bastard.

655
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,020
He's a bastard.

656
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,020
He's a bastard.

657
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,020
He's a bastard.

658
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,020
He's a bastard.

659
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,020
You bastard.

660
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,020
With your skills,

661
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,020
I'm sure I can train you

662
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,020
to become the most brave warrior in Eastland.

663
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:32,020
Then,

664
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,020
you won't have to be a slave in the West.

665
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:43,020
There's no one

666
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,020
more powerful than me.

667
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:50,020
How dare you hit me?

668
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,020
How dare you hit me?

669
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
My name is

670
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,020
Kunwu.

671
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,020
Kunwu.

672
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:37,020
Move.

673
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
Boss,

674
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,020
did you see a slave with a mask?

675
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
He left.

676
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,020
He left?

677
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,020
Where did he go?

678
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,020
I don't know.

679
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,020
Where is he?

680
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Over there.

681
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
This...

682
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,020
I'm sorry.

683
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,020
I got the wrong person.

684
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,020
I'm sorry.

685
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,020
I'm sorry.

686
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I'm sorry.

687
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,020
I'm sorry.

688
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:26,020
I'm sorry.

689
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,020
I'm sorry.

690
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:28,020
I'm sorry.

691
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,020
I'm sorry.

692
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:30,020
I'm sorry.

693
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,020
I'm sorry.

694
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
I'm sorry.

695
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:33,020
I'm sorry.

696
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,020
I'm sorry.

697
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,020
I'm sorry.

698
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,020
I'm sorry.

699
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:37,020
I'm sorry.

700
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,020
I'm sorry.

701
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,020
I'm sorry.

702
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,020
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

706

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

708

I'm sorry.

709
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:47,020
I'm sorry.

710
00:38:47,020 --> 00:38:48,020
I'm sorry.

711
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:49,020
I'm sorry.

712
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,020
I'm sorry.

713
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,020
I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

750
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,520
I'm sorry.

751
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,420
Mister Tian,

752
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,100
I'm sorry I 1600 years ago wirelessPod StealthH laughs to go seek

753
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:39,060
Hey,

754
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,820
She is

755
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,020
She is

756
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,020
