Pass down the order.

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,160
I am deeply grieved

18
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,840
by the death of Commandant Bi Qiu.

19
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,200
You must thoroughly investigate this matter.

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,400
Starting from today,

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,480
seal the city gates.

22
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,080
Do not let anyone escape.

23
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,160
I will personally interrogate
any suspicious person.

24
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,800
Yes.

25
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,600
Thank you, Great Chief,

26
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,760
for helping Bi Qiu just now.

27
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,480
He could be free from suffering earlier.

28

Today, I need to go to South Mountain
to console his family.

29
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:25,800
His father raises pigeons
on the South Mountain all day long.

30
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,920
However, his son died before him.

31

When I return,

32
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,960
I will discuss with you

33
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,880
about capturing and killing
the Half-faced Demon.

34
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:38,000
Governor Mo, please restrain your grief.

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,160
Raise pigeons?

36
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:50,360
I'm afraid that Governor Mo Qianzhi of Yingzhou

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,800
is plotting treason.

38
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,320
I command you to secretly investigate it.

39
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,480
When a gray messenger pigeon arrives,

40
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,440
a message can be sent.

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,360
Could it be Bi Qiu

42
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,680
was the secret agent
that the Empress Dowager planted in Yingzhou?

43
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,280
Bi Qiu should act as the relay station
for my messages.

44
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,480
It's okay.

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,856

00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,664
I think

47
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,600
I know why Bi Qiu died,

48
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,160
but I cannot say it.

49
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,568
It's okay.

It seems this tip-off is incorrect.

62

The tip-off claims

63
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,920
there are traces of the Half-faced Demon
outside the city.

64
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,320
But we don't see the Half-faced Demon.

This is too coincidental.

For the sake of the people of Yingzhou,

167
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,960
better to wrongfully kill than to let go.

168

If there is accidental harm,

169
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,080
at worst, I can compensate with my life.

170
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,320

is a capital offense.

do not threaten me with execution.

I am wholeheartedly serving the people.

174
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,440
I just want to eliminate the Half-faced Demon

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,200
and restore peace to the common folk.

176
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,880
Even in the presence of the Empress Dowager,

177
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,160
I would say the same words.

178

Open your eyes and see.

179

00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,080
This place turns out to be the headquarters
of the Huo'e Sect.

188
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,800
Good.

189
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,800
It really is you, Ji Dafu.

190
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,040
You first murdered Li Kaixiang.

191
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,960
Then you framed Li Kairui.

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,160
Then you dragged Liu Zongyuan into this

193
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:49,320
as a scapegoat.

194
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,960
What exactly are you plotting?

195
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:53,240
I did not frame Li Kairui.

196
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:55,760
I even paid to clear his name.

197
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,040
As for Li Kaixiang,

198
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:01,040
so what if I killed him?

199
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,400
He deserved to die.

200
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,920
Liu Zongyuan deserved to die too.

201
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,160
Those foolish commoners,

202
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,720
their deaths are not a pity.

203
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,960
I'm afraid you are the most foolish one.

204
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,200
The commoners you killed were so innocent.

205
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,440
You too were once a son and a husband.

206
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,920
You also have parents, a wife, and offspring.

207
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Do you know the pain when loved ones

208
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,200
are tragically killed?

209
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Shut up.

210
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,640
Tragic death of loved ones.

211
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:27,480
How could I not know that pain?

212
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,480
But when I saw Xiulian,

213
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,320
she was no longer human-like,

214
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,160
disfigured.

215
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,120
But they promised me

216
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,520
they would bring Xiulian back to life.

217
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,000
She will come back.

218
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,240
Who are they? Did they promise you
that they could resurrect Xiulian?

219
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:58,240
Pity you are not like her.

220
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,520
So you can only offer up your viscera.

221
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,040
Shen Du.

222
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,520
Yan Xing, are you alright?

223
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,520
I'm fine.

224
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,960
How did you follow me?

225
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:36,600
The Half-faced Demon was in a fight

226
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,080
and a piece of his robe was torn off.

227
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,600
It had a strong scent
of complex medicines on it.

228
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,680
It reminded me of the place in Yingzhou
where medicinal materials are most concentrated

229
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,560
and which is the least likely to be suspected.

230
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,800
Guangchun Clinic.

231
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,368
Let's get out first.

232
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,760
What's that noise?

233
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,056
There are snakes!

234
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,160
Shen Du, be careful!

235
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,880
Never hurt yourself for my sake,
no matter when.

236
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:42,640
Shen Du,

237
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,240
thank you for saving me.

238
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,440
After we get out this time,

239
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,280
I will be your wife properly for once.

240
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,400
Did you bring the silver I asked for?

241
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,880
If I can leave Yingzhou safely
at an early date,

242
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,280
you can be at ease sooner.

243
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,000
I have prepared all the silver.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,600
It's placed right in…

245
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,320
How dare you!

246
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,680
The lord will not let you go.

247
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:47,400
I'm afraid you won't live to see that.

248
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:49,960
The murderer, Ji Dafu,

249
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,680
you can't escape. Guards!

250
00:15:57,720 --> 00:15:59,680
Take the murderer to the execution cell.

251
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,312
Yes.

252
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,800
Jing Lin, hurry up.

253
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,720
The water's all boiled away
and your meat isn't ready.

254
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:38,800
What's the rush?

255
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,840
Don't underestimate my knife skills.

256
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,120
Here, kid.

257
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,320
You're the kid.

258
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,920
Mr. Pan,

259
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,160
this is for you.

260
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,720
Longevity Dragon and Phoenix Pot.

261
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,680
Mutton Nourishing Soup.

262
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,520
Chinese Yam and Pork Tripe Porridge.

263
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,720
Please enjoy your meal.

264
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:24,880
Were these

265
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,800
arranged by Senior Clerk Yan
for you to make for me?

266
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:30,280
Mrs. Shen instructed me to make them for you.

267
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,840
Longevity Dragon and Phoenix Pot.

268
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,320
Mutton Nourishing Soup.

269
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:36,200
And what he has made for you.

270
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,240
Chinese Yam and Pork Tripe Porridge.

271
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
Please enjoy your meal.

272
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,280
What dishes will the Great Chief have?

273
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,360
The Great Chief will have

274
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,400
only one dish.

275
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,080
It's made by Mrs. Shen herself
for over two hours.

276
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,200
Complete Tonic Soup.

277
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,200
Mr. Pan,

278
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,360
please enjoy your meal.

279
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,520
Kid, go.

280
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,840
Your hand isn't injured.

281
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:37,200
Why can't you drink by yourself?

282
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,080
My shoulder blade was cut.

283
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,120
I can't lift my hand.

284
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,600
Shen Du,

285
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,480
it's been three days already.

286
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,920
You've long been healed.

287
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,240
Stop lying.

288
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,720
Who said she wanted
to be a good wife to me for once?

289
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,280
Got tired of it in just three days?

290
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,880
Is it possible

291
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,960
that one time equals three days?

292
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,240
Stop being dishonest.

293
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,680
Shen Du, I haven't asked you yet.

294
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,760
Why pretend to not see and deceive me?

295
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,040
When did your night blindness get better?

296
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,400
That day, your knife skills were so precise
in killing the venomous snake.

297
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,920
It was not at all
about identifying position by sound.

298
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,960
It's been better for a while now.

299
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,800
It's been a while now?

300
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,096
Well…

301
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,400
That time in the hot spring,

302
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,160
he was pretending to be blind.

303
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,480
Drink it yourself.

304
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,032
Great Chief.

305
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,736
Speak.

306
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,640
Ji Dafu has been arrested
and brought to justice.

307
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,600
Mo Qianzhi, stop.

308
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,000
How dare you?

309
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,600
Who dares to interrupt
the Great Chief's interrogation?

310
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,496
Great Chief,

311
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:15,400
after our investigation,

312
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
Ji Dafu

313
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,400
is the mastermind

314
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,840
behind the Half-faced Demon case.

315
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,800
After he committed the crime,

316
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:23,360
he gouged out Er Laipi's eyes,

317
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,920
beheaded Li Kaixiang,

318
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,360
and took Liu Zongyuan's liver.

319
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,680
This person is extremely evil and guilty.

320
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:33,320
Not killing him is insufficient
to appease the public's anger.

321
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,800
- He should be killed!
- Kill him!

322
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:38,840
He has harmed so many people.

323
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
Dying like this would be too lenient for him.

324
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,440
Exactly, this person
is extremely evil and guilty.

325
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,600
Even a thousand cuts wouldn't suffice

326
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,920
to appease the public's anger.

327
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,040
He should suffer a thousand cuts.

328
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,120
Kill him!

329
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:52,880
- Kill him!
- He should be killed!

330
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,200
Ji Dafu established a gambling house
without authorization.

331
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,800
He killed your family members.

332
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,880
His crimes are unforgivable.

333
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,120
Execute him immediately.

334
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,928
Wait a moment.

335
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,760
Senior Clerk Yan, what do you mean?

336
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:08,880
Could it be

337
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,920
that you want to plead for Ji Dafu?

338
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,280
There are still some doubts in this case
that have not been clarified.

339
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,000
Ji Dafu confessed to his crimes
without hiding anything.

340
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
The evidence is conclusive.

341
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,960
The time has come.

342
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:22,504
Execute him immediately.

343
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,440
Great Chief,

344
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,200
haven't you always been saying

345
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,720
that you want to eliminate harm for the people?

346
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,520
Why would you want to save
such an utterly evil person?

347
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:53,640
Kill him!

348
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,360
I cannot die!

349
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,680
I don't want to die!

350
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:06,040
- Well killed!
- Well done!

351
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:10,400
Well killed!

352
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,920
He deserved to die.

353
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,360
A great satisfaction to the people.

354
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:15,840
Well killed.

355
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,960
Well done!

356
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,128
Well killed.

357
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,240
Great Chief,

358
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,760
my actions

359
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,400
follow the will of the people.

360
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:58,120
Mr. Mo, you are wise.

361
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,040
I've smelled the smell on him

362
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,880
in the place of my confinement.

363
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,240
- Jing Lin.
- Yes.

364
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,000
Check it out.

365
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,880
Yes.

366
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,520
He is the Great Chief.

367
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,960
The infamous White Ghost of Xiang'an City.

368
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,360
Why did he stop it just now?

369
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,680
Who knows, maybe it's retribution for the evil.

370
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,520
Stop talking, let's hurry up and go.

371
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,600
Let's go.

372
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:53,520
My Lord, a secret report from Yingzhou.

373
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,440
Ji Dafu is dead. The situation has changed.

374
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,960
We need to bide our time
and act opportunistically over there.

375
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:08,440
Forget it, it's just a drop in the bucket.

376
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,080
Not important.

377
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,040
It is just the beginning in Yingzhou.

378
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,000
A single gun makes it hard to sound.

379
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,760
Keep a close watch on other places.

380
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,000
Strike when they are unprepared.

381
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Only then can we rise high.

382
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,720
Yes.

383
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:43,240
How is

384
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,960
the deployment in Nanlang and Xichen?

385
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,120
Everything has been done
according to your orders.

386
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,280
Good.

387
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,240
If Heaven aids me,

388
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,760
I will surely triumph over Heaven.

389
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,640
If Heaven does not aid me,

390
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,440
I will defy Heaven.

391
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,320
The people of Yingzhou

392
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,120
are all happy about Ji Dafu's death.

393
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,360
Naturally.

394
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,120
Ji Dafu committed many evils.

395
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:15,400
The people of Yingzhou

396
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:17,320
were all in a panic
because of the Half-faced Demon.

397
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:19,120
They hate him to the bone.

398
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,480
Now the criminal has received just punishment.

399
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,400
It is right to be happy.

400
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,680
What a pity.

401
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,160
The people are singing praises

402
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:32,800
that Mo Qianzhi has accomplished a lot.

403
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
But it was clear that Ji Dafu

404
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,240
was tortured by harsh punishments.

405
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,120
Somehow, he became crazed.

406
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,400
Now our clue has been cut off again.

407
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,640
Now all the people of Yingzhou

408
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:45,560
have seen it.

409
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,040
Mo Qianzhi detests evil
as if it were his enemy.

410
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
He has made the decisive execution order.

411
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,440
It's me, Shen Du,

412
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,600
who intervened.

413
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,840
One is praised by everyone.

414
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,000
The other is the White Ghost

415
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:58,360
who terrifies people at the mere mention.

416
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,520
In the eyes of the common people,

417
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,080
you and Mr. Mo

418
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,160
are so different.

419
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,320
If my heart is at ease,
that's all that matters.

420
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:06,800
Why fear the words of others?

421
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,080
The words of people can be fearsome indeed.

422
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,344
Well,

423
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:17,120
Governor Mo has executed Ji Dafu publicly.

424
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,640
It seems to comfort the public's heart.

425
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,280
But it is also strange.

426
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:23,360
It was inconsistent with his usual cautious way

427
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
of doing things.

428
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:35,440
When the Half-faced Demon caused chaos
in the city that day,

429
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,000
he mentioned the day of Sanyang.

430
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,880
I remember his expression
being somewhat strange at that time.

431
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,400
Is there anything special
about the day of Sanyang?

432
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,760
Isn't it just about to come?

433
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,520
Hold on a moment.

434
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,200
I've heard my mother say

435
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,440
this year's day of Sanyang

436
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,880
is indeed different from the previous ones.

437
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,960
It is the day of Deadly Sanyang

438
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,200
which is rare in decades.

439
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,840
The day of Deadly Sanyang?

440
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,000
What does that mean?

441
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,360
In any case, it means
multiple inauspicious aspects.

442
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,600
She asked me to be especially careful

443
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,400
and instructed me not to leave the house
under any circumstances.

444
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,760
Well, my mother believes in everything.

445
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,800
It's all hearsay after all.

446
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:14,320
But from what I know of Mo Qianzhi,

447
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,960
he is not one to care about such things.

448
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,160
Great Chief.

449
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,240
How did the investigation go?

450
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,840
It is just as you predicted.

451
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,640
I visited several households.

452
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,720
The girls on the city walls that day,

453
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,440
who were abducted by the Half-faced Demon,

454
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,880
were all rescued by the people
from Mr. Mo's yamen.

455
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,920
However,

456
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,320
there was no news afterwards

457
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,800
about them being sent back.

458
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,800
What?

459
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,040
Where are those girls?

460
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,320
Could it be that they were really taken away
by Mr. Mo?

461
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,000
It seems that the Half-faced Demon

462
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,960
did not randomly abduct girls
in the city that day

463
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,160
but took those girls away with a purpose.

464
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,440
However, I have checked it.

465
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,560
The family backgrounds

466
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,000
of those girls

467
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,720
share no similarity.

468
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,456
It's Mo Xiuxiu.

469
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,520
Xiuxiu?

470
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,320
Do you remember the portrait of Mo Xiuxiu

471
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,440
hanging inside the Mo Mansion?

472
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,040
Du Xiaowan

473
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,480
and the five women who were kidnapped
by the Half-faced Demon that day,

474
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,760
between their eyebrows and eyes,

475
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,680
there are similarities with Mo Xiuxiu.

476
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:38,240
What if all this is not a coincidence?

477
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,960
Ji Dafu is dead.

478
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,000
The affairs in Yingzhou are not yet over.

479
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,360
If it's really as we suspected,

480
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,960
I'm afraid he was in collusion
with the behind-the-scenes Huo'e Sect

481
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,200
from the very beginning.

482
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,520
On the day of Sanyang,

483
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,840
they will act again.

484
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,320
What should we do next?

485
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,480
Find them.

486
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,920
Find them?

487
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,880
Find them.

488
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,360
Those women who were kidnapped

489
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,560
are the key.

490
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,640
Yingzhou is so big.

491
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,320
Where would these people be hidden?

492
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,080
Naturally, in those places
one would think impossible.

493
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,560
My Lord,

494
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,880
everything is in readiness.

495
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,960
Just waiting for the auspicious time.

496
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,120
Very well.

497
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,520
Xiuxiu,

498
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:42,320
no matter what,

499
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,920
I must activate the formation today

500
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,240
to bring you back.

501
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,784
Mr. Mo,

502
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:53,160
please let me go.

503
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,000
Considering I've always been obedient,

504
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,040
I beg you, spare my life.

505
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,640
Let me go.

506
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,400
I don't want to die yet.

507
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,064
Jing Lin.

508
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,888
Xiuxiu.

509
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,000
Thankfully, we arrived just in time.

510
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,000
They are all alive.

511
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,440
Xiuxiu.

512
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,680
Qianzhi.

513
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,720
Qianzhi,

514
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:58,248
does it look good?

515
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:03,320
It looks good.

516
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,576
Qianzhi.

517
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Mr. Mo.

518
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,640
Impossible.

519
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,680
Xiuxiu wouldn't call me Mr. Mo.

520
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,280
She would only call me Qianzhi.

521
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,600
Impossible.

522
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:19,760
Impossible to fail.

523
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,400
It's impossible to fail.

524
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,560
It's you guys.

525
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,280
It was you who frightened Xiuxiu's soul away,

526
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:25,920
making her unable to find the way back.

527
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:28,760
Shen Du, you're so heartless.

528
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,920
In this world,

529
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,040
there is no way to resurrect the dead.

530
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,240
He has gone mad to the point
of almost losing his humanity.

531
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Humanity?

532
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,480
Not knowing others' suffering,

533
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:51,000
do not persuade others to be good.

534
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,320
Shen Du,

535
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,560
you should understand

536
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:56,360
this principle.

537
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,240
If it were possible for the wrongfully dead
to be resurrected,

538
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,400
what would you choose?

539
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,160
Xiuxiu

540
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:07,600
was the kindest

541
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,720
and most innocent person in this world.

542
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,840
Yet those scoundrels

543
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,480
forced her to her death.

544
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,112
Mo Xiuxiu.

545
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,280
Was she not ill…?

546
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,648
Who exactly

547
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,880
caused Xiuxiu's death?

548
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,560
Before Xiuxiu died,

549
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,520
she kept asking

550
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,040
why

551
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,160
and what she had done wrong.

552
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,880
Give me some food, please.

553
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,920
Give me some food, please.

554
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:44,120
What's the matter?

555
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,320
[Mo Xiuxiu]
My lord, there are displaced people blocking the road.

556
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,160
Take some food and distribute it to them.

557
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,800
Yes.

558
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,160
Qianzhi, as we get closer to Yingzhou,

559
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,720
the number of displaced people increases.

560
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:02,280
If you take over Gannandao in the future,

561
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,280
I hope you will

562
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,720
provide assistance for these displaced people

563
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,440
and give them a place of stability.

564
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,280
My dear sister,

565
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,880
you are just too kind-hearted.

566
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,320
Come, Xiuxiu.

567
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,639
Welcome, honored guest!

568
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,239
Please come inside.

569
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,639
We will stay here for the night.

570
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,760
The horses must be tired after a day's travel.

571
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:40,880
Please come in.

572
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,159
Miss, are you feeling unwell?

573
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,000
Let me assist you to rest over there.

574
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,080
No need.

575
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:52,800
My family is urgently waiting for the water.

576
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,760
I must hurry and take it back.

577
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,120
You are beautiful and kind-hearted.

578
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,600
Please accompany me for a part of the way.

579
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,800
Alright, I will help you over there.

580
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,664
Thank you, miss.

581
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,992
Let's go.

582
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,640
Save me.

583
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,160
I just encountered some bad people.

584
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:35,760
My family is waiting for me
at the post station.

585
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,560
Please, can you take me back?

586
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,760
Rest assured.

587
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:41,960
I will save you.

588
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,280
Xiuxiu.

589
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,760
Don't come over.

590
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,080
Don't.

591
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,280
- Stay away.
- Xiuxiu.

592
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,080
Xiuxiu, it's alright now.

593
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,040
Come back with me.

594
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,360
Nobody will hurt you anymore.

595
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,960
No, I was wrong.

596
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,000
Qianzhi.

597
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,280
But I just wanted to help.

598
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,800
What exactly did I do wrong?

599
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,880
Xiuxiu.

600
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,760
Xiuxiu.

601
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,360
Don't.

602
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,000
Xiuxiu.

603
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,680
Xiuxiu.

604
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:21,192
Qianzhi..

605
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:55,800
Who are you?

606
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,920
Who I am is not important.

607
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,760
If you wish to revive your sister,

608
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:03,280
I might be able to help you.

609
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,800
Reviving the dead

610
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,720
is utterly absurd.

611
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,000
The world is vast

612
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,560
and full of wonders.

613
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:12,920
What Dacang doesn't have

614
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,760
doesn't mean I don't have it.

615
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:18,480
As long as your heart is devout enough.

616
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,120
You really know

617
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,720
the art of resurrection?

618
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:52,296
Of course.

619
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:01,120
Moth passes through fire to be reborn.

620
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,280
It is the foundation of the Huo'e Sect.

621
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,800
If you truly wish to follow me,

622
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,040
I can

623
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:10,080
resurrect your sister.

624
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,800
As long as you can resurrect Xiuxiu,

625
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,960
I, Mo Qianzhi,

626
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,360
will follow only your lead.

627
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,960
What resurrection technique?

628
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,960
It's nothing but rhetoric
to buy people's hearts.

629
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,360
You have obsessions in your heart.

630
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,040
Thus, you listened and believed.

631
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,760
My senior,

632
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,840
do you not know

633
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,680
that under your protection,

634
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,200
the Huo'e Sect has been rampant in Gannandao

635
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,440
for many years

636
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,160
and has killed countless people?

637
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,600
Do you still believe
they will resurrect Mo Xiuxiu?

638
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,760
Why not?

639
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,800
What reason do I have not to believe?

640
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,560
As long as Xiuxiu can be resurrected,

641
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,000
even if it means killing more people,

642
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,800
what's the harm?

643
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:56,600
Don't those rats

644
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,160
deserve to die?

645
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:02,280
It was the Half-faced Demon of Guangchun Clinic

646
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,480
who killed those people for me.

647
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,120
Xiuxiu kindly saved the refugees

648
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,360
only to be

649
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,520
humiliated to death
by another gang of villains.

650
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,360
How can I not avenge this?

651
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:13,360
- Save me.
- Someone is trying to kill me.

652
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,160
- Don't be afraid.
- Save me.

653
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,200
Under the broad daylight,
there is no absence of law.

654
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:18,800
With our lord here,
you will surely be protected.

655
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,000
It's them, they are the ones trying to kill me.

656
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,640
Why do they want to kill you?

657
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:37,720
Xiuxiu,

658
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,760
I'm here to avenge you.

659
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,440
They all deserve to die.

660
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,480
They should all be buried with Xiuxiu.

661
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,600
Shen Du,

662
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,360
why do you disrupt the sacrifice?

663
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,640
Why

664
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,800
do you just refuse to let Xiuxiu come back?

665
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,720
Those people deserve to die.

666
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:54,280
What about them?

667
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,320
What did they do wrong?

668
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,760
This world has always been unfair.

669
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,080
Shen Du,

670
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:02,880
you know it clear enough.

671
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,200
Using others' lives for sacrifices.

672
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,120
You didn't hesitate to take five lives

673
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:09,720
to exchange for the resurrection you wanted.

674
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:11,400
Even if it worked,

675
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:14,360
do you think Xiuxiu

676
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:17,440
could really accept it with peace of mind?

677
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:27,784
My senior,

678
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,880
Xiuxiu is already dead.

679
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:34,440
Xiuxiu is not dead.

680
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:38,040
I will bring her back.

681
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,064
Guards!

682
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
Using death to resurrect,

683
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,280
to bewitch the heart.

684
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,280
Harvesting people's internal organs

685
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,560
for use in a sacrifice.

686
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,040
Well,

687
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,160
after Mrs. Tang committed murder,

688
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,760
she removed the internal organs of the victims.

689
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,560
She was also deceived by the Huo'e Sect

690
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:30,920
and wished to conduct
this resurrection ceremony.

691
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,600
Creating mystery and spreading terror.

692
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,440
Only to make people feel awe

693
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:41,040
can the Huo'e Sect thoroughly control
these followers.

694
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,960
Xiuxiu.

695
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,400
Be careful.

696
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:51,432
Slow down.

697
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,040
Ms. Yan,

698
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,040
is there really no way

699
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:01,320
to bring people back to life?

700
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:19,778
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

701
00:42:19,778 --> 00:42:23,455
