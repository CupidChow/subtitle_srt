Where are you going?

00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,280
Jia'er is sick
and wants his father by his side.

Let go.

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,000
You always use Jia'er

00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:06,280
You think I can't tell?

24
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,120
I just won't let you see that woman.

25
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,639
What a shrew.

26
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,120
A jealous shrew.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,360
You're living off me.

28

Are you here to see me ridiculed?

00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:39,200
W-Why would I do that?

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,880
You married well
and now you're making a fool of me.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,000
I don't need your help.

43

Spare the formalities.

49
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,920
You contributed greatly
to solving the murder case.

I would love to reward you with something.

51
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,200
But I couldn't

52
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,120
think of anything.

56
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,360
I do not wish for a reward.

57
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,720
But please

58
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,960
bestow upon me an oral decree.

59
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,080
Very well.

60
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:48,360
Tell me about it.

Empress Dowager,

62
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,240
from now on, please kindly
address me as Clerk Yan

63
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,560
instead of Mrs. Shen.

64
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,520
You have such insight

65
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,480
and ambition at such a young age.

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,160
I really appreciate it.

67
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,600
Our court appoints the virtuous and capable,

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:16,760
regardless of gender.

69
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,079

70
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,800
rely on their husbands.

71
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,079
We can fight for

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,320

73
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,760
Approved.

74
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,160
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

75
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,800
Forgive me for speaking boldly.

76
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,680
All Six Ministries have female officials,

77
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,680
but they mostly

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,800
take on cleaning and archiving tasks.

79
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,240
In the Ministry of Justice,

80
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,120
female officials
can't work on cases like male officials.

81
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:54,400
You see.

82
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,080
I am a woman, as well.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,480
Therefore, I know

84
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,920
how much we have to

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,040
go through

86
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,320
to stand as tall as men.

87
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,200
If I can sit

88
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,840
on this throne,

89
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,880
then the female officials

90
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,160
have every right to work on cases.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,440
Madam Xu.

92
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,120
Draft an imperial edict on my behalf.

93
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
From now on,

94
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,160
all the female officials

95
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,320
shall enjoy

96
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
the same rights as male officials.

97
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,880
Your Majesty is truly wise.

98
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,040

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,080
From now on,

100
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,560
you're free to conduct investigations

101
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,000
like your male colleagues.

102
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:40,160

Mr. Xu.

105
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,480
Is the ministry head here?

106
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,080
He hasn't been feeling well

107
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:56,720
and has taken a sick leave.

108
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Is there something urgent?

109
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,880
It's not exactly urgent.

110
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
It's just somewhat shocking.

111
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,400
How so?

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,240
Regarding Liang Chenzhong's chronic poisoning,

113
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,400
you told me to

114
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,960
look into the people around him.

115
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,440
I looked into it and followed the leads.

116
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,320
Guess who it led me to?

117
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,560
It led me to the owner of the Tongming Hall,

118
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,720
Rong Zhui.

119
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,000
Don't move.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,920
Behave.

121
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,624
Dripping Water Guanyin.

122
00:06:34,624 --> 00:06:36,000
Take her away.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,376
Go.

124
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
I brought some tonic for your mother.

125
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,400
The bottom one is for you.

126
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,440
You suffered in prison for nothing

127
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,840
and lost a lot of weight.

128
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,000
Thanks for looking after me.

129
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,720
The prison guards didn't give me a hard time.

130
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,800
And it was quiet in the cell.

131
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Therefore, I came up with

132
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,000
many ideas to improve siege weapons.

133
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,080
I know turning myself in

134
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,080
was a stupid move.

135
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,280
But no matter what,

136
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,560
I couldn't let my mother
suffer any more misfortunes.

137
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,600
Thank you for discovering the truth

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,960
and clearing our names.

139
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,920
This case may have been closed,

140
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
but we still haven't caught

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,520
the person with the poison.

142
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Your family is not considered innocent yet.

143
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:09,760
A-Are you still going to arrest my mother?

144
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,080
- How can you arrest me?
- Take him away.

145
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,280
Great Chief.

146
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,720
Xu Xiangren and Madam

147
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,720
arrested Liang Jiren.

148
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,160
They looked into the Tongming Hall?

149
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,240
That's right.

150
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,240
They have arrested

151
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,360
Rong Zhui, the owner of the Tongming Hall.

152
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,360
That's quick.

153
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,880
Should I take some people

154
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,240
to stop them?

155
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,440
What for?

156
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,320
She was just granted authority.

157
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Let her show off a bit.

158
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,880
Understood.

159
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,960
Mr. Liang.

160
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:54,200
I've been

161
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,760
visiting you quite frequently

162
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,880
to share Empress Dowager's burden.

163
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,880
Meanwhile, I have something else in mind.

164
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,320
Now, I've discovered what I've wanted to know.

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,840
And someone has

166
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:09,360
arrested the suspects for me.

167
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:14,800
The nine sons of the dragon

168
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,040
have different characters.

169
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,560
The poisoning has nothing
to do with you and your mother.

170
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,680
The second branch

171
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,520
has nothing to do with the main branch.

172
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:27,560
Do your job.

173
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,360
Live up to the Empress Dowager's expectations.

[Ministry of Justice]

175
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,440
You poisoned Liang Chenzhong

176
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
with Dripping Water Guanyin?

177
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,600
That's right. I did it.

178
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,600
His eldest son

179
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,520
was nothing but a scoundrel.

180
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,800
If he remained alive,

181
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,120
his father was bound to

182
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,600
die at his hands one day.

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,400
Besides,

184
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:27,200
I already carry his father's child.

185
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,760
Naturally, I have to plan for the future.

186
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,160
Master, this way, please.

187
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,600
A batch of new dancers arrived.

188
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:40,360
Would you like to take a look?

189
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,632
Sensible.

190
00:10:43,232 --> 00:10:44,360
Nice!

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,480
Mr. Liang.

192
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,640
I have found a real beauty for you.

193
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,832
[Liang Chenzhong]

194
00:10:48,832 --> 00:10:51,000
Lan'er, come here.

195
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,600
- What a beauty. Come here.
- Young Master.

196
00:10:57,312 --> 00:11:00,320
Mr. Liang, please have some tea.

197
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
I had no choice.

198
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,880
That wayward son of mine was either

199
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,200
out there gambling or visiting brothels.

200
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,360
Once he ran out of money,

201
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,520
he came to threaten me for more.

202
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,440
He almost drained my savings dry.

203
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,280
Otherwise,

204
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:22,240
I would not have done that.

205
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,720
Besides,

206
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:28,280
I have an unborn child.

207
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:29,600
Shouldn't I

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,800
do something for him?

209
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:49,384
[Prison of Ministry of Justice]

210
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,920
So,

211
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,160
Rong Zhui got pregnant.

212
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,200
So he decided

213
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
to get rid of his eldest son.

214
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,440
That's right.

215
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:00,560
I've seen all kinds of

216
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,840
strange cases as an inspector,

217
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
but I've never

218
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,760
heard of a father poisoning his eldest son

219
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,040
on purpose.

220
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
I didn't expect that

221
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,720
a tiger would actually devour its child.

222
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,080
People are truly unpredictable.

223
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,280
Great Chief.

224
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,480
What brought you here?

225
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,120
Minister Liang, don't you remember?

226
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,040
The Empress Dowager

227
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,400
has entrusted this murder case

228
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,680
solely to me.

229
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,200
However, I'm really surprised

230
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,400
by your ruthless measures.

231
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,720
If I had any other options,

232
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,120
I wouldn't have…

233
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,320
I had no choice.

234
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,720
Even a tiger does not eat its cubs.

235
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,320
How come you simply

236
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,680
"had no choice" when it came to your son?

237
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,680
Great Chief,

238
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,520
why are you mocking me?

239
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,720
I did try to murder my own child.

240
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,320
But what about you?

241
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,160
You reported your own father.

242
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:58,960
We are clearly the same type of people.

243
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,360
Among all the accusations

244
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,320
that convicted my father,

245
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,440
one said that he had leaked a weapon design

246
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,640
to the enemy.

247
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,920
That weapon design was drawn

248
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
by your younger brother.

249
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,280
I knew it.

250
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,320
You've been hanging out

251
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,640
with that silly nephew of mine.

252
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:39,400
I thought you valued talents

253
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,160
and saw my silly nephew

254
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,600
as an inseparable friend.

255
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,480
It turns out

256
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,760
that you've been suspecting us.

257
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:04,080
My goodness, why are you here?

258
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:05,560
Why did you come at this hour?

259
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,040
I came to see you.

260
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,840
No one saw you, right?

261
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,520
I don't know.

262
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,560
We'd be in trouble if someone saw you.

263
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,280
We have other things to worry about.

264
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,240
Your son must have

265
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:22,120
figured something out.

266
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,760
That's why you harbored the intent

267
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,080
to silence him.

268
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,040
If you had

269
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:32,560
found anything solid,

270
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:37,040
you wouldn't come to question me here.

271
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,520
Even if

272
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,080
you bring this to the Empress Dowager,

273
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,280
I still have nothing to say.

274
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,520
In that case,

275
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,960
your affection for the unborn child

276
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,560
is nothing but a disguise.

277
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,720
If you promise to

278
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,200
look after my unborn child,

279
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,200
I may try to recall the event.

280
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,440
Perhaps

281
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,760
I might recall something.

282
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:33,600
You are not in a position
to negotiate terms with me.

283
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:43,040
Minister Liang, have you ever heard of

284
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,800
a punishment called inch-torture?

285
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,280
With each cut,

286
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,400
the criminal will shed
exactly 36 drops of blood.

287
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,880
In three days,

288
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,920
a total of 360 cuts are made

289
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,360
while the prisoner is alive.

290
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Shen Du.

291
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,480
I am a high official.

292
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,359
I am guilty of attempted murder.

293
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,760
And… And I was just an accomplice.

294
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,760
I don't deserve to die.

295
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,160
Y-You shall not act recklessly.

296
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,736
Act recklessly?

297
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,040
Do you really think

298
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:32,280
people call me "White Ghost"

299
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,600
for no reason?

300
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,760
Do you really think

301
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,480
you can leave this place alive?

302
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,800
H-How dare you--

303
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,120
This is the first cut.

304
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,840
I have nothing to do these days,

305
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,720
so I might as well keep you company.

306
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,000
I confess.

307
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,312
I confess.

308
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
I got drunk back then

309
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,120
and leaked my younger brother's weapon design.

310
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,520
After what happened,

311
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,960
I was too scared to confess.

312
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,200
Back then, your father was close

313
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,120
to my brother.

314
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,280
Besides,

315
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:34,200
he had been convicted of treason.

316
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,800
I just seized the opportunity

317
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:39,280
and blamed it on him.

318
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,000
Chenzhong had found out

319
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,760
about it by chance

320
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,960
and had kept extorting money from me.

321
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,600
I couldn't take it anymore.

322
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,960
I simply couldn't.

323
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,200
Great Chief.

324
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,880
Back in the day,

325
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,840
your father was convicted of treason

326
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,320
with solid evidence.

327
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,920
With one less conviction,

328
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,040
you still can't overturn the case.

329
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,240
So it was you, indeed.

330
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:30,000
Then, I will overturn the convictions

331
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,480
one by one.

332
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:30,520
I do not seek to be renowned.

333
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,320
I only wish to have a clear conscience

334
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,640
and not let the people down.

335
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,800
[Shen Bingzhu, Shen's father]
How can I collude with you?

336
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,960
No way.

337
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:43,840
Don't say that I haven't warned you.

338
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,520
The nail that sticks out

339
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,480
gets hammered down.

340
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,560
If you don't ally with me,

341
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,520
you will be walking into a fire

342
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,080
with no return.

343
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,160
I receive my wage from His Majesty.

344
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,720
Naturally, I shall share his burden

345
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,920
even at the cost of my life.

346
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,600
By heavenly decree,

347
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,360
here comes the edict.

348
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,360
The criminal, Shen Bingzhu,

349
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,240
secretly corresponded with the enemy,

350
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,680
burned down our army's granary,

351
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,480
leaked the weapon designs,

352
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,360
and colluded

353
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,400
with the enemy.

354
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,720
[Gao Youning, Shen's mother]
He shall be executed.

355
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,600
The male members
of the Shen family are to be executed.

356
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,000
The women and children are to be imprisoned.

357
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,040
Convey the message widely.

358
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,440
[Late father Shen Bingzhu's tablet]

359
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,520
Father, all these years,

360
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,600
I've never given up seeking justice

361
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,640
for all our family members.

362
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,760
But I'm still clueless

363
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,040
about who that woman is.

364
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,040
Is she an enemy or a friend?

365
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:23,200
Today, at least I managed to prove

366
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,160
that you were framed for

367
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:29,800
leaking the weapon design.

368
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,840
Father, rest assured.

369
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,000
I will find that woman one day.

370
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,400
And I will gather

371
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,400
all the evidence I need.

372
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:23,944
Great Chief.

373
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:27,120
The Ministry of Justice
and the inspectors are celebrating

374
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,960
- tonight.
- Why do I care?

375
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,160
Great Chief.

376
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,160
You are always right.

377
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:38,640
- Cheers.
- You've worked hard.

378
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,760
Drink up, and I'll fill it up.

379
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,920
- Let's get wasted.
- Can you drink?

380
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:44,800
- Over there.
- Come on, let's go.

381
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,640
Come on, Mr. Meng, I toast to you.

382
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,120
Dig in.

383
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,520
You've worked hard.

384
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,840
Cheers.

385
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,560
I almost forgot.

386
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,720
Your letter.

387
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,800
It came to the ministry.

388
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,320
So happy?

389
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,600
Chi is coming to Xiang'an.

390
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,120
She has asked to meet with me.

391
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,920
That's great.

392
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,720
I've heard you mention Chi

393
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,360
so many times.

394
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
The ministry received so many

395
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,040
case-solving letters from commoners.

396
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,880
Only you were silly enough

397
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,160
to read the letters one by one.

398
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,920
I laughed at you back then.

399
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,640
I didn't expect you

400
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,520
to meet such a close pen pal.

401
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,200
I am so jealous.

402
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,320
I still remember

403
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,480
her first letter sent from Jiangnan.

404
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,400
The letterhead featured gilded inlays.

405
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,680
And it had a fragrance.

406
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:51,640
She even put flower petals in the envelope.

407
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,560
I am so jealous.

408
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,160
I really want to meet

409
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,600
such a talented

410
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,000
young lady.

411
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:01,440
She must be a beauty.

412
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,520
Sorry.

413
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,840
She only asked to meet with me.

414
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,936
Annoying.

415
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,440
They really can drink.

416
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:15,760
- Dig in.
- Have some grapes.

417
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,184
Here.

418
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,160
Liuniang.

419
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,600
Come on.

420
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,920
I truly admire your investigative methods.

421
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,840
I toast to you.

422
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,360
Mr. Xu, I'm not very good at drinking.

423
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,360
It's okay.

424
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,320
You'll get better at it.

425
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:35,000
You'll gradually discover

426
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,280
the mystery in the wine.

427
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,680
Cheers.

428
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,360
You'd better behave.

429
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:56,080
Want to be arrested again?

430
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,680
Great Chief.

431
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,000
Shen Du.

432
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,080
Why are you here?

433
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:18,040
Great Chief, please have a seat.

434
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,400
Did I say I wouldn't come?

435
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,080
Great Chief.

436
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,680
Great Chief.

437
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:44,160
Your esteemed presence

438
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,920
is such an honor for me.

439
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,440
Let me toast to you.

440
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:10,000
Please enjoy.

441
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,640
Come on, Great Chief.

442
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,680
I toast to you.

443
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,720
That was unexpected.

444
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,040
The Great Chief can really hold his liquor.

445
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,040
Great Chief.

446
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,520
I toast to you.

447
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,792
Cheers.

448
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,120
He can hold his liquor?

449
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,520
I'm not drunk.

450
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,960
I'm very sober.

451
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,280
Alright.

452
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,280
You're very sober.

453
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,704
You don't believe me?

454
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,560
Find someone to fight with me.

455
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Now that you mention it,

456
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,720
I really do have someone

457
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,760
I want to beat up.

458
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,704
Let's do it!

459
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:19,800
Thank you for coming, Great Chief.

460
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:28,008
Mind your steps.

461
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,840
Jing Lin, bring the lantern.

462
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,880
What for?

463
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,640
Who beats someone up

464
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,640
with a lantern in hand?

465
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:43,112
Let's go.

466
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,800
I can

467
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,840
beat someone up,

468
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,280
but not without a lantern.

469
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:53,960
Yes, you can.

470
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,360
Look at me. I am your lantern.

471
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,840
Let's go.

472
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,560
Jing Lin, let's go.

473
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
Let's go.

474
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,840
Let's go.

475
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,920
- Let's go.
- Be careful.

476
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,680
Liuniang, be careful.

477
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:08,760
- Goodbye, Great Chief.
- Be careful.

478
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,760
- Be careful.
- Chuichui, let's keep drinking.

479
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:11,800
Who wants to drink?

480
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:13,240
I want to eat.

481
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:15,496
Be careful.

482
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:49,800
Jing Lin.

483
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,920
Come here and hold him.

484
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,040
He's too heavy.

485
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,760
Let's go.

486
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,720
- Great Chief, there's a staircase.
- Be careful.

487
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:10,760
Another one.

488
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,920
Up.

489
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,880
Stand still. Be careful.

490
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,160
Who's there? Let me out.

491
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,704
Who is it?

492
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:30,920
Who is it?

493
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,240
I'm going to beat him up.

494
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,504
Wait here for me.

495
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,440
I'll go.

496
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,640
Okay.

497
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,264
Go ahead.

498
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,200
Who's there? Let me out.

499
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,480
So wasted.

500
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,352
Who is it?

501
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,240
Who is it? What do you want?

502
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,880
Buddha absorbs the sin

503
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,360
and only kills the cheaters.

504
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,880
So many unfaithful lovers

505
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,600
are buried at Ximing Temple.

506
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,640
Someone still favors the lover

507
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,880
and neglects his family.

508
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:18,280
It's just a minor punishment as a warning.

509
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,920
If you dare to do it again,

510
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:22,200
I will gouge out your heart and bury you.

511
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,400
I dare not anymore.

512
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,560
I dare not anymore.

513
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,080
So this is how

514
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,800
the drunk White Ghost looks.

515
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,120
Take your sober Great Chief
back to the mansion.

516
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,640
Let's go.

517
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,944
- Watch your steps.
- Go.

518
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:45,680
Be careful.

519
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,960
Who was it? So ruthless.

520
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,520
Who was it?

521
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,040
I didn't expect the mighty White Ghost

522
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,200
to get drunk so easily.

523
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,400
Aren't you a tough guy?

524
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,800
The corpses

525
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,360
are easier to carry than you.

526
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,960
Thank you.

527
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,760
No problem.

528
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,600
Bringing back a drunk roommate

529
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,360
is no big deal. You're welcome.

530
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,480
Detention center.

531
00:34:04,288 --> 00:34:11,176
♫ May you also look up
to see the brilliant stars and moon ♫

532
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,400

♫ Never mind the destined solitary fate ♫

537
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,600
It's from the new preserved fruits shop.

538
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,639
Who is there?

539
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,760
I have to go.

540
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:45,400
I'll comb your hair tomorrow.

♫ The ice and snow slowly melting ♫

542
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:56,960
This is really tasty.

543
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,080
Try it.

544
00:34:59,776 --> 00:35:00,960
Let her go.

545
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,000
- Let go.
- Let her go.

546
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,840
- Let her go.
- Shen Du.

547
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,880
I will find a way to get you out.

548
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
Wait for me.

549
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:14,280
Madam Xu.

550
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:20,160

Shen Du.

556
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,720
You're so annoying.

557
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,480
Good morning, Madam.

558
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,640
Good morning, Madam.

559
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,440
Madam, please have breakfast.

560
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,440
You…

561
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,080
Morning.

562
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:12,520
I got drunk and did something improper.

563
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:44,328
It's alright.

564
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,040
Last night--

565
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,520
Nothing happened.

566
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:02,960
Sister.

567
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
Qi Yeyun.

568
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,560
