26

the Ming Hall fire case throughout the night

and had not returned for the entire night.

The Great Chief has served Empress Dowager

with utmost loyalty and duty.

30
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,240
It's just pitiable for the bride.

31
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,680

00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,928
was 'Dripping Water Guanyin'.

186
00:08:44,928 --> 00:08:46,753
[Mrs. Liang]

187
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,120
The Ministry of Justice

188
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,040
[Liang Jiren]
and the inspector will definitely

189
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,400
find out your son's cause of death.

190
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,240
Find out what?

191
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,240
Liang.

192
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,080
I apologize.

193
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,880
Sorry, sorry.

194
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,200
See you, Minister Liang.

195
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:08,904
Are you still investigating?

196
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Ximing Temple is an imperial
temple built by the imperial order.

197
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,440
All the reputable officials
and nobles of Xiang'an

198
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,480
would come here to offer incense.

199
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,640
With this kind of incident,

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
naturally, there must be an explanation.

201
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,720
Yes, you're right.

202
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,560
Mrs. Liang made such a scene

203
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,040
and it messed with my head.

204
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,400
Quickly investigate the case.

205
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,440
Quickly close the case.

206
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:38,600
Lu Chuichui.

207
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,160
Yes.

208
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,280
Go, go, go.

209
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,640
Take the already identified information

210
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,760
and send it back
to the Ministry of Justice for filing.

211
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,240
I've heard that the abbot of Ximing Temple

212
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,320
had stored quite a good selection of tea.

213
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,320
Let's go

214
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,800
and have some free tea.

215
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,920
Drinking tea?

216
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:04,800
He still has the nerve to drink tea.

217
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,960
Wu Taiming brings no peace.

218
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,520
All he does is act high and mighty.

219
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,680
I can't believe him.

220
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,400
Liuniang.

221
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,280
You have been looking
at the bodies for a long time.

222
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,560
Wait until you're done, come with me.

223
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,840
If Wu Taiming is enjoying tea,

224
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,680
we should also treat ourselves better.

225
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,680
I will take you to Furong Garden
for the new opera and some good tea.

226
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:30,000
Chuichui, you go back first.

227
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,200
I want to take a closer look
at the corpse pit again.

228
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,040
- Go then.
- Alright.

229
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,760
I'm leaving.

230
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,320
Dripping Water Guanyin?

231
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:06,360
It seems you still haven't
clearly remembered my words.

232
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,640
I wouldn't dare.

233
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,480
What are you doing here

234
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,680
instead of being at the Shen Mansion?

235
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,920
Although I have married into the Shen family,

236
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,600
I'm still a clerk of the Ministry of Justice.

237
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,560
How can I not come
when a murder has occurred here?

238
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:26,560
You are just a clerk
of the Ministry of Justice without rank.

239
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,880
How come you have taken
on the duty of a coroner?

240
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,160
I have also never heard

241
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,400
that the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards

242
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,800
needed to put out a fire personally

243
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,520
and toil all night for it,

244
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:38,240
at the expense of missing his wedding night.

245
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,920
Great Chief, I just asked the inspector
for the investigation results.

246
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,000
There is very little blood in the pit.

247
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,200
Mostly, it is corpse fluid.

248
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Liang and Kuang probably were moved here

249
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,680
after most of their blood had dried.

250
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,360
But there are no wheel tracks nearby.

251
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,760
There are, however, many footprints.

252
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:57,440
This place has countless pilgrims,

253
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,360
even Princess of Valor is a regular visitor.

254
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,880
What can be discerned from footprints?

255
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,440
What about the shovel marks in the pit?

256
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,880
Can they show how long ago it was?

257
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
It must have been some time ago.

258
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,440
But the coroner says
it's difficult to judge the time.

259
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,440
April 15th.

260
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,120
How do you know?

261
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,400
The edge of the pit is thinner
at the bottom and thicker at the top.

262
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,000
The impact point is sharp,
and the edge is round.

263
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,840
The murderer or an accomplice

264
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,520
used a commonly seen round-headed shovel.

265
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:27,080
The soil at the side of the pit is loose,
with a heavy center.

266
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,360
The soil at the bottom of the pit is compact.

267
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,600
This is a manifestation of post-rain soil.

268
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
Today is the eighth day of May.

269
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,080
The last time it rained

270
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,320
was on the fifteenth of April.

271
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,640
Here.

272
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,680
When I came out in the morning,

273
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,040
I took some from the house.

274
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,760
When I return, I'll have to ask the old butler,

275
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:03,760
which store he bought these
sweet preserved fruits from.

276
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,152
Here you go.

277
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,560
The soil changes a lot.

278
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,040
Your findings may not be reliable.

279
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:15,960
Look here.

280
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,720
About three feet and eight inches
above the ground,

281
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,800
there is a streak of dirt,

282
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
caused by splashing mud and water.

283
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,080
The bamboo in Ximing Temple
is the yellow-grooved bamboo,

284
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,760
which can grow one to two inches
one day after the rain.

285
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,880
The splash marks are directly
opposite the grave pit.

286
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,360
The marks are thick at the bottom
and thin at the top.

287
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,680
They were undoubtedly made on the day.

288
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
Did Chen Wen also teach you these?

289
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:41,240
I am very concerned about you, my wife.

290
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,360
I've done a thorough research.

291
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,760
My master once said,

292
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,720
that capturing the criminals, putting them
in custody, and interrogating them

293
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,760
are the duties of the Ministry of Justice.

294
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,440
Therefore, exhausting every
means to crack the case

295
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,320
is the responsibility of any member
of the Ministry of Justice.

296
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,760
You are just a lowly clerk without rank.

297
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,200
The duty of the Ministry of Justice

298
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,960
won't fall on you no matter what.

299
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,520
- I…
- We only got married yesterday.

300
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:00,480
Return with me to the Shen Mansion today

301
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,360
and learn the responsibilities of a new bride.

302
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,720
The Great Chief hastily welcomed the bride.

303
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,400
Now all of Xiang'an knows

304
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,200
that the Great Chief does not favor Liuniang.

305
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,200
And coincidentally,

306
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,920
I don't care much for you, the Great Chief.

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,080
So from now on,

308
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,400
we shall each do our own thing,

309
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,520
without interfering with each other.

310
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:18,680
And you don't need to worry

311
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,080
about what responsibilities I take on.

312
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,120
It seems that today,

313
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:25,600
I have to worry about it.

314
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,440
Shen Du.

315
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,680
Let go.

316
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,024
Shen Du.

317
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,280
Put me down. Shen Du, Shen Du.

318
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,320
What are you doing?

319
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,320
What do you want?

320
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,600
Truly deserving to be Ximing Temple.

321
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,640
How can one get such good tea in the office?

322
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,800
Unfortunately for your husband,

323
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,400
I married a lady who is
wholeheartedly devoted to official duties.

324
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,360
So I can only bring her home for some comfort.

325
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,600
Put me down now.

326
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,800
Nice scenery.

327
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,680
Shen Du, what are you doing?

328
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,280
Put me down now.

329
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,040
I advise that you be more obedient,

330
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,640
otherwise,

331
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:14,280
I'll show affection to you in public.

332
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,560
What?

333
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,320
That girl, Yan Xing,

334
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,240
and the other one on the horse is

335
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,240
Great Chief Shen?

336
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,960
Didn't they say that White Ghost
threatened Mrs. Shen

337
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:36,520
with a knife to her neck
on the day of their marriage?

338
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,440
It appears these are all rumors then.

339
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,640
Now,

340
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:43,480
you are now Mrs. Shen in everyone's eyes.

341
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,880
Having already entered the game,

342
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,920
there's no longer a choice to leave unscathed.

343
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,920
A monkey dressed in silk is still a monkey.

344
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,800
You put on this show.

345
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:53,000
Are you trying to win

346
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,120
a reputation as a good husband and son-in-law?

347
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,520
We are newlyweds.

348
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,800
Being intimate is natural.

349
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,000
Today,

350
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,200
I will definitely make you

351
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,720
and the people behind you satisfied.

352
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,360
The Imperial Guards
manage myriad affairs daily.

353
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,120
I'm sure you have many

354
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,160
things to attend to

355
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,720
on behalf of Empress Dowager.

356
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,200
Taking me along might be inconvenient, right?

357
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,200
- Are you dead or crippled?
- Great Chief.

358
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:19,120
If you are neither dead nor crippled,

359
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,560
what inconvenience could there be?

360
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,464
A letter from the palace.

361
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,560
[Decree from Empress Dowager]
Quickly resolve the Ximing Temple murder case

362
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,560
Ensure the safety of the second branch
of the Liang family, Liang Chenyu

363
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,160
- I need to go somewhere.
- Where to?

364
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,200
Liang Mansion at Fengyue Alley.

365
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,634
[Liang Mansion]

366
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,360
What's going on?

367
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,680
If he doesn't investigate
the case, I still have to.

368
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,240
Following him like this is not a solution.

369
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,839
Great Chief.

370
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,839
Our third young master is
waiting for you in the study.

371
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:23,816
Great Chief.

372
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:31,800
Call me Honey.

373
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,240
Or you can say goodbye to your tongue

374
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,520
after we leave the Liang Mansion.

375
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,520
Honey.

376
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,168
Speak.

377
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,040
My official position is,
after all, different from yours.

378
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,240
You have business
with the master of the second branch.

379
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,160
It's not very convenient
for me to accompany you.

380
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:07,120
I might as well wait for you outside.

381
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,000
I just want to go out for a walk.

382
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:18,360
Fine, Jing Lin.

383
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,920
- Follow her.
- Yes.

384
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:25,440
Great Chief, this way, please.

385
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,800
I stayed up all night.

386
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,080
I'm going to take a nap here now.

387
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,160
Go over there and stand guard for me.

388
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,840
Alright then.

389
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,960
Since you guards

390
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,360
can even watch

391
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:01,560
the Great Chief's wife sleep.

392
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,680
There's no need for me to be coy.

393
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:07,208
Guard away.

394
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:10,280
Mrs. Shen.

395
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,400
What are you doing here?

396
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,960
Here, for you. It's very sweet.

397
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,640
I heard that after the Liang family split,

398
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,280
they built a wall.

399
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,360
The trees in this area

400
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,480
seem to have been moved here afterward.

401
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,880
Logically speaking, these pear,
mulberry, and locust trees

402
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,760
are not considered auspicious choices.

403
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,400
The second madam ordered them

404
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,920
when she was mad.

405
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,400
Separation?

406
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:42,560
Pointing at one to curse the other.
Guilty conscience.

407
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,600
These two brothers hold deep grudges.

408
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
Could it be

409
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,640
as rumored in the alleyways,

410
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,480
that the son of the second madam, Liang Chenman

411
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:54,480
was poisoned by the Dripping Water Guanyin,

412
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,160
and it was done by the first
branch of the family?

413
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,920
Be careful with what you say.

414
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,160
However,

415
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,920
the second madam did go mad
after the death of the second young master.

416
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,000
Since then,

417
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
the connecting door in the wall
between the first branch and the second branch

418
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,240
has never been opened again.

419
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,528
Honey?

420
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,480
What are you doing, Madam?

421
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,176
Avoiding White…

422
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:23,520
I'm hiding from my husband.

423
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:24,680
Well,

424
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,840
since I married him yesterday,

425
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,640
my husband can't leave me for a moment.

426
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:31,080
He has to send someone

427
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,080
to follow me with every step I take.

428
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,000
I really need some air.

429
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,560
White?

430
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:39,520
Is the Great Chief so clingy?

431
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,160
Yes, he is.

432
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,480
I was wondering about it.

433
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,000
Although the Great Chief often comes,

434
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:49,280
it's the first time he brought a female
family member into the mansion.

435
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,320
So my husband

436
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,440
is actually very close to the Liang family.

437
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,040
The Great Chief and our third young master

438
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,200
are very close.

439
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,200
He usually brings some flowers,
plants, and medicinal herbs

440
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
to the second madam.

441
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:01,200
Something happened
in the second madam's yard again, hurry!

442
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,440
It's the second madam's yard.

443
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,320
The Empress Dowager has decreed.

444
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,360
The crossbow improvement blueprints

445
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,952
must be completed on schedule.

446
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,960
But how can I have the mind to draw them?

447
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,720
Your brother Liang Chenzhong's murder case

448
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,200
is being investigated by my imperial guards.

449
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,880
You can rest assured.

450
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,520
But…

451
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,160
Your family has been serving
the Ministry of Works for generations,

452
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,560
skilled in archery and machinery.

453
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,920
Most of our dynasty's crossbow equipment

454
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,640
was designed by your grandfather

455
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,600
which has earned prestige on the battlefield.

456
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,240
Passing down to your generation,

457
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,040
only you can be entrusted
with this important task.

458
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,920
The Empress Dowager has always valued talent.

459
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:52,200
Just focus on completing

460
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,400
the task entrusted to you.

461
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:11,880
Just like before,

462
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,360
as soon as my father
picked up the brush to draw,

463
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,080
your father would immediately turn and leave.

464
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,680
Before my father died,

465
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,560
he could never forget the incident that year.

466
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:25,080
[Beloved Father Shen Bingzhu]
The criminal Shen Bingzhu

467
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,880
deserves death for his crimes.

468
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:31,000
There's no need to mention it again.

469
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,560
Rest assured,

470
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:35,520
I won't repeat that person's mistakes.

471
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,920
Man.

472
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,760
Man.

473
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:02,760
Man.

474
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,920
Dripping Water Guanyin?

475
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,080
Don't touch my Man.

476
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,240
[The second madam Liang]
Man. Man.

477
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:19,480
Don't touch my Man.

478
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,432
Help.

479
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,272
Help.

480
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,000
Help.

481
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,720
Great Chief, over there.

482
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,216
Help.

483
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,512
Help.

484
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,408
Help me!

485
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,856
Help.

486
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,720
Shen Du.

487
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,520
What a cruel heart you have.

488
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:01,960
If you can't drive me away, you're thinking
of taking the chance to drown me here.

489
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,840
Help.

490
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,560
- Help me.
- Here.

491
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,160
Clean it up.

492
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:32,160
Take the Great Chief's wife
to bathe and change.

493
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,960
I'm so sorry about today.

494
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
I hope you will forgive me.

495
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,400
It's alright.

496
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,080
Tell your third son

497
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,760
to focus on his work with ease.

498
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,552
Yes.

499
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,136
I take my leave.

500
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,480
Had I not seen it with my own eyes,

501
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,480
who would have thought

502
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,720
the White Ghost that makes
the world tremble at the mention

503
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,400
turns out to be a considerate husband?

504
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,960
A ruthless man to the outside world,

505
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,280
but a man of deep feelings in reality.

506
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,040
What have you told those maidservants?

507
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,240
I was playing along with your act

508
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,000
of being a good husband.

509
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,080
Maidservants from a grand household like this

510
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:29,760
spread rumors in the most effective way.

511
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,040
Why did you save me?

512
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,200
If I were to die from drowning,

513
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:52,640
it would be an accidental death.

514
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,400
You wouldn't have
to find a way to drive me away.

515
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Why not kill two birds with one stone?

516
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,800
I still need you for something.

517
00:28:02,758 --> 00:28:06,492
[Shen Mansion]

518
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,760
I have settled your belongings, madam.

519
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,240
You shall rest for the night here.

520
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,560
Didn't the master say

521
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:28,320
that the main room should not
be used as a bridal chamber

522
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,480
as it could easily lead to bloody disasters?

523
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,680
The master has already resolved it.

524
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,200
So rest assured and reside here.

525
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,560
I think the west chamber has better feng shui.

526
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,040
It's beneficial to me. I should
go back and stay there.

527
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:44,744
Stop right there.

528
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
You don't have a choice.

529
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:56,160
If you wish to die,

530
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,680
you can leave the Shen Mansion.

531
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:08,712
Fine,

532
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,880
I'll live here.

533
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Bloody disasters?

534
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:22,840
It's not yet certain who will bleed.

535
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,280
Madam.

536
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:13,240
The master has not yet started eating.

537
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,120
So what?

538
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,320
I'm hungry.

539
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,640
The one who caused me
to fall into the water today

540
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,160
was the second madam of the Liang family.

541
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,240
Her son died

542
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,720
from the Dripping Water Guanyin poison,

543
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,040
but she treated that pot of poison

544
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,280
as if it were her own child

545
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:35,480
and even called it "Man".

546
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,240
Now, this son of the first branch,
Liang Chenzhong

547
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,000
has also been poisoned
by Dripping Water Guanyin.

548
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,896
How could it be such a coincidence?

549
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,696
Do not speak while eating.

550
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,200
I have finished eating.

551
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,440
Do you also think

552
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,680
that Liang Chenzhong's death

553
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,160
is revenge by Liang's second branch?

554
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,472
Great Chief.

555
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,280
Send it away.

556
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,272
Yes.

557
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,320
Leaving in such a hurry?

558
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,640
Skipping the meal?

559
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:44,360
Talkative.

560
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,800
You manage people's eating and drinking,

561
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,000
but are you also going to manage
their speaking and blinking?

562
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,280
Remember, in the Shen Mansion,

563
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,280
you'd best choose to be blind

564
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,120
and deaf as well.

565
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,120
The case of Liang Chenzhong

566
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:16,160
has been handed over to the Imperial Guards.

567
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,880
The case belongs to the Ministry of Justice.

568
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,720
I thought you were smart.

569
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,800
Empress Dowager has handed the case

570
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,000
over to the Imperial Guards

571
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,480
from the Ministry of Justice.

572
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,520
Don't you see

573
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,800
her underlying purpose?

574
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,560
Empress Dowager wants to calm the issue.

575
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,400
Because the Liang family is an important
official in the Ministry of Works.

576
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,880
The design of the current dynasty's crossbows

577
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,640
all came from the hands of the Liang family.

578
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,720
Liang Chenman of the second branch
died suddenly and unexpectedly.

579
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:46,560
Liang Chenzhong suddenly died again.

580
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,160
If the third young master was involved again

581
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,200
due to family vendetta,

582
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,200
it would inevitably affect

583
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,480
the succession of the Liang family's skills.

584
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,840
Not completely foolish after all.

585
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,160
The second branch of the Liang family
cannot be imprisoned.

586
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,848
Unless

587
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:03,400
you want to confront the Empress Dowager.

588
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,192
Or are you saying

589
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:15,720
this is what Zhang Hangwei meant?

590
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:26,600
I am not a follower of Prime Minister Zhang.

591
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,760
You left the scroll in the room

592
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:35,640
on purpose, to test me?

593
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:38,200
You should thank your cleverness.

594
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,480
Otherwise, you would have been beheaded by now.

595
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,080
In fact, there's no need to open it.

596
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:48,600
I can guess

597
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,920
that it is the crossbow diagram inside.

598
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,200
What are you laughing at?

599
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,320
I am laughing at you.

600
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:59,280
The Great Chief of the Imperial Guards

601
00:33:59,280 --> 00:34:00,480
has determined that the murderer

602
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,960
is from the second branch
of the Liang family without verification.

603
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,040
But it might not be true.

604
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,640
The second branch of the Liang family
bears a grudge against Liang Chenzhong.

605
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,719
Yet the murderer only slashed

606
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,880
the courtesan's face to the bone.

607
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,400
I said, you don't need
to investigate this matter.

608
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,920
What if I insist?

609
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,960
Either stay alive and be silent,

610
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,199
or become a dead person who cannot speak.

611
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,960
Great Chief.

612
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,160
How about we make a bet?

613
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,840
You're truly not afraid I'd kill you.

614
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,520
Of course, I am afraid.

615
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,360
But you have also said

616
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,480
that you still needed me for something.

617
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,400
What?

618
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,200
Are you afraid of losing the bet to me?

619
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,200
How do we bet?

620
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:42,880
Let me investigate.

621
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,880
If the murderer

622
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,720
really is the third young master
of the Liang family, Liang Chenyu,

623
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,400
you win.

624
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,480
I will personally ask for a divorce then.

625
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:54,320
My life will also be at your disposal.

626
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,600
You really seem to think your life is too long.

627
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:02,680
But if I do find the murderer,

628
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:04,760
after three months,

629
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,800
you and I will part ways.

630
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,320
You didn't want to marry me,

631
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,240
and neither did I.

632
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,560
We have no grievances.

633
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,960
We don't seek a century of harmony,

634
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:24,280
only a pleasant parting.

635
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:47,048
Okay.

636
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,600
No matter what,

637
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:05,120
I must endure three months.

638
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:07,520
By then, the examination
for the female officials will be over.

639
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,320
The matter of being dispatched abroad

640
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,640
should also be settled by then.

641
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,160
It's not appropriate for me

642
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
to live in this main bedroom, right?

643
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,640
If I say you live here, you live here.

644
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,680
Our marriage was bestowed

645
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,440
by Empress Dowager.

646
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,400
In anyone's eyes,

647
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,960
we should be overflowing

648
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
with affection.

649
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,800
If you cannot do that…

650
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,400
I'll lose my head again.

651
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,000
Alright, I know.

652
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,280
You don't say.

653
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,480
I think

654
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:03,080
this main bedroom suits me.

655
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,680
In that case,

656
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,240
you should treat me as the lady of the house

657
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,880
in all ways, you know?

658
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,240
Have to play the full role, right?

659
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,120
If I sleep here,

660
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:18,280
where will you sleep?

661
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,320
Didn't you just say

662
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,480
"in all ways"?

663
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:24,400
Newlyweds enjoying their bliss,

664
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,680
close as lacquer and glue,

665
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,840
we can only share the same bed now.

666
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,920
You climbed onto my bed with your outerwear on.

667
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,480
That's always how I do it at home.

668
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,920
If you're not used to it,

669
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,120
you just have to try.

670
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,880
You're right.

671
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,440
I should try to get used to it.

672
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:29,000
You're pressing on my hair.

673
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,360
You don't say.

674
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,560
The preserved fruits in the Shen Mansion
are really delicious.

675
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,080
I can never get enough.

676
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,928
So good.

677
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,600
Would you like one?

678
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:28,240
You…

679
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,560
Mr. Zhong.

680
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,960
Change it.

681
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:34,080
Change everything.

682
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,560
The light is so bright.

683
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,520
Can it be turned off?

684
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,480
No, it can't.

685
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:08,520
How can I sleep with it this bright?

686
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,320
You could just not sleep.

687
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,040
Chi, how have you been recently in Jiangnan?

688
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,040
Recently, I solved a wife-murder case.

689
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:14,280
The deceased did not commit suicide.

690
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,320
Let me reconstruct

691
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,832
the scene for you.

692
00:42:16,832 --> 00:42:18,200
Yuanniang.

693
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:19,920
After you strangled Wang Yuanniang,

694
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,760
you put a rope around the corpse's neck,

695
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,040
dragged her to the beam,

696
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,320
hung the other end of the hemp rope

697
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,440
on the beam,

698
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:27,200
and pulled hard to hang her up.

699
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:31,080
All these left marks on the beam.

700
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,120
Therefore,

701
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:33,320
two different strangulation marks

702
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,000
appeared on her neck.

703
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,240
The black ones went backward,

704
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:37,960
and the brown ones went upward.

705
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,720
There are still rope burn marks on your hands.

706
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:42,120
She was strangled to death by you.

707
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:44,120
Clerk Yan,

708
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,680
Ms. She has confessed

709
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,320
that she assisted Cheng Xian

710
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:49,000
in the matter of killing his wife.

711
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,440
This small shirt was embroidered
by Yuanniang, wasn't it?

712
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,920
Upon examination by the coroner,

713
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,560
Wang Yuanniang was found
to be two months pregnant.

714
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,960
You're trying to deceive me.

715
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,400
Even if she was pregnant,

716
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,240
so what?

717
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,480
You resented marrying into the family,

718
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,960
and in anger plotted to murder Wang Yuanniang.

719
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,080
But what you didn't know

720
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,840
was that she was wholeheartedly devoted to you.

721
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,600
She has long planned
that after the child is born,

722
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,360
they would take your surname.

723
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,520
The embroidery on this little shirt

724
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,600
is the surname Cheng.

725
00:43:17,521 --> 00:43:19,600
[Cheng]

726
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:21,120
You blame Wang Yuanniang's maternal family

727
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,160
for oppressing you.

728
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,480
But you know the truth better than anyone.

729
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,760
Yuanniang.

730
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:30,240
I owe you an apology, Yuanniang.

731
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:32,760
Yuanniang.

732
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:34,000
However, on the deceased's body,

733
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,200
there was also a pinprick wound,

734
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:37,240
which is quite strange.

735
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,120
The coroner has temporarily been
unable to determine its origin.

736
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,440
Lately, there have been

737
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,960
many changes with me.

738
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,480
Before dawn.

739
00:44:06,166 --> 00:44:09,984
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

740
00:44:09,984 --> 00:44:13,661
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

741
00:44:13,661 --> 00:44:18,358
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

742
00:44:18,358 --> 00:44:21,302
♫ We are forever bound ♫

743
00:44:21,302 --> 00:44:24,757
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

744
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:28,304
♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫

745
00:44:28,304 --> 00:44:33,278
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

746
00:44:33,278 --> 00:44:36,222
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

747
00:44:36,222 --> 00:44:40,734
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

748
00:44:40,734 --> 00:44:44,062
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

749
00:44:44,062 --> 00:44:45,662
♫ Your palm lines ♫

750
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:48,425
♫ Your gaze ♫

751
00:44:48,425 --> 00:44:51,486
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

752
00:44:51,486 --> 00:44:55,742
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

753
00:44:55,742 --> 00:44:59,774
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

754
00:44:59,774 --> 00:45:01,214
♫ Your palm lines ♫

755
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:03,774
♫ Your gaze ♫

756
00:45:03,774 --> 00:45:06,654
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

757
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:11,448
♫ You are the one for me ♫

758
00:45:24,168 --> 00:45:28,045
♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

759
00:45:28,045 --> 00:45:31,715
♫ Every moment is treasured ♫

760
00:45:31,715 --> 00:45:36,374
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

761
00:45:36,374 --> 00:45:39,407
♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

762
00:45:39,407 --> 00:45:42,633
♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

763
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:46,373
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

764
00:45:46,373 --> 00:45:51,390
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

765
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,270
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

766
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:58,558
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

767
00:45:58,558 --> 00:46:02,334
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

768
00:46:02,334 --> 00:46:03,904
♫ Your palm lines ♫

769
00:46:03,904 --> 00:46:06,654
♫ Your gaze ♫

770
00:46:06,654 --> 00:46:09,566
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

771
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:13,566
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

772
00:46:13,566 --> 00:46:17,719
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

773
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:19,423
♫ Your palm lines ♫

774
00:46:19,423 --> 00:46:21,974
♫ Your gaze ♫

775
00:46:21,974 --> 00:46:24,747
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

776
00:46:24,747 --> 00:46:29,489
♫ You are the one for me ♫
