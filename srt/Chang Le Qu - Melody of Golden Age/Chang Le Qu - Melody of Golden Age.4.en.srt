Morning, Great Chief.

16
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,600
It's not morning anymore.

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,040
It seems that

18
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,600
the Ministry of Justice
is not very strict in rules.

19
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,080
Thanks to you.

20
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:12,480
I slept so well last night.

of the Liang family is not the murderer.

How certain are you?

23
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:21,040
Almost certain.

24
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,680
Go on then.

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,200
Now your head

26
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,840
is still on your neck

27
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,240

even with a head,

29
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,240
I would still have to go to underworld.

No way.

I've heard all about
you two riding a horse together.

Tell me the truth.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,480
Indeed, good news stays within,

52

You're now famous
among the circle of noblewomen

55
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,560
in the Imperial City.

56
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,920
Back then, there was a woman
who feigned fainting

57
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,520
and fell into Shen Du's arms.

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,160
And she got arrested by the Imperial Guards

59
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,160
and sentenced for

60
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,680
the crime of offending the Great Chief.

61
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,720
It really is his style.

62
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,080
Since then,

63
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,240
once the women in Xiang'an City

64
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,560

65
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,200
they'd avoid him.

66
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,120
I can't believe he would
show affection with you in the street

67
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,920
and had close contact.

68
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,480
It's better to have less contact.

69
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,584

72
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,160
The Empress Dowager was furious.

73
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,120
Several people from the Imperial Guards
were held accountable.

74
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,360
Even your husband was fined his salary.

75
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,760

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:28,920
I heard about that poor scholar
named Chen Baiyi.

77
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,360
He set himself on fire in the Ming Hall

78
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,440
because he sought fame but failed.

79

He is dead.

80
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,280

86

and wanted to pardon her.

87

But this old lady

88
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,360
went to the Ministry of Justice

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,400

did she ever have a dispute with someone?

190
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,960
Zhanxin has always been gentle,

191
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,440
getting along well

192
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,240
with everyone.

193
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,680
Until the officials came to inform last night,

194
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,400
didn't you know that Kuang Zhanxin was missing?

195
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,720
She left on the seventeenth of last month

196
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:58,000
to go on an outing with Liang Chenzhong.

197
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,160
Liang Chenzhong

198
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,760
would take her out for fun before.

199
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,840
I thought this time,

200
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,680
she just went for a bit longer.

201
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,800
If we need further information,

202
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,040
we'd come and ask again.

203
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:12,160
Please calm down.

204
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,720
I heard that Chen Baiyi set himself on fire

205
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,640
and also set the Ming Hall on fire.

206
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,280
Fortunately, you drove him out early.

207
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,400
Dacang values much on background.

208
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,960
He's from a poor family,

209
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:33,480
and still wanted to become a noble.

210
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,080
It's ridiculous.

211
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,160
He's lucky to polish my essays

212
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,960
for me.

213
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,800
Yet he was still not content.

214
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,720
This bunch of poor scholars

215
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,200
just don't know what is gratefulness.

216
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,480
How dare he

217
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,120
to try to get the first place
in the Hongwen School literary competition!

218
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,280
- Come on, drink.
- Come on.

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,280
Liuniang.

220
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,200
Let's go.

221
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,000
- Liuniang.
- Marshal Xu.

222
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,960
Miss Lu.

223
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:18,080
Marshal Xu, you're here
at Tongming Hall for a case?

224
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,120
It's the case

225
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,360
obtained by your husband.

226
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,360
I guess I shouldn't call you Liuniang anymore.

227
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,560
I should call you Mrs. Shen.

228
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
Marshal Xu, as always,

229
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,880
call me Liuniang.

230
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,440
Fine. Then from now on,

231
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,760
don't call me Marshal Xu anymore.

232
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,120
Call me Mr. Xu.

233
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,280
Okay, Mr. Xu.

234
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,480
After the matter of Kuang Zhanxin got out,

235
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,520
the owners of the shops

236
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,640
near the Pingkang Alley

237
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,120
act as if they are obsessed,

238
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,840
feeling like the ladies from their own shops

239
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
who have been out for a long time
and not returned

240
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,320
are missing.

241
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
There are a dozen cases already.

242
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,320
More people are missing?

243
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,560
No.

244
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
Among seventeen girls
who were reported missing,

245
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,360
fifteen have already been found.

246
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,400
And the two remaining,

247
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,280
are probably fine.

248
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
But there is one thing

249
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
I haven't decided whether to report it yet.

250
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,560
And then I met you here.

251
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,880
This records

252
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,360
[Missing Persons Case Files]
the cases of missing performers over the years.

253
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,000
Weird.

254
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,400
These performers

255
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,400
are not the most popular,

256
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:26,000
but all are well-versed in music and rhythm,

257
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,240
specializing in instrumental music

258
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,240
and skilled at playing the pipa.

259
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,520
Exactly.

260
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,880
It's just too coincidental.

261
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:33,480
That's why it feels suspicious.

262
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,120
These are the portraits of the missing women.

263
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,640
These women

264
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:53,600
all have the same flying fairy hairstyle.

265
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,000
Anything else?

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,680
Look.

267
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,080
The faces of these women

268
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,680
are different,

269
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,960
yet they all have something in common.

270
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,200
Especially in demeanor,

271
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,200
they are extremely similar.

272
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,480
Yes.

273
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,520
At first glance,

274
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:18,880
they really look similar.

275
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,600
I thought to hand these files
over to the Ministry of Justice,

276
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,440
but I don't think it's okay
to bypass the Imperial Guards.

277
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,760
Now it seems

278
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,520
it's best that you get it.

279
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,760
White Ghost surely wouldn't draw his sword
and kill his wife over this, right?

280
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,800
Then I shall take my leave first.

281
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,520
You swore oaths at dawn

282
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,240
and left.

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,080
I wonder what you were investigating.

284
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,680
So you are chatting here.

285
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,760
I am discussing the case

286
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,920
with Marshal Xu,
who commands all the inspectors

287
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,400
of the Imperial City.

288
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,520
Command all the inspectors?

289
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,960
This is impressive.

290
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,000
Back in the day, Marshal Xu

291
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,400
was a grand criminal wanted
by the imperial court

292
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,920
with a bounty of 100,000 taels.

293
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,280
So, Marshal Xu

294
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,480
is the one from the legends
who infiltrated the palace

295
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,240
and stole the Empress Dowager's jade pillow.

296
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,400
If he's that amazing,

297
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,640
he wouldn't be caught.

298
00:14:39,640 --> 00:14:42,240
Although he's caught,
the Empress Dowager appreciated his talent.

299
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,720
Not only did she not punish him,

300
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,360
but she also got rid of him as a slave.

301
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,760
It's true that he's caught.

302
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,840
That means he was outsmarted
and his skills were inferior.

303
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,920
I…

304
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,040
With someone like him,

305
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,320
what information can you get?

306
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,120
I can get the information.

307
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,560
As for my bet on the Liang family,

308
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,720
I'm about to win.

309
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,920
Every evidence now

310
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,560
indicates

311
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,760
that this is a years-long series
of serial murders.

312
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,200
Once I find the murderer,

313
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,200
the second branch of the Liang family could

314
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,600
completely clear their name.

315
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
Great Chief, the one watching
the Liang family has reported back

316
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
that the second branch was splashed with
chicken blood by those from the main branch.

317
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,800
The second madam had become even more insane.

318
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,360
Liang Sanlang went
to the Ministry of Justice to turn himself in.

319
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:25,760
And Princess of Valor wants to see you.

[Guangyue Restaurant]

321
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,720
Princess of Valor
only invites the Great Chief alone.

322
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:59,680
Princess of Valor.

323
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,200
Liang Chenyu was imprisoned.

324
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,640
This is not what the Empress Dowager wanted.

325
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:13,120
If I remember it correctly,

326
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,520
the Empress Dowager

327
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,920
did not request you

328
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,120
to thoroughly investigate this case,

329
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,960
instead, to protect
the second branch of the Liang family.

330
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,120
We don't have enough evidence yet,

331
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,472
so there is no conclusion.

332
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,680
Great Chief, you have always been meticulous.

333
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:47,920
But this time,

334
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,040
you have been slow
to follow the rules in handling affairs.

335
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,600
Don't be like your father,

336
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:58,600
who makes significant moves silently.

337
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,160
I dare not.

338
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:23,040
Princess of Valor must be
making things difficult for the Great Chief.

339
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:25,119
The Empress Dowager had given instructions
regarding this case of the Liang Mansion

340
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,440
to protect the second branch
of the Liang family.

341
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:28,040
Yet, you insist on
investigating to the very end.

342
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,400
And now, Liang Sanlang
has been put into the prison.

343
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,240
Now, how can the Great Chief explain this?

344
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,840
I will take responsibility for this case,

345
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,600
and surely give an explanation to those above.

346
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
The Empress Dowager trusts you,

347
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,640
so naturally, I also trust you.

348
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,360
But I hope you

349
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,360
don't let us down.

350

I am so grateful.

354

Great Chief.

355
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,040
Five pairs of bodies were dug up
at Ximing Temple,

356
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,560
who died the same way the other two did.

357
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,960
In that case,

358
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,920
this matter indeed has nothing to do
with the second branch of the Liang family.

359
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,880
The two before from Liang Chenzhong's case,

360
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,160
there are six pairs of men and women,

361
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,440
twelve bodies in total.

362
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,360
The murderer killed them in the same way.

363
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,680
The men had their hearts carved out,

364
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:48,760
and the women were disfigured.

365
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,880
This is not the soil of Ximing Temple.

366
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,400
These bodies

367
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,160
have been moved recently,

368
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,040
reburied anew.

369
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,080
Their face turned purple,

370
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
and flesh turned inside out.

371
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,440
But I can still tell

372
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,880
this is a young woman.

373
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,920
Can you estimate the time of death?

374
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,920
These two people

375
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,240
must have been killed the month before.

376
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,720
Around the bodies,

377
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:20,400
there are many layers
of charcoal and plant ash.

378
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,320
They must have been used to cover the smell.

379
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,480
What exactly is this fragrance?

380
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Anything weird?

381
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,400
If my master were here,

382
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,760
he could definitely tell what's in it.

383
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,800
In my opinion,

384
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:41,240
you have already learned
what your master taught you.

385
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,520
And you are no less skilled
than Pan Chi, the top detective.

386
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
Not really.

387
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,320
After my master retired,

388
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
he's traveled far and wide,

389
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:50,320
probably has almost forgotten about me.

390
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,240
This is the first pair of bodies ever dug up.

391
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,680
Their decomposition is the most severe.

392
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,120
It's hard

393
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,400
to tell the time of death.

394
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,120
It should be

395
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,360
within four to six years.

396
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,760
If the murderer is the same person,

397
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,680
that would be insane.

398
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,120
He can disembowel and heart excise,

399
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,400
must be a strong man.

400
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,600
Perhaps a butcher.

401
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,560
In my opinion,

402
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:20,240
the murderer is very likely a woman.

403
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,800
Why?

404
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,280
The position, length

405
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,600
and depth of the wounds

406
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,640
on each face of the female body

407
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,640
are almost identical.

408
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,480
And the strength used in the stabbing

409
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,120
doesn't seem to be from a man.

410
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,520
If the murderer is a woman,

411
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,880
she would have to have killed
twelve people over these years.

412
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,800
These male victims

413
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,280
were not the elderly or week.

414
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,720
They were all in their prime when they died.

415
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:46,000
Why could they possibly not resist?

416
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,160
Mr. Xu.

417
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,520
If you think it is impossible

418
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,760
because you have not seen it,

419
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,520
then many strange cases in this world

420
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,920
cannot be solved.

421
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,720
Let's go.

422
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,080
You…

423
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,680
What do you want to do?

424
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,000
Princess of Valor has already instructed

425
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,120
that the case of Ximing Temple
and the case of the Liang Mansion

426
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,160
would be merged and handled together

427
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,800
and placed under the management
of the Imperial Guards.

428
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,120
People from the Ministry of Justice

429
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,200
must not interfere any more.

430
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,400
Whatever.

431
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,880
I'm going to take you to a place.

432
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,520
Where to?

433
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,032
You…

434
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,680
The scent of White Champaca
lingers in her sleeves.

435
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:49,800
A silk robe with a ruyi pattern brocade.

436
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,160
A jade velvet flower hairpin.

437
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,880
A peony-decorated white silk fan.

438
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,720
If you have time to be in daze,

439
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
might as well think carefully

440
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,640
about how to keep your life.

441
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,480
Where exactly are we going?

442
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,544
The Ministry of Justice.

443
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,720
Put me down now.

444
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,120
We're not far from the Ministry of Justice,

445
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,880
I can walk there myself.

446
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,400
The murderer has not yet been found,

447
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,120
and Liang Sanlang is still in prison.

448
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,040
If he dies,

449
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,320
you'd die with him.

450
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,440
Great Chief Shen.

451
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,720
The bet I placed

452
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,760
has never been lost.

453
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,520
Great Chief, what

454
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,800
brings you here?

455
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
Can't I come here?

456
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,040
Great Chief, not at all.

457
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:01,080
Welcome!

458
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,440
I've come to ask you for a person

459
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,800
to assist at the Imperial Guards.

460
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,120
Great Chief, you want to transfer someone.

461
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
Easy.

462
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:10,840
Who do you want?
I'll make the arrangements immediately.

463
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,264
Her.

464
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,080
The case of the ten corpses at Ximing Temple

465
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,320
has been entirely entrusted
to the Imperial Guards.

466
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,040
The Ministry of Justice should stay out of it.

467
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:27,840
Yes.

468
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,160
Great Chief, I have many
case files unorganized.

469
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:33,920
I'm afraid I can't be transferred
to the Imperial Guards.

470
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,640
Clerk Yan, what are you talking about?

471
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,040
You have many case files unorganized.

472
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,680
Hand it over to Miss Lu.

473
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:47,000
Hurry up and go with the Great Chief.

474
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,360
If you don't come,

475
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:53,720
then this case is concluded.

476
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,720
Director Wu.

477
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:58,000
Drag those bodies outside the city

478
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,520
and bury them in some place.

479
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,680
No way.

480
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,200
- I'll go now.
- Liuniang.

481
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,920
We got it from Chen Baiyi's house.

482
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,880
I've read all the essays he has written.

483
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,280
Each piece is brilliantly written.

484
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:15,520
During these days,

485
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,720
you have worked a lot.

486
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,880
It's fine.

487
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,360
Let's watch a play in the Furong Garden.

488
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,832
Approved.

489
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,000
Be careful.

490
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,000
Great Chief.

491
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,440
The coroner has already
completed the preliminary tests.

492
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,840
Jing Lin.

493
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
If people from the Ministry of Justice are
found to be investigating this case privately,

494
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,720
shall be dealt with
as acting for personal gain.

495
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,280
Yes.

496
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,400
Then I must thank you

497
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,280
for your support and favor,

498
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,720
allowing me to get the right
to investigate this case.

499
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,840
I will surely do my best

500
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,080
to solve the case as soon as possible.

501
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,720
Glad that you know it.

502
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:55,480
Since I've been transferred
to the Imperial Guards,

503
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,840
then I'd be a member of the Imperial Guards.

504
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,200
So, I have to follow the rules
of the Imperial Guards.

505
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,760
I am just a clerk.

506
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,040
How can I ride with you

507
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:05,640
on the same horse?

508
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:10,120
I am not skilled at riding.

509
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,880
I believe Mr. Jing is compassionate
to his subordinates.

510
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,640
You certainly won't leave me behind, right?

511
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,240
Me?

512
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,480
Then today,

513
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,800
I have to ride a horse

514
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,000
with you.

515
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,040
If you wish to ride a horse,

516
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,840
would naturally be with the Great Chief.

517
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,920
As for me…

518
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,360
I will lead the horse for you.

519
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,920
It's not appropriate.

520
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,280
Let's ride a horse together.

521
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,480
When handling cases, there's no
distinction between men and women.

522
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:45,880
You can just treat me

523
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,720
as a regular colleague.

524
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,560
Madam, take your seat.

525
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,080
How much longer do you have to chitchat?

526
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,840
If you keep doing so,

527
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,200
you'll be fined six months' salary.

528
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,360
I…

529
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:01,096
Great Chief.

530
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,520
These were taken from the bodies

531
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,960
of the first victims.

532
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,160
Supervised by

533
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:23,320
the first year of the Shengli Era.

534
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:33,240
It was worn by the body
of the man who was first killed.

535
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,160
The murderer's first crime

536
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,400
should be six years ago.

537
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,816
Why?

538
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,200
The murderer killed in the same way

539
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,160
every time.

540
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,160
There must be a pattern

541
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:50,240
to the timing.

542
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,960
A very small mistake

543
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,400
makes a great difference.

544
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,920
If we are wrong,

545
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,120
then it won't be easy

546
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:58,360
to find the murderer.

547
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,960
Double Fish Pattern.

548
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,320
Jinxiu Workshop.

549
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,760
This Double Fish Pattern

550
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,720
was a specially made pattern
by Jinxiu Workshop back then.

551
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,600
It's so popular.

552
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,960
Jinxiu Workshop was

553
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,280
the largest silk square in the Imperial City,

554
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:26,640
presenting tribute silks to the palace
on the first day of every month.

555
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,640
However, in June
of the third year of the Shengli Era,

556
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,120
Jinxiu Workshop was charged
with the crime of insubordination

557
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,280
for delaying presenting Princess Runing
with summer clothes.

558
00:27:33,280 --> 00:27:34,920
Henceforth,

559
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,080
no one in the Imperial City

560
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,840
dared to wear clothes
from Jinxiu Workshop out in public.

561
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,560
This man must have died

562
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:42,840
before the insubordination case
of Jinxiu Workshop.

563
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:45,000
The gold medal was made
in the first year of the Shengli Era.

564
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,360
Then he might die in the first year

565
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,440
of the Shengli Era.

566
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,000
Impossible.

567
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,160
Double Fish Pattern

568
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,240
was the style of spring clothes

569
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,240
made by Jinxiu Workshop
in the third year of the Shengli Era.

570
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,880
It was only available
from February to April back then.

571
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,160
You remember it so clearly?

572
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,400
The case file of Jinxiu Workshop
is in the Archive.

573
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,720
There is a volume of illustrated catalogs,

574
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,760
recording the patterns
of Jinxiu Workshop over ten years.

575
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:09,720
Jing Lin, go and confirm by comparison.

576
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,560
Make no mistake.

577
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:14,120
Yes.

578
00:28:22,859 --> 00:28:25,890
[Chang'an City]

579
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,000
Madam, the Archive

580
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,600
is full of treasures and books.

581
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,104
Do not wander around

582
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:36,080
or touch anything.

583
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,240
Understood. We should split up to search.

584
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,120
- You go over there.
- Don't touch anything.

585
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,308
Collection of essays from the Hongwen School.

586
00:29:01,308 --> 00:29:03,452
[Test Paper Four]

587
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
Hurry up.

588
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,440
Hurry up. Don't drop it.

589
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,920
What on earth is going on?

590
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:14,880
Wait.

591
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,560
Wait, why are you here?

592
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:18,560
Weren't you transferred to the Imperial Guards?

593
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:19,840
I want to see Director Wu.

594
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:21,960
There's progress in the case
of Chen Baiyi's self-immolation.

595
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,320
He has already instructed

596
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,560
that no one can mention

597
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,360
the Ming Hall case again.

598
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,440
If anyone mentions it again,
he should submit the resignation.

599
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,760
There really is an inside story.

600
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,960
I want to see Director Wu.

601
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,040
Wait.

602
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,200
Didn't you see

603
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,520
the entire Ministry of Justice

604
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,680
got into trouble

605
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,880
with a nursery rhyme?

606
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,000
No one has time

607
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,280
to investigate the self-immolation case.

608
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,320
Nursery rhyme?

609
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:44,120
Don't you know it?

610
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,600
Mind your head.

611
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,440
It's spread to every household
in the Imperial City.

612
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,880
I wonder this time

613
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,640
which place will suffer.

614
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,760
Be careful. Mind the steps.

615
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,200
Ruthless people,

616
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,680
merciless Buddha,

617
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:02,560
under the sovereign, the order is in chaos.

618
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,320
Merciless Buddha hides the sin.

619
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,520
Black Fiend is coming.

620
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,176
Kid.

621
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:21,520
Do you realize what you just said

622
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,040
is truly outrageous?

623
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,880
Well,

624
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,360
how should I punish you?

625
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,680
Try this new invention.

626
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,080
Later,

627
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,880
we'll put the pot on the fire.

628
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,280
And you'll have even more fun.

629
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:46,056
Guards.

630
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,840
No, please no.

631
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,520
No, please no.

632
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,720
No, please no. He is just a kid.

633
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,400
Please spare him.

634
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,640
If one can spread such

635
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,680
outrageous words,

636
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,840
then the Imperial City

637
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:01,040
will become a place without rules.

638
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,760
- No, my lord.
- Please spare us.

639
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,760
If you do not properly educate your kid,

640
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,360
then I'll do it for you.

641
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,800
No, my lord.

642
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,760
Make way for the Princess of Valor's carriage.

643
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,640
Princess of Valor.

644
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,880
He looks somewhat familiar.

645
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,520
What is going on here?

646
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,520
Your Highness, please save my child.

647
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:41,000
Please save my child, Your Highness.

648
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,720
I've come to patrol the streets today,

649
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,600
suddenly heard a child

650
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,360
saying outrageous words,

651
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,720
so I caught him.

652
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,840
Sorry to disturb you.

653
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,160
I see.

654
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:54,640
Your Highness, please show mercy.

655
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,000
I'm sorry that my child speaks nonsense.

656
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,320
I will certainly

657
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,480
educate him well.

658
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,800
Yes, Your Highness.

659
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,920
Parents are to blame
for children's misbehavior.

660
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,520
You should be blamed.

661
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,440
Vice Minister Lai.

662
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:15,120
Everyone would make mistakes.

663
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,280
Moreover,

664
00:32:16,280 --> 00:32:18,600
he is just a kid.

665
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,920
Vice Minister Lai, you've always been kind.

666
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,120
So why would you

667
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,240
ruin your own good reputation over a child?

668
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,920
Even so…

669
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:29,680
Since I have witnessed it today,

670
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,400
it means

671
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,440
this child is destined to meet me.

672
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,600
Vice Minister Lai.

673
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,480
Could you perhaps spare this child

674
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,960
for me?

675
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,240
Since you said so,

676
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,200
I naturally have to spare him.

677
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,440
Release him.

678
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,360
- Thank you.
- As long as the child is fine.

679
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,800
- Thank you.
- You may leave.

680
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,040
Thank you, Your Highness.

681
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:08,760
Princess of Valor is truly kind and nice.

682
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,560
Princess of Valor is truly generous

683
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,560
and merciful.

684
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,640
See you.

685
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,240
Get twenty strokes of the cane for punishment.

686
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,624
Yes.

687
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:52,040
Who exactly is that woman?

688
00:33:57,818 --> 00:34:00,581
[Imperial Guards]

689
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,520
What's wrong?

690
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,840
Lai Luozhi accused

691
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,240
the Great Chief was ineffective
in investigating the case.

692
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:10,520
So the Empress Dowager issued an order
to take the Great Chief away.

693
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:15,400
You two guard the door.

694
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,960
Tell me about anything
of the Great Chief promptly.

695
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,120
Yes.

696
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,640
No entry.

697
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,679
The Great Chief has instructed
that without permission,

698
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:25,880
no one is allowed to approach the office.

699
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,136
If you…

700
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,239
If you want to break in, step over me.

701
00:34:42,592 --> 00:34:44,000
Don't flip through.

702
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,440
If you flip through, I'll show no mercy.

703
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,560
Stop flipping through.

704
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,480
If you keep flipping through,
I will take my own life.

705
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,679
If you want your Great Chief to die,

706
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,719
then do it.

707
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:59,400
Grind the ink.

708
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,864
Grind the ink.

709
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:07,720
I hope it's not too late.

710
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,508
[Great General]

711
00:35:29,102 --> 00:35:31,272
[Imperial Guards]

712
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:35,920
Her handwriting is surprisingly
similar to that of the Great Chief.

713
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,360
Are you confident that this
can really save the Great Chief?

714
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,320
I can't guarantee it,

715
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,040
but we should at least give it a try.

716
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,400
Perhaps it can avoid him
from severe punishment.

717
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,760
What are you waiting for? Hurry up!

718
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:08,960
I am waiting here.

719
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,080
Stop flipping through.

720
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,680
Empress Dowager.

721
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
The Imperial Guards
has taken over the case for several days,

722
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,200
yet they haven't solved it.

723
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,280
Now there are rumors

724
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,360
saying the imperial court
is inept at selecting officials.

725
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,280
Even worse, some speculate
about the emperor's intentions,

726
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,240
saying we intend to shield the Liang family.

727
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,400
It's a disgrace to your reputation.

728
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:37,400
Empress Dowager, please

729
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,240
allow the Imperial Inspectorate
to take over this case.

730
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,440
What you said

731
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,840
is exactly what I am concerned about.

732
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,320
Shen Du from the Imperial Guards has arrived.

733
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,280
Shen Du,
the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

734
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:08,040
Greetings to you, Empress Dowager.

735
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:10,960
May you live for long.

736
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,960
Minister Shen.

737
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,880
The case of the Liang family

738
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,480
has yet to be solved.

739
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,480
Maybe you should give me an explanation.

740
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,800
Empress Dowager,

741
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,760
the murder case of the Liang family
is not an isolated incident.

742
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,000
But it's related to multiple bodies dug up

743
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,680
in succession at Ximing Temple

744
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,120
and committed by the same murderer.

745
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,640
Based on the evidence, the Imperial Guards

746
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,200
has speeded up solving the cases.

747
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,280
The case of the Liang Mansion
involves important court officials.

748
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:36,280
And Ximing Temple is even a place
for devout Buddhist practice and worship.

749
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,960
Now with the case unresolved,

750
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,240
an offensive nursery rhyme

751
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,760
has become popular in the city.

752
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,160
Tell me about it.

753
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,600
Then I will

754
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,080
recite this nursery rhyme

755
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,800
to you.

756
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,240
Ruthless people,

757
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,320
merciless Buddha,

758
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,920
under the sovereign, the order is in chaos.

759
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,400
Merciless Buddha hides the sin.

760
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,840
Ridiculous!

761
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:07,280
Empress Dowager, please calm down.

762
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,480
I believe that the spread of this nursery rhyme

763
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,640
is all because the murder case at Ximing Temple

764
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,960
remains unresolved.

765
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:14,280
If the Imperial Guards
cannot find the murderer,

766
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,400
then we might as well

767
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,960
have an exorcism.

768
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,440
Empress Dowager, you are admired by all.
Don't mind

769
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:23,120
these reckless words.

770
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,400
Great Chief Shen.

771
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,520
You forgot this.

772
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,680
The Imperial Guards
suddenly arrived to arrest me,

773
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,400
and I was in the process
of sorting out the case,

774
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,040
wanting to present it to you.

775
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,400
In the peaceful world,
only the Buddha's heart prevails.

776
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,880
Evil thoughts through countless calamities
shall never survive.

777
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:17,320
Unraveling the threads
to cleanse the grievances.

778
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:21,080
With keen insight, the world is at peace.

779
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,040
Very well.

780
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,120
Now that you've got clues

781
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,760
about the Liang family

782
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:29,400
and Ximing Temple.

783
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,600
Then let's proceed.

784
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,680
Understood.

785
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:39,280
Minister Shen.

786
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,080
You also mentioned in your memorial

787
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,040
there is an inside story
on the Ming Hall self-immolation case.

788
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,240
The self-immolator did not
do it to vent dissatisfaction,

789
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,560
but rather used death
to express his determination

790
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,960
to me.

791
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:56,720
Is that true?

792
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:58,240
I am reviewing it

793
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,520
and will report as soon as possible.

794
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,720
Empress Dowager.

795
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,440
Alright.

796
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,760
You two

797
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,360
are both my right-hand men.

798
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,640
Each with your own merits.

799
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:18,120
Enough for today, you may all leave now.

800
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,880
Minister Shen.

801
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,600
Please stay.

802
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:35,240
I have another matter

803
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:39,840
for you to attend to immediately.

804
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,240
Understood.

805
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
Great Chief Shen.

806
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
Today, in front of the Empress Dowager,

807
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,160
you remained composed

808
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,600
and eloquent.

809
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:13,120
Truly amazing.

810
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,920
Vice Minister Lai, you flatter me.

811
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:17,760
I was merely stating the facts.

812
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,640
People say

813
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,680
the Imperial Guards

814
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,520
is the Empress Dowager's eyes.

815
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,840
But don't look

816
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,080
in the wrong direction.

817
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,760
All we do

818
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,320
are within our duties,

819
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,840
unlike the Imperial Inspectorate,

820
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,880
with fangs bared, tearing about everywhere.

821
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,360
If it were someone else,

822
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:43,120
they would probably be at their wits' end.

823
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,360
Then I hope you to solve the case soon.

824
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:55,400
There are many people

825
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,920
watching you.

826
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,778
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

827
00:42:27,778 --> 00:42:31,455
