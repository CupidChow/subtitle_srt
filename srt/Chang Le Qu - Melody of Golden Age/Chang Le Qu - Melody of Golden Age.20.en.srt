What does that mean?

41

Why isn't there anyone to interpret divination?

00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:53,680
That's not right.

43
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,280

00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,520
Well, if that's the case,

191
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,000
I will go back with you,

192
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,320
lest he fall ill because of this

193
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,360
and blame me.

194
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,360
Liuniang.

195
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,720
You're leaving?

196
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,240
Shen Du is injured.

197
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,720
I have to take care of him.

198
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,440
So block-headed.

199
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,608
See you around.

200
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,200
Fine, let her be.

201
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,040
What a bummer. Let's see the Lady Serpent.

202
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,480
Lady Serpent.

203
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,000
Excuse me.

204
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,120
Excuse me.

205
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,616
Excuse me.

206
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
Oh my God.

207
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:58,720
What a pretty Lady Serpent.

208
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,320
So beautiful.

209
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
She gave up the chance to attain immortality

210
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,960
and came to the mortal world

211
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,040
to share her cultivated elixir

212
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,920
with everyone.

213
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,120
Elixir.

214
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,760
It's called the Elixir of Beauty.

215
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,880
It gives women

216
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,120
tender and fair skin

217
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,760
and unprecedented charm.

218
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,440
Single ladies will meet their Mr. Right.

219
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
Men can also ask for some

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,560
to give to their loved ones.

221
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:26,640
The Lady Serpent

222
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,320
wishes all the couples

223
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,480
a long and happy marriage.

224
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:37,040
Lady Serpent, please bestow us
with the Elixir of Beauty.

225
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,880
Ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,560
The Elixir of Beauty is worth a fortune.

227
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:43,800
Supply is limited.

228
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:44,960
Whoever wants it

229
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,720
can get one with ten taels of gold.

230
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,480
- Tender and fair skin.
- So expensive.

231
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,920
Unprecedented charm.

232
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:53,000
Maybe there's a reason it's so expensive.

233
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,960
- That's true. Let's go.
- Let's go.

234
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,640
Alright, the Elixir of Beauty is sold out.

235
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,880
That's it?

236
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:02,920
I've come three times

237
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,000
and gotten nothing.

238
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,720
If you wish to obtain the elixir,

239
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,000
come back in three days.

240
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:09,560
Maybe next time.

241
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,008
Let's go.

242
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,400
How do you feel today?

243
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:39,920
Does the wound still hurt?

244
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,440
No.

245
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,840
Why do you look

246
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,320
so sullen?

247
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,000
Do I?

248
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,320
Why do you look beaming with joy?

249
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,360
Found someone you like?

250
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,920
But Jing Lin said…

251
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,200
It looks like you're enjoying yourself.

252
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,680
That's right, I'm fooling around
while you're away.

253
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,760
It's quite enjoyable.

254
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:22,520
[Marshal of Inspectors]

255
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,920
You went to see Xu Xiangren?

256
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,480
Yeah.

257
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,360
It just so happened. What about it?

258
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,320
It just so happened?

259
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:35,080
At the temple where people pray for romance?

260
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,080
And he gave you the marshal's token?

261
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,160
Mr. Xu gave me this as my sworn brother.

262
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:40,160
Don't be paranoid.

263
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,408
Why…

264
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:46,360
Why would I be paranoid?

265
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
Indeed.

266
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,360
You wouldn't be paranoid.

267
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,600
Once you've recovered,

268
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,200
visit Mingsheng Temple as well.

269
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,680
It works like a charm.

270
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,160
You might actually get what you wish for.

271
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,640
What would I wish for?

272
00:14:15,492 --> 00:14:17,840
[Su Guang]

273
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,920
Stop crying. What's all the fuss about?

274
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:25,880
Ma'am, my belly hurts so much.

275
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:28,840
May I come down for a bit?

276
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,560
I shouldn't have let you eat at night.

277
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,200
Be careful. Don't get the tail dirty.

278
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:37,240
- Thank you, Ma'am.
- Honey, come here.

279
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:38,840
Guard the door.

280
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:41,224
Okay.

281
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,720
What a fraud.

282
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,880
A cultivating Lady Serpent?

283
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,120
She's clearly

284
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,000
a young lady kidnapped by traffickers.

285
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:08,360
Farewell, Miss.

286
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,888
You…

287
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,560
I don't think

288
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,920
I have anything of value with me.

289
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:21,440
Perhaps, only this is worth some money.

290
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,160
Please have it.

291
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:28,040
Here, take it.

292
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,920
Why do you have the Moth Jade?

293
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,240
You're with the Huo'e Sect?

294
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,640
This isn't mine.

295
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,960
All my things were confiscated
after I got kidnapped

296
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,160
in Gannandao.

297
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,240
It's from the person who snatched me.

298
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,680
So you were snatched in Gannandao?

299
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,400
Was the trafficker

300
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,720
someone from Xiang'an?

301
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,640
Judging by his accent,

302
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:58,280
he should be a local at Gannandao.

303
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,640
The Huo'e Sect gained momentum in Xiang'an

304
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,920
in a very short time.

305
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:08,000
How did it spread to Gannandao so fast?

306
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,520
That's not right.

307
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,680
When were you kidnapped?

308
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,680
I don't remember it very well.

309
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,760
But it's been months at least.

310
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:24,120
Miss, do you remember the way back home?

311
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,920
I have a way to travel

312
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,040
between the Western Regions
and the Jinwu Tribe.

313
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:31,960
How about this? Follow me.

314
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,080
I'll help you look for

315
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,920
merchant caravans to the Western Regions.

316
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,360
Really?

317
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,760
Let's go.

318
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,200
Can you really attend the court meeting?

319
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:49,280
Your wound hasn't healed

320
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,440
so you shouldn't move.

321
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:51,840
It's just a court meeting,

322
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:54,400
not an arrest.

323
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,200
People would see you

324
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,880
as a widow if I still don't show up.

325
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,720
Be careful, then.

326
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,960
These days,

327
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,384
- be--
- Great Chief.

328
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:22,760
Great Chief. Madam.

329
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,960
An oral edict came.

330
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,240
The Empress Dowager
summoned Madam to the palace.

331
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,400
Empress Dowager,

332
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,880
this is Clerk Yan Xing.

333
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:51,360
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

334
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,920
We're alone here.

335
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,000
Spare the formalities.

336
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Please rise.

337
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,920
Shen Du has done well in the case

338
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,760
of Chen Huo'e.

339
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,760
I have not decided

340
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,840
how to reward him.

341
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,880
Tell me.

342
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,560
How should I reward him this time?

343
00:18:11,560 --> 00:18:13,080
Whatever you bestow on him

344
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:14,880
is a grace from you.

345
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,280
No matter whether there is a reward,

346
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,720
we will be deeply grateful.

347
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,960
You're still a minor official,

348
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,960
but you have learned all the cliches

349
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,960
in the officialdom.

350
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,400
Please forgive me.

351
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,360
Empress Dowager.

352
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,920
Why must you give Clerk Yan a hard time?

353
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:37,560
Great Chief Shen was already
leading the Imperial Guards

354
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,640
and he was made the Guard of the Capital.

355
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,240
He can't be promoted any further.

356
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,000
Why don't you give Clerk Yan

357
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,360
some tangible rewards?

358
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,480
You are certainly siding with her.

359
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:51,960
I just feel that

360
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:54,720
Clerk Yan's determination
to become a female official

361
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,560
reminds me of my younger self.

362
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,880
So I feel related to her.

363
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,040
If that is the case,

364
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,280
then I shall promote Clerk Yan Xing

365
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,320
to the position of Senior Clerk.

366
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,840
Empress Dowager.

367
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,040
I was going to

368
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,120
take the exam this year, anyway.

369
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:19,880
I want to take the exam on my own

370
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,440
and become a Senior Clerk.

371
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,880
Of course, you will take the exam.

372
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,400
The female officials

373
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,080
of the Six Ministries are promoted
and demoted based on ability.

374
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,160
The Empress Dowager

375
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,040
is making you the Senior Clerk

376
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,280
to present you with a greater challenge.

377
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,320
If you take the exam as a clerk,

378
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,360
you remain a clerk even if you fail

379
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,480
and become a senior clerk if you pass.

380
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:46,320
But if you take the exam as a senior clerk,

381
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,760
then you face greater risks.

382
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:49,960
If you fail,

383
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,800
you'll be dismissed.

384
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,360
But if you pass,

385
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,680
you'll have the opportunity
to be promoted to Chief Clerk.

386
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,400
Do you dare to take the risk?

387
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,600
I won't let you down, Empress Dowager,

388
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,160

389
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,800
All right.

390
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,120
Madam Xu has been right about you.

391
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:25,840
Senior Clerk Yan,

392
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,680
I'm looking forward
to your performance in the exam.

393
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:48,560
You and Shen Du are truly in love.

394
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,760
It's so enviable.

395
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,280
Actually, he…

396
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,520
Actually, he sent me a message long ago,

397
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,160
asking me to take extra care of you

398
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,600
just in case you make a mistake

399
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,680
due to nervousness.

400
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:09,840
He's probably afraid
that I would disgrace the Shen family.

401
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,104
Is that so?

402
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:14,880
I don't think so.

403
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,880
I've known him for years

404
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,320
and I've never seen him

405
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,640

I am very pleased.

And let me thank you for your trust.

411
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,960
Back then,

412
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,080
when Jing Lin gave me the memorial
on the case of Chen Huo'e,

413
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,160
I realized what you wanted.

414
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:41,000
We weren't so acquainted,

415
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,920
yet you entrusted your life

416
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,240
to me.

I trust you.

418

And I trust that Shen Du

419
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,040
wouldn't misjudge a person.

you have been nice to me.

I've heard that you're

431
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,120
marrying Mr. Han soon.

432

You're the one getting married.

I heard that

440
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,440
you didn't even like Great Chief Shen.

441
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,776
What a pity.

442
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,640

If the wedding falls through,

447
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,520

00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,200
We've asked for an imperial physician

461
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,440
during the day.

462
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,440

form a diagnosis no matter what.

464
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,040
Have you ever seen such symptoms?

465
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,360
I can't tell what this is, either.

466
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,680
But judging from her look,

467

I don't think she's ill.

I just feel it's poisoning,

No way.

She couldn't poison anyone.

I figured it out.

497
00:27:58,040 --> 00:27:59,200
I went to the Imperial Guards

498
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,240
and asked Mr. Jing to check the archives.

499
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:03,040

500
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:06,120

Can we find any former followers of the sect?

This is the tricky part.

504

Ever since Chen Huo'e died,

505
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,720
the Huo'e Sect seemed to have vanished

Even the Imperial Guards

508
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,680
had no clues in their archives.

509
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,440
How can we conduct any investigations?

510
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,920
Should we

00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,320
go to Princess Yong'an?

Since it has to do with Chen Huo'e,

then let's not mention Princess Yong'an again.

00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,520
Mother.

565
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,160
You have also seen him.

566
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:59,240
I even considered him a friend back then.

567
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,880
His mother

568
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:05,920
has probably

569
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,760
become good friends with you.

570
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:12,400
Mother.

571
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,840
He doesn't seem like a bad person
to you either, right?

572
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,232
Then…

573
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:23,800
Then what should I do?

574
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,639
Just think of me as the man in black,

575
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,536
Mr. Mask.

576
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,800
Y-You're here?

577
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,416
I've always been here.

578
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,440
V-Vice Minister Lai.

579
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:58,360
Like I said, when we're here,

580
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,280
you can go on treating me as Mr. Mask

581
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,920
and your friend.

582
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:18,120
Even the Black Fiend needs friends?

583
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,960
Perhaps it's worth trying.

584
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
That's true.

585
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,400
Even the White Ghost can get married.

586
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:31,640
Naturally, the Black Fiend

587
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:34,720
needs to make friends too.

588
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,080
However, my friends and I

589
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,840
must be equal.

590
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,000
We must help each other when needed

591
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,640
and share secrets.

592
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,480
You…

593
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,360
Why don't you go first?

594
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:49,360
I'll see.

595
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:55,480
Sharing secrets.

596
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,120
I don't really

597
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,640
have any secrets these days.

598
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,680
But

599
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:04,120
I've run out of pocket money

600
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:07,480
and dined at the Shen Mansion. Does it count?

601
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,840
Okay, my turn now.

602
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:16,480
You have a secret to share with me?

603
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,320
I know you're close

604
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,160
to Yan Xing.

605
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,640
I heard that her third sister

606
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,760
was poisoned with "Butterfly out of Cocoons".

607
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,480
And I

608
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,160
just so happen

609
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,800
to have the formula for the antidote.

610
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,840
Where did you get it?

611
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:35,360
The Imperial Inspectorate arrested

612
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:37,960
and interrogated Chen Huo'e twice.

613
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,240
You know about this.

614
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,160
I obtained the formula

615
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,920
of the antidote back then.

616
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:50,200
Why are you giving it to me?

617
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,120
I can give you the formula

618
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,680
but under one condition.

619
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:54,720
What is it?

620
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,240
Don't tell anyone it's from me.

621
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,360
Why not?

622
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,680
You're doing a good deed.

623
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,880
Why can't I tell anyone it's from you?

624
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,880
Of course, you don't have to believe me.

625
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,440
Nor does Yan Xing.

626
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,280
Firstly, I'm not sure
if the formula is authentic.

627
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,400
If it doesn't work

628
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,000
or makes things worse,

629
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,560
I take no responsibility.

630
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,200
Secondly,

631
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,360
it contains a rare ingredient,

632
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:25,520
which is the blood

633
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,280
from the heart of a mirror image person.

634
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,960
Whether you can find it

635
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:36,000
depends on Yan Sanniang's luck.

636
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:03,016
Liuniang.

637
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,040
You stayed up all night?

638
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,800
Chuichui, I can't keep you company today.

639
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:13,920
I am looking for

640
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:16,320
a life-saving formula.

641
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,800
Liuniang.

642
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,040
Take a look at this.

643
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:40,800
The antidote for "Butterfly out of Cocoons"?

644
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,840
How did you know Caiwei was poisoned?

645
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,400
Where did you get this formula from?

646
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,120
I-I got it from a friend of mine.

647
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,880
A friend?

648
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,120
Since when do you have

649
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,000
such a resourceful friend?

650
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,800
Anyway, it seems that this formula

651
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,960
comes from

652
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,120
the Imperial Inspectorate,

653
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:06,200
supposedly obtained
during the interrogation of Chen Huo'e.

654
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,960
But we don't know if it's real.

655
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,600
I don't know if it works.

656
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,032
The Imperial Inspectorate?

657
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,920
Chen Huo'e.

658
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,840
The one who makes the poison has the antidote.

659
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:21,960
Then who administrated it?

660
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,960
How did you just happen to get this?

661
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,400
I…

662
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,800
Forget about that for now.

663
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,920
Maybe you should take this formula

664
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,040
to a pharmacy

665
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,560
to discern its authenticity

666
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,880
and see if it's poisonous.

667
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,880
And even if it is real,

668
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:39,840
it needs the blood
from the heart of a mirror image person.

669
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,880
But

670
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,200
isn't Chen Huo'e the only mirror image person

671
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,520
in this world?

672
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:47,560
And wasn't she killed by your husband,

673
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,920
the White Ghost?

674
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:55,320
Yeah, Chen Huo'e is dead.

675
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,720
Where can we find

676
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,320
another mirror image person?

677
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,520
Master Chen Wen is fasting in the mountains.

678
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,600
We don't know when he'll return.

679
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,000
Clerk Yan, you should know.

680
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,240
Marshal Xu? Let alone you,

681
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:13,880
even I haven't seen them these days.

682
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:44,320
Excuse me.

683
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:47,720
Do you know where Pan Chi is?

684
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,920
You're looking for Pan?

685
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,720
He's been gone for days.

686
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,840
I heard he went with

687
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:56,200
some beauty

688
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,800
to chase the Xichen merchant caravan.

689
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,360
Young people are really absurd.

690
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,440
Your Highness.

691
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:21,320
Yan Sanniang has been poisoned.

692
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
Yan Sanniang is poisoned?

693
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,920
And I heard there is no cure.

694
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,360
It was a minor punishment as a warning.

695
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:33,840
I merely put

696
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,840
some herbs

697
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,000
that induce nightmares

698
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,160
in her tea.

699
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,280
I have consulted the imperial physicians.

700
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,280
I'm sure it's not deadly.

701
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:45,920
So someone is trying to set you up.

702
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:51,440
Yeah, that's right.

703
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,920
Yan Sanniang's life

704
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,840
is not worthy of anything.

705
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:57,320
But her father, Mr. Yan,

706
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:59,360
works for Prime Minister Zhang.

707
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:00,800
Her sister, Yan Xing,

708
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,680
is the wife of Shen Du.

709
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,960
If she dies,

710
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,560
wouldn't I be at odds with Prince Xian

711
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:11,000
and the Imperial Guards?

712
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,920
No doubt the poisoner

713
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,280
has harbored such malicious intent.

714
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:19,040
Beat him up! Harder!

715
00:42:34,391 --> 00:42:38,209
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

716
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:41,886

00:44:41,791 --> 00:44:45,944
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

749
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,648
♫ Your palm lines ♫

750
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:50,199
♫ Your gaze ♫

751
00:44:50,199 --> 00:44:52,972
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

752
00:44:52,972 --> 00:44:57,714
♫ You are the one for me ♫
