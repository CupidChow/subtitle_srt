15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,680
Just sit in and listen.

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,280
Do not cause trouble.

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,080
Or you'll be charged

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,880
with disrupting the court trial.

19
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,400
How terrifying.

20
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,000
But then again,

21
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
even if Ji Fangming is a minor official
in the Ministry of Justice,

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,280
he is still appointed

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,000
by the imperial court.

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,640
I certainly will not stand by

25
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,920
and let you force a confession.

26
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,800
Ji Fangming.

27
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,040
You may have many tricks up your sleeves,

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,320
but those are nothing but tricks.

29
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,880
What's fake is fake.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,280
Truth can't be forged.

31
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
You have been plotting for years

32
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,800
just to find out

33
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,280
the truth about the case

34
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,520
of the Jinxiu Workshop.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,720
What a pity.

36
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,960
You ended up targeting and killing

37
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,200
the wrong person for your revenge,

38
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,280
unaware that you were being used.

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,800
Clerk Yan, better save it.

40
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,520
Your attempt to lure

41
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:47,120
a confession from me is not so innovative.

42
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,600
Since you're so curious,

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:52,600
I will tell you the truth.

44
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,880
Chen Shoujie and his wife, Mrs. Chen,

45
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,880
were the instigators of that case.

46
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,680
I plotted everything
that had happened these days

47
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,720
just to avenge

48
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,800
the dozens of people
who had died from injustice

49
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,200
at the Jinxiu Workshop.

50
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,360
Why are you so certain

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,520
that you know the absolute truth?

52
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,560
Mrs. Chen used to be

53
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,320
an embroideress there.

54
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,160
Chen Shoujie took advantage of his position

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,320
to cover for her

56
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,560
by forging her background

57
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,800
and falsifying others' testimonies.

58
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:25,160
Before Kong Xianrong
delivered the summer clothing design

59
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,640
to Princess Runing's mansion,

60
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
he had checked them in person

61
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,400
and sealed them after

62
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,920
checking with the embroideresses.

63
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,040
Therefore,

64
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,720
it must have been swapped
by one of the embroideresses.

65
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:37,320
After what happened,

66
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,640
everyone at the Jinxiu Workshop

67
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,960
was put away for interrogation.

68
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,880
Only Mrs. Chen

69
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,040
got away with it.

70
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,480
Once I found out about it,

71
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:49,360
I went to sound Chen Shoujie out.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,160
Shoujie,

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,720
do you remember this?

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,912
<i>[Jinxiu Workshop]</i>

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:02,536
Jinxiu Workshop?

76
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,000
No, you can't mention it. I don't want to die.

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,800
I apologize. We apologize.

78
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,080
We don't know anything.

79
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:15,440
Every grievance has a source.

80
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,880
Please don't come to us for retribution.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,320
Honey, you must not say anything.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,280
Just because of that,

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,440
you concluded that

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,800
Chen Shoujie was the murderer?

85
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Do you know why those people

86
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,360
would be terrified by the illusions?

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,440
Because they knew

88
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
that the deceased had died unjustly

89
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,520
and might seek retaliation as vengeful spirits.

90
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,800
They felt guilty.

91
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,280
Spirits don't exist.

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,680
Even if they do,

93
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,520
they only exist in people's minds.

94
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:51,240
If you have a clear conscience,

95
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,560
why would you be afraid of them?

96
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,800
Mr. Shen, you're truly upright.

97
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,160
But not everyone

98
00:04:57,160 --> 00:05:00,320
is like you've described.

99
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,760
Some people

100
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,360
may be able to act decent

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,280
even if they have done

102
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
something shameful.

103
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
They may appear

104
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,920
just like ordinary people.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,640
So you killed Mrs. Chen.

106
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
That's right.

107
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,800
She deserved to die.

108
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,560
She was the ringleader.

109
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,280
She was the one

110
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,440
who swapped the summer clothing design.

111
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,040
Jinxiu Workshop.

112
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,800
Karma has gotten me.

113
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,360
Do you have anything to say?

114
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,760
It's time to pay my debt.

115
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,120
I killed her

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,240
to comfort the spirit
of my best friend in heaven.

117
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,200
What's wrong with that?

118
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,480
Even the most sinister criminal

119
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,920
shall be punished by the court and the law.

120
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,360
You are free to seek justice

121
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,520
by appealing the case.

122
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,760
But you can't take the law

123
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,080
into your own hands.

124
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,840
That's easy for you to say.

125
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,320
Seeking justice?

126
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:02,720
Appealing the case?

127
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,440
So many years have passed.

128
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,440
Everyone knows it was a wrongful conviction.

129
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:10,320
But who is willing to
step forward and do justice?

130
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,640
Forget about others.

131
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,360
Let's just talk about you.

132
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,520
Holding a high position,

133
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
you've won the Empress Dowager's trust.

134
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,760
Yet you have

135
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,000
let this case remain

136
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,200
buried for years.

137
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,400
In that case,

138
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
I might as well

139
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,000
deal with the real culprits.

140
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,280
So you killed Mrs. Chen

141
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:37,360
and spared Chen Shoujie,

142
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
who lost his senses due to the shock,

143
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,960
not for the sake of the old days,

144
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,080
but to torture him alive, right?

145
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,960
That's right.

146
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,360
Mrs. Chen was the instigator

147
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,960
and deserved to die.

148
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,600
As for Chen Shoujie,

149
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,920
I didn't kill him

150
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:57,360
not because I didn't want to.

151
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
He covered for the culprit.

152
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,880
An easy death wouldn't serve him right.

153
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
It suddenly

154
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,760
occurred to me that I could

155
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:11,280
torture him to death

156
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,680
for him to experience

157
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,720
the helplessness

158
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,240
and despair we had experienced

159
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,760
when we lost our family and friends back then.

160
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,280
Xianrong.

161
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,360
I have finally

162
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,720
done you justice.

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
<i>[The moths flying to the flame. Born in the morning,
dead by evening. Not entering the cycle of death.]</i>

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,680
Those people should be

165
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
condemned to

166
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
never enter samsara.

167
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,480
But now,

168
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:36,520
he's lost it.

169
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,600
Yet you

170
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,760
still believe that he is innocent.

171
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,440
You just won't accept the fact

172
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,400
that the deceased were wrongfully accused.

173
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,400
So you are guilty as well.

174
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,000
You should pay the price for this.

175
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:58,160
- What Huo'e?
- Huo'e…

176
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,760
I found the fabric of the Jinxiu Workshop

177
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,040
at Chen Shoujie's mansion.

178
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,120
If they were

179
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,320
the real culprits,

180
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,040
why would they carefully preserve something

181
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:34,280
that constantly reminded them of their sin?

182
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,120
No way.

183
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,480
Perhaps, you're not the only one

184
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:43,120
feeling helpless and anguished

185
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,200
after the incident.

186
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,840
I can't be wrong.

187
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,240
There's no way I'm wrong.

188
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,800
Perhaps you were blinded by revenge

189
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,760
and didn't realize that

190
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,440
Mrs. Chen kept staring
at the hidden compartment

191
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,480
on the roof beam

192
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,520
where she had hidden the cloth until she died.

193
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,480
Perhaps she wanted to talk

194
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,960
but she never got the chance.

195
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,600
It's all my fault.

196
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,160
It's all my fault.

197
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,840
I shouldn't have

198
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,400
concealed the truth for years.

199
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,080
I didn't want to die.

200
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,120
I have harmed so many people

201
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,760
to protect my family.

202
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,640
I deserve to die.

203
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,320
No one can wrap fire in paper.

204
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:48,840
The truth is about to

205
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,040
come to light.

206
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,200
Xianrong.

207
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,640
I owe you an apology.

208
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,400
I was coerced to close the case

209
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,720
in such a hurry

210
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,400
because I was afraid of death.

211
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,800
I didn't expect…

212
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,360
I didn't expect…

213
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,720
Coerced?

214
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,960
By whom?

215
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,000
Tell me now.

216
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,760
What's the point of confessing now?

217
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,560
So many people have

218
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,800
suffered injustice and couldn't find peace.

219
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,160
You covered up the truth

220
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,400
because the real culprit intimated you.

221
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,640
Can you bring back

222
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,040
the deceased even if you confess now?

223
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,880
Who coerced you?

224
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,120
Huo'e…

225
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,640
Chen Huo'e.

226
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,840
Chen Huo'e.

227
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:42,000
Chen Huo'e again?

228
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,080
No way, I didn't kill the wrong person.

229
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,920
Mrs. Chen was the culprit.

230
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,320
She wouldn't have lied to me.

231
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,080
Who instructed you to lead Yan Xing

232
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:09,600
to the Mingsheng Temple?

233
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,720
They used me for real.

234
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,200
They used me for real.

235
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,760
People laugh at

236
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,800
the moths flying to the flame.

237
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,160
But no one knows that

238
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:33,680
mayflies live at dawn and die at dusk,

239
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,800
not entering the cycle of death,

240
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
while moths survive the fire

241
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,880
and await reincarnation.

242
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:40,480
Ji Fangming, wake up.

243
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,440
Kong Xianrong never stopped
proclaiming his innocence.

244
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,160
All he wanted was justice

245
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,040
and the truth.

246
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:50,880
But you were blinded by hatred

247
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:53,440
and were incited to kill the innocent.

248
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
How are you any different from those who

249
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,680
framed the Jinxiu Workshop?

250
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,080
There's solid evidence,

251
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,200
yet you are still spreading rumors.

252
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,440
Great Chief Shen.

253
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,560
Don't you want to know

254
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,160
who the other culprits are

255
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,080
as Chen Huo'e told me

256
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,400
after she got resurrected?

257
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,800
The real culprit is

258
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,680
the Princess of Valor.

259
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:31,720
The Princess of Valor

260
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,880
had been jealous

261
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,640
of Princess Runing for years.

262
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,720
Thus, she used

263
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,160
the Jinxiu Workshop to frame her.

264
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,280
Shut your mouth.

265
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,400
Apart from her,

266
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,880
Prince Xian was also involved.

267
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
He wouldn't settle for less

268
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,080
than the Princess of Valor

269
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,440
and craved power.

270
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
And the Empress Dowager.

271
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,760
They are all murderers.

272
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,240
You…

273
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,200
You're all murderers.

274
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,360
You're making a fuss

275
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,400
by framing the royal family

276
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:01,040
and slandering the Empress Dowager

277
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,040
just to get a retrial.

278
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,520
Great Chief Shen.

279
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,080
This is a serious matter.

280
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,840
A retrial may have implications.

281
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,720
Do not bring trouble upon yourself.

282
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,040
Just ignore

283
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,360
this madman's ravings.

284
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,400
Wu Taiming, you despicable being!

285
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,280
I am not crazy.

286
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,680
I am more awake

287
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
than ever.

288
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,920
I mean everything I say.

289
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:29,200
Great Chief Shen, I wonder

290
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,640
if you dare to report what I said

291
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,880
to the Empress Dowager

292
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,000
without missing a single word.

293
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,440
You're really wishing

294
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,760
for the death penalty.

295
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,920
If I can console

296
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,000
those lost souls and spirits

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,200
by sacrificing myself,

298
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,016
then it is worth it.

299
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:06,920
In that case,

300
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,080
I shall do as you wish.

301
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,120
I will report

302
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,320
what happened today

303
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,440
to the Empress Dowager.

304
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:22,400
Vice Minister Lai, what do you think?

305
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,240
You are the chief judge.

306
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,640
The Imperial Inspectorate

307
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:26,640
is merely sitting in

308
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,720
on the murder case of Mrs. Chen.

309
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,600
The final ruling

310
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,400
is up to you, Great Chief.

311
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,800
One acts indifferently.

312
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,680
The other is as sly as a fox.

313
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,840
They make sure they stay out of the matter.

314
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,400
I, Ji Fangming,

315
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,080
appreciate your effort
on behalf of the wronged souls,

316
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,840
Great Chief Shen.

317
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,720
I truly admire you

318
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,920
for your intelligence

319
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,520
and courage, Clerk Yan.

320
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,800
I wonder if you're interested

321
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920
in joining the Imperial Inspectorate.

322
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,160
I'm in dire need of a capable assistant

323
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:15,400
like you.

324
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,560
Mr. Wu,

325
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,000
you won't be so petty

326
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,000
as to hold on to a talent, right?

327
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,920
Please don't make fun of me, my lord.

328
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,800
Yan Xing may be working
for the Ministry of Justice,

329
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,760
but she is also Great Chief Shen's wife.

330
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,160
You surely don't

331
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:39,160
intend to take my person away

332
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,360
in my presence, right?

333
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:46,000
What an accusation.

334
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,680
It seems I have been rash and inconsiderate.

335
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:52,040
I simply wished to
recruit some talents under my wing.

336
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,600
Please don't be paranoid.

337
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,000
Paranoid?

338
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,040
After all these years,

339
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,920
you're still an expert in

340
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,600
making countercharges.

341
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,080
Matters of the officialdom

342
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,000
should not involve family.

343
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,400
Given your way of handling things,

344
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,440
I'm afraid that Clerk Yan wouldn't enjoy

345
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,520
solving cases with you all day long.

346
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,600
Besides,

347
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,080
a fine bird chooses the tree

348
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,800
upon which to perch.

349
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,880
You shouldn't hinder

350
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:23,840
those who have a promising future, right?

351
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,400
I'm quite content

352
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,400
with this tree.

353
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,520
I am a lazy person

354
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,800
who enjoys a leisurely life.

355
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,560
I don't intend to work somewhere else yet.

356
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,800
Mr. Lai, thank you

357
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,880
for your recognition.

358
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,320
In that case,

359
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,920
I'll wait and see

360
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:57,200
how great the tree

361
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,560
you've chosen can be.

362
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,960
People say that

363
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,680
although a couple
were birds from the same forest,

364
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,599
they'd fly in separate directions in adversity.

365
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:22,480
Mr. Wu, what do you think?

366
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,640
Well… I am dull-witted.

367
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,839
Cheesy love affairs

368
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,840
are unfathomable to me.

369
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,600
"Cheesy love affairs." Well said.

370
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,640
Interesting.

371
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:46,400
<i>It's a serious matter.</i>

372
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,240
<i>A retrial may have implications.</i>

373
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:51,400
<i>Do not bring trouble upon yourself.</i>

374
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>The final ruling</i>

375
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,040
<i>is up to you, Great Chief.</i>

376
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,800
What are you thinking? Why are you absorbed?

377
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,200
I'm so tired.

378
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,960
I need to rest now.

379
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,400
Is something wrong?

380
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,400
Yun Que seems

381
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,920
particularly concerned
about this interrogation.

382
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,000
She's after the case

383
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,680
of the Jinxiu Workshop all along.

384
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:46,960
Now,

385
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,600
she can no longer hold back.

386
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:53,880
So you kept her in the mansion

387
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,000
just to find out

388
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,360
whether she showed up out of a coincidence

389
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,520
or if someone was fanning the flames.

390
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,200
Jing Lin has looked into her.

391
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,680
She doesn't know much about the matter.

392
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:05,760
However…

393
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:06,760
However what?

394
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,040
However, her parents

395
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,520
had quite some business dealings

396
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,160
with the Jinxiu Workshop.

397
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,320
But they were not implicated.

398
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,640
If they hid the evidence to protect themselves,

399
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,080
then why did she
steal the evidence to seek justice

400
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,600
after Chen Huo'e showed up?

401
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,800
Isn't it too much of a coincidence?

402
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,120
If that's the case,

403
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,160
why don't you ask them directly?

404
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,120
It's not time yet.

405
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,320
And I'm afraid it won't be easy

406
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,800
to keep them alive to testify.

407
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,320
We are in the light,

408
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,360
the enemy in the dark.

409
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:46,360
Just leave it to me.

410
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:49,680
But the old case involves multiple parties.

411
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:51,400
Even Wu Taiming and Lai Luozhi

412
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,880
were desperate to stay out of it.

413
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,400
It seems that the truth

414
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,280
might be much darker

415
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,520
than I expected.

416
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,880
What a surprise.

417
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,920
The fearless Yan Liuniang

418
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,160
can be afraid.

419
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,360
Are you really

420
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:13,040
going to convey Ji Fangming's
dangerous statements

421
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,680
to the Empress Dowager?

422
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,200
I promised someone

423
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,800
to get to the bottom

424
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:20,760
of this old case in person.

425
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,464
Someone?

426
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:28,600
It can't be Princess Runing…

427
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,640
Fearlessness comes from ignorance.

428
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,680
Deep fear derives from knowledge.

429
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,160
Now I see

430
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,920
the gap between us.

431
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,880
You knew this day would come,

432
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:42,840
yet you remained so calm and composed.

433
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,680
You don't sound like yourself.

434
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,880
Usually, you'd jump into action the moment

435
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,720
you heard about wrongful convictions.

436
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,160
And no one could stop you.

437
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,480
Of course.

438
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,640
Stand against injustice

439
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:54,720
to serve justice.

440
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,160
That's our job as officials

441
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:58,880
who get paid by the imperial court.

442
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:04,160
But I'm also aware of

443
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,040
the consequences of reopening

444
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,320
the Jinxiu Workshop case.

445
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,600
With nothing but
Ji Fangming's accusation, I'm afraid…

446
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,744
You have improved.

447
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,800
That wrongful conviction

448
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,120
caused a sensation

449
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,160
and traumatized

450
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,200
many commoners.

451
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,840
If we retry the case,

452
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,200
the shadows will fall upon

453
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,400
all of us again.

454
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,520
No one will be able to avoid it.

455
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,280
That's right.

456
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,640
They wanted to use Ji Fangming

457
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,920
to bring attention

458
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,760
to the old case

459
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,400
and lead the people

460
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,600
to doubt the royal family.

461
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,880
Ji Fangming must have realized

462
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,160
that he was being used

463
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,800
but he had no choice.

464
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,800
How pitiful.

465
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:58,408
And tragic.

466
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,000
How confident are you

467
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,160
about the retrial?

468
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,760
That's why I am worried.

469
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,840
It's been so many years.

470
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,680
The Empress Dowager may not allow a retrial

471
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,520
if you bring it up suddenly.

472
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,560
Besides, what if she takes it on you…

473
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,000
So, you've been worried since you

474
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,160
left the Ministry of Justice

475
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:23,400
because of me?

476
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:31,520
I'm not worried about you.

477
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,040
I'm worried you'll get me involved.

478
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,040
Anyway,

479
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,080
I am known as

480
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,240
Mrs. Shen at the moment.

481
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,600
And I have to think about

482
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,840
all these people in our household.

483
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,200
Everyone holds a position.

484
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,800
The wronged people
want the old case to be reviewed.

485
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,520
And the Empress Dowager wants

486
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,160
nothing but peace and happiness

487
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:52,200
for the people.

488
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,560
But what about you?

489
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,880
Don't worry about me.

490
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,480
I have this under control.

491
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,800
I said I'm not worried about you.

492
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:19,840
Then I'll leave the one

493
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:22,240
at home to you, honey.

494
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,600
Since you know she is trouble,

495
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,600
why do you still keep her around?

496
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:32,120
She may have key evidence on her.

497
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,520
Is that your explanation?

498
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:37,280
White Ghost is truly cold and callous.

499
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,760
You only cause people trouble.

500
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,520
Jing Lin,

501
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,360
keep an eye on Yun Que.

502
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,680
If you find a chance,

503
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,840
check and see if she's still hiding

504
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,400
something about the case.

505
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,192
Understood.

506
00:24:09,567 --> 00:24:12,174
<i>[Guangyue Restaurant]</i>

507
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,480
Abduct someone for me.

508
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:35,040
It's not a real abduction.

509
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,360
I just need you to make a trip to Jiangnan

510
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,160
and bring the person safely here.

511
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,520
Jiangnan?

512
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,000
I remember that Yun Que

513
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,560
who wants to take your place as Mrs. Shen

514
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,960
is from Jiangnan, right?

515
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,400
Don't tell me you're jealous

516
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,520
and want to…

517
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,480
Please.

518
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960
Talented Young Master Pan.

519
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,640
Master Pan. Pan Chi.

520
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,520
Only you can help me with this.

521
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:05,200
Please.

522
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,400
It's not such a big deal.

523
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,440
However,

524
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:09,760
it's a bit of legwork.

525
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,880
Rest assured.

526
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,000
Once you return,

527
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,480
I will definitely treat you to a feast

528
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,360
and buy you top-quality alcohol.

529
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,040
Besides, I can tell that

530
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,960
you're no ordinary merchant.

531
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,080
But I swear I won't expose you.

532
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
Are you threatening me?

533
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,040
Of course not.

534
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,800
How would I dare?

535
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,960
After all, we are

536
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,920
good friends who help each other out.

537
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,080
Just friends?

538
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,480
What did you say?

539
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Nothing.

540
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:41,800
Then I'll be waiting for the feast.

541
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,720
Right.

542
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,760
Take this with you. It's on the way.

543
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,560
What is this?

544
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,280
A list of the people

545
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:53,800
killed by Chen Huo'e.

546
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,240
You…

547
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,040
The crossed-out ones are the names

548
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
of the victims who were murdered

549
00:25:58,880 --> 00:25:59,920
near Xiang'an.

550
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,080
You'll pass by a few on the way

551
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,760
so you can inquire about

552
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,840
the deceased.

553
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,480
It's so hard to

554
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,920
get a treat from you.

555
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,960
Right.

556
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,800
Take this.

557
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:17,560
I just obtained it.

558
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,440
Why are you giving me a fan?

559
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,120
Is there something fancy?

560
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,800
Be careful now.

561
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,040
It has a mechanism.

562
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,080
The fan handle is hollow.

563
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,960
You can put powder in it.

564
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,160
With a little sprinkle,

565
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,680
you can disperse the powder

566
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:33,000
without anyone noticing.

567
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,120
The fan handle is hollow.

568
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,240
Is this for poisoning?

569
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,840
That's not exactly the case.

570
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,160
How you use

571
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:44,480
a hidden weapon is up to you.

572
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:49,320
You're giving me such a rare item?

573
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:52,280
Don't tell me…

574
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,840
Don't tell me…

575
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,360
Don't tell me you're forcing me to buy it.

576
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:00,640
Just take it for now.

577
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,560
You can pay me if you find it useful.

578
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,600
So you are indeed forcing me to buy it.

579
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,560
Is there poison in it?

580
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,800
It can't kill anyone.

581
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,840
But it can easily

582
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,080
take down a cow.

583
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,920
Have you heard?

584
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,080
- Another miracle at the Jinxiu Workshop ruins.
- Really?

585
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,000
Swarms of moths fluttered against the wall.

586
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,440
Blood formed words.

587
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,480
Even the moths are crying out
for justice for the deceased.

588
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,000
These moths are sinister.

589
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:29,160
They're taking revenge on the real culprits.

590
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,880
It's been so many years.

591
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,480
Why is it happening so suddenly?

592
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,920
Haven't you heard?

593
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,560
Someone else has died

594
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:37,600
because of that case.

595
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,360
Everyone is deeply concerned.

596
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:42,720
It must have been a wrong conviction.

597
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
Too many people died tragically,

598
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,400
unable to be vindicated.

599
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,920
That's why they lingered here.

600
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:50,040
Surely they won't just go after anyone, right?

601
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,800
We are innocent.

602
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,920
It's said that only by reopening the case

603
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,000
and doing justice

604
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,480
can these wronged spirits rest in peace.

605
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,435
<i>[Prudence and Magnanimity]</i>

606
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,200
Why aren't you eating?

607
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,560
The noodles are getting smushy.

608
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,120
You came back so late.

609
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,840
I bet you've eaten outside.

610
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,080
Of course.

611
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,560
I don't mind working hard but I can't starve.

612
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,080
I have done so much

613
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,720
in the past few days.

614
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,920
I'm exhausted.

615
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,576
Dig in.

616
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,440
You know what?

617
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,200
I visited the Jinxiu Workshop at night

618
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,800
and as expected,
I saw something like a ghost fire

619
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:44,480
floating midair.

620
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,320
There was something drifting,

621
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,440
but I couldn't see it clearly.

622
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,960
That must be the ghostly shadow mentioned by

623
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,440
the people.

624
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,240
On the way back, I saw

625
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,680
each and every household

626
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:59,480
next to the Jinxiu Workshop

627
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:02,400
having this hung above the entrance.

628
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,560
The Moth Jade.

629
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,840
You went there alone at night?

630
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,720
Didn't you find it creepy?

631
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,880
Those rumors are fabricated.

632
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,200
They're obviously made up

633
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,760
by Chen Huo'e who supposedly

634
00:29:22,760 --> 00:29:24,840
came back to life.

635
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,120
But I did see ghost fires

636
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,040
quite often in the cemeteries during summer.

637
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,840
My master once told me

638
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,880
that it happened because

639
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,520
something imperceptible arising from

640
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,600
the decomposing corpses

641
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,080
was ignited in the dry air.

642
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,880
The ghostly shadows must have been

643
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,160
created in a similar way.

644
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:43,640
It's just the shadow of

645
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,480
a fast-moving black bird or beast.

646
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,440
I knew it.

647
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,720
You know everything.

648
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
Did you plan this?

649
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:57,080
The Jinxiu Workshop

650
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,200
should be guarded by the Imperial Guards.

651
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,600
But this afternoon,

652
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,440
when the moths smashed themselves

653
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,320
onto the wall "miraculously",

654
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:07,240
the guards did not disperse the crowd.

655
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,720
Jing Lin was there,

656
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,560
but he just watched from a distance.

657
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,440
So what?

658
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,600
The Imperial Guards have a lot to investigate.

659
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,640
Ji Fangming has been arrested.

660
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,120
I don't need to bother.

661
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,160
Aren't you waiting?

662
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,520
For what?

663
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,040
For a trend

664
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,080
that can help you reopen

665
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,840
the Jinxiu Workshop case.

666
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:50,200
You went out for a bit

667
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,720
and brought something back.

668
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:55,400
Be careful.

669
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,840
Don't play with it.

670
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,200
Don't do that.

671
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,320
So nervous.

672
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,080
Who gave it to you?

673
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,720
I haven't paid for this fan yet.

674
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,440
Don't break it.

675
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,904
Really?

676
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,520
Why are you

677
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,080
acting weird these days?

678
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,760
Am I?

679
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,536
Yes, you are.

680
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,160
If I forget to prepare
the medicinal meal in time,

681
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,280
find something to eat.

682
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,720
Don't starve.

683
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:50,560
And you're not allowed to just talk nonsense

684
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,120
out of nowhere

685
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,640
and then assume a frightening pose.

686
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:57,240
And you're not allowed to suddenly…

687
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:05,224
Suddenly what?

688
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:09,560
Suddenly…

689
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:20,600
You're not allowed to waste food.

690
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:28,072
Fine.

691
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:31,400
I won't.

692
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,120
But you must not

693
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,560
do something dangerous
like visiting the Jinxiu Workshop

694
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,720
at night again.

695
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,960
Luckily, I had someone

696
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,440
on guard there tonight.

697
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,280
Otherwise, you could have been in grave danger.

698
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,160
Just this once. Don't do this again.

699
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,000
<i>What's going on?</i>

700
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,040
<i>I feel so dizzy.</i>

701
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:07,600
<i>No way, Pan Chi.</i>

702
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,840
<i>You're giving such a hard time.</i>

703
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,560
Yan Xing.

704
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:17,840
Take down a cow.

705
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,032
What…

706
00:33:52,727 --> 00:33:58,041
<i>♫ Endless long night, the moonlight reflects

00:36:56,812 --> 00:37:00,536
<i>♫ Waiting from youth till hair turns gray ♫</i>

751
00:37:00,536 --> 00:37:03,427
<i>♫ In this life ♫</i>

752
00:37:03,427 --> 00:37:09,685
<i>♫ Just keep you in my heart ♫</i>

753
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,040
Let her sleep.

754
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,000
Don't wake her up.

755
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,624
Understood.

756
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,840
Ji Fangming is outrageous.

757
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,440
He has failed to fulfill his duty

758
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,960
to the imperial court.

759
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,160
He even dares

760
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,800
to slander Prince Xian
and the Princess of Valor

761
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,640
with the old case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

762
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,440
He deserves to die.

763
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,760
Empress Dowager.

764
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
Ji Fangming surely deserves to die.

765
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,720
But he was definitely

766
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,200
instigated by someone.

767
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,640
They used his obsession

768
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,680
to spread rumors.

769
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,640
Who did it?

770
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,720
The serial killer

771
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,720
who committed suicide

772
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,360
upon her arrest five years ago.

773
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:23,560
Chen Huo'e.

774
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:24,960
What?

775
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,480
A person who has died

776
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,800
can still stir up trouble

777
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,320
in Xiang'an City?

778
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,560
I remember

779
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,000
you investigated

780
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
this case in person, Lai Luozhi.

781
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,960
What exactly happened?

782
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,400
Empress Dowager.

783
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,600
The case of Chen Huo'e

784
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,080
caused panic among the people.

785
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:50,040
Therefore, I executed her in public

786
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,800
after I arrested her.

787
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,560
Half of the Xiang'an citizens were there

788
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,640
and they saw Chen Huo'e

789
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,200
taking her own life.

790
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,600
Her corpse was thrown

791
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:01,240
into the mass grave under people's watch.

792
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,360
It's just…

793
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,680
Just what?

794
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:06,360
It's just that she had said crazy things

795
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,200
about coming back to life.

796
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,360
So you're saying that

797
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,600
she has truly come back to life.

798
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,880
Recently,

799
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:17,960
rumors have it that

800
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:19,320
Chen Huo'e has appeared.

801
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,680
And some followers are convinced

802
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,960
that she was Chen Huo'e

803
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,720
who had killed herself five years ago.

804
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,280
But in my humble opinion,

805
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
someone has been

806
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,800
using this to cause trouble

807
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,000
and bewitch people.

808
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:32,920
My ministers.

809
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,320
Chen Huo'e fabricated miracles

810
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:36,760
to make the people suspect

811
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:39,400
that the people of the Jinxiu Workshop
suffered injustice.

812
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,480
The Imperial Guards

813
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,120
asked for permission
to retry the cases of Chen Huo'e

814
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,400
and the Jinxiu Workshop.

815
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,840
Gentlemen, what are your opinions?

816
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:52,440
Your Majesty loves the people.

817
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,720
Now that Great Chief Shen

818
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:56,120
intends to retry this case,

819
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,880
I don't see a problem here.

820
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,600
Vice Minister Lai, what do you think?

821
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,560
In my humble opinion,

822
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,240
the case must have been suddenly brought up

823
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,080
for a reason.

824
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,240
But I dare not speculate

825
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:15,360
if the case would disturb

826
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,600
the peace of Xiang'an City.

827
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,680
Empress Dowager,

828
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,720
I reviewed the previous files

829
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,040
and realized

830
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,720
many unresolved mysteries.

831
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,440
You have always been caring

832
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,800
for the people.

833
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,920
I know it's a tricky issue

834
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,320
but I dare not withhold the truth.

835
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,760
Mother Empress, in my humble opinion,

836
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,280
Great Chief Shen is right.

837
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,760
If we can unravel the truth

838
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,040
and bring peace to the people,

839
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:43,160
you'll surely be pleased.

840
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,520
That's also a way to show

841
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,320
your determination to

842
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,400
free people from worries.

843
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,440
"Free people from worries." Well said.

844
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:52,640
Minister Shen.

845
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,920
I will entrust this case

846
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,960
solely to you.

847
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,680
You must get to the bottom of it.

848
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,800
Understood.

849
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,760
Please rest assured, Empress Dowager.

850
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,080
I'll arrest the culprit as soon as possible.

851
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,000
What do you think

852
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,080
about the retrial?

853
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,280
What happened back then

854
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:14,680
caused panic among the people.

855
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,080
I shall take my leave.

856
00:41:28,442 --> 00:41:32,320
You never interfere
too much with court affairs.

857
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,680
But you attracted unwanted attention this time.

858
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,120
Sir.

859
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,280
I didn't think so much.

860
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,720
I just want to see

861
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,280
what Shen Du would do.

862
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,400
Back then, when Princess Runing

863
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:48,000
was punished for the clothing design,

864
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
some people suspected

865
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,840
that it was the work

866
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:52,040
of the Princess of Valor.

867
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:53,680
Now that the case will be retried,

868
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,760
if it turns out to be

869
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,240
related to the Prince of Valor,

870
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,280
then it would be great news for us.

871
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,680
We can use them

872
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,520
to eliminate adversaries.

873
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,000
You got me wrong.

874
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I only want to find out

875
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,400
what happened back then.
