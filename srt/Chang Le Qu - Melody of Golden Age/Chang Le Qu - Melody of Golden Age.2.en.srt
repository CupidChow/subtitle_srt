00:01:41,216 --> 00:01:42,440
[Shen Mansion]

16
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,560
My lord.

17
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
Empress Dowager bestowed you the marriage.

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,880
Should we make some preparation?

19
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,160
Mr. Zhong, you don't take any action.

20
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:50,360
With me here,

21
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:51,360
she won't be able to enter the mansion.

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,720
It's that trick of yours again?

23
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,120
To throw human head and darts

24
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,080
to scare her away.

25
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,880
This time it's the Empress Dowager
who bestowed the marriage.

26
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,280
Could it be…?

27
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,280
So what?

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:05,120
As always, we'll scare her away.

29
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,840
Prime Minister Zhang, well…

30
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
Alright.

31
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,440
Stop it.

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,800
Just do as I said.

33
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:26,720
Mr. Yan.

34
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,000
You are wise.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,040
I believe you won't

36
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,360
let me down.

37
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,520
Rest assured, Prime Minister Zhang.

38
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,584
Shut the gate.

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,960
Honey.

40
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,040
Prime Minister Zhang has come in person.

41
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
What's the matter?

42
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
Shen Du in the imperial court

43
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,440
never involves himself in factions.

44
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,720
Especially in the competition
between Prince Xian and Princess of Valor,

45
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,160
he's been always neutral.

46
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:59,920
Prime Minister Zhang
is the Prince Xian's strategist.

47
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,320
Sanniang was chosen this time,

48
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:03,920
surely not just for her talents.

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,080
Does he want Caiwei to be a spy?

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,160
Keep your voice down.

51
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,360
No way. I can't let Caiwei marry to him.

52
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,600
Just now, Prime Minister Zhang
mentioned to me again

53
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,520
about the matter
of the Six Ministries' reselection.

54
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,760
If Sanniang does not marry,

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,440
I will be sent to defend the frontier desert
in the official selection.

56
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,360
And our whole family must move.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,960
Prime Minister Zhang threatened father
with exile of the whole family to the desert.

58
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,920
Master, Madam, something's wrong.

59
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:28,880
Sanniang has run away,

60
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,760
said to elope with a scholar named Han Shiyuan.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,240
[Hoping father approves of us to be together.]

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:38,760
- What a rebellious girl!
- Master.

63
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,080
- Honey
- Father.

64
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,280
- Master.
- Honey

65
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,592
Father.

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,040
Why are all of you looking at me?

67
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,160
Have you found Sanniang?

68
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,560
If not, hurry up and go look for her.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,080
Even it means to go through Xiang'an,

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,120
you must find my disobedient girl
and bring her back to me.

71
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,560
Go look for her carefully.

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:15,080
Hurry up.

73
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,224
Wait.

74
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,720
Keep it a secret.

75
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,880
Don't let others know

76
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:23,040
Sanniang is missing.

77
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,960
Right. Don't let anyone know
Sanniang is missing.

78
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Just say

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,480
that Liuniang's rabbit is lost.

80
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,744
Yes.

81
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,800
Liuniang.

82
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,440
You often move around outside,

83
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,600
so are quite familiar with the area.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,800
And you have a good relationship with Caiwei.

85
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,880
Go look for her together.

86
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:47,840
Okay.

87
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,600
Then I'll go to look for the rabbit.

88
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,008
Okay.

89
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,120
Yan Liuniang.

90
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,520
Are you ladies of the Yan family
not allowed to go home?

91
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,120
Why are you hanging out all day?

92
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Great Chief, please move.

93
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,240
My rabbit is lost.

94
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,680
I need to go look for it.

95
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,440
Really?

96
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,560
So your rabbit is lost.

97
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,760
The gate of Yan Mansion

98
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,760
has been shut all day today.

99
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:09,440
I thought you were busily
preparing for the wedding.

100
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,080
So you were just looking for a rabbit.

101
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,960
Great Chief, if you finish talking,

102
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,200
I will keep looking for it.

103
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,920
I wish you could find it.

104
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Tomorrow is the wedding

105
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,840
between me and your third sister.

106
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,200
At that time,

107
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,240
I am very much looking forward to seeing you

108
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:32,400
coming to the wedding with the rabbit.

109
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,960
Great Chief.

110
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:47,000
May I ask you

111
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,320
a favor?

112
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,824
Ask me a favor?

113
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,480
Except for the prisoners in the cell
who want to die,

114
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:57,400
in the entire Dacang,

115
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm afraid there's no other one

116
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,840
who wants to ask me for a favor.

117
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:06,120
Great Chief, please
break the engagement with my third sister.

118
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,040
Do you know what you're saying?

119
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,720
Yes.

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
Great Chief.

121
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,600
Please cancel the engagement
with my third sister.

122
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,000
Although you have no official rank,

123
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,520
at least you're a literate clerk.

124
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,760
Don't you know

125
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,200
what it means?

126
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,240
The Empress Dowager bestowed this wedding.

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,720
There's no way to cancel it.

128
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,080
The Empress Dowager

129
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,280
values you much,

130
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,720
so she wants to give you

131
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,960
a good match.

132
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
Yes.

133
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,680
The Empress Dowager has meticulously selected,

134
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,720
and Prime Minister Zhang has guaranteed it.

135
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,240
I believe I will be a good match

136
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,680
with your third sister.

137
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,760
That's the Empress Dowager

138
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,920
not knowing what the ladies

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,720
of the Yan family are like.

140
00:08:57,720 --> 00:08:59,080
Seeing how rude and disrespectful I am,

141
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,240
you should know

142
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:01,880
my third sister and you

143
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:04,240
will definitely not be a good match.

144
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,120
Are you saying

145
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,000
your third sister's talents are all fake?

146
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
Deceiving the world to steal fame

147
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,480
is a crime against the sovereign.

148
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,680
I…

149
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,920
I'm talking about me.

150
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,920
You indeed are rude and disrespectful.

151
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,440
But I'm not marrying you.

152
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,240
It's a pity

153
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,320
that your third sister

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,760
has such a rude and disrespectful sister
like you.

155
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,120
But you've never met my third sister.

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Aren't you afraid

157
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,560
that the two of you

158
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,440
will not fall in love?

159
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,520
So what?

160
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,120
What?

161
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,160
One should always be with the one he loves.

162
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,840
Treating each other with mutual respect

163
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,360
and valuing each other.

164
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,160
This is what makes a lifetime happy.

165
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,960
It doesn't matter.

166
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,304
You…

167
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,280
You are so silly

168
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,400
and unreasonable.

169
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,280
How dare you!

170
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,920
Shen Du.

171
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,200
Even if I don't want to believe

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,480
the rumors from outside,

173
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,040
but look at you now.

174
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,760
You are talking mean,

175
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,080
acting outrageous,

176
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,480
being ruthless

177
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
and unreasonable.

178
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Even if my third sister doesn't have a crush,

179
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,480
she would never marry you.

180
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,160
Treating each other with mutual respect

181
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,640
and valuing each other.

182
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,400
These things

183
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,920
are already far from me now.

184
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,480
Mother.

185
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,200
Someday,

186
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:31,840
[Bi Luo]
I will move you to the noblest cemetery

187
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:34,640
in the world,

188
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,720
where you will be worshipped.

189
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,240
Master.

190
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,480
Everything is ready.

191
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,880
Great Chief.

192
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,920
Although Yan Liuniang

193
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,120
doesn't speak nicely,

194
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,040
don't you also wish to cancel this engagement?

195
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:07,680
Since we haven't scared them away yet,

196
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,960
and they are already asking for a cancel,

197
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:12,840
why don't we just go with the flow?

198
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,280
Of course this wedding can't be completed.

199
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,920
But I shouldn't

200
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,760
be the one to cancel it.

201
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:23,920
Right, right.

202
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,360
Empress Dowager bestowed you the marriage,

203
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,520
so you naturally should be grateful.

204
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:30,480
Still, the Yan family must be the one
to cancel the engagement.

205
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,360
According to the scouts,

206
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:35,080
Sanniang of the Yan family
has eloped with that scholar,

207
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,960
yet, has not been found.

208
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,240
Even if they don't cancel the engagement,

209
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,400
then tomorrow's bridal pickup

210
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,960
is naturally canceled, right?

211
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,320
They are in the wrong,

212
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,760
and to the Empress Dowager,

213
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:44,960
Prime Minister Zhang
will naturally have to find a way

214
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:47,240
to smooth things over.

215
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,560
How can we only watch half of a play?

216
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,400
Where the bride is,
that's the Yan family's business.

217
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:58,760
Tomorrow morning, I will naturally
send a team to pick up the bride.

218
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:24,752
[Yan Mansion]

219
00:13:36,047 --> 00:13:39,560
[Awaiting Punishment from the Empress Dowager]

220
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,920
Everyone.

221
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,920
You have been working in Yan Mansion for years.

222
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:50,000
Now that we have encountered such a disaster,

223
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,400
I'm afraid the heaven
wants to doom our Yan family.

224
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,360
I have prepared some money for you,

225
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,400
so you could find a new place to settle.

226
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:20,720
I have already finished the will.

227
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,760
Mother.

228
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,120
I don't want to die yet, mother.

229
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,816
Mother.

230
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,080
Mother.

231
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,400
- Mother.
- Alright.

232
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,824
I'll be the bride.

233
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,000
What time is it already?

234
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,480
Why hasn't the bride come out yet?

235
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
We're going to miss the auspicious time!

236
00:15:17,688 --> 00:15:24,517
♫ May you also look up
to see the brilliant stars and moon ♫

237
00:15:27,704 --> 00:15:35,704
♫ No matter the endless rivers,
until you came into my life ♫

238
00:15:35,704 --> 00:15:39,975
♫ Rushed encounters in time,
with shallow fates ♫

239
00:15:39,975 --> 00:15:45,429
♫ The winter in warm memories ♫

240
00:15:46,136 --> 00:15:49,981
♫ Never mind the destined solitary fate ♫

241
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:54,399
♫ Blazing a lifetime of splendor ♫

242
00:15:56,216 --> 00:16:00,334
♫ I have waited
until time bloomed into flowers ♫

243
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:05,912
♫ The ice and snow slowly melting ♫

244
00:16:05,912 --> 00:16:10,378
♫ I hear those gentle words ♫

♫ He said he loves her ♫

246
00:16:15,992 --> 00:16:20,457
♫ The flower in the mirror,
the moon in the water, present in my dreams ♫

247
00:16:20,457 --> 00:16:25,824
♫ It's not the vain and false glamour ♫

248
00:16:25,824 --> 00:16:28,480
♫ Why fear the flying sand on the road ahead ♫

249
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,080
♫ Chasing time, riding the white horse ♫

00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,600
Liuniang.

251
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,760
Liuniang, no way!

252
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,560
Liuniang.

253
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,600
This won't work out.

254
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,840
Think about that White Ghost.

255
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,680
He's someone in the Shen Mansion
who crawled out from a pile of dead bodies.

256
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,480
Could you live a good life after marrying him?

257
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:48,560
Run. Take this.

258
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,000
You know people in the Ministry of Justice.

259
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,240
When the time comes, find a place

260
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,720
to hide for three months.

261
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,120
Return home after this period passes.

262
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,600
Don't worry about me.

263
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,040
Your father is just a paper tiger,

264
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,040
can't do anything bad to me.

265
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,079
At worst,

266
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
I'll serve him well

267
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,720
for the rest of my life.

268
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,480
If it really doesn't work out,

269
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,040
you can just

270
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,240
divorce me.

271
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
I'll go to

272
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,920
sing opera again.
I could support the two of us.

273
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,000
Mother.

274
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,160
Which troupe

275
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,880
would take in an elderly actress like you?

276
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
Although I am a concubine's daughter,

277
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,960
under your protection since childhood,

278
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I have not suffered much.

279
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,640
My third sister has been nice to me.

280
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,000
I was unwilling to practice
the female arts of needlework,

281
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,640
eager to apply for the position
as a female official.

282
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,840
It was my third sister who knelt for
an entire night in the ancestral hall for me.

283
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,360
You!

284
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,840
You just remember the good in others.

285
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,360
I am part of the Yan family,

286
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,960
naturally, I can't watch the Yan family suffer.

287
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,240
My third sister doesn't wish to marry,

288
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,120
because she has Mr. Han in her heart.

289
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,480
I have no one in my heart.

290
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,760
So I shall marry on her behalf.

291
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,880
Silly girl.

292
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,960
It is not that simple.

293
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:05,040
Mother, don't worry.

294
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,680
I have seen many dead

295
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,960
at the Ministry of Justice

296
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,120
Even the White Ghost

297
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,800
couldn't scare me.

298
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Besides, he's still a human.

299
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,720
He could never take me to the underworld.

300
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,432
Alright.

301
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:40,904
Father.

302
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:46,056
Mother.

303
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,760
Please take good care of my mother for me.

304
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,040
I

305
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,080
am leaving.

306
00:19:32,846 --> 00:19:40,623
[Yan Mansion]

307
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,120
Pick up the bride.

308
00:20:11,104 --> 00:20:12,440
Great Chief.

309
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,440
Before the wedding ceremony,

310
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,040
the bride and groom should not meet.

311
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,760
The bride dropping the bridal sedan chair
halfway would bring bad luck.

312
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,040
Moreover, as the groom,

313
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,520
you haven't even changed
into your wedding attire.

314
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,680
Enough. We'll follow

315
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,360
the Imperial Guards' rules.

316
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,480
The Great Chief decides what to do.

317
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,752
Well…

318
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,056
My wife.

319
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,240
Let me see

320
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:44,480
the virtuous lady

321
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,240
of the Yan family

322
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,560
who has learned a lot.

323
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,360
This virtuous lady

324
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,080
is me.

325
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,200
Great Chief, are you going

326
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,200
to kill your wife in public?

327
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,040
Don't forget

328
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,360
this marriage is bestowed
by the Empress Dowager.

329
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,440
Although I don't have any official rank,

330
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,920
and I am not an official,

331
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,840
at the very least, I am a clerk
in the Ministry of Justice.

332
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,120
This is not a crime scene,

333
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,920
nor is there a suspect holding anyone hostage.

334
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,920
Even if you are the Great Chief,

335
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,560
you cannot just

336
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,360
kill an innocent clerk.

337
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:12,872
Really?

338
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
Since when

339
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:29,200
could a fly be a clerk?

340
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:37,760
You don't need to humiliate me like this.

341
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,680
Since you're so upset about this marriage,

342
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,120
why don't you kill me now?

343
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,384
Don't rush.

344
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
This sword today

345
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,560
hasn't chopped your neck,

346
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,040
but very soon,

347
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,120
it will leave you with no way out.

348
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:23,280
Yan Liuniang is really bold,

349
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,720
daring to marry for her third sister.

350
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,400
This is a crime against the sovereign.

351
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,920
The Empress Dowager only said to bestow
a marriage to a lady from the Yan family.

352
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,000
The Empress Dowager

353
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,648
doesn't care which lady at all.

354
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,760
But you…

355
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,880
I care even less.

356
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,040
Sooner or later to get her away.

357
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,040
The Yan family doesn't have

358
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:44,160
many interesting rabbits.

359
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,240
A bold one is intriguing.

360
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,200
It's rare

361
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,440
that she is not only bold,

362
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,800
but also smart.

363
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,000
Liuniang.

364
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,280
Liuniang.

365
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:09,520
Liuniang.

366
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,760
Chuichui.

367
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,000
Liuniang.

368
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,800
It is really you.

369
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:17,000
I heard that your third sister
was to marry today

370
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:18,960
and wanted to find you
to join in the excitement.

371
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,680
But upon arriving at the Yan Mansion,

372
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,080
I saw Lady Jin crying at the gate,

373
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
saying that it was you who was to be married.

374
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Liuniang, do you want it?

375
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,880
But the groom

376
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:32,600
is Shen Du.

377
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,520
He's no longer Shen Du,

378
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,360
but the cruel and ruthless White Ghost.

379
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
Chuichui, don't worry and go back.

380
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,880
No way.

381
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:45,200
How can I just watch you

382
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,800
falling into the hands of White Ghost?

383
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
I'll go with you.

384
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,800
I will be with you.

385
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,840
Terrible.

386
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,880
What's wrong? Take your time.

387
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,865
The bride has arrived.

388
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,080
[Butler of the Shen Mansion, Shen Zhong]

389
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,160
Bride?

390
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,920
What's the special family rule?

391
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,160
The Shen Mansion is made
to look like a mourning hall.

392
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,880
It doesn't look like
it's going to have a wedding at all.

393
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,200
There are so many white lanterns.

394
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,320
Madam, upon your first arrival
at the Shen Mansion,

395
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,240
the servants would never dare to neglect you.

396
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,960
This wedding

397
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,200
is all about the right timing,
location, and people.

398
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,440
A few days ago,

399
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,520
we invited someone

400
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,560
to tell the fortunes of you two.

401
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,920
So today,

402
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,960
it is not suitable for wedding celebrations.

403
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,200
It's okay.

404
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,240
As you please.

405
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,856
Please.

406
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,720
Because the Great Chief lives alone for years,

407
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,480
the main chamber

408
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,680
lacks the air of auspiciousness,

409
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,840
so is not suitable as a bridal chamber.

410
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:41,360
It could easily lead to disaster.

411
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,800
A new room has been specially prepared for you.

412
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,200
You should rest early

413
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,640
and wait for the Great Chief to return.

414
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,160
Ridiculous.

415
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:54,312
It's okay.

416
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
Please lead the way.

417
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
Please.

418
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,320
Mr. Shen.

419
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,960
I wonder if you remember

420
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,680
what my birthdate is.

421
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:08,104
Well…

422
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,720
I know you don't want

423
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,720
to say my birthdate in public.

424
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,000
Thank you for your consideration.

425
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,568
Please.

426
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,480
Chuichui, have some preserved fruit.

427
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Are you still in the mood to eat?

428
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:11,400
Madam, wish you two have a child soon.

429
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:16,160
Spread it now?

430
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,680
Did you never even consider
that Liuniang would marry into the family?

431
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,480
Chuichui.

432
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,720
Don't make it difficult for them.

433
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,680
They're being ridiculous.

434
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,120
They probably thought

435
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:44,640
I might run off halfway.

436
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,160
But this is so absurd.

437
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,280
It's nothing.

438
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,640
Just some courtesy.

439
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,640
Empty courtesy?

440
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,400
Your family has suffered loss.

441
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,120
I've heard

442
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,400
that what Shen Du sent to your family

443
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,880
were all just for show,

444
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,400
none of them was valuable.

445
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,192
Well…

446
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,080
You might as well marry
into an ordinary family.

447
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,720
At least that would be sincere.

448
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,160
People would value much on their weddings,

449
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:30,160
but you got nothing.

450
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,320
And you can still smile now?

451
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,600
Since he doesn't want to marry,

452
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,120
then I insist on getting married.

453
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,010
[Three]

454
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,720
Great Chief, terrible!

455
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,960
There's news from the Imperial Guards up ahead.

456
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,640
That bride is simply outrageous.

457
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,200
Not only did she not leave, she actually came.

458
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,080
She should already be at the Shen Mansion now.

459
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,640
I knew it.

460
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,200
The key is, no one thought
this wedding would actually happen,

461
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,720
so nothing was prepared.

462
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,960
But she went to the venue to set up

463
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:11,600
and offer suggestions.

464
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,080
Let her be.

465
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,320
Previously, there were many ladies

466
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,240
who wanted to marry into the Shen Mansion.

467
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
But with some tricks,

468
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,880
they ran away in an instant.

469
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,200
No one who has seen your sword
would dare enter the bridal chamber.

470
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,920
After entering the mansion,
Mr. Shen deliberately withheld her dowry.

471
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,120
She not only wasn't angry,
but still wanted to marry.

472
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,120
This woman is well-trained,

473
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,280
and rises to the challenge.

474
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:38,480
Prime Minister Zhang sending her here
is definitely a big conspiracy.

475
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,744
[Six]

476
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,160
Even you can tell,

477
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,680
then it's not a conspiracy at all.

478
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,720
This rabbit,

479
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,440
compared to those in the past,

480
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,320
is indeed much more intriguing.

481
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,000
The matchmaker…

482
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,320
Great Chief, rest assured.

483
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:15,000
I have already given a heads-up

484
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:16,360
to the bridal pickup team.

485
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,480
Now everyone only thinks

486
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,520
that you are successfully marrying

487
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:23,120
and the wedding is completed perfectly.

488
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,520
Now I understand

489
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,360
why Shen Du is known as White Ghost.

490
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,640
Just look at these.

491
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,480
In broad daylight, it's like a memorial hall.

492
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,720
When evening comes,

493
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,920
it is still as brightly lit as day.

494
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,800
Could it be to illuminate the underworld

495
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,040
to guide the ghosts?

496
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,920
Perhaps he's afraid of

497
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,440
ghosts knocking at midnight.

498
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,040
Liuniang.

499
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,120
Now,

500
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,360
do you really hate White Ghost?

501
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,960
I was silly in my youth,

502
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,680
thinking he was a nice guy.

503
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,920
But after these past days,

504
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,320
I've seen through him now.

505
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,280
Then he said those words
when he stopped the sedan…

506
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,480
I think he didn't want me to enter the mansion,

507
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,320
so he wanted to scare me away.

508
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:33,360
Then what will you do?

509
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,560
Don't worry.

510
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,840
After all, it's a marriage
bestowed by the Empress Dowager.

511
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,920
He won't lay a hand on me

512
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,440
that soon.

513
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,960
I would be careful and cautious,

514
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,840
keeping holding on.

515
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
I must hold on until

516
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,960
the court decides on the personnel
for external appointments,

517
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,440
so my family won't be exiled to the frontier.

518
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,080
This is not a marriage.

519
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:53,280
You are entering a den of demons.

520
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,800
Seeking life in the underworld

521
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
is not that easy.

522
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,240
It's getting late, you should head back.

523
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,280
Or your father would be anxious.

524
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,680
I won't go. I want to stay here with you.

525
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,720
Can you come to stay with me every day?

526
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,480
I can't get you involved.

527
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,680
Rest assured.

528
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,560
Tonight he will certainly put on an air

529
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,120
of neglecting and disdaining me.

530
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,560
So he won't enter my room.

531
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,920
What are you doing here?

532
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,520
This is the Shen Mansion.

533
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:22,960
And tonight is my wedding night.

534
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,320
Why couldn't I come?

535
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,664
But you…

536
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,760
As the lady of the Yan family,

537
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:34,640
you are praised

538
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,040
for your talents,

539
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,600
with knowledge

540
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,640
of the past and present.

541
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,760
Your reputation as a virtuous lady

542
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,080
is known throughout the Xiang'an.

543
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
I wonder

544
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:49,640
if what I mentioned is you.

545
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:56,320
Yes.

546
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,680
Of course, the Empress Dowager

547
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
thought

548
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:03,120
I am extremely well-matched with you.

549
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,360
Otherwise, why would she bestow a marriage?

550
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:08,760
Great Chief, if you are dissatisfied with me,

551
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,920
then just divorce me.

552
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,800
What you thought

553
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:25,160
is just like what you look like.

554
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,560
Naive.

555
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:57,360
What a pretty lady you are.

556
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:02,800
I would definitely cherish you,

557
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:05,840
why could I divorce you?

558
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,760
I have never seen a bride

559
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,440
running around before the wedding ceremony.

560
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:21,200
If you don't want to

561
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,360
get injured

562
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:26,040
in the Shen Mansion,

563
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,640
then behave.

564
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,480
You are right.

565
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,800
Honey.

566
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,680
Now that I have married you,

567
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,160
I must naturally

568
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,920
do whatever I should well,

569
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,880
to serve you

570
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,920
well.

571
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,200
Do you

572
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,720
want to flirt to me?

573
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,320
Since you say to serve me well,

574
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,280
then let me tell you three things.

575
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,160
First,

576
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,160
don't try to be

577
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:14,360
the real Mrs. Shen.

578
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,120
Between you and me,

579
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:18,360
we are in name only.

580
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,360
Second,

581
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:21,600
don't expect any information

582
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,960
from me.

583
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,840
I know what Prime Minister Zhang

584
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,000
sent you for.

585
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:33,400
Third,

586
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,920
you are not the wife I want to marry,

587
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,280
don't try to survive in the Shen Mansion.

588
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,480
My lord.

589
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,640
Have you seen Madam?

590
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:34,600
About the wedding ceremony…

591
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,400
Let's regard it as completed.

592
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,480
Well…

593
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,680
The west wing room…

594
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,680
Just let her stay there.

595
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:49,920
Great Chief.

596
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,520
The Ming Hall is on fire.

597
00:40:54,432 --> 00:40:55,840
Great Chief.

598
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,120
Why did the Ming Hall catch fire?

599
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,320
Someone set himself on fire in the Ming Hall,

600
00:40:58,320 --> 00:40:59,480
resulting in a fire.

601
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:01,400
The guy set himself on fire
has been burned beyond recognition.

602
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,640
Send more men

603
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,400
to ensure the safety of the palace.

604
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,200
Find out who that guy is.

605
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,520
Nothing can be left out.

606
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,056
Yes.

607
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:23,560
Why don't you let me see her?

608
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,400
I am the female official
of the Ministry of Justice.

609
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,680
I came here with her yesterday.

610
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,200
We cannot let you in, Miss.

611
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,400
- Without the permission of Mr. Shen,
- Please.

612
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:32,560
we cannot let you in.

613
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:34,040
Yes.

614
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,440
- Chuichui.
- You can't get in.

615
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:38,880
Liuniang, terrible!

616
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,664
- Madam.
- Madam.

617
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,560
In the bamboo forest of Ximing Temple,

618
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:50,080
a couple of bodies was found nearby.

619
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:53,200
The bodies look so weird.

620
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,200
The Ministry of Justice and the inspector
have already sent people there.

621
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,320
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

622
00:42:12,694 --> 00:42:16,512
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

623
00:42:16,512 --> 00:42:20,189
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

646
00:43:49,161 --> 00:43:52,901
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

647
00:43:52,901 --> 00:43:57,918
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

648
00:43:57,918 --> 00:44:00,798
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

649
00:44:00,798 --> 00:44:05,086
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

650
