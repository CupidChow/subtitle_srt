<i>[Princess of Valor Mansion]</i>

16
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,800
Mr. Zhang is here.

17
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,800
- Stand still. Don't move.
- Wait.

18
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,400
Stop it. Let him go.

19
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,200
Trying to kidnap someone in broad daylight?

20
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,840
We're not kidnapping.

21
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,520
I have sent someone

22
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,920
to invite him over as a guest.

23
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Princess of Valor.

24
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,000
Since he is a guest,

25
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,440
he should be free to come and go.

26
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,960
But it's obvious

27
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,280
that he doesn't want to be a guest.

28
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Just a personal matter.

29
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,480
I didn't expect it to get you to come.

30
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,680
I wonder what relationship you have

31
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,720
with Mr. Han.

32
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,240
Your Highness.

33
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
I am ordered to offer my condolence

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,800
to the Great Chief couple.

35
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,880
And I happened to hear Mrs. Shen

36
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,600
mention it.

37
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,720
The Empress Dowager has always valued you.

38
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:35,720
This is

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,480
for the good of you.

40
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,040
I hope you could think it over.

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,000
Since you have said so,

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,360
it would be inappropriate for me
to insist on holding him here as a guest.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,320
I shall take my leave.

44
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,000
Mrs. Shen.

45
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,360
I have made it clear last time

46
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,840
that you might protect Mr. Han temporarily,

47
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,600
but can you protect him for a lifetime?

48
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:26,840
Great Chief, someone has reported

49
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,320
that a number of moth-shaped jades

50
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,920
suddenly appeared
in the ruins of Jinxiu Workshop.

51
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,920
And someone appeared. Quite creepy.

52
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,840
Let's go to Jinxiu Workshop.

53
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:39,680
It's Mr. Kong from Jinxiu Workshop.

54
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,160
But hasn't Mr. Kong already died?

55
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,240
Is it a person or a ghost?

56
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,880
Can it be that the dead
really can come back to life?

57
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,240
You saw it just now.

58
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,760
Is it really the work of ghosts?

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
I never believed in ghosts.

60
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,680
If any,

61
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,200
someone's been up to something.

62
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,480
Let's investigate carefully

63
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:10,720
and will certainly find some clues.

64
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,800
I've found it.

65
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,520
The divine sign appears,
revealing precious jewels.

66
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,760
This moth-shaped jade must be a divine one.

67
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,560
- There must be more. Keep searching.
- Definitely more. Search.

68
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,360
I found one.

69
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,688
It's marvelous.

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
I found another one.

71
00:04:29,414 --> 00:04:33,056
<i>[Shen Mansion]</i>

72
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,240
I always feel that

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,880
there are two forces

74
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,480
behind this case.

75
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,880
One of them

76
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,080
wants to quietly erase the Jinxiu Workshop case

77
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,200
in low profile.

78
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,400
While another one

79
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,960
wants to stir up trouble
by taking advantage of this.

80
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
Moth-shaped jade appeared.

81
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
The master reveals his spirit.

82
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
The dead come back to life.

83
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,800
As if all these bizarre events

84
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,040
were scheduled to happen together

85
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,080
in this month.

86
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,320
Whoever stirs up such a commotion

87
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,920
in the Imperial City

88
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,760
is definitely not a serial murderer

89
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,880
or an ordinary warlock.

90
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,680
There must be a big shot behind it.

91
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,200
But I can't figure out

92
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,640
what this big shot

93
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,360
is up to.

94
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,120
Creating a god.

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,000
Creating a god?

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,600
The case now is already

97
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,120
beyond your control.

98
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,360
There's a case within the case,

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,880
and it's intricately connected
to the court's strife.

100
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,800
What's the purpose

101
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,360
of creating a god then?

102
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,400
Any thoughts?

103
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:44,200
My only thought right now

104
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,720
is the only advice I can give you.

105
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,200
Stop investigating.

106
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,960
Don't get involved in the trouble.

107
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,200
Boring.

108
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,680
I thought you had some profound insights.

109
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,920
I must continue to investigate the case.

110
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,520
Childish.

111
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,400
Don't put yourself in danger.

112
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:14,320
Are

113
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,920
you concerned about me?

114
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,224
What do you think?

115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,280
In any case, you are now

116
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,760
Mrs. Shen.

117
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,680
Behave yourself.

118
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,800
Don't get involved in trouble.

119
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,440
I think you're concerned about me.

120
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,400
You don't let me go.

121
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,320
I must get to the bottom of it.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,384
Madam.

123
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,920
Lu Chuichui and I

124
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:19,040
have an appointment to visit
the silk store in the south of the city.

125
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,680
I've heard they've received
a batch of new cloths.

126
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,960
In red,

127
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,360
yellow, black,

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,400
and sophora yellow.

129
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,800
The tie-dyeing looks really good.

130
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,760
If I go too late, I won't get any.

131
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,200
Maybe you should go back.

132
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,520
Don't disturb Great Chief.

133
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,680
He didn't rest well last night,
just let him sleep a little longer.

134
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,720
Alright, hurry up and go.

135
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,680
Madam, where are you going
so early in the morning?

136
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,080
Lu Chuichui and I

137
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,840
have an appointment to visit
the silk store in the south of the city.

138
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,240
I've heard they've received
a batch of new cloths.

139
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
In red,

140
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,400
yellow, black, and sophora yellow.

141
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,560
The tie-dyeing looks really good.

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,600
If I go too late, I won't get any.

143
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,040
I'm going to the silk store
in the south of the city.

144
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,280
I've heard they've received
a batch of new cloths.

145
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,720
- Mr. Zhong, what happened?
- Yellow,

146
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,480
- black, and sophora yellow.
- Had another quarrel with the Great Chief?

147
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,240
- If I go too late, I won't get any.
- What are you talking about?

148
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,240
Want some sugar cakes? I just made them.

149
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,760
I am about to deliver them to the Great Chief.

150
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,640
No, it's a made-up lie.

151
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,312
What?

152
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,280
Mrs. Shen left the house

153
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,560
this early in the morning,

154
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,240
must have something urgent to do.

155
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,520
Recently, Great Chief

156
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,840
hasn't had much appetite for breakfast,

157
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,080
so I made some sugar cakes.

158
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,040
Try them too.

159
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,496
Jing Lin.

160
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
Great Chief.

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,679
Go keep an eye on Yan Xing.

162
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,240
With her temper,

163
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,919
she definitely won't listen to me.

164
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,320
Yes.

165
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,920
<i>There's one person missing from this case.</i>

166
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,200
<i>The witness who found Mrs. Chen's body.</i>

167
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,760
<i>Besides Chen Shoujie, there was another person.</i>

168
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,760
<i>She made personally</i>

169
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,680
<i>basin mutton, smoked chicken,</i>

170
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
<i>baked flatbread and cake.</i>

171
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,680
<i>She even gave me a bowl of wine.</i>

172
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,680
<i>Madam treated us so well.</i>

173
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,440
<i>She made personally</i>

174
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,440
<i>basin mutton, smoked chicken,</i>

175
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,720
<i>baked flatbread and cake.</i>

176
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,440
<i>The testimony of Chen Shoujie's servant</i>

177
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,600
<i>is exactly the same</i>

178
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:16,240
<i>as that recorded by the officials</i>

179
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,360
<i>when they questioned him.</i>

180
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,640
<i>The testimonies are identical,
not a single word differs.</i>

181
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,720
<i>He probably memorized what to say beforehand.</i>

182
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,560
Chen Shoujie.

183
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Where is your servant?

184
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:31,520
Fire moth!

185
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,992
Fire moth!

186
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:37,760
Fire moth!

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
Fire moth!

188
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,360
- Fire moth!
- What fire moth?

189
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:48,320
Fire moth!

190
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,200
Fire moth!

191
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:52,200
Fire moth!

192
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,824
Fire moth!

193
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,568
It's you.

194
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,400
The day Mrs. Chen got killed,

195
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,440
what exactly did you see?

196
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,840
Why would you forge the testimony?

197
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,560
He seems to be waiting for me?

198
00:11:30,663 --> 00:11:33,781
<i>[Mingsheng Temple]</i>

199
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Mingsheng Temple.

200
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,840
Sounds familiar.

201
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,600
Excuse me,

202
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,840
did you see

203
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,080
someone coming in?

204
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:38,600
Excuse me.

205
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,504
Help!

206
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,480
The dead come back to life.

207
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,520
The dead come back to life.

208
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:16,440
The dead…

209
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,016
You cannot die.

210
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:23,760
You still haven't told me who the murderer is.

211
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,080
- You cannot die.
- Who are you?

212
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,720
And who are you?

213
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,640
Why did you kill him?

214
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,200
I didn't kill him.

215
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:45,600
I saw it with my own eyes.

216
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:46,880
Don't try to deny it.

217
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,200
I really did not kill him.

218
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:51,280
Guards.

219
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,120
I didn't kill him, I just…

220
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,432
Stop!

221
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,680
Greetings, Princess Runing.

222
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,240
Princess Runing?

223
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:11,880
<i>[Ministry of Justice]</i>
Mingsheng Temple.

224
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,680
No wonder it sounds so familiar.

225
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,040
Princess Runing

226
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,600
involving in the Jinxiu Workshop Case

227
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:19,080
stays at Mingsheng Temple.

228
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,800
Mr. Xu.

229
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,240
What? Don't you want your head anymore?

230
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,760
Don't you want your hands anymore?

231
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:39,800
Why would I be that foolish

232
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,480
to be set up?

233
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,000
I am really so foolish.

234
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,960
What's wrong?

235
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,040
I think

236
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,520
I got this powder

237
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:04,720
in the Mingsheng Temple.

238
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,000
It looks like the suspicious powder

239
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,040
around Jinxiu Workshop.

240
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:11,800
I need to calm down.

241
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,680
There must be some connection here.

242
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,560
There must be something I've missed.

243
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,720
Don't be anxious.

244
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:20,160
There is someone out there
who is more anxious than you.

245
00:15:21,888 --> 00:15:23,240
I've been following her all the way.

246
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,760
But when I reached
the outside of Chen Shoujie's Mansion,

247
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,080
my horse seemed to get frightened.

248
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,520
After I got to Mingsheng Temple,

249
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:28,880
Princess Runing has already…

250
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
Are you sure that after coming out
from the Chen Mansion,

251
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,520
Yan Xing didn't look right?

252
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,920
Yes, I called her several times

253
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,880
and she didn't respond at all,
as if she were bewitched.

254
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:36,120
And she ran after something.

255
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
I don't care who it is.

256
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,320
Whoever dares to harm my people,

257
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,800
I won't show any mercy.

258
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,720
But Madam was taken by Princess Runing,

259
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,040
I'm afraid this matter
would not be that simple.

260
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,440
There are rules, you can't go in.

261
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,760
How could Yan Xing
possibly have killed someone?

262
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,920
You really can't go in.

263
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,040
How is Yan Xing doing?

264
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,200
She's fine and just ate two steamed buns.

265
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,400
Right, she said

266
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,440
not to tell her family

267
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,280
about this matter yet.

268
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:19,720
Who set Yan Xing up?

269
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,840
You must investigate this thoroughly.

270
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:24,440
We also believe Yan Xing won't kill anyone.

271
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,120
But the one who arrested her
is the Princess Runing.

272
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,120
This matter

273
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,760
might not be that easy to investigate.

274
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,560
What's not that easy?

275
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:48,040
With solid evidence here,

276
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,640
it is natural

277
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,280
to punish a murderer.

278
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,760
You!

279
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,680
Mr. Lai.

280
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,000
I wonder what brings you here
to the Ministry of Justice's prison

281
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,360
at this late hour.

282
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,440
The Mingsheng Temple case

283
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,920
involves the Princess Runing.

284
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,000
The Empress Dowager wants to interrogate

285
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,480
the murderer, Yan Xing.

286
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,960
What are you waiting for? Take her.

287
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,960
Yes.

288
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:15,592
Wait!

289
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,120
What do you want to do, Great Chief?

290
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,800
Do you intend to shield your wife,

291
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
obstruct the interrogation

292
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:36,600
and go against the law?

293
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,880
The Imperial Inspectorate
breaks into the Ministry of Justice's prison.

294
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,920
Is this by the emperor's decree?

295
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,720
Or are you

296
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,160
regarding the law as nothing?

297
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,480
The Imperial Inspectorate has always

298
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,440
serves the Empress Dowager sincerely.

299
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,560
Great Chief,

300
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:04,560
you are slandering me.

301
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,080
Regarding today's matter,

302
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,560
I must take action personally,

303
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,760
in order not to let down

304
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,040
the Empress Dowager.

305
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,920
I will personally
investigate this matter thoroughly.

306
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,400
Vice Minister Lai, please leave.

307
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
Guard this place well.

308
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,440
If anyone dares approach,

309
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,960
consider it an act of jail delivery

310
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,600
and kill.

311
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,696
Understood.

312
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,920
Unexpectedly,

313
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,640
you truly trust

314
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:46,280
that Mrs. Shen is not the murderer.

315
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,800
But I wonder

316
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,560
what the Empress Dowager will react
when she knows about this tomorrow.

317
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:54,240
Whether she will be moved
by the deep affection between you two,

318
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,320
or ask me to carry out the public execution.

319
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,200
One night.

320
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,800
Great Chief,

321
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:11,080
please

322
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,480
cherish the night.

323
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,440
Go.

324
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,440
Come again tomorrow.

325
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,520
In the dead of night,

326
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,640
- what are you doing?
- Old Wu.

327
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,160
Shut up and come with me.

328
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,680
Can't you wait until tomorrow?

329
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,768
Great Chief.

330
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,520
Jing Lin.

331
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:04,160
You saw with your own eyes

332
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,840
that after Yan Xing came out
of the Chen Mansion,

333
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,000
as if chasing someone,

334
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,160
she rode all the way to the west of the city.

335
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,880
Yes.

336
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
Yan Xing said,

337
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,320
she discovered the Chen family servant
forging testimony,

338
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,120
so she went to the Chen Mansion.

339
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:18,920
But she found he was trying to flee,

340
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,560
so chased him all the way
to the Mingsheng Temple.

341
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,600
That's right, that's what Yan Xing said.

342
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,440
Then something's wrong.

343
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,000
What's wrong?

344
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,840
Jing Lin, lift your foot.

345
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,560
I see.

346
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,640
The west woods are muddy.

347
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,160
If it were a fast horse galloping,

348
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,960
the hem of the pants couldn't be this clean.

349
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,800
I must have soiled my soles
on the way to Mingsheng Temple

350
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,120
chasing Madam.

351
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,880
But the soles
of the Chen family servant are spotless.

352
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,240
Then how did the body
appear at the Mingsheng Temple?

353
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:18,160
Could this scent be…

354
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,080
The Mingsheng Temple case

355
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,200
has many doubts.

356
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:27,200
No one interrogates the suspect until tomorrow.

357
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,480
But if…

358
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,960
If Yan Xing suffers in the prison,

359
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,280
I will hold you responsible.

360
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:35,960
Great Chief.

361
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,320
What should we investigate next?

362
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:42,160
The source of the mistake.

363
00:22:12,704 --> 00:22:13,891
<i>Not entering samsara, undying.</i>

364
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:17,640
<i>[Like a moth to a flame.
Live at dawn, die at dusk.]</i>

365
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:23,768
<i>[Like a moth to a flame. Live at dawn, die at dusk.
Not entering samsara, undying.]</i>

366
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,360
This powder is similar to the one
that appeared in the Jinxiu Workshop.

367
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,360
Did

368
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:57,000
Madam fall into a trap right here?

369
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,320
<i>Fire moth!</i>

370
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,320
What was it before?

371
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:41,880
Great Chief.

372
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:45,080
There doesn't seem to be
any signs of rummaging or fighting.

373
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,520
So much blood.

374
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,040
Looks like this is where the murderer killed.

375
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:08,920
How did the victim end up
at the Mingsheng Temple after then?

376
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,480
<i>[It's a box.]</i>

377
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:19,560
Great Chief, this is the whereabouts
of Prince Xian last night.

378
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:24,080
<i>[Prince Xian meets with Princess Runing
at the Mingsheng Temple]</i>

379
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,880
As expected.

380
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,080
You sent someone to spy on the Prince Xian.

381
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,600
If they find out,

382
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,360
- I'm afraid…
- It's for emergency.

383
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,520
I need to meet

384
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,120
this Princess Runing myself.

385
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,560
I'm Shen Du,
the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

386
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:02,120
Greetings, Princess Runing.

387
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,920
Great Chief Shen,

388
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,680
you are the renowned White Ghost.

389
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,880
Today,

390
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,040
who do you want to take away here?

391
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,600
Your Highness, you misunderstand.

392
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:14,000
Today I have a favor to ask.

393
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,200
Don't be kidding.

394
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,520
I am no longer a princess,

395
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,280
but a commoner.

396
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,600
Great Chief, I can't help you with anything.
Please leave.

397
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,520
Your Highness,

398
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,360
please hear me out.

399
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,600
If it is an affair of the court,

400
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,000
it has nothing to do with me.

401
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,320
Don't tell me about it.

402
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,880
It is my personal affair.

403
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,000
A personal affair?

404
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,760
Yesterday, my wife was set up by someone.

405
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,360
She broke into the Mingsheng Temple
and got caught.

406
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,920
I hope you could show some mercy.

407
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,440
I can't believe you would

408
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,480
come to beg me for your wife.

409
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,040
You are very different from

410
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,640
what I heard about you.

411
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,400
Do you want me to release your wife?

412
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,400
I want you to tell me the truth.

413
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,200
What do you mean?

414
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,520
Are you suggesting
that I have slandered your wife?

415
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,280
Naturally, you did not intend to do so.

416
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:22,680
But if you want to protect someone,

417
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,320
you might hide some part of information.

418
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:32,800
Nonsense!

419
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:35,040
I am tired. You may leave.

420
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,320
At the time of the incident,

421
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:40,160
was there really only you
in the Mingsheng Temple,

422
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,480
without anyone else?

423
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:47,640
The Empress Dowager has confined you here.

424
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,160
If she learns that you met
Prince Xian secretly,

425
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,720
I wonder what she thinks.

426
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,640
Are you threatening me?

427
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:00,200
I only seek the truth.

428
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,040
He just came to visit

429
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,040
his lonely aunt,

430
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:10,520
brought some items

431
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:11,960
and have a cup of tea.

432
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,280
We never criticize state affairs,

433
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,720
or have any scheme.

434
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,920
It's a courtesy thing between relatives.

435
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,720
Can't we do so?

436
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Prince Xian values family ties.

437
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,440
But people on the outside
may not necessarily think it that way.

438
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,920
Sometimes,

439
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,400
one word can kill a person.

440
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,960
Your Highness, please tell me the truth

441
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,440
and clear my wife's name.

442
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,056
Open it.

443
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,920
I didn't actually see your wife kill anyone.

444
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,320
When I rushed over upon hearing the commotion,

445
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:00,280
only she and the body were left in the hall.

446
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,400
I didn't want others to find out

447
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,720
that Prince Xian was here,

448
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,080
so I told him to leave through the back door.

449
00:28:05,080 --> 00:28:06,720
Later, upon inspecting the back door,

450
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,080
traces of forced entry were discovered.

451
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
Among the pile of items brought by Prince Xian,

452
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,840
I found this box.

453
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,880
But I don't know where it came from.

454
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,400
Thank you for telling the truth.

455
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,800
Sorry for offending you.

456
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,440
Great Chief, be careful.

457
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,320
If anything happened to Prince Xian,

458
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,160
I would inform the Empress Dowager

459
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,280
of your spy on the royals.

460
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,280
Do you think

461
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,800
that I would be that bold

462
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,120
to do so without permission?

463
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,680
May there be peaceful days ahead.

464
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,080
Don't you want to know

465
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,760
the truth behind
the Jinxiu Workshop case from years ago?

466
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,560
What can I do then?

467
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,000
The dead

468
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
can never come back.

469
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,200
The dead are gone

470
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,320
and have found peace.

471
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:15,840
Just a word to comfort the living.

472
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,560
No one dared to investigate

473
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,800
the truth of that case back then.

474
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:20,840
What about today?

475
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,720
I promise you

476
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,600
that I would get to the bottom of the case

477
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,760
and give you the truth.

478
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,920
Good, then I'll wait for the truth.

479
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,720
Prince Xian.

480
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,880
Mingsheng Temple is a place of dispute.

481
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,080
If the Empress Dowager knew

482
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,160
that you have been there,

483
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,080
she would certainly accuse you

484
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,960
of harboring treasonous intentions.

485
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:02,040
Give a dog a bad name,

486
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,080
then hang him.

487
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,280
Because of a piece of clothing,

488
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,480
Aunt got involved in the Jinxiu Workshop case.

489
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,640
Prince Xian, mind your words.

490
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,040
Mind your words.

491
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,520
You just did a disaster relief job well,

492
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,080
which pleased the Empress Dowager.

493
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,600
Do not do anything

494
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,400
to displease the Empress Dowager.

495
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,920
Do not neglect minor conduct,

496
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,720
lest you suffer a great loss.

497
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,640
Shen Du has known about this,

498
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,920
yet did not report it.

499
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,640
He is quite calculating.

500
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,360
It is already light.

501
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,720
Why hasn't Great Chief returned yet?

502
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,120
It's about time.

503
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,504
Take her.

504
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,200
How stubborn you are.

505
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I remember back then

506
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:17,280
you were caught by Shen Du.

507
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,200
But now you listen to him.

508
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:22,600
Empress Dowager has decreed,

509
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,960
ordering you to take the suspect at noon.

510
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,240
The time has not yet arrived.

511
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,280
Don't ever take anyone.

512
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,240
Inspector.

513
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,080
How dare you to stop the Imperial Inspectorate
from handling case.

514
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:47,560
I want to see

515
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,960
how powerful

516
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,600
you are.

517
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,400
Vice Minister Lai, you're quite arrogant,

518
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:58,200
but seem a bit too hasty.

519
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,760
I should do my best

520
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
for the Empress Dowager.

521
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,120
Empress Dowager has decreed.

522
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:42,320
The Mingsheng Temple case
is fraught with numerous doubts.

523
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,360
Now it's transferred to the Imperial Guards
to take full responsibility

524
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,840
to investigate.

525
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Great Chief Shen.

526
00:32:57,560 --> 00:33:00,640
You really act fast.

527
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,192
Retreat.

528
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:16,480
Why hasn't she come out yet?

529
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,720
Bless her.

530
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:19,760
Come out now.

531
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,560
Liuniang, you've finally come out.

532
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,400
I was so worried.

533
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:26,560
Come on.

534
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:29,520
I'm glad that you could
come out safe and sound.

535
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:31,920
You!

536
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:35,240
You always get yourself in
during investigating the cases.

537
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,080
But I'm glad that you could
come out safe and sound.

538
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,720
Do you have any idea how worried I was

539
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,560
when I heard you'd been arrested for murder?

540
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,680
Come on.

541
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,320
Get rid of the bad luck. Go around.

542
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,240
I got blessed.

543
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,400
The case has been cleared up

544
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,680
and then I got released.

545
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,280
If Great Chief didn't

546
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,360
go to Princess Runing

547
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,520
to explain the situation,

548
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:56,200
and find the box used for transporting the body

549
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,960
from the one who framed you
in the woods behind the Mingsheng Temple.

550
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,120
Do you think you could come out so easily?

551
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,560
He went to find Princess Runing?

552
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,880
What did you just say?

553
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,160
The box used for transporting the body

554
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,400
was thrown into the woods?

555
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,679
Something's wrong.

556
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,480
What's wrong?

557
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,600
You must have been scared.

558
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,440
It's all right now.

559
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,480
Right. Mr. Xu and Jiang Langxing

560
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,679
have gone to pursue new clues.

561
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:25,159
I heard that the dead servant
of the Chen family

562
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:27,199
had been stealing the Chen family assets

563
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:29,520
while Chen Shoujie was dull.

564
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,560
Later, he got caught by Mrs. Chen,

565
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:32,679
so he betrayed his master

566
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,920
and colluded with someone

567
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,800
to kill her.

568
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,719
Unfortunately, he's dead now.

569
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,320
Yan Xing.

570
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:51,719
Great Chief, are you here
to take Liuniang back?

571
00:34:51,719 --> 00:34:52,760
Back?

572
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,639
I'm all fired up to investigate the case

573
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,159
and clear my name now.

574
00:34:59,488 --> 00:35:00,760
What are you doing?

575
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,080
You're quitting.

576
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,400
We've reached this point.

577
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,640
Even I'm quitting now, can I stay out of it?

578
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,800
And,

579
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,160
the body of that servant of the Chen family

580
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,280
should be at the Ministry of Justice.

581
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
I must find clues from his body.

582
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,680
When I say no, I mean no.

583
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,240
The murderer used
that servant of the Chen family

584
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,640
to lure me to the Mingsheng Temple,

585
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,960
obviously leading me

586
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,600
to suspect Princess Runing.

587
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,960
Princess Runing has not left
the Mingsheng Temple for many years.

588
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,000
Who wants to drag her down into this?

589
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,560
Enough.

590
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,760
Are you asking me to quit

591
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,560
because it's related to the royals?

592
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,480
Leave this matter to me. I will handle it well.

593
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,040
I just want to know the truth.

594
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,240
Since you

595
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,840
are hesitant and fearful of the powerful,

596
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:48,160
fine, I'll investigate this case myself.

597
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,640
Great Chief, you

598
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,560
can just pursue your career.

599
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:52,760
So that's what you think of me.

600
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,280
Aren't you always afraid of
being implicated by others?

601
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,600
Then let's divorce right now.

602
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,720
So you don't have to write

603
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,960
a confession later.

604
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,392
Liuniang.

605
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,800
What should we do?

606
00:36:26,336 --> 00:36:27,680
Where are you going?

607
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,152
To do the autopsy.

608
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,400
Shen Du has examined the body before.

609
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,520
The soles of his shoes did not
have any forest mud on them.

610
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:49,520
He was sent

611
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,000
to the Mingsheng Temple after he died.

612
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,600
What? Did you find anything?

613
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,080
Come and smell this.

614
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,800
This is the scent of something
used to slow down the decay of a body.

615
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,480
Long before I arrived
at Chen Shoujie's mansion,

616
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,000
he had already died.

617
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,840
What happened after then,

618
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,000
although I witnessed them myself,

619
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,480
I'm not sure

620
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,440
if it's true.

621
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,960
Are you suggesting

622
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,040
everything you saw might be an illusion?

623
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,400
What is that?

624
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,720
Or what kind of drug

625
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,520
could manipulate the mind like this?

626
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,520
The world is vast,

627
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,400
there are a lot of things

628
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:45,120
that are beyond our grasp.

629
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,360
And,

630
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,200
what concerns me more is

631
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:49,640
the method used on this servant's body

632
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,880
to delay the death time

633
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:55,400
is the same as what Mrs. Tang used.

634
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,400
Do you think

635
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:00,440
there is a way to bring the dead back to life?

636
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,600
You mean Chen Huo'e

637
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,880
might bring the dead back to life

638
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,200
as others said?

639
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,880
Yes.

640
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,280
I don't think so.

641
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,120
So I have to find out the truth.

642
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,960
So you quarreled with your husband

643
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,040
and ran away from home?

644
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,680
I am just afraid

645
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:22,520
that without White Ghost's protection,

646
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,160
what if you get bullied?

647
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,440
What am I afraid of?

648
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,760
I still have you guys.

649
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,080
If you go home and your mother finds it out,

650
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:32,080
she will definitely scold you.

651
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,080
Don't worry.

652
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,072
I already know where to go.

653
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:36,120
<i>[Historical Archive]</i>

654
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,880
<i>This is where the Ministry of Justice</i>

655
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,960
<i>keeps case files.</i>

656
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:41,280
<i>I can't believe</i>

657
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,560
<i>that no clues can be found.</i>

658
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,280
- Clerk Yan.
- Mr. Ji.

659
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,520
Why do you come
to the Historical Archive so late?

660
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,640
Mr. Ji, I want to check on

661
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:05,760
every record before and after

662
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,800
the Jinxiu Workshop case.

663
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,400
You've been in charge of
the Historical Archive for years.

664
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,760
Do you know where it is?

665
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,080
Jinxiu Workshop.

666
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,200
It's been some years.

667
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,000
Perhaps over there, you can take a look.

668
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,528
Thank you.

669
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,280
<i>I've smelled</i>

670
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:26,440
<i>this scent somewhere before.</i>

671
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,480
Clerk Yan.

672
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,960
Mind the fire.

673
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,120
Thank you.

674
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,600
I will be careful.

675
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,400
<i>Aren't you always afraid of
being implicated by others?</i>

676
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:15,840
<i>Then let's divorce right now.</i>

677
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,920
<i>So you don't have to write</i>

678
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:18,960
<i>a confession later.</i>

679
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,088
<i>Mother.</i>

680
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,560
<i>Orange.</i>

681
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,280
<i>The branches of the orange tree
outside the wall</i>

682
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:37,640
<i>just happened to fall into the garden.</i>

683
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:40,000
<i>I know you like oranges,</i>

684
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,040
<i>so I picked them for you.</i>

685
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:46,000
<i>Have you written the things</i>

686
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,040
<i>I told you to?</i>

687
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,040
<i>I don't know how,</i>

688
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,280
<i>nor can I write it.</i>

689
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,240
<i>My father has been upright all his life.</i>

690
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,520
<i>He has never done the slightest thing</i>

691
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:57,520
<i>against the Shen family's precepts.</i>

692
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,400
<i>My father was framed by others.</i>

693
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,760
<i>How can I admit to those unfounded crimes</i>

694
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,280
<i>on behalf of my father?</i>

695
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>Shut up.</i>

696
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,160
<i>You have a criminal father.</i>

697
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,880
<i>If you do not draw a clear line
with the Shen family,</i>

698
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:12,160
<i>then you will have no hope. You…</i>

699
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,120
<i>But how can I live ignobly,</i>

700
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,400
<i>allowing my father to be reviled?</i>

701
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,600
<i>Rather so,</i>

702
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,200
<i>I would rather, like my father,</i>

703
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:24,240
<i>die to prove my integrity.</i>

704
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,080
<i>But if even you die,</i>

705
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,480
<i>then this unjust case</i>

706
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,480

708
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,000
<i>Do you really want them</i>

709
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:35,320
<i>never rest in peace</i>

713
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,120
<i>don't call me your mother again.</i>

714
