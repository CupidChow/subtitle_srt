Considering your feelings on this matter,

16
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,680
I won't make things too difficult for them.

17
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,320
I will give you three days

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,600
to think it over carefully.

19
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,200
Take care, Vice Minister Lai.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,688
Stiffy.

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,728
Stiffy.

22
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,400
Don't cry, Chuichui.

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,656
I'm fine.

24
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,336
I'm fine.

25
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,960
Liuniang,

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,440
you can't just not eat all the time.

27
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,960
Open the door.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,720
I will bring you a bowl of soup.

29
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:51,400
If you have any grievances,

30
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:52,600
once you've eaten,

31
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,000
I will join you in confronting
the Shen Mansion.

32
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,080
I have had a close brush with death.

33
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,360
No matter if it's the White Ghost

34
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,640
or the White King Yama,

35
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,440
I will scratch him until he cries.

36
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,680
My daughter,

37
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
I know how much you're suffering.

38
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,200
But a woman

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,320
must have love and appreciation

40
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,200
to flourish.

41
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,000
A person who doesn't appreciate you,

42
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,160
what use is he to you?

43
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,000
We can't just

44
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,920
get knocked down by every little thing.

45
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
I promise you

46
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,720
to find you a handsome young man

47
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,280
who will cherish you greatly

48
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,920
and heed your advice.

49
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,376
How about that?

50
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,840
Handsome young man.

51
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,920
I've come to see Yan Xing.

52
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,240
Liuniang, it's me, Pan Chi.

53
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,224
Liuniang.

54
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,000
Liuniang has been shutting herself in lately

55
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,480
and does not open the door for anyone.

56
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,752
Come in.

57
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,480
She's taken my words to heart?

58
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
Madame.

59
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,680
Lady Jin,

60
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,360
was there a man

61
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,840
who just entered Liuniang's room?

62
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Madame, what nonsense are you talking?

63
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,440
What do you mean, a man?

64
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:57,080
Liuniang is a female official
of the Ministry of Justice,

65
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,400
not a lady sequestered deep in the household.

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,280
Of course, she should meet with guests

67
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,760
and deal with official business.

68
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,440
Liuniang is naturally virtuous.

69
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,080
Even though Liuniang
is not my biological daughter,

70
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,080
I've watched her grow up.

71
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,120
Everyone knows it.

72
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,200
Previously she married Shen Du.

73
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,080
I was frightened.

74
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,680
I hoped that she would find a good marriage.

75
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,600
But now that she has divorced
and returned to the Yan Mansion,

76
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,680
she should at least consider

77
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,720
the reputation of the Yan Mansion.

78
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,320
What do you mean?

79
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,880
Don't you know?

80
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,160
Now the entire Yan Mansion

81
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,120
is under the watch
of the Imperial Inspectorate.

82
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
Outside, it's rumored

83
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,240
that the daughter of the Yan family

84
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,600
has become an abandoned wife.

85
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,440
If now there are men coming and going,

86
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,480
I'm afraid others would think

87
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,560
that our Yan family lacks discipline.

88
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,920
Madame,

89
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,440
clearly, it was Liuniang

90
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,880
who did not want
that heartless Shen Du anymore.

91
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,880
How dare you call Liuniang an abandoned wife?

92
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,400
Let me tell you, Madame.

93
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,120
I've tolerated you for a long time.

94
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm at my wit's end with you.

95
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,520
I'm well-intentioned.

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,800
What do you mean by well-intentioned?

97
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
Stop fighting.

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,240
Stop fighting.

99
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,560
Stop it.

100
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,760
Isn't this family misfortune?

101
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,280
You two, stop it now.

102
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,560
Liuniang.

103
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,840
I'm with all good intentions. You…

104
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,240
You guys also shush.

105
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,560
Madame, Mother,

106
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,760
stop arguing.

107
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Father,

108
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,240
we need to go out for a bit.

109
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,240
Lady Ru.

110
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
- You're talking nonsense.
- Look.

111
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,000
- Isn't that a man from outside?
- Stop fighting.

112
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,160
You're still making excuses.

113
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,960
Stop fighting.

114
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,080
- My Lord.
- Why are you hitting me?

115
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,920
Look at her. Are you going
to do something about her?

116
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,800
Be gentler, you hit my face.

117
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:17,320
You are…

118
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,160
You are from Tongming Hall.

119
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,152
You are Yan Xing?

120
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:27,480
There's a small alley up ahead where you turn.

121
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,480
Get out from there.

122
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,800
No one will know.

123
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,600
Why help us?

124
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,960
For the sake of sisterly affection.

125
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,360
For the virtue of women.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,560
Thank you.

127
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,240
- Thank you.
- Please hurry.

128
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,120
They're here.

129
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,560
- Miss.
- Quick.

130
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,960
Liuniang.

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,280
Chuichui.

132
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:53,032
Quick.

133
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,480
You finally arrived.

134
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:07,520
I was worried you wouldn't make it out.

135
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,160
Fortunately, it was a close call
with no harm done.

136
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,320
The White Ghost has really joined forces
with Lai Luozhi?

137
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,000
From now on,

138
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I will have nothing to do with Shen Du.

139
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:35,080
How did you manage to evade
the Imperial Inspectorate's surveillance?

140
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,799
You haven't left your home in days.

141
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,039
That has made Lai Luozhi
lower his guard somewhat.

142
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,240
It seems Chuichui

143
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:43,559
understood my letter.

144
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,240
Yan has its watchers.

145
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,840
In three days, meet Chi at the pawnshop.

146
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,560
It means around the Yan Mansion,

147
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,920
Lai Luozhi's watchers are surveilling.

148
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:55,960
In three days,

149
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,600
meet me at the pawnshop.

150
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,080
Lu Chuichui is waiting for us at the pawnshop.

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,240
We will find a way

152
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,480
to bypass the secret lookouts.

153
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,560
To Zhanxin.

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,560
It turns out she is Kuang Zhanxin's friend
from Tongming Hall.

155
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,400
So her helping me today

156
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,400
is because she thinks

157
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,360
I avenged Kuang Zhanxin?

158
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,640
Solving the case and clearing the injustice

159
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,440
was never about seeking a reward.

160
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,600
Today's gains

161
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,320
are all for the good intentions of the heart.

162
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,320
A kind of mutual help.

163
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,360
Chuichui,

164
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,920
now, Lai Luozhi has unchecked power.

165
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,120
I have thought of a solution.

166
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,440
Why don't you go with Jiang Langxing

167
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,880
and temporarily leave Xiang'an?

168
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,120
Go out and lay low for a while.

169
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,760
I feigned compliance with him yesterday.

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,480
He should lower his guard lately.

171
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,640
We can take this opportunity to escape.

172
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,040
Liuniang,

173
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,720
why don't you leave with us?

174
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,640
I need to stay here.

175
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,560
Why?

176
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,120
You can't still be clinging on

177
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
to the White Ghost, can you?

178
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,528
Take good care of yourself.

179
00:10:32,975 --> 00:10:35,120
Chuichui.

180
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,704
Father.

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,200
This is your first long journey.

182
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,640
Remember,

183
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,280
nothing is as good as gold.

184
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,480
I have prepared for you

185
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:47,160
much gold.

186
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,120
It's convenient for use on the road.

187
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,200
Come on, put it on your back.

188
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,440
Be careful on the road.

189
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,200
- Be obedient.
- Father.

190
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,400
Alright, be obedient.

191
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,480
Stiffy.

192
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,400
Chuichui.

193
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,440
It's alright now.

194
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,480
Stiffy,

195
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,800
for my sake,

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,600
you are leaving Xiang'an

197
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,200
and also giving up the identity
of an inspector.

198
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,280
Will you feel regret?

199
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,000
Will you feel it's a pity?

200
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,120
As long as you are with me,

201
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,760
anywhere is a place for me to make my mark.

202
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,840
Right.

203
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,000
From now on,

204
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,360
we shall be a pair

205
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,360
of chivalrous heroes who punish the wicked
and eliminate the evil.

206
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:23,016
Okay.

207
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,704
Thank you very much.

208
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,040
Take care.

209
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,240
Farewell.

210
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,360
Give it to me.

211
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,568
What do you mean by "disappeared"?

212
00:12:53,568 --> 00:12:55,080
It's my incompetence.

213
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,600
Miss Lu and Jiang Langxing
have indeed lost their traces.

214
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,320
I'm afraid they have already left Xiang'an.

215
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,400
Then leave the city

216
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,480
and search everywhere.

217
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,840
Even if you have to dig
three feet into the ground,

218
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:04,160
you must find her for me.

219
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,696
Yes.

220
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,960
She was deceiving you all along.

221
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,000
Why pay so much attention

222
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,400
to such a woman?

223
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:16,400
Get out.

224
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,560
Get out.

225
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
<i>[Lai Mansion]</i>
Dongzhou garrison

226
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,320
pay respects to Vice Minister Lai.

227
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:32,560
The Governor of Yangyue City requests
to see Vice Minister Lai.

228
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,040
Commandant of Yuanmeng City
is here to pay respects.

229
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,800
Vice Minister, the carriages
of the noble classes who have come to submit

230
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:48,840
are crowding the streets

231
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,880
near the mansion. They just won't leave.

232
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,680
Now, 70% of the officials

233
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,360
have pledged allegiance under your leadership.

234
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:58,160
We will have difficulty accomplishing things
with only the literati.

235
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,400
Are there any movements
from the commanders in various places?

236
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,720
All the commandants from the various
prefectures have sent letters of allegiance,

237
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
all expressing the desire to use
the opportunity of the grand assembly

238
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,080
to come to Xiang'an to give thanks to you.

239
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,280
Good.

240
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,800
In the six garrison towns,

241
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,600
four commandants have pledged allegiance.

242
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,040
The remaining two are not worth fearing.

243
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,560
The second day of the second month.

244
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,840
It seems that

245
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,000
the second day of the second month

246
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,080
is a good day.

247
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,080
The moths flying to the flame.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,800
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

249
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,560
Not entering the cycle of death.

250
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,360
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

251
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,040
The Ziwei appears in the world.

252
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:41,800
The blessing of Dacang.

253
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,520
The emperor's blessing is forthcoming.

254
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,160
The world for Luozhi.

255
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,680
The emperor's blessing is forthcoming.

256
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,360
The world for Luozhi.

257
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,960
The emperor's blessing is forthcoming.

258
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,480
The world for Luozhi.

259
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,928
Liuniang.

260
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,320
Pan.

261
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:03,560
The Imperial Inspectorate

262
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,360
has not yet rescinded its surveillance
on the Yan Mansion.

263
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,400
You just come out like that.
Aren't you afraid of being implicated?

264
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,160
Lai Luozhi has been trying to implicate me

265
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,880
for many times.

266
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,400
I'll accompany you to go out
and clear your mind.

267
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:13,680
Why can't I?

268
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,080
I've heard that now the Imperial Guards
and the Imperial Inspectorate are in cahoots.

269
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:21,760
From now on, I'm afraid Xiang'an

270
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,600
will see no clear skies.

271
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,280
After hearing too many rumors,

272
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,440
it's easy to harm one's health.

273
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,320
Better to find some fun.

274
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,520
Madam.

275
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
Director Yan.

276
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,160
Director Yan,

277
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,280
you always claim yourself

278
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,480
to be devoted to official duties.

279
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:52,080
How come you are not to be seen
at the Ministry of Justice now?

280
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,480
Instead, you are here

281
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,760
flirting with someone who is of no importance.

282
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,280
Mr. Shen,

283
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:00,080
Liuniang has finished her shift.

284
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
She is affiliated with the Ministry of Justice.

285
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,760
Whom she chats with
and whom she makes friends with

286
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,920
are none of the Imperial Guards' business.

287
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,920
Throughout the court of Dacang,

288
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,160
aside from the Imperial Inspectorate,

289
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,480
who would dare not to listen
to the word of my Imperial Guards?

290
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:12,960
Shen Du,

291
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:15,240
just look at what you've become now.

292
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,080
The common people are all saying

293
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,160
that the black and white Yamas
are walking side by side.

294
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,920
From now on, the human world is a purgatory.

295
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,120
Do you think

296
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,440
being shunned by everyone like a venomous snake

297
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,880
is a matter of honor?

298
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,960
Do you still remember the words you once said

299
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,040
and the vows you made?

300
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,320
People

301
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,640
are all subject to change.

302
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,680
Liuniang,

303
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,160
don't waste your words on this kind of person.

304
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,848
Let's go.

305
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,200
Liuniang,

306
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,720
sit here and rest for a while.

307
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,720
I'll be right out.

308
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,160
Liuniang,

309
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,720
do you still remember

310
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,720
this is the place where we first met?

311
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,520
When the shadow arrives,

312
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,240
at noon there is an endpoint.

313
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,640
With the shadow's length,

314
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,560
the explanation is in the endpoint.

315
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:49,840
This is what you taught me.

316
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,560
Since the moment we first met,

317
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,320
I've imagined what your future would look like.

318
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,800
You will become

319
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,920
a female official pleading for the people.

320
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,000
Your reputation will last for centuries.

321
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,160
Now, it is only you

322
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,480
who still believes in the ambitions
in my heart.

323
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,520
In my eyes,

324
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,760
you have never been someone's daughter,

325
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,120
nor someone's wife.

326
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,880
You are Yan Xing, the female official
of the Ministry of Justice.

327
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,280
You are the most formidable

328
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,160
case-solving expert in Dacang.

329
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,440
And even more so, my confidant.

330
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,360
I only hope that

331
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:34,320
you can live freely and happily
in the Ministry of Justice

332
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,440
to fulfill your own ambitions.

333
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:39,480
I will definitely stand behind you silently.

334
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,800
But regretfully,

335
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,760
everything has now changed.

336
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,680
The court is full of undercurrents

337
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,680
with no fairness or justice to speak of.

338
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,200
You are caught up in it

339
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,440
and it has become your burden.

340
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,800
The world is vast

341
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:59,800
and there isn't just one path to officialdom.

342
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,960
Perhaps you are right.

343
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:49,760
With our power,

344
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
even if we travel all around the world,

345
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,160
we could also settle matters that are unsettled

346
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,200
and redress cases of injustice.

347
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,720
Yan Xing,

348
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,680
are you willing to join me

349
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,800
to escape this place of disputes

350
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,920
and travel the world?

351
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,520
As long as you are willing,

352
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,480
I can

353
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,040
take the lives of this pair
of scoundrels immediately.

354
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,880
If you let them go now,

355
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm afraid they won't come back.

356
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,440
That's just right.

357
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,520
To avoid any eyesore.

358
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,320
Rest assured.

359
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:57,880
I will ensure that the Ministry of Justice
vindicates the Shen family.

360
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,000
It's just a matter of a memorial to the throne.

361
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,240
Is there anything else you need to explain?

362
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,200
I have already told my family

363
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,280
that I will go out and play for a few days.

364
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,320
They are very supportive.

365
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,240
The world is vast and wide.

366
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,040
One can have an open and magnanimous heart

367
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,640
and be untroubled by mundane matters.

368
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,320
Once outside the city,

369
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,000
all disturbances

370
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,400
are no longer related to you and me.

371
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,160
With the sky as the cover
and the earth as the home,

372
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:38,840
stride the winds with high aspirations.

373
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,400
Your Majesty.

374
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,480
It's alright.

375
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,640
I'm fine.

376
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,352
I'm fine.

377
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,872
Your Majesty.

378
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,024
Guards…

379
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,520
Your Majesty,

380
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,200
take your medicine.

381
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,880
News from the palace.

382
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,880
The Empress Dowager's illness has worsened.

383
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,280
It seems she won't have much time.

384
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,800
In that case,

385
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,680
I shall visit her in person.

386
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:18,040
Who goes there?

387
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,520
Hearing that Your Majesty's condition
has worsened,

388
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,800
I'm deeply concerned.

389
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:27,400
I've come to pay respects to Your Majesty.

390
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
I'm fine.

391
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,400
A few days of rest should suffice.

392
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,800
Vice Minister Lai, there's no need to worry.

393
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:38,880
You just need to do well

394
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,000
the affairs you should handle in the court.

395
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,360
Behave and keep to yourself a bit

396
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,040
lest others say you don't understand the rules.

397
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:52,240
Thanks for your instructions, Your Majesty.

398
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,560
It seems

399
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,640
the news that Your Majesty's illness is fatal

400
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:04,320
is not false.

401
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:07,176
How dare you!

402
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,360
In front of me,

403
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,160
how can you be so disrespectful and impudent!

404
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,480
Don't get angry.

405
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,240
Human life is fragile.

406
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:26,480
Someone come!

407
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,800
You've come to harm me.

408
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,520
Your Majesty,

409
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,120
how could I harbor such intentions?

410
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,960
I have always

411
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:43,040
been utterly loyal.

412
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:52,200
Lai Luozhi,

413
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:56,000
you were of lowly birth.

414
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,280
Had I not supported you,

415
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:00,720
how would you possess

416
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,000
your current status and wealth?

417
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:07,080
Yet you harbor a disloyal heart.

418
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:09,640
You are worse than a beast.

419
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,720
If you were not

420
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,400
suspicious or prone to jealousy

421
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,640
and could not tolerate others,

422
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,880
how would you have ended up
with today's retribution?

423
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,120
I think I have been just to heaven and earth

424
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,280
and I have a clear conscience.

425
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,240
I didn't fail Dacang.

426
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:31,040
How can I allow you to judge me?

427
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:36,120
What a phrase, "a clear conscience".

428
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,160
Do you still remember

429
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Ms. Shu who was framed

430
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,360
and driven to death by you?

431
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,944
Ms. Shu?

432
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,320
Who on earth are you?

433
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,680
What is your relation to her?

434
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:57,608
Indeed.

435
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,840
In the vast imperial palace,

436
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:03,680
who would remember a woman
presented by a neighboring country

437
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:07,160
a concubine driven to her death?

438
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,560
Of course,

439
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:13,160
even more so, no one would remember

440
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,200
her child.

441
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,880
Zhi,

442
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,440
you must remember

443
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,880
it was Zhou Xu who killed your mother.

444
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,320
Once your father is dead,

445
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,640
there is no longer a way for us to survive
in the entire palace.

446
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,120
The Empress

447
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,520
and the Zhou clan behind her

448
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,040
now have unchecked power.

449
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,320
They will not let you live.

450
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,800
But do not be afraid.

451
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,520
I will protect you.

452
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,560
Even in death,

453
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,280
I will ensure you survive.

454
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,480
Use my death

455
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,320
to trade for my child's chance at life.

456
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
Zhi,

457
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,880
you must survive.

458
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,840
You have to live on

459
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,120
and take back everything that belongs to you.

460
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,520
Do you understand?

461
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,600
Do you understand?

462
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,600
Zhi.

463
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,040
The wet nurse used her own son

464
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:31,280
to exchange for my life.

465
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,880
From then on, I became Lai Luozhi.

466
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,280
The wet nurse's pair of twin daughters and I

467
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,520
depended on each other for life.

468
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:05,120
Mother.

469
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:10,160
People laugh at the moths flying to the flame.

470
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,200
Little do they know
they are but mayflies themselves.

471
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,520
Mother.

472
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,400
After my mother's death,

473
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,440
you who have a high status

474
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,840
thought

475
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,400
this was but a palace scandal.

476
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,040
You ordered that this matter not be discussed
in the palace again.

477
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:37,680
It is for this very reason

478
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,640
the maid who came to Dacang with my mother,

479
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,520
my wet nurse,

480
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:44,400
fooled everyone

481
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:48,160
and took me out of the palace.

482
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,920
That year,

483
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,720
inside the ruins,

484
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,160
the charred corpse of that boy…

485
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,240
My wet nurse's son.

486
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:20,000
Of similar age to me.

487
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,320
He willingly

488
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,120
entered the fire in my place.

489
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,736
Mad.

490
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,360
Truly mad.

491
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,680
All of this

492
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,240
was all thanks to you.

493
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,400
It was because of you.

494
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,920
So it should be me

495
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,400
who repays you this consequence.

496
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,760
What do you want?

497
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,840
You won't live long.

498
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,400
The young emperor has yet to come of age.

499
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,120
I think this world

500
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,400
should be handed over to me,

501
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:07,160
his uncle.

502
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,640
This throne was rightfully mine.

503
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,440
Only my ascension can better continue

504
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,240
the Xiao family's lineage.

505
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,960
The spirit of my late father

506
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,280
would also feel deeply consoled

507
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:28,120
on behalf of the ancestors.

508
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:31,040
Your Majesty,

509
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:34,440
please write the abdication edict now.

510
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,200
Abdication edict?

511
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:44,040
Delusional fantasies.

512
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,400
Just think,

513
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,240
my sister, Yong'an,

514
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:54,600
is still in custody.

515
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:56,120
As for Prince Xian,

516
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:57,920
it's time to arrange

517
00:32:57,920 --> 00:33:01,000
a good place for him.

518
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:09,320
How dare you!

519
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,920
I am now the Regent.

520
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,160
It was Your Majesty

521
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:16,520
who promoted me to the position.

522
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:18,000
Yong'an funded troops for a rebellion.

523
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,240
There is irrefutable evidence.

524
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,280
From Prime Minister Zhang,

525
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,560
I can easily dig out a charge

526
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,120
to imprison Prince Xian.

527
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,520
What's the next step?

528
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,560
Your Majesty,

529
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,520
can you really not guess it?

530
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,520
I entered the palace at the age of 14.

531
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:56,160
I spent my whole life in struggle.

532
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,240
But ultimately,

533
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:03,200
I still neglected to guard against others.

534
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,280
You could well wait until after my death.

535
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:07,880
Won't any kind of imperial edict

536
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,400
be up to you to fabricate?

537
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:14,920
But you are just

538
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,080
a man fishing for fame.

539
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,560
You just want to ascend

540
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,639
to the throne rightfully.

541
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:25,560
The day of the grand assembly

542
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,080
is also the anniversary of my mother's death.

543
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,159
It's also the final deadline

544
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:30,719
I'm giving you.

545
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:31,800
When the time comes,

546
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,159
my mother will see her son

547
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,920
returning in a righteous and dignified manner.

548
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,239
Her death anniversary

549
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,400
will be the day her child ascends the throne.

550
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:18,880
Shen Du, I know what you're up to.

551
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:42,920
<i>Counting the days,</i>

552
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:45,280
<i>they should have arrived by now.</i>

553
00:36:01,754 --> 00:36:03,120
<i>[Nanlang Country]</i>

554
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:05,520
This is the boundary marker of Nanlang.

555
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
We have finally arrived.

556
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:14,280
- Master.
- Mr. Chen.

557
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:20,760
Xing,

558
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,440
I've received your message via the pigeon.

559
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:24,480
I figured you should have arrived by now.

560
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,280
But you have arrived even sooner than expected.

561
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,240
Master, Xiang'an City

562
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:31,000
is now filled with Lai Luozhi's minions.

563
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:34,320
For safety, we dared not rest on the way.

564
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,760
The things you want to know

565
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,520
are indeed not simple.

566
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,880
So it turns out you

567
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,880
had Mr. Chen

568
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,240
secretly go to Nanlang

569
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:53,080
to investigate the background of Lai Luozhi.

570
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,840
<i>[Bi Luo]</i>
I heard from Chuichui before

571
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,160
that on the tombstone of Lai Luozhi's mother,

572
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,640
there was only the name Bi Luo,

573
00:36:57,640 --> 00:36:59,160
but no family surname.

574
00:36:59,160 --> 00:37:01,280
So I had Yeyun go and investigate.

575
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,800
On the partially burnt paper used for worship,

576
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:03,880
there's a drawing of a conch.

577
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,760
While on the sacrificial money used
by Dacang for ancestor worship,

578
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,360
such patterns are rare.

579
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:08,600
It is said that in Nanlang,

580
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,800
there's a worship of conches.

581
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,080
Yeyun found

582
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,760
traces of spilled ox blood on the ground.

583
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,960
Using ox blood as an offering

584
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,760
is exactly a custom of Nanlang.

585
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,640
Master,

586
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,720
Bi Luo turns out to be Ms. Shu

587
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,000
presented to the former Emperor
of Dacang by Nanlang.

588
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,160
That's right.

589
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,800
However, Bi Luo

590
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,440
had an unknown past.

591
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:33,280
I'm afraid even her own son

592
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,360
does not know it.

593
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,120
After the grand assembly tomorrow,

594
00:38:17,720 --> 00:38:20,720
everything will be settled.

595
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,040
After waiting for so many years,

596
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,440
if she

597
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:29,160
willingly surrenders the throne tomorrow…

598
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,960
It is still somewhat lacking something.

599
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:05,640
Long live Your Majesty!

600
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:18,440
The tribute envoy from Xichen
presents treasures for an audience.

601
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,000
The tribute envoy from Nanlang
presents treasures for an audience.

602
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:37,680
Today,

603
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,280
all nations come to celebrate.

604
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:41,240
Together they contribute to the grand occasion.

605
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,040
Wishing for cordial international relations

606
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,520
and peace over the four seas.

607
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,960
Stability at the root ensures national peace.

608
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,320
It is necessary to start anew
together with the people.

609
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,360
Only when all under heaven are of one heart

610
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,400
can glory endure for a thousand years,

611
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,160
ensuring longevity and stability.

612
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,840
Selection of talent solely based on virtue

613
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,360
will naturally stabilize the world.

614
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,680
Harmonizing the world

615
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,280
and ensuring longevity and stability

616
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,280
are the responsibilities of a great nation.

617
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,800
Greetings, Your Majesty.

618
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:21,160
May you live long!

619
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:28,480
The grand assembly at the court

620
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,960
is a universal celebration.

621
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:31,880
The Empress Dowager is delighted

622
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,480
and has recovered from illness.

623
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,960
Her Majesty grants a banquet for the ministers.

624
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:39,800
Thanks to the Empress Dowager's great favor.

625
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,280
The Empress Dowager has just recovered.

626
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,920
Her Majesty should not overwork.

627
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,920
If the old illness relapses,

628
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,080
that would be bad.

629
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:48,160
Does the Empress Dowager have a decree

630
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:50,120
to be announced during the grand assembly

631
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,480
to all officials?

632
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,760
Vice Minister Lai,

633
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,880
you've more and more ignorant of the rules.

634
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,400
Thanks to Vice Minister Lai's reminder.

635
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,320
I indeed have something to announce.

636
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:07,160
Recently, I suddenly fell seriously ill

637
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,440
and had no time for court affairs.

638
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,840
The various matters

639
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:14,360
were temporarily entrusted
to the Imperial Inspectorate for supervision.

640
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:17,920
Vice Minister Lai has worked quite hard.

641
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:21,160
Now, my health has fully recovered.

642
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,320
The Emperor has been

643
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:26,040
diligently studying the laws of governance
with the Senior Tutor.

644
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,320
Starting from today,

645
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,840
Vice Minister Lai need not continue

646
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,440
the duty of regency.

647
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,320
He will be relieved
of the Imperial Inspectorate's tedious tasks.

648
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:38,000
Go and rest at ease.

649
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:56,417
<i>♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫</i>

650
