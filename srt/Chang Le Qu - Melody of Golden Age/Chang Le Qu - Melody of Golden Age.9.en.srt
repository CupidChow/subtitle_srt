[Episode 9]

15
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:46,480
How did you get all these injuries?

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,160
I fell by accident.

17
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:00,040
That means Great Chief has been quite careless.

18
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,400
What I mean is,

19
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:06,200
he didn't take good care of you.

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,200
I tell you guys,

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,600
typically, women who are abused at home

22
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
all say that, right?

23
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,496
Right.

24
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,480
My lord!

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,120
What happened to you?

26
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,360
Move, move, move aside.

27
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,480
Quick, take a seat.

28
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
Slow down.

29
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,680
How did this happen?

30
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,320
Where did you get hurt? Slow down.

31
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,840
Where did you get this injury?

32
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,680
How did this happen?

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,200
I fell by accident, I fell.

34
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,640
You fell as well?

35
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,760
Jiang the stickler.

36
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,720
I just wanted to watch a play.

37
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,120
The opera was only halfway through

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,640
and my father dragged me back.

39
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:04,240
It must have been that Jiang the stickler.

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,240
Well, is it Mr. Wu who sent Jiang the stickler

41
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,080
to torment me?

42
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,640
How on earth did I offend him?

43
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
My father said

44
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,200
there is no problem

45
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,360
that a gold ingot can't solve.

46
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,480
If one ingot isn't enough, use two.

Chuichui,

48
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,320
I really can't help you with this.

49
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,480
I have an appointment with Chi

50
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:34,840
today at the Guangyue Restaurant. I must go.

51
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,440

53
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,600
your

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,680
head injury can be said to be from a bump.

55
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,920
But how did your leg get injured?

56
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,520
It wasn't the White Ghost bullying you, was it?

57
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,920
No.

58
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,120
I'm going.

59
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,520
Boss, a pancake, please.

60
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:12,560
The weather is really nice today.

61
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,720
Here, your pancake.

62
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,959
Thanks, put it on my tab.

63
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,400
Okay.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,560

Jiang the stickler.

66
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,080
Just speak clearly.

67
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,520
How much do you really want?

68
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,320
What you've given is plenty.

69
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
Come on up.

70
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,240
Look over there.

71
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,480
Chuichui.

72
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:16,080
Father, give me an ingot of gold.

73
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,320
[Lu Jinshan]
Chuichui, if you buy this kind of poor boy,

74
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,800
how can he be worth gold?

75
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:22,160
A string of coins is sufficient.

76
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
Here.

77
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,800
No, I want an ingot of gold.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,040
Miss, from now on I am your man.

79
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,600
No need, I have enough servants at home.

80
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
A man for a lifetime.

81
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,360
How can one serve others?

82
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,400
He must go do more meaningful things

83
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,720
and protect more people.

84
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,304
Let's go.

85
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,240
Chi,

86
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
you and I make friends through letters,

87
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,520
corresponding for a long time in the boudoir.

88
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,280
Finally, we're going to meet today.

89
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,240
I'm actually feeling a bit nervous.

90
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,960
I wonder what kind of beautiful lady

91
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:36,720
you are.

92
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,840
Miss, Mr. Yan has suddenly fallen
critically ill.

93
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,320
Please hurry back to the mansion to see.

94
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,200
My father is critically ill.

95
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,680
Postpone our meeting to another time.

96
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,720
Hoping for your understanding.

00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,960

99
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,120
Dad, how are you?

100
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,040
Now, it's really not easy for me

101
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,760
to see you.

102
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,120
If I wish to hear you

103
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,840
speak a few words of truth,

104
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:45,680
that's even harder than reaching the heavens.

105
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,344
I dare not.

106
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,640
Dare not?

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,440
You clearly know why

108
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,600
I made you marry

109
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,480
into the Shen Mansion.

110
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,560
Yet you report to me every day

111
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,720
the trivial things

112
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,080
like Shen Du's meals.

113
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,720
Prime Minister Zhang,

114
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:14,080
I know since entering the Shen Mansion,

115
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,880
I must share your worries

116
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,280
and keep inquiring about Shen Du's information.

117
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,800
But in the Shen Mansion

118
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,040
I'm just a secluded lady.

119
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,320
What can be found out

120
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,400
is nothing more than trifles about three meals.

121
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,600
For espionage information,

122
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,160
details are important.

123
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,440
I fear omitting anything.

124
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,560
So I had to report everything
regardless of importance.

125
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,240
If you still feel it is not enough,

126
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,480
for the confidential report next month,

127
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,159
I will report the daily routines,

128
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,559
bathing and conjugal circumstances…

129
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,559
Stop talking.

130
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,880
As a young lady,

131
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,200
how can you speak such words?

132
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,320
Mr. Yan,

133
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,000
this is the good daughter you have raised.

134
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
Prime Minister Zhang, please forgive me.

135
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,920
Please forgive me.

136
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,600
It is my fault for not teaching
my daughter properly.

137
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,360
I have not taught my daughter properly.

138
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,760
I am incompetent

139
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,880
and failed to find out useful intelligence.

140
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,040
Please don't

141
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,480
displace anger onto my father.

142
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,760
Liuniang,

143
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,440
I know

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,720
once a girl is married,

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
her husband is her heaven.

146
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,920
In her eyes and in her heart,

147
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
it's all about the one beside her.

148
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,960
Even if she has been wronged,

149
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,320
she must swallow it herself.

150
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,520
But what a girl fears most is

151
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:29,080
that her pillow companion
is a jackal from Zhongshan.

152
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,640
The case of Shen Mansion

153
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,000
caused a sensation throughout the court
and the country back then.

154
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,720
You were little at that time.

155
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,240
But you should have heard of it.

156
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,360
Do you know

157
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,000
who dealt the final blow to the Shen family?

158
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,240
It was Shen Du.

159
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,000
Great Chief,

160
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,120
after conducting investigation, I found

161

162
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,600
that had been endorsed by the Empress Dowager,

163
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,040
the archives of evidence
are all kept at the Secretariat of Lintai.

164
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
Lintai?

165
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,240
But the Secretariat has
entrenched and interwoven power.

166
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,960
Lintai has always been heavily guarded.

167
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,120
Even the imperial guards

168
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:21,480
may not approach without a reason.

169
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,200
It doesn't matter.

170
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,000
As long as the item is there,

171
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,280
there will naturally be a way to get it.

172
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,880
Yes.

175
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,240
However, coincidentally,

176
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,320
Prime Minister Zhang also
went to Yan Mansion tonight.

177
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,160
He did not take the Prime Minister's carriage.

178
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,480
Instead, he took the usual sedan chair.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,080
Understood.

180
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,640

00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,200
I denounce.

190
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:53,400
I, Shen Du, the son
of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu,

191
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,720
denounce my father

192
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,840
for colluding with foreign lands

193
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,360
and conspiring with the rebel army.

194
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,760
I denounce.

195
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:06,160
I, Shen Du, the son
of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu,

196
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,640
denounce my father

197
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,200
for colluding with foreign lands

198
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,636
and conspiring with the rebel army.

199
00:12:13,636 --> 00:12:17,252
♫ Lights will intertwine ♫

200
00:12:17,252 --> 00:12:22,788
♫ You are my final destination ♫

201
00:12:22,788 --> 00:12:25,818
♫ Who will guide me through loneliness
and confusion ♫

202
00:12:25,818 --> 00:12:29,988
♫ Understand my vulnerability ♫

203
00:12:29,988 --> 00:12:32,810
♫ Who will guide me through helplessness
and persistence ♫

204
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:36,743
♫ Take me in, alone but never falling ♫

205
00:12:36,743 --> 00:12:41,152
♫ Can't escape the fetters of fate
set for you and me ♫

206
00:12:41,152 --> 00:12:45,880
♫ Embracing the gentleness you've given ♫

207
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,080
Great Chief,

208
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:49,440
why mock me?

209
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,120
I am one accused of murdering my own child.

210
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,440
And you

211
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,320
are betraying your own father.

212
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:58,400
You and I are clearly the same kind of person.

213
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,216
♫ Who will guide me through grudges and karma ♫

214
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,240
Father, for the path I chose back then,

215
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,240
I had no choice.

216
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,520
But now

217
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,040
as long I can successfully enter Lintai,

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I will be able to obtain

219
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,080
the correspondence
of colluding with the enemy that year.

220
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,560
After it is proved it was forged,

221
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,464
there will be one less piece of evidence
against my father's crimes.

222
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:29,484
♫ Wishing to disappear
in the dust of noise with you ♫

223
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,280
In the case of the Shen Mansion back then,

224
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,120
although the evidence was conclusive,

225
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,920
Minister Shen nevertheless
proclaimed his innocence

226
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,560
and refused to sign the confession.

227
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,720
Despite enduring torture,

228
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:53,080
he never admitted guilt until his death.

229
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,880
The case was ultimately closed
with just physical evidence.

230
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,480
There were no confessions.

231
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,800
But who could have expected it?

232
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,280
After many years, the Young Emperor
ascended to the throne.

233
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,520
The Empress Dowager presides over the court.

234
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:03,840
Your beloved husband Shen Du,

235
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,760
in order to escape his criminal record
and climb to a high position,

236
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,840
did not hesitate to write a confession.

237
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,160
On behalf of his father, Minister Shen,

238
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,200
he admitted the crimes

239
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,040
one by one.

240
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,016
Who?

241
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,680
It's me.

242
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
Your husband.

243
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,920
What are you doing here?

244
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,040
Why are you covered in blood?

245
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,360
Honey,

246
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,400
do you want to know whose blood this is?

247
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:39,720
It's the blood of the dozen or so people
in Yan family,

248
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,880
old and young.

249
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,960
You deserve it

250
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,920
for being a spy.

251
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:59,200
Are you truly such a cold-blooded
and heartless person?

252
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:51,304
The porridge is not bad.

253
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,728
Too sweet.

254
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
The side dish is quite crisp.

255
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,296
Too salty.

256
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,240
I love to have sweet porridge
with salty dishes.

257
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,400
Mr. Zhong,

258
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,680
from now on, for breakfast,

259
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,359
prepare salty porridge with sweet desserts.

260
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
Shen Du, what do you mean?

261
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,040
I don't mean anything.

262
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,840
Shen Du,

263
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,280
are you really such a person?

264
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,040
Are you truly such a person?

265
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,680
So what if I am?

266
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,760
So what if I'm not?

267
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,920
Yan Xing,

268
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,720
I, Shen Du, am exactly this kind of person.

269
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,600
Great Chief,

270
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,360
I truly feel injustice on your behalf.

271
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:13,680
The fact that woman is not content
is one thing.

272
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,200
But she even turns out to be
a fierce and evil woman.

273
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,200
At the beginning, she at least pretended a bit.

274
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
In just a few days,
her true nature has been revealed.

275
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,440
You have your orders to obey.

276
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,280
I also have my duties to fulfill.

277
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,200
At least, we need to keep up appearances.

278
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,760
But we won't get serious, rest assured.

279
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,920
Jing Lin,

280
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,200
well,

281
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,600
is it that Mrs. Shen was beaten by her husband

282
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,920
or is it that the White Ghost
met a female demon

283
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,960
could excite the ladies

284
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,640
of Xiang'an City even more

285
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,640
and make the likes of Prime Minister Zhang

286
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,080
feel that there's an opportunity to exploit?

287
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,800
Several days have passed since the wedding day.

288
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,720
It must provide some fodder for gossip.

289
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,880
You mean it's intentional
to let those with ulterior motives

290
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,920
believe that the Shen Mansion is not at peace

291
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,040
and thereby lower their guard.

292
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,400
You're not stupid.

293
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,040
So the quarrel you had today

294
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,160
was deliberate?

295
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,800
Clever indeed.

296
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,480
The injuries on Madam

297
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,120
were also inflicted by design?

298
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,840
Hongwen School has always recruited

299
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,560
individuals of high status.

300
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,640
This time, the examination does not require
recommendation letters

301
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
and there's no investigation
into one's family background.

302
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
So how will character be assessed?

303
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,440
It will be a contest
of who writes the best essay.

304
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,840
For those rural louts,

305
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,600
as long as they're willing
to bury themselves in hard study,

306
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,200
hanging their heads from beams
and stabbing their thighs with awls,

307
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,240
they might just win the big prize
and enter the school.

308
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,440
I don't want to be their classmate.

309
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,960
Your Majesty,

310
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,040
the examination for the Hongwen School
is approaching.

311
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:00,760
This is the first time family backgrounds
are not being scrutinized.

312
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,800
Scholars from humble backgrounds

313
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,240
who are capable

314
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
can all compete fairly.

315
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,920
The significance is extraordinary.

316
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,160
Moreover, this time it's especially permitted

317
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,880
for students from Xichen and Nanlang

318
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,520
to take the exam.

319
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,560
Therefore,

320
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,160
every single detail of this examination

321
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,960
must not be taken lightly.

322
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,440
Indeed.

323
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,080
What Prime Minister Zhang says is very true.

324
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,160
This examination is unprecedented.

325
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,080
It will affect the face of Dacang.

326
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,280
Prime Minister Zhang, who do you think

327
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:36,000
is worthy of this important responsibility?

328
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,520
Prince Xian has made notable contributions
to the disaster relief.

329
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,160
Along the way, the common people
sang praises of his integrity.

330
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,440
I think

331
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:47,120
perhaps this time we should let His Highness

332
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,800
take charge of the imperial examination.

333
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,840
Everyone knows that Prince Xian
and Prime Minister Zhang value the nobility.

334
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,440
If you were to be in charge,

335
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,520
wouldn't there no longer be the slightest chance
for the poor scholars throughout the land?

336
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,720
You have misunderstood.

337
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,160
Princess of Valor,

338
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:13,640
who do you think would be more suitable?

339
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:15,600
I think

340
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,440
it might be better to let Shen Du take charge.

341
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,640
Since when has Princess of Valor held
Great Chief Shen in such high esteem?

342
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,160
To actually have the Imperial Guards,
who are in charge of martial positions,

343
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,000
oversee the civil service examination.

344
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
Vice Minister Lai, your words are incorrect.

345
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,440
Choosing the virtuous and promoting the capable
is all in service of the Empress Dowager.

346
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,720
Although the Hongwen School examinations
are written tests,

347
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,840
the relevant arrangements

348
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,320
involve more than just literary flourish

349
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,240
but also require a firm hand to manage.

350
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,400
The Imperial Guards have always been
meticulous in their work.

351
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
They will surely make proper arrangements.

352
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,480
The Imperial Guards

353
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,400
are willing to share the worries
of Your Majesty

354
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,040
and give it our best effort.

355
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:50,640
Your Majesty,

356
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,400
Great Chief Shen

357
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
spends all day arresting people
and handling cases,

358
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,560
causing everyone to be alarmed.

359
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:58,440
Moreover, the Shen Mansion's inner quarters

360
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,240
are in constant turmoil.

361
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,280
He lacks the ability to manage his family.

362
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,640
If we let Shen Du take charge

363
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:05,200
of this imperial examination,

364
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,800
it really is

365
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,880
a disgrace to scholars, Your Majesty.

366
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,160
About the matters in my mansion,

367
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,400
Prime Minister Zhang is very clear.

368
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,520
Alright.

369
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,200
About this matter,

370
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
let me think about it.

371
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,600
I take my leave.

372
00:22:35,404 --> 00:22:37,521
[Shen Mansion]

373
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,368
Who?

374
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,960
Caiwei.

375
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,000
Please get up.

376
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,040
Liuniang,

377
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:15,000
it's me who has wronged you.

378
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,160
Caiwei,

379
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,440
why have you come back?

380
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,600
Where is Mr. Han?

381
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,960
It was you who suffered on behalf of me.

382
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,680
I discussed it with Mr. Han.

383
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,560
We might as well go home together
and apologize.

384
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:28,360
But, but I dare not go home.

385
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:34,080
I just have to hide outside the Shen Mansion.

386
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,200
I'm sorry.

387
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:38,240
Caiwei,

388
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,480
don't blame yourself.

389
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,600
Let's go home first.

390
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,280
We can talk about any issues when we get home.

391
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:44,320
[Yan Mansion]
Right, over there.

392
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,440
Come on, below it.

393
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,600
Right.

394
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,600
- Good.
- Come down quickly.

395
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,080
Sanniang and Liuniang have returned.

396
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:55,440
My Lord, Madam,

397
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,840
Sanniang and Liuniang have returned.

398
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,240
My Lord, Madam,

399
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,280
Sanniang and Liuniang have returned.

400
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,440
My Lord, Madam,

401
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,440
Sanniang has returned?

402
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,240
Yes, Sanniang and Liuniang have returned.

403
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,600
- Mother
- Caiwei.

404
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:12,240
Caiwei, you're finally back.
You had me so worried.

405
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,360
- Liuniang.
- Mother.

406
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:16,480
My poor, unfortunate Liuniang.

407
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,280
So the rumors outside are true.

408
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,240
- That White Ghost really dared to hit you?
- Mother.

409
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,480
With all your good intentions,

410
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,160
you took the risk to go to the Palace of Death
for someone else.

411
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,720
They are ungrateful.

412
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:27,800
Enjoying good food
and mother and daughter reuniting.

413
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:30,200
Only my poor Liuniang

414
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:33,120
was threatened and tormented
by that White Ghost.

415
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,240
- You were Beaten up.
- Mother, stop it, it didn't happen.

416
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,840
- It's all because
- Liuniang,

417
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,920
I was too selfish,

418
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,560
thinking only of myself.

419
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,040
Today, outside the Shen Mansion,

420
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,200
I heard them say

421
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,480
you were insulted by that White Ghost.

422
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:51,680
I'm deeply pained.

423
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,520
That White Ghost insulted you?

424
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,440
It should be a mutual exchange of insults.

425
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,200
If such a thing happens again next time,

426
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,760
I will put it all on the line.

427
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,160
We'll curse him together.

428
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,440
Mother, it really didn't happen.

429
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:07,120
Everyone is here.

430
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,960
Stop.

431
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:18,760
Liuniang, I heard that you were beaten

432
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,160
by that White Ghost.

433
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:22,360
Isn't it because you're too foolish

434
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:23,840
and are unable to serve your husband?

435
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,480
- You have a foul temper.
- You!

436
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,200
I tell you, you're…

437
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,680
- Caiwei, is it really you?
- Be quiet.

438
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,320
Didn't you elope with someone?

439
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,520
Reeking of alcohol.

440
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:37,320
Not returning all night.
What kind of state are you in?

441
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:39,680
- My Lord.
- What kind of state?

442
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,520
- My Lord.
- What kind of state?

443
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,960
My Lord.

444
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,760
Go back to your room.

445
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,680
You can't do that.

446
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,160
Father, I remember it.

447
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,360
On my way back just now,

448
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,720
it seemed like I saw that White Ghost

449
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,760
with a squad of imperial guards

450
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:56,200
charging towards our home.

451
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,600
Don't know who they want to capture.

452
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,560
Greetings, Great Chief.

453
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:37,640
Great Chief.

454
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,680
Shen Du,

455
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,520
all of this is my fault.

456
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,240
It has nothing to do with Liuniang.

457
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,200
If there's anything, let it all come at me.

458
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,656
Who are you?

459
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,800
Yan Caiwei.

460
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,176
Take her away.

461
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,080
Great Chief,

462
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,400
I am well aware

463
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,080
the marriage between the Shen and Yan families

464
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:27,840
displeased you.

465
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,960
I feel guilty about it.

466
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,560
But the marriage between you and Liuniang

467
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,160
has already taken place.

468
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,200
I hope you will consider the marriage

469
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,760
and show leniency, Great Chief.

470
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,240
Take away Yan Xing as well.

471
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,840
Take both people away? Great Chief.

472
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,680
You can't do that, Great Chief.

473
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,600
Don't move.

474
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,280
I, Yan Mojie, am here.

475
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,360
Nobody is allowed to touch
my Yan family members.

476
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
White Ghost,

477
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,080
do you really think you belong
to the Palace of Death?

478
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,280
You can take any one's soul

479
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,520
you want to take.

480
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,600
Is there no law and order anymore?

481
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,720
You shut up.

482
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:10,720
This guy

483
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,760
obstructed official duties.

484
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,880
Take him away together.

485
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,600
- Great Chief.
- Great Chief.

486
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,280
Please have mercy, Great Chief.

487
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,520
You can't do that, Great Chief.

488
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:24,920
Great Chief.

489
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:28,360
Please have mercy, Great Chief.

490
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,800
- Caiwei, Liuniang.
- Great Chief.

491
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:35,600
You can't do that, Great Chief.

492
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,864
Great Chief.

493
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,800
Shen Du,

494
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,360
what on earth do you want to do?

495
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,080
Yan Caiwei,

496
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,800
where is Han Shiyuan?

497
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,960
I…

498
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,200
I don't know.

499
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,520
He is now a murder suspect.

500
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:08,880
Are you sure you want to cover for him?

501
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,496
- What?
- What?

502
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Madam,

503
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,720
your absence from the Ministry of Justice today
has left you uninformed.

504
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,880
In a cornered well of the Hongwen School,

505
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,560
the body of a scholar was found.

506
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,080
Since the case involved a scholar
from the Hongwen School,

507
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,320
it alarmed the Empress Dowager.

508
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,320
The Empress Dowager instructed that the
Imperial Guards are to handle the investigation.

509
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,920
Currently, the prime suspect

510
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,800
is Han Shiyuan.

511
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:30,880
Impossible.

512
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,440
Mr. Han would never commit murder.

513
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,760
Do you think Han Shiyuan and you were

514
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,640
eloping for love?

515
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:39,480
But the evidence shows

516
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:42,640
that he is a murderer, fleeing from his crime.

517
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,600
How could it be?

518
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:46,240
Impossible.

519
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,480
Caiwei,

520
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,600
do you really not know

521
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,880
where Han Shiyuan is?

522
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,160
He must show himself

523
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:54,840
to prove his innocence.

524
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,720
As soon as we returned to Xiang'an,

525
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,120
Mr. Han disappeared.

526
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,840
I, I really don't know.

527
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,640
I really don't know.

528
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,920
Can I take a look

529
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,160
at the corpse of the deceased?

530
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,160
Inside the corpse's mouth and nose,

531
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,560
there is no signs of drowning.

532
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,840
It excludes death by drowning.

533
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
There are multiple bruises on the body

534
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,560
and there are signs of a struggle.

535
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,240
The time of death

536
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,680
was about a month ago.

537
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:10,800
Madam, the time of death
should be the seventh day of the fifth month.

538
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:13,608
Thank you.

539
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,960
The coroner from the Imperial Guards
is impressive.

540
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,960
To deduce so accurately

541
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,040
is admirable.

542
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,520
I have much to learn from you.

543
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,120
Madam and her weeping sister

544
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,480
really are quite different.

545
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,280
You're standing so far away.

546
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,680
Are you afraid the body
will decompose excessively

547
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,760
and suddenly explode?

548
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,520
No need to worry.

549
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,520
The decomposition is not yet at that stage.

550
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,560
It won't explode.

551
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,240
This is far too different.

552
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,640
Are there any other pieces of evidence?

553
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,760
From the bottom of the well,

554
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,640
a piece of clothing

555
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
and a notebook were also retrieved.

556
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,040
Upon examination, the clothing
is Han Shiyuan's.

557
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,120
The notebook

558
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,320
is from the day of the seventh.

559
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,400
It's the post-class test left by the teacher
from Hongwen School.

560
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,440
So the date of death

561
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,080
is deduced based on this.

562
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,080
Acquisition of the deceased's information

563
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,720
is not limited

564
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:23,280
to coroner's autopsy.

565
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,320
Case handling by the Imperial Guards.

566
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,200
- Where is Han Shiyuan?
- I don't know.

567
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,480
You, where is Han Shiyuan?

568
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,240
I don't know either.

569
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,360
Not telling me, huh?

570
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,440
Jing Lin.

571
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,480
What kind of questioning is this,
forcing a confession?

572
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,920
They are almost scared to death. Get out now.

573
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:44,680
I almost had it out of them.

574
00:32:44,680 --> 00:32:47,496
Let me do the questioning.

575
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,720
Madam might have forgotten

576
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,560
that she is also wearing the clothes
of the Ministry of Justice.

577
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,880
Usually very low-profile.

578
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,400
Not much interaction with us.

579
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,440
Excuse me,

580
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,520
during this period of time,

581
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:08,840
did you see Han Shiyuan?

582
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,640
The last time I saw Han Shiyuan

583
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,000
was on the evening of the seventh day
of the fifth month.

584
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,640
That day I passed by his dormitory.

585
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:15,040
After he said goodbye to his classmates,

586
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,200
he left.

587
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,920
On the evening of the seventh day
of the fifth month?

588
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,240
Are you so sure?

589
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,720
That day he went out and headed west.

590
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,120
I was about to greet him.

591
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,120
But when I turned around,

592
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,400
I saw flames to the east.

593
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,520
Then

594
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,040
I heard about the great fire at the Ming Hall.

595
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,560
So I remember it.

596
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,840
Han Shiyuan is one

597
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,640
of the most handsome students in our school.

598
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:36,640
He normally has little interaction with others.

599
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:37,720
Oh yes.

600
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:40,200
You can ask his roommate Lan Guizhou.

601
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,680
However, Lan Guizhou is a person

602
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,040
who is always reserved and gloomy.

603
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,880
He only talks to Han Shiyuan.

604
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,320
- Are you Lan Guizhou?
- Yes.

605
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:49,600
Did you see Han Shiyuan
on the seventh day of the fifth month?

606
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,160
Yes.

607
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,880
Shiyuan said he was leaving Xiang'an
to get married.

608
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:56,720
After saying goodbye, he headed west.

609
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,720
Okay, thank you.

610
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,240
Miss.

611
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,720
Miss.

612
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,159
Is there anything I can help with?

613
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,480
How come you are everywhere?

614
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:16,000
I'm here to collect the students' pawned items.

615
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,920
To investigate, one must be like her,

616
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,320
going deep into the field.

617
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,040
Her appearance while investigating

618
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:23,679
is truly valiant and spirited.

619
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,320
When can I take her as my teacher

620
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:30,520
and investigate cases with her?

621
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,000
Miss.

622
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,280
Anyone

623
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,400
must not interfere with Clerk Yan's

624
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,520
investigation.

625
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,160
What are you worried about?

626
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:12,160
I just feel something is not right.

627
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,824
Is there a problem with the evidence?

628
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,040
No.

629
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,960
But it's precisely because there is none

630
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,600
that I feel it's a bit strange.

631
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,336
Too perfect.

632
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,600
Come and look, take a look.

633
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
The testimonial evidence and physical evidence
are both overly conclusive.

634
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,320
So much so that it feels a bit contrived.

635
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,440
One can't rely solely on intuition
when investigating a case.

636
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,880
I only believe in evidence.

637
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,480
I also believe in evidence.

638
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,680
But what if the evidence is fake?

639
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,848
Look over here.

640
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,416
And here as well.

641
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,440
What are you doing?

642
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,960
Too dark.

643
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,440
Where is it dark?

644
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,160
This room is as bright as daylight.

645
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,840
I find it dazzling, okay?

646
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,360
Let's talk about the physical evidence first.

647
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:51,640
It's both the notebook
and the piece of clothing.

648
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,760
These two pieces of evidence.

649
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,760
As if someone is afraid of people

650
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,440
not finding Han Shiyuan guilty.

651
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,680
The color of Han Shiyuan's piece of clothing

652
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,200
is so conspicuous.

653
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,280
If it were torn off,

654
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,480
how could it not be noticeable?

655
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,760
Now look at this.

656
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,080
These two student testimonies.

657
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:05,560
Both say that on the night of the seventh day
of the fifth month,

658
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,680
they saw Han Shiyuan

659
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,160
and they are very certain.

660
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,560
But that day was the day of our wedding.

661
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,880
Caiwei and Han Shiyuan

662
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,680
ran away on the sixth day of the fifth month.

663
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,960
Running away might have been just
to avoid your Yan family.

664
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,360
Perhaps they were still in the city
on the seventh day of the fifth month,

665
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,760
watching you, the fool, take part
in the substitute marriage.

666
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,920
No, before our wedding,

667
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:24,920
Caiwei and Han Shiyuan

668
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:26,800
had already left the city.

669
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,160
You trust Caiwei this much?

670
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,080
Why did she have you substitute
in the marriage?

671
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,880
Caiwei had no other choice.

672
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,440
Who would want to marry you, the White Ghost?

673
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,608
So aggrieved.

674
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,200
Then you leave as well.

675
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,760
The Palace of Death doesn't welcome you.

676
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,000
I'm leaving then.

677
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:40,360
Bravo!

678
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,880
Bravo!

679
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,240
Bravo!

680
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:49,680
Wonderful!

681
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,248
Do it again.

682
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,120
Awesome.

683
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,560
Here it comes, the hanging ghost
is at the door claiming lives.

684
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:00,400
Here it comes, the hanging ghost
is at the door claiming lives.

685
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:03,048
Bravo!

686
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:06,344
Bravo!

687
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,920
Look!

688
00:39:17,152 --> 00:39:18,320
Caught.

689
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,680
The ghost has been captured.

690
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,600
- The ghost has been captured.
- Such divine power.

691
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,400
That's amazing.

692
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:27,560
Bravo!

693
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,600
What divine power do I have?

694
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,600
This is merely

695
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,640
the most common sleight of hand.

696
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,400
I operate the mechanism inside.

697
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:36,800
When I operate downwards,

698
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,280
what is shown on this white cloth

699
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:39,680
is an image projected upwards.

700
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,840
Everyone must remember,

701
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:43,600
if someone claims in the future
that they can use this magic

702
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,360
to catch ghosts,

703
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:48,600
that person is definitely a charlatan.

704
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,960
I see.

705
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,120
Now I know.

706
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,640
You're so direct in revealing secrets.

707
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,760
Aren't you afraid of ruining
your peers' livelihood

708
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,920
so that they'll give you trouble?

709
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:04,880
Mozi said,

710
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,680
"When the shadow reaches the end at noon,
the length of the shadow is determined by the end."

711
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,840
This was known by the ancients

712
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
thousands of years ago.

713
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,320
Therefore, I think anyone who is a scholar

714
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,520
should be aware of this.

715
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,280
So this is not any kind of secret.

716
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:19,160
Much less should we deceive the common people.

717
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:20,440
You

718
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:22,160
are quite interesting indeed.

719
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,920
Although you're in the Ghost Market,

720
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:27,280
you're a scholar with integrity.

721
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,920
I just heard Hongwen School

722
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,800
recruits scholars regardless of background.

723
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,800
I came to join in the excitement.

724
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:34,200
I see.

725
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,480
Let me wish you success in advance.

726
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:38,040
I usually enjoy reading idle books.

727
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,440
When it comes to the classics,

728
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:40,920
I can't really get into them.

729
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,480
I'm afraid I might not meet the standards
of Hongwen School.

730
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:45,960
I can only make a living

731
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,320
in this Ghost Market.

732
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:49,480
You're being modest.

733
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,240
I see you have a study

734
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,760
of this art of light and shadow.

735
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,680
There is one thing I would like to ask.

736
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,760
Don't be so formal.

737
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:59,920
Just call me Pan.

738
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,320
If you want ask about anything,

739
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,360
feel free to do it.

740
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,760
Whether it's the art of self-defense

741
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,400
or the way to manage a husband,

742
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:07,360
I know a thing or two.

743
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,400
I have no need for these.

744
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,960
In this contraption of yours,

745
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,120
originally there is no ghost.

746
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:13,880
Yet it seems as if there is one.

747
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,000
Do you know

748
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,160
whether there is a way

749
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,480
to make people outside feel as if they see him

750
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:20,560
when there is no one in the room?

751
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,960
There are no ghosts or gods in this world.

752
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,320
Nor does anyone know the true form
of ghosts and gods.

753
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,800
But it's different with the living.

754
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,360
Living people all look different.

755
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,840
It's not easy to disguise.

756
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,240
Exactly so.

757
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,080
Miss, you may articulate your question

758
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,440
and elaborate upon it.

759
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,240
For example, the time, the lighting,

760
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,320
the position within the room,

761
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,800
or the appearances of the people
inside and outside the room, and so on.

762
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,680
Okay.

763
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,240
Bravo!

764
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,720
What brings you to the Imperial Guards?

765
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:07,760
I have found the evidence.

766
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:10,360
Han Shiyuan has been wronged.

767
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:11,440
What evidence?

768
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,880
Follow me to the Hongwen School tonight.

769
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,520
I will have you capture the criminal
on the spot.

770
00:42:38,479 --> 00:42:42,297
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

771
00:42:42,297 --> 00:42:45,974
