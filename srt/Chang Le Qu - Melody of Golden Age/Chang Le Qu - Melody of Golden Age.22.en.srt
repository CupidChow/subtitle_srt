[A Land of Natural Beauty and Talented People]

16
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,520
Liuniang is married.

17
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,800
And Sanniang is about to get married soon.

18
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,920
Siniang,

19
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,040
you refuse to go home

20
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,040
with your husband so resolutely.

21
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,160
What are you going to do here
at your maiden home?

22
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,120
My husband asks me to go home

23
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,560
simply because he wants me

24
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,880
to live my desolate life

25
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,600
that appears splendid

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,920
for the reputation of the two families.

27
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,080
How is it any different from before?

28
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,960
Why can't I be like Liuniang

29
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,480
and focus on studying

30
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,160
to pursue a career path?

31
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,320
Even if I'm only an embroideress,

32
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,600
I'll be making a living

33
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,480
on my own.

34
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,160
But a divorced woman

35
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,720
will inevitably be judged.

36
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:37,200
The reputation

37
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,280
of our Yan family will be tarnished.

38
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,960
Even your sisters

39
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:44,240
will be looked down upon
by their husbands because of you.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,320
Father.

41
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:47,600
I grew up listening to you emphasizing

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,160
the reputation of our family.

43
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,920
Our reputation is indeed important.

44
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:53,080
But the price is too high if we have to

45
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,440
sacrifice Yijiao's happiness.

46
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,640
Our family

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,400
has gone through so much these days.

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,600
It wasn't our reputation

49
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,480
that got us over these troubles.

50
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:09,560
Honey, please take a seat.

51
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:14,080
Father.

52
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,960
Mr. Han surely won't look down on me

53
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,600
because Siniang gets divorced.

54
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,600
Nor would

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,680
the Great Chief

56
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,240
look down on Liuniang for this.

57
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,640
As long as we don't belittle Siniang,

58
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,640
who would look down on her?

59
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,480
Caiwei is right.

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,840
My lord.

61
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
We've finally settled down

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,920
and managed to live a peaceful life

63
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,960
in Xiang'an.

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,240
Why should we make the children suffer

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:43,720
just for our reputation?

66
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,760
Our daughter has grown up.

67
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,640
I'll leave you

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,080
to decide what to do.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
Thank you, Father.

70
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,399
Welcome, Jinzang.

71
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,680
Mr. Yan.

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,520
Come on in.

73
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,360
Here's a small gift.

74
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,360
- Mr. Yan.
- Please come in.

75
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,040
- Congratulations.
- Please come in.

76
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Come on in.

77
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,520
Liuniang.

78
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,560
- Your uncle.
- Uncle.

79
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,160
Mr. Zhang.

80
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,440
Please come in.

81
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,560
Please take the seat of honor.

82
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,944
That's wrong.

83
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,736
Shiyuan.

84
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,320
I'm here just to…

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,400
You should sit on the groom's side.

86
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,280
Yeah, the groom's side.

87
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,080
- Yeah.
- Of course.

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,440
Why isn't the wedding starting?

89
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,560
Liuniang.

90
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,880
Did your father really
agree to Siniang's divorce?

91
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,440
This time, he actually values

92
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,800
his child over his reputation.

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,800
That's good.

94
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,160
When it's your turn

95
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,920
to get divorced,

96
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:44,224
your father will be used to it.

97
00:05:44,224 --> 00:05:45,480
Me?

98
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,920
Your three-month deal
with the White Ghost is almost due.

99
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,320
Why are you reluctant

100
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,720
to get ready?

101
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,520
The White Ghost won't

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
make things hard for you, right?

103
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,280
Where hasn't he come yet?

104
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Vice Minister Lai.

105
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,160
Please come inside.

106
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,040
The wedding is starting

107
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:13,360
without the guests?

108
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,000
How can we start

109
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,320
without you?

110
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,560
What's wrong?

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,440
I serve in the court together with

112
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:52,120
Mr. Yan and you.

113
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,960
You are welcome here,

114
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,200
but I'm not?

115
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,200
Besides,

116
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,640
when Yan Sanniang

117
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,960
was dying from the poison of Chen Huo'e,

118
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,840
I provided her with the antidote.

119
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,680
I basically saved her life.

120
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,520
Why can't I come to her wedding

121
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,800
for a cup of wine?

122
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,952
You want a cup of wine?

123
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
Naturally, we will serve you.

124
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:50,440
Great Chief Shen, Vice Minister Lai.

125
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,560
What an honor.

126
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:58,376
Today is

127
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,360
my younger brother's wedding.

128
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,840
I am truly grateful to have

129
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,440
both of you here.

130
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,600
Why don't we get seated first

131
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,560
and catch up later?

132
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,016
What do you think?

133
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,056
That's enough.

134
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I brought the wedding gift

135
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,440
and won't disturb you any further.

136
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,559
Great Chief Shen, I take my leave.

137
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,400
Thank you for coming

138
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,000
to my daughter's wedding today.

139
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,880
What an honor!

140
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,320
That's right.

141
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:58,520
Please be seated.

142
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,920
Take your seats.

143
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,360
Please.

144
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:26,760
The auspicious moment is upon us.

145
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,200
Good.

146
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,320
Prime Minister Zhang

147
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,640
didn't bother my father
with the civil officer appointment.

148
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:46,320
Was it because you helped?

149
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,840
No.

150
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,192
Really?

151
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,536
Thank you.

152
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
Urgent report from Gannandao.

153
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,840
Urgent report from Gannandao.

154
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:30,160
Empress Dowager.

155
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,600
Urgent report from Gannandao.

156
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,760
Gannandao?

157
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,120
Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi

158
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,320
submitted a memorial,

159
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:39,800
stating that there have been
cases of cannibalism

160
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,480
committed by a "Half-faced Demon".

161
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,000
What?

162
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,080
They say the Half-faced Demon

163
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
acts when the victim is unconscious

164
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,600
and eats only one part
of the human body at a time.

165
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,640
The victims wake up, finding themselves

166
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,920
missing some limbs.

167
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,600
This is absurd.

168
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,480
How can we tolerate this

169
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,080
under broad daylight?

170
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,320
At first glance,

171
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
it's truly terrifying.

172
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,640
But if we think about it,

173
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:09,800
it shares some striking resemblance

174
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,920
with the Chen Huo'e case.

175
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,480
It's a fraud revolving around

176
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,200
supernatural powers.

177
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,880
Your Majesty, please look into it.

178
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:21,840
Rumors abound only when the truth is not clear.

179
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,520
I believe the top priority

180
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,160
is to send someone capable

181
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,720
to Gannandao as soon as possible

182
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,800
to assist Mo Qianzhi

183
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,240
unravel the truth

184
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,600
and quell the rumors.

185
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,440
Wan.

186
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,560
Who do you think

187
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:39,160
is the most suitable for this job?

188
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,960
I bet Your Majesty

189
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,560
already has someone in mind.

190
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,912
Clever girl.

191
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,400
Empress Dowager.

192
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,904
They have arrived.

193
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,000
- I, Shen Du,
- I, Yan Xing,

194
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,640
pay my respect, Your Majesty.

195
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,880
Great Chief Shen.

196
00:13:31,811 --> 00:13:35,821
[The Half-faced Demon devours people.
Please find the true culprit.]

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,080
Minister Shen.

198
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,800
You see?

199
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,320
Someone is trying to

200
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,800
induce chaos in Gannandao

201
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,680
with this case.

202
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:50,160
I remember that

203
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,000
you once had some connections with

204
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,760
the Yinzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi.

205
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,520
Thus, I am sending you and your wife

206
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,480
to Gannandao to look into this case

207
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,480
of the cannibal Half-faced Demon.

208
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

209
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:19,760
Senior Clerk Yan, please wait.

210
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,880
Bring Senior Clerk Yan the satin clothes.

211
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,408
Bring them up.

212
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,040
You just got married but you're already

213
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,880
heading to Gannandao to solve a case.

214
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,080
So the Empress Dowager

215
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,480
told me to prepare some satin clothes

216
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,520
for you to choose from.

217
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,720
This is…

218
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,000
A secret decree from the Empress Dowager.

219
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,040
Open it.

220
00:15:16,313 --> 00:15:21,136
[Mo Qianzhi is disloyal. Find his accomplices.]

221
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,840
Senior Clerk Yan,

222
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,160
I remember I once asked you

223
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,680
what reward you would like.

224
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,440
Empress Dowager,

225
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:34,840
from now on, please address me as Clerk Yan

226
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,080
instead of Mrs. Shen.

227
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,920
You don't wish to bear the title of Mrs. Shen

228
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,320
and aspire to be a female officer
of the Ministry of Justice.

229
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,240
The task I entrust to you today

230
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,040
is for you to fulfill
the duties of a female officer

231
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,400
to work for

232
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,320
the Ministry of Justice and me.

233
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,200
Senior Clerk Yan,

234
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,400
do you understand?

235
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,000
Yes, Your Majesty.

236
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,640
At your service.

237
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,240
Many supernatural cases
have occurred in Gannandao.

238
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,400
I fear that the Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi

239
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,280
is plotting treason.

240
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,880
I hereby order you to look into him

241
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,400
via secret investigation

242
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,080
and confirm whether
he has accomplices in the court.

243
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,240
The gray messenger pigeon

244
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,680
will convey your messages.

245
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,280
Did the Empress Dowager issue

246
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,520
this secret decree

247
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,320
because she suspected

248
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,560
no one but Shen Du?

249
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,960
Did she assign this job solely to me

250
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,640
because she knew that our marriage is a sham

251
00:16:59,640 --> 00:17:02,320
or was she trying to test me?

252
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:07,800
Why are you smiling?

253
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,240
The brocade tribute from Shazhou

254
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,960
features exquisite embroidery.

255
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,079
I am laughing at you

256
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,119
because you spent hours there

257
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,400
and ended up picking this.

258
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,079
The Empress Dowager must be disappointed.

259
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,440
Such embroidery patterns
can be seen everywhere in Xiang'an.

260
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,720
The Empress Dowager awarded it to me.

261
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,319
What matters is that I like it.

262
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:30,000
I actually find this embroidery
delicate and graceful.

263
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,160
Only the complicated ones

264
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,600
are tacky and gaudy.

265
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:33,720
Forget it.

266
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,400
As long as you like it

267
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,680
since it's a reward to you.

268
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,920
If Mo Qianzhi indeed harbors ulterior motives,

269
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,200
what do I do about Shen Du?

270
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:00,133
[Guangyue Restaurant]

271
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,960
I knew

272
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,720
my disciple wouldn't

273
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,800
invite me for tea

274
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,320
without a reason.

275
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,640
It turns out that

276
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,840
you want to ask me about

277
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,160
Yingzhou Governor Mo Qianzhi.

278
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,040
You should ask

279
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,920
your husband about him.

280
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:21,200
It's quite a reach

281
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,600
to ask me when the answer's close at hand.

282
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,640
Why?

283
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,160
Mo Qianzhi

284
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,240
used to be the top student

285
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,440
of Shen Du's father,

286
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:34,120
Shen Bingzhu.

287
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,320
No wonder.

288
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,200
So they're old acquaintances.

289
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,320
Not just acquaintances.

290
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,520
Mo Qianzhi

291
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,720
was a talent of great potential

292
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:45,280
and a promising career path.

293
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,560
But the Shen family committed a grave crime,

294
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:51,720
and he risked his life
to argue for his mentor's innocence

295
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,840
and send Shen Du to the detention center

296
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,640
instead of getting executed.

297
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:58,520
He himself was exiled to the borders

298
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,640
with no hope of promotion from then on.

299
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,160
What a pity.

300
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,440
What a pity.

301
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,640
I'm afraid you came to me today

302
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
because Mo Qianzhi

303
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,360
is involved in some cases, right?

304
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,640
You should remember

305
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,240
that I may have retired,

306
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,520
but my ability

307
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:29,640
to see through people remains unchanged.

308
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,040
You're worried that

309
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,560
if you look into him,

310
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,560
it will implicate

311
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:42,000
another person who's close to you.

312
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:45,080
Am I right?

313
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,720
Master.

314
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,400
I still have a lot to learn.

315
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,480
Whoever wants to be a proper investigator

316
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,200
has to go through

317
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
what you are undergoing.

318
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,440
No matter how trivial the detail,

319
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,560
or how close the suspect is to you,

320
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,400
do not be afraid to doubt them.

321
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,960
Be brave and seek verification.

322
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,280
Trust

323
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,480
could also be a drive

324
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,440
for investigation.

325
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,400
Alright.

326
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,080
I've told you everything.

327
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,200
Brew me another pot of good tea, will you?

328
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
Alright, Master.

329
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,440
That's more like it.

330
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:26,728
Alright then.

331
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:31,840
Shen Du is going to Gannandao?

332
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:39,000
Those things in Yingzhou…

333
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,640
Rest assured, my lord.
Everything has been taken care of.

334
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,320
If Shen Du is going,

335
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,880
let him go.

336
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,280
But he could be

337
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,000
lifting a stone to hit his foot.

338
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,080
My lord.

339
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:58,440
The letter from Lintai disappeared.

340
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,360
What?

341
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,880
The letter is gone?

342
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,200
I have looked into it.

343
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,160
The letter is nowhere to be found.

344
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:07,160
Besides,

345
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,760
the letter disappeared

346
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,720
during the Hongwen School examination

347
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,480
after Shen Du was appointed
the Guard of the Capital.

348
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,200
Well well, Shen Du.

349
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,040
Are you really

350
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:22,280
going to overturn the ruling on the old case

351
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,880
concerning your family?

352
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
Hurry up. Speed up.

353
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,280
I have prepared everything you asked for.

354
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,680
There were a few items

355
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,960
I couldn't find.

356
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,000
But

357
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,600
I managed to find them

358
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,360
at my father's pawnshop.

359
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,960
Would Uncle Lu let me have them?

360
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,320
Of course, I am his beloved daughter.

361
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,800
He would certainly agree.

362
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,120
Right, Marshal Xu said he had a mission

363
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,320
and couldn't see you off.

364
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,400
He told me to remind you

365
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,480
to keep the token he gave you.

366
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,040
If you ever run into trouble,

367
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,920
seek help from the local inspectors.

368
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,880
Right, I almost forgot.

369
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:01,320
Your pen pal Chi's letter

370
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,400
came to the Ministry of Justice.

371
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,864
Take a look.

372
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:13,720
Chi says that

373
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,520
she's on her way to Yingzhou.

374
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,520
Then I can

375
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,720
bring her all the gifts this time.

376
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,720
Master, all the rare items you wanted are here.

377
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:26,280
Am I not impressive?

378
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,160
Well, let's hit the road then.

379
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,360
- Travel safe.
- Master.

380
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,640
Take care, Master.

381
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,040
What are these

382
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,640
rare treasures for?

383
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,760
It's for a friend.

384
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,520
All this trouble

385
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,720
for a friend?

386
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,360
We have only one cart.

387
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,080
The load capacity is limited.

388
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:11,360
We're traveling light.

389
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,240
Leave behind

390
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
the unnecessary items.

391
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,920
Great Chief, don't worry about the load.

392
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,400
I just asked for two carts.

393
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,000
Madam can carry as much luggage

394
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,728
as she pleases.

395
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:32,560
This is a business trip,

396
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,680
not a tourist one.

397
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,440
Necessities only.

398
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,600
These are all necessities.

399
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:44,480
Liuniang.

400
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,920
Great Chief.

401
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:50,280
Liuniang, I brought you something.

402
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,400
This is medicine for sprains.

403
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,440
Cured meat. Salted fish.

404
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,640
And Caiwei and your father--

405
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,160
Mother…

406
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,120
We only have one cart and the load is limited.

407
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,320
Necessities only.

408
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,600
You don't have carts?

409
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:05,760
Your father has one.

410
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,920
They can bring it over now.

411
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:10,632
No need.

412
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,000
- Jing Lin.
- Yes.

413
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,520
Where is the second cart?

414
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,760
I-It should be arriving soon.

415
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:24,160
I'll go check.

416
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,840
Let's go.

417
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,360
I thought only one cart was allowed.

418
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,440
Just do as the Great Chief says.

419
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,120
I told you this is not an easy job.

420
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,280
Hurry up.

421
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,320
Liuniang.

422
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
It's your first trip

423
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,400
away from home and it's freezing at the border.

424
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,920
Be very careful.

425
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,600
If you run into trouble,

426
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,760
don't act tough. What matters is to stay alive.

427
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:44,920
Mother.

428
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,000
I am going to solve a case.

429
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,880
It's not like going to war.

430
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,520
Take good care of yourself.

431
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:52,800
Also,

432
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,000
tell Father to try

433
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,200
to avoid the strife

434
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,200
at court.

435
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:59,440
No matter what, wait for us to return.

436
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,480
Write me letters if anything happens.

437
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,040
I got it.

438
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,080
Don't worry about anything at home.

439
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,200
On the other hand,

440
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,840
we can't help you

441
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,280
if anything happens to you.

442
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,880
You must help each other out.

443
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
Mother-in-law, rest assured.

444
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,880
I will take good care of my wife.

445
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,328
Good to know.

446
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:32,552
[Chang'an City]

447
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,776
You woke up.

448
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,200
I thought you were going to

449
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,680
sleep all the way to Yingzhou.

450
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:11,080
I-I didn't sleep well last night.

451
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,760
I'm not usually like this.

452
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,800
The scenery outside

453
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
of Xiang'an is indeed different.

454
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:29,120
Madam, what's wrong?

455
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:32,480
Nothing, I'm just looking at the scenery.

456
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,560
May I read it?

457
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,056
Stop the carriage.

458
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,680
Stand guard around and turn around.

459
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,464
Understood.

460
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:58,480
Tell me whenever you feel unwell.

461
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,400
Thank you.

462
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:08,440
I just don't want you to throw up

463
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,440
in my carriage.

464
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
I'll be careful.

465
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,680
But your people are so poor

466
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,280
at driving,

467
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:22,200
going left and right all along.

468
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,320
We've been followed

469
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,600
ever since we left the city.

470
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,920
How do we shake off the tails

471
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,400
if we don't change lanes swiftly?

472
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,160
Scouts.

473
00:29:42,160 --> 00:29:44,200
North and west of the forest.

474
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,240
Change lanes now.

475
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,240
Understood.

476
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,280
I didn't expect that

477
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:51,400
we'd be followed by so many people.

478
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,560
This trip to Yingzhou

479
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,920
may not be an easy one.

480
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:38,960
Lead the caravan.

481
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,560
Take the original route.

482
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,440
Make sure you shake off all tails

483
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:45,040
and join us in Shanyang City.

484
00:30:54,933 --> 00:30:57,329
[Shanyang City Inn]

485
00:31:29,088 --> 00:31:30,360
Remember what I said.

486
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,880
No one should disturb them.

487
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,440
Rest assured.

488
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:38,120
Great Chief, Madam.

489
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:39,320
The room is ready.

490
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,360
You can rest

491
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,560
in your room after food.

492
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:46,600
Jing Lin.

493
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,160
Hasn't the luggage arrived?

494
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,360
Madam.

495
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,120
The luggage cart will arrive

496
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,440
in about an hour.

497
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,920
Great Chief, Madam has packed her luggage

498
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,680
with the ingredients for your diet.

499
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:23,640
Are you saying that

500
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,000
those big boxes she brought

501
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,200
were filled with herbs?

502
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,240
That's right.

503
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,240
Those are ingredients

504
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,800
Madam collected from various places.

505
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,320
I bet Madam didn't tell you

506
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,200
because you would be reluctant

507
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,064
to bring them with you.

508
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,760
Who's there?

509
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,416
Come here.

510
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:30,040
Master, help.

511
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,360
Help, Master.

512
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,808
Qi Yeyun.

513
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,320
Thankfully, you came out.

514
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,080
Otherwise, he would have strangled me.

515
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,864
Let me see.

516
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,800
Shen Du, why are you so harsh

517
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,960
on a kid?

518
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,560
What kind of kid sneaks around

519
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,560
outside someone's room

520
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
in the dead of night?

521
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,600
He's definitely up to something.

522
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,320
Weren't you also pacing back and forth

523
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,200
outside someone's room in the dead of night?

524
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,400
The sound of your footsteps kept me awake.

525
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,840
Were you also up to something?

526
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,360
I ate too much at night
and was trying to digest.

527
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,864
Jing Lin.

528
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,000
You shook off the tails?

529
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,840
Even the kid followed us here.

530
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:25,560
My apologies.

531
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I didn't follow you all the way.

532
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,719
I just followed you
to the outskirts of the city

533
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,280
and sneaked into the carriage

534
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,000
while no one was in it.

535
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:35,040
I hid in the carved cabinet under the seat

536
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,199
and ended up here.

537
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:41,920
Master, am I qualified to be your disciple?

538
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,239
I want to learn from you

539
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,480
and become an investigator like you.

540
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:47,480
Master, please take me in.

541
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:48,719
Stop.

542
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:50,560
Don't call me "Master".

543
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,960
Call me sister instead.

544
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,760
We need to discuss it properly.

545
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:57,240
Since you've followed us here,
you might as well stay

546
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,160
and come back with us to Xiang'an.

547
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,480
Thank you, sister.

548
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,560
Jing Lin, are there any spare rooms left?

549
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,760
Yes, I'll arrange for it.

550
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,880
Mr. Jing.

551
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,080
Who permitted you to do that?

552
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,720
You're right.

553
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,040
We were both commissioned

554
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:14,920
to work on the case by the Empress Dowager.

555
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,920
Can't I even

556
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,040
get a room for a staff member?

557
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,600
Brother-in-law, I don't need a room.

558
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,040
As long as you take me in,

559
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,640
I can even sleep in the woodshed.

560
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,440
What…

561
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,280
did you just call me?

562
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:38,840
Brother-in-law.

563
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,960
Sister wouldn't

564
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:41,200
let me call her master.

565
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:43,040
I should call her "sister".

566
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,720
Since I'm calling her that,

567
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:47,120
I should call you brother-in-law.

568
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,960
Isn't that right?

If you don't like that,

00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,120
I can call you Great Chief Shen

00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880

I shall drive him out right away.

What do you mean by "huh"?

Is it so difficult to look after a kid?

00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:49,120
Yes, Great Chief.

00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,720

Don't you have anyone on duty here?

Apologies for not welcoming you properly.

It's fine. Where is Governor Mo?

601
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:46,040
He's out for work. I've sent someone for him.

602
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:48,760
He will be here soon.

welcoming you properly.

Governor Mo.

609
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,800
Were you examining a corpse

610
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,840
just now?

611
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,520
How do you know?

612
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,200
People who deal with corpses

613
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,160
inevitably get the scent of death.

614
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
I bet you are

615
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,320

616
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,000
You are such a keen observer.

617
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,520
I truly admire you.

618
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,040
Xiang'an is quite far from Yingzhou.

And you're a young lady.

620
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,120
You must have endured

621
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,440
much hardship on the way.

622
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,200
Thank you for your concern, Governor Mo.

623
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:51,200
It was a smooth journey without much hardship.

624

Senior, how have you been lately?

625
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:58,680
Great Chief Shen, you flatter me.

626

Apologies for my negligence.

627
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:19,960

I haven't had time to prepare
a welcome banquet for you.

629

For the sake of the people,

630
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,920
why don't we work on the case first

What do you think?

634
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,320
That's inappropriate.

635
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,960
The Great Chief came all the way here.

636
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,240
Even if there's no feast,

637
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,640
you should prepare some tea

638
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,880
to welcome him.

639
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,280
But you prepared nothing.

Aren't you disrespectful to the Great Chief?

Great Chief, here is the case file.

653
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,040
This is a headless corpse.

654
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,520
Don't get scared.

655
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,680
She's quite bold.

656
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,040
Don't underestimate my wife.

657
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,640
The deceased is Li Kaixiang.

658
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,440
The suspect is his younger brother, Li Kairui.

659
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,240
They started arguing after a few drinks.

660
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
The younger brother

661
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:46,280
passed out drunk

662
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,360
and woke up only to find

663
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,120
his elder brother decapitated and the head

664
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:51,280
still hasn't been found.

665
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,320
Any clues?

666
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,600
Judging from the coagulated blood,

667
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:01,440
the victim should have been alive

668
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:03,600
when he was decapitated.

669
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,600
He was decapitated alive?

670
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:11,040
It seems like there are only two possibilities.

671
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,640
One is that the victim

672
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:15,440
was unconscious

673
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,160
and it was a quick death.

674
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,600
The other is that

675
00:41:18,600 --> 00:41:21,080
the murderer is an expert

676
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,440
who fought the victim and cut off his head

677
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,080
during the fight.

678
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,880
But I examined the body

679
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,040
and found no bruises whatsoever.

680
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:30,520
The coroner found

681
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:31,960
no internal injuries either.

682
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,800
So the second possibility is ruled out.

683
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,800
What a brilliant analysis.

684
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,320
Great minds think alike.

685
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,720
