00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,200
I dare not recognize you.

189
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:17,544
Shen Du.

190
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,120
You really aren't smart.

191
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,440
What a tough guy you are!

192
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,360
Here in the Imperial Inspectorate,

193
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,320
I've seen so many tough guys.

194
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,440
After a few times of torture,

195
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,880
those who don't want to talk,

196
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,680
can only ask for death.

197
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:45,760
But you could still

198
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,440
stare at me.

199
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:51,320
Indeed. You really deserve

200
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:54,320
to be my opponent.

201
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,360
The Imperial Inspectorate's torture instruments

202
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,680
are really something.

203
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,680
Fortunately,

204
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:09,320
I've had the experience.

205
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,840
You are so strong.

206
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
If you really died,

207
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,600
it would be a pity.

208
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,960
They call you as the White Ghost,

209
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,040
and me as the Black Fiend.

210
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:30,480
If you and I can get along well

211
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,200
and work together,

212
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,280
then

213
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,200
no one can beat us in this world.

214
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:41,440
It's a shame for me

215
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,840
to be compared

216
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:47,880
to someone like you.

217
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,560
You rejected me.

218
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,480
It is widely known

219
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,600
you and I are the Empress Dowager's right arms.

220
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,480
But do you know it?

221
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,560
She has long been suspicious

222
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,079
you and I have evil intentions,

223
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:09,000
making us monitor each other

224
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,560
and going against each other.

225
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:11,760
While,

226
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,760
she can take advantage of it.

227
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,280
After all, she's the most powerful woman

228
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,920
in the world.

229
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,240
She has the world in her hands.

230
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,824
Including you,

233
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,840
back then.

234
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,040
Has anyone told you

235
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,000
that the Shen family was framed

236
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,840
by the Empress Dowager herself?

237
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,200
And you…

238
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,120
You fool!

239
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,520
Yet you served your enemy

240
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,200
for so many years.

241
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,000
Where is the evidence?

242
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,280
Evidence?

243
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,280
Don't lie to yourself.

244
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,240
Over these years,

245
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,760
you should have realized

246
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,920
in the case of Shen Bingzhu

247
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,480
collaborating with the enemy,

248
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,880
there was more than one person

249
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,040
wanting him dead.

250
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,832
Why?

251
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,160
Because everyone knew

252
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:47,520
it was the Empress Dowager who wanted him dead.

253
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:54,320
Dozens of people,

254
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,560

except you, a fool.

256
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,200
You're talking nonsense.

257
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:16,200
You're talking nonsense.

258
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,400
You're talking nonsense!

259
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,480
Yes.

260
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,080
You've seen it.

261

The fire moth is me.

262

265
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,520
You've witnessed the power of the Huo'e Sect.

266
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,400
Why not

267
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,880

is already under Lai Luozhi's control.

273
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:56,920
So many officials who opposed him

274
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,360
have been assassinated.

275
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,360
On your way there,

276
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,120
you must be very careful.

277
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,200
Mr. Shen.

00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:15,960
will not happen again.

283
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,200
I, Yan Xing, must enter the palace

to seek justice from the Empress Dowager.

285
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:31,760
Remember to leave the gate open for me.

Yes.

288
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,680

00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,080
Don't go any further.

What if I don't?

291

Do you want

292
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,120
to continue assassinating
imperial officials in the street?

293
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,480
Is there no law?

Because only a heroine

00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:34,200
might be gone.

377
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,400
What do you call me?

378
00:30:48,694 --> 00:30:54,680
♫ May you also look up
to see the brilliant stars and moon ♫

379
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,416

Good.

397
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,880
The great power in the imperial court

398
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:28,800
is all in my control.

399
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,680
Only these inspectors

400
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:34,560
are out of my control.

401
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,480
Those remaining weak scholars

402
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:39,320
are even easier

403
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,880
to be handled with.

404
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,800
Now the inspectors lose their marshal,

405
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:45,960
naturally, can't make anything big.

406
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,840
The Marshal of Inspectors is dead.

407
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,800
Great Chief of the Imperial Guards

408
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,880
should face reality now.

409
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,160
Why brought me here?

410
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,000
On such a winter night,

411
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,200
I want to bring you here

412
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,920
to appreciate the special scenery.

413
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,520
If I didn't know

414
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,600
that Yan Liuniang is a spy

415
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,440
sent by Prime Minister Zhang,

416
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,280
I might have been moved

417
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,000
by your deep marital affection.

418
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,920
Today, your wife

419
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:12,320
has bravely

420
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,360
stormed the palace gate today,

421
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,720
kneeling for an entire day

422
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,240
in the heavy snow.

423
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:25,560
Vice Minister Lai,
you brought me here in the dead of night.

424
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,800
You don't just keep me company
to see my wife, right?

425
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,360
I am jealous of you.

426
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,440
Why are there always so many people

427
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,240
willing to fight for you?

428
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,920
Perhaps you still don't know.

429
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,120
To protect your wife entering the palace,

430
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:49,520
Marshal of Inspectors and his woman

431
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,000
even sacrificed their lives.

432
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,040
What a

433
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:59,016
tragedy.

434
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,400
Great Chief Shen.

435
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,800
Over these days,

436
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,080
I think you must have understood

437
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:14,360
how the world will be like in the future.

438
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,120
Great Chief, do you still remember it?

439
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,560
When I gave you the bottle of the heart blood,

440
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,000
you once promised me something.

441
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,080
Whether you are sincere or not,

442
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,400
I need you to stand by my side.

443
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:46,880
Of course.

444
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,720
That's good then.

445
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,800
I have always believed

446
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,400
you

447
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,440
are a man of his word.

448
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,256
Madam.

449
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,680
It snowed a bit.

450
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,800
It's just a pity

451
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,880
that today I couldn't meet the Empress Dowager.

452
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,360
Tomorrow,

453
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,760
I will go again.

454
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,960
Shen Du.

455
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:28,040
You're back.

456
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:30,920
Did the Empress Dowager release you?

457
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,016
It is Vice Minister Lai.

458
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,080
Vice Minister Lai.

459
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,600
Lai Luozhi released you?

460
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,960
Can't believe it.

461
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,360
What happened to your face?

462
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,840
Let me see.

463
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,160
Honey.

464
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,240
What's wrong?

465
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,368
Yan Xing.

466
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,200
Let's divorce.

467
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,360
What did you say?

468
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,056
You and I

469
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:41,416
get a divorce.

470
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:46,640
Divorce?

471
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:49,096
Why?

472
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,280
Have you encountered any danger?

473
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:57,280
Did Lai Luozhi threaten you?

474
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,320
What happened?

475
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:10,200
Shen Du, do you forget it?

476
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,200
I am Yan Liuniang.

477
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:18,760
I am the Chief Director
of the Ministry of Justice.

478
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,840
Although my rank is not high,

479
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,400
I have also experienced

480
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,480
many major cases.

481
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
I've never been

482
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,360
one who needs protection

483
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,920
on her husband.

484
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:34,080
I can stand by your side

485
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,520
and face the challenges

486
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,640
with you.

487
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,560
I am not afraid of trouble,

488
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,160
or difficulties.

489
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,480
No matter what happens,

490
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:46,520
I can face it all with you.

491
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,200
Are you afraid of implicating the Yan family?

492
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,680
Shen Du.

493
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:04,120
If Lai Luozhi wants to lay his hand on us,

494
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,000
even if you and I get a divorce

495
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:08,840
he will not let the Yan family go.

496
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:12,440
If we want to protect them,

497
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,440
we might think of a solution together.

498
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:16,920
Like,

499
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,040
sending the Yan family away from Xiang'an.

500
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,736
And…

501
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,984
Yan Liuniang.

502
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,120
It's not because of the Yan family.

503
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,280
Nor is anyone threatening me.

504
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,600
Actually, it is very simple.

505
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,200
After experiencing this period of time,

506
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,560
I've figured it out.

507
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,760
The Shen family

508
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,720
needs a wife who is educated and well-mannered,

509
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,000
and able to support her husband
and teach her children.

510
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,560
You cannot provide me

511
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,560
with a worry-free household.

512
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,840
Nor do you prioritize me.

513
00:41:57,840 --> 00:41:59,360
You're always trying to win

514
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:02,120
and show off.

515
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:06,120
You're not a good partner for me.

516
00:42:26,138 --> 00:42:29,956
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

517
00:42:29,956 --> 00:42:33,633
