[Episode 28]

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,640
Ms. Yan.

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,640
Is there really no way

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,920
to bring people back to life?

18
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,240
There is too much injustice in this world,

19
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,680
especially towards women.

20
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
At home, we must listen to our father.

21
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,320
When married, we must listen to our husband.

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,760
And we have to behave well.

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,200
If we make the slightest mistake,

24
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,160
we will be despised

25
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,520
and cursed

26
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,479
by others.

27
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,040
Think about it.

28
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,600
How ironic it is!

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,920
But if one only clings to these,

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,080
how can one ever seek

31
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,200
true fairness?

32
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Xiuxiu.

33
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,360
How did you know Mr. Mo?

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,360
And why do you call him so intimately?

35
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,400
He once saved me.

36
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,160
However,

37
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,360
he might have chosen me

38
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,560
as his sacrifice offering by then.

39
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,120
You really do resemble

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,560
Mo Xiuxiu.

41
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,440
But I am not Mo Xiuxiu, after all.

42
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,760
Stop, don't move.

What do you want?

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
Release Mr. Mo.

46
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,240
Mo Qianzhi is colluding with the Huo'e Sect,

47
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,400
perverting the law for personal gain
and wantonly killing the innocent.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,440
The Imperial Guards is ordered to arrest him.

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,880
Nonsense!

50
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,560
Mr. Mo protected the civilians

51
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,640
and fought to the death
with the Half-faced Demon.

52
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,720
When we executed the criminal Ji Dafu,

53
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,960
you repeatedly obstructed us.

54
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,520
I think you had ulterior motives.

55
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,680
Mr. Mo then ordered us

56
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,080
to be alert.

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,160
As expected,

58
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,480
we found out that you people

59
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,240
[Shen Du To Guangchun Clinic]
made a secret deal with the Half-faced Demon.

60
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,840
And now you want to take Mr. Mo hostage.

61
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,200
Are you trying to turn things upside down.?

62
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
You are framing us.

63
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,279
After Great Chief came to Yingzhou,

64
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,240
the Half-faced Demons

65
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,600
had continuously popped up.

66
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,839
Is this a coincidence?

67
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,240
Foolish!

68
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,920
You all are fooled by Mo Qianzhi's disguise.

69
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,040
Who exactly has captured you?

70
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,040
Xiuxiu.

71
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,520
Tell them the truth.

72
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,360
It's Mo Qianzhi who is in collusion
with the Half-faced Demons

73
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:35,000
and wants to use you
as the sacrifice offerings.

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,960
Shen Du, it's been so many years.

75
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,760
I never expect you'd become like this.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,120
Just give up and surrender.

77
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
You guys, release Mr. Mo.

78
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,760
It is Mo Qianzhi who has been
indulging the Half-faced Demons

79
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,640
killing in the city.

80
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,520

White Ghost, release Mr. Mo.

82
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,000
Governor Mo is a good official
who empathizes with the people.

83
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,800
He has our people in mind.

84
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,640
Do not frame and set him up.

85
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:06,640
Release Mr. Mo.

86
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,520
Release Mr. Mo.

87
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,600
What are you going to do?

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,160
Step back.

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,400
Do not accidentally harm the civilians.

90

I can't beat them,

91
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,200
nor can I reason with them.

92
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,000
These people of Yingzhou have gone crazy.

00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,360
Shen Du.

94
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,680
They've seen through

who's the bad guy.

96
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,760
What about you?

97
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,320
So this is your true scheme.

98

Wait!

99

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,480
Are you inspectors trying to rebel?

102
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,240
My apologies, Mr. Mo.

103
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
You all know

104
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,480
how troublesome we inspectors are.

105
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,280
Step back.

106
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,128
Let them go.

107
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,040
Hurry up, go.

108
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,920
Marshal Sun, thank you
for coming to the rescue today.

109
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,360
Great Chief, not at all.

110
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,720
Marshal Xu has already sent a letter,

111
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,440
ordering me to work with
Senior Clerk Yan to investigate the case.

112
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,200
It is my duty to do so.

113
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,320
If inspectors didn't come to rescue today,

114
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,640
the civilians in the city

115
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:47,200
might besiege us.

116
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,280
For the people of Yingzhou,

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,480
Governor Mo is indeed a rare good official.

118
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,920
He set up tents in disaster years,

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,640
providing porridge to the people for free.

120
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:56,200
He also led the yamen runners

121
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,960
to repair houses for the people

122
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:59,800
for free.

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,000
How would the civilians

124
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,280
think of such an official as a bad guy?

125
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,800
On one hand, he is a nice man
who's beloved by the people

126
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,840
and respected by his colleagues.

127
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,600
On the other hand, he is a madman
who pays no regard for human life

128
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,440
and believes in the cult.

129
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:12,560
It's really hard to tell

130
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,440
if he's nice or not.

131
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,360
Now, we can only temporarily
hide outside the city,

132
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,320
waiting to see how things go.

133
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,600
Sorry to make you all

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,560
to end up in this plight with us.

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,680
Marshal Xu trust you guys.

136
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,800
As the leader of the inspectors
in the Gannandao, I also trust you.

137
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:37,640
Great Chief.

138
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,040
It's the secret letter just received,

139
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,544
coming from Xiang'an.

140
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,200
The Empress Dowager has ordered the
surrounding counties to assemble their forces,

141
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,080
wanting me and General Zhenyuan

142
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,800
to capture Mo Qianzhi alive.

143
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,840
Yet Mo Qianzhi just drove us out of the city.

144
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,280
This secret letter came too soon.

145
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,640
Before coming here,

146
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,600
the Empress Dowager had summoned me,

147
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:06,880
telling me to keep a close watch on Mo Qianzhi.

148
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,320
Upon arriving in Yingzhou City,

149
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:10,880
a spy had made contact with me.

150
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,080
It must be Bi Qiu

151
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,520
who got killed not long ago.

152
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,080
I think he noticed something amiss,

153
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,160
and sent the message to Xiang'an early on.

154
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,440
In that case,

155
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,520
everything

156
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,760
in and out of Dacang

157
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,960
is all under the surveillance
of the Empress Dowager.

158
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:29,600
This shows

159
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,640
sending me to Gannandao
to deal with the Half-faced Demon

160
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:33,640
is also part of the Empress Dowager's

161
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,640
plan.

162
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,000
The Empress Dowager asked you
to take down Yingzhou.

163
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,039
If there is a war,

164
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,640
what will happen to the civilians in the city?

165
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,040
Let's hope things get better

166
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:47,440
before General Zhenyuan gets here.

167
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,280
Who is it?

168
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,080
Who is it? Come out here.

169
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
Qi Yeyun?

170
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,680
What are you doing

171
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,200
sneaking around there?

172
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,720
My sister taught me this.

173
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,560
I must observe everything carefully first.

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,960
Better safe than sorry.

175
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,720
I am Shen Du.

176
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,280
I have a word with Mo Qianzhi.

177
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,720
If you want to talk,

178
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,928
come up.

179
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,320
You dare to come alone.

180
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,440
Aren't you afraid I'll kill you?

181
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,960
I am here to give you an ultimatum.

182
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,440
Xiang'an is aware of your betrayal.

183
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,840
The Empress Dowager
has dispatched the Zhenyuan Army

184
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,400
to Yingzhou.

185
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:35,560
It's not too late to stop now.

186
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,600
It's not that easy for them

187
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
to take down the city.

188
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,720
Do you think

189
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:50,720
tens of thousands of people
in the city are following you,

190
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,640
and with those Half-faced Demons,

191
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,680
you can fight the royal court?

192
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,560
The will of the people

193
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,680
can withstand tens of thousands of soldiers.

194
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,360
Do you remember

195
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,200
the oath you swore to my father?

196
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,400
Be loyal to the country,

197
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,320
and not let the people down.

198
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,160
Shen Du.

199
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,920
I never thought you'd say that to me one day.

200
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,440
Don't you see

201
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
the current Dacang

202
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,480
is already full of rot and corruption?

203
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,520
It's only a matter of time before it collapses.

204
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,200
Then get rid of the rot and corruption,

205
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,200
instead of tearing it down.

206
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,400
The people of Huo'e Sect
have no regard for human life,

207
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,480
could betray you at any time.

208
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,000
Are you going to gamble

209
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,120
with the lives of these innocent people?

210
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,240
If you want to negotiate,

211
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,240
I have only one condition.

212
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,704
What is it?

213
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,760
Bring me the head of Mrs. Shen.

214
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,120
Then there is no chance for negotiation.

215
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,400
Du.

216
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,280
She is on the Empress Dowager's side,

217
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,040
a tool used by the Empress Dowager
to coerce you.

218
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,720
Without her, you will notice

219
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,360
how rotten

220
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,160
the current Dacang is.

221
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,560
You're the one blinded by hatred.

222
00:12:56,120 --> 00:13:01,120
You really did it wrong this time.

223
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,536
I was wrong.

224
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,520
You regard the murderer as your father.

225
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:24,200
No, as your mother.

226
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,160
What she eats every day

227
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,000
is by sacrifice

228
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,480
with the blood of your people.

229
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,000
What she enjoys

230
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,840
is built upon the bones

231
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,960
of your people.

232
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,400
If I was wrong,

233
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,440
then that makes you even more wrong.

234
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,040
You want to know the truth, right?

235
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,912
[Granary Reserved for Dacang]

236
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,840
This is a bag for carrying grain and fodder.

237
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,680
Why does the grain bearing the mark
of the granary from that year

238
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,480
appear in Gannandao thousands of miles away?

239
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,320
Shouldn't these have been destroyed

240
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,880
along with the fire?

241
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,840
Did it ever occur to you

242
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,920
that my teacher,

243
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,440
your father,

244
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,560
was holding on

245
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,960
to an empty Treasury?

246
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,000
I'll find out the truth myself.

247
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,920
But you are staking the lives
of the people of the city.

248
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:35,920
Laying your foundation

249
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,800
at the risk of massacring
all civilians in the city.

250
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
I would never agree.

251
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,752
Stop it.

252
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,720
I don't have much family left in this world.

253
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,840
I don't need you to agree.

254
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,400
There's no turning back.

255
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,120
I've been planning this for so long.

256
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:12,600
I won't let go at the last moment.

257
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,160
I remember

258
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,880
you're the one who wanted revenge.

259
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,840
Of course, I want revenge.

260
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,448
But I,

261
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,400
and my father,

262
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,520
would never take the lives
of the people of the city for revenge.

263
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,032
Great Chief.

264
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,760
Shen Du.

265
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,248
How is it?

266
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:24,120
No room for negotiation.

267
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,640
Jing Lin, where is General Zhenyuan now?

268
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,920
I've received a letter from Mengzhou,

269
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,560
saying the reinforcements
will likely arrive in three days.

270
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,960
I wonder how many soldiers
Mo Qianzhi has trained.

271
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,560
If all the men of the city defend the city,

272
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,200
there will surely be a fierce battle.

273
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,816
Not necessarily.

274
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,360
Mr. Pan, you indeed get things done quickly.

275
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:44,680
Great Chief Shen.

276
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:47,720
I've brought everything you wanted.

277
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,200
These are…

278
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,960
What do you need these bamboo sticks for?

279
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,120
Troops take risky moves,

280
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,320
and success or failure
hinges on this one action.

281
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:20,436
[Cang]

282
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,480
Are you planning

283
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,640
to take down Yingzhou

284
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,160
before General Zhenyuan arrives?

285
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,416
Mr. Mo.

286
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,360
People often say that

287
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,400
let bygones

288
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,680
be bygones.

289
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:24,760
But some pain

290
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,280
doesn't just exist in the memory,

291
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,960
but already deep in the flesh.

292
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,480
It vibrates with every breath taken.

293
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,440
And it is constantly destroying

294
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:43,400
and cursing,

295
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,920
"Why don't I go to die?"

296
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,200
And those who have not truly experienced it

297
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,520
could never possibly know it,

298
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,560
or could never teach others how to live.

299
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:20,240
Xiuxiu, do you think

300
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,920
I was wrong?

301
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,720
You are a good official,

302
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,320
a good brother,

303
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,560
and the best person I've ever met.

304
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,120
You saved me from the dead.

305
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,880
Not only did you save me,

306
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,800
but also helped Yingzhou a lot.

307
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,000
You haven't wronged anyone.

308
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,680
It is the world that owes you too much.

309
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,480
You, just like her,

310
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:02,520
always trust me unconditionally.

311
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,120
Yet I have let you down.

312
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:12,520
If one day she truly comes back to life,

313
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,000
I don't think

314
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,920
she'd recognize the current me.

315
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,360
If possible,

316
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I really want to know

317
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,000
what the original you

318
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,160
were like.

319
00:20:49,176 --> 00:20:53,980
[Yingzhou]

320
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,760
Guys, listen.

321
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,440
General Zhenyuan
and a hundred thousand soldiers

322
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
have already arrived in the city suburbs

323
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,440
to guard the civilians

324
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:20,080
and eliminate the rebels.

325
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,400
This is the last chance for Yingzhou.

326
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,440
We can spare you if you surrender.

327
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,400
If not,

328
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,800
we'll eliminate the rebels

329
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,640
and protect our people.

330
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:34,360
Mr. Mo.

331
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,640
Mr. Mo.

332
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,960
If the battle can be avoided,

333
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,320
I hope you could let the civilians in the city

334
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,200
unharmed.

335
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,280
Things are going

336
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
far beyond our expectations.

337
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,360
I heard General Zhenyuan

338
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,120
is cruel and warlike.

339
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,920
Moreover, with these hundred thousand soldiers,

340
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:49,080
they will surely

341
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,040
destroy Yingzhou,

342
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,480
and get civilians killed.

343
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:09,680
You are so indecisive,

344
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,480
impossible to achieve greatness.

345
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,840
Mr. Mo.

346
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,440
Master has a message for you.

347
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,720
Now is

348
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,280
the critical moment.

349
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:22,240
Must not be soft.

350
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,280
The people of Huo'e Sect
have no regard for human life,

351
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:26,440
could betray you at any time.

352
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,840
Are you going to gamble

353
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,960
with the lives of these innocent people?

354
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,120
For Yingzhou, for the people,

355
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
Mr. Mo has done everything.

356
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,560
Yet he got framed by treacherous people.

357
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,120
We must protect Mr. Mo!

358
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,320
Protect Yingzhou!

359
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,760
Protect Mr. Mo!

360
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,160
Protect Yingzhou!

361
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,640
Protect Mr. Mo!

362
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,120
Protect Yingzhou!

363
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,560
Protect Mr. Mo!

364
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,240
Protect Yingzhou!

365
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,800
Protect Mr. Mo!

366
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,360
Protect Yingzhou!

367
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,760
Protect Mr. Mo!

368
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,560
You are a good official,

369
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,800
a good brother,

370
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:02,000
and the best person I've ever met.

371
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:06,280
In the end, I have let Yingzhou down.

372
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:07,880
Protect Mr. Mo!

373
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,640
Protect Yingzhou!

374
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,280
Protect Mr. Mo!

375
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,920
Protect Yingzhou!

376
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,520
Protect Mr. Mo!

377
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:17,160
Protect Yingzhou!

378
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,960
Shen Du.

379
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,360
I, Mo Qianzhi,

380
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,720
want to fight you alone.

381
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:41,240
You and I have finally come to this point.

382
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,520
I taught you how to fight when you were a kid.

383
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,520
You never beat me in the past.

384
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,360
You're picking up pretty fast

385
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,480
what I just taught you.

386
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,560
Study earnestly,

387
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,920
so one can make rapid progress.

388
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,880
I'm going to beat you one day.

389
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,600
Then you have to hurry.

390
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,600
I aim to be

391
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:30,000
the top warrior in Dacang,

392
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,120
galloping across the battlefield

393
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,920
and loyally serving my country.

394
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,520
This time, it's my turn to win.

395
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,968
What should we do?

396
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,440
Senior.

397
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,920
I am getting old,

398
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,160
and I can't react as fast as you anymore.

399
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:03,920
Protect Mr. Mo!

400
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,880
You came to fight me

401
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,200
because you couldn't
abandon the people of Yingzhou.

402
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,240
Open the gate.

403
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
No need to fight anymore. That's great!

404
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,160
No need to fight anymore. That's great!

405
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:35,744
[Cang]

406
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:45,120
What a bluff!

407
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,800
Du.

408
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,040
Over these years,

409
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,520
you've really improved.

410
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,880
You won.

411
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,240
If you don't care about the people,

412
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:34,880
you might notice such tricks.

413
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,680
I was betting

414
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,200
you won't risk the lives
of the people of Yingzhou.

415
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:46,120
So you didn't lose.

416
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:49,240
When will the reinforcements arrive?

417
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,560
Tomorrow.

418
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,360
And how will you explain it then?

419
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,640
Mo Qianzhi is manipulated by the cult,

420
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,880
overestimating his abilities.

421
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,040
Yingzhou is short of military force,

422
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,040
cannot withstand a single blow.

423
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,720
There are still many people in the city

424
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,800
convincing that you are manipulated

425
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,120
by the Huo'e Sect

426
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,560
and pleading for you.

427
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,080
Tell me how you
and the leader of the Huo'e Sect

428
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,360
make connection.

429
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:53,120
People laugh at the moths flying into the flame

430
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,040
while moths survive the fire

431
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,160
and await reincarnation.

432
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,600
Coming back to life is a fallacy.

433
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,160
Heaven blesses.

434
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:15,600
Even the mayflies that are
born in the morning and dead by evening

435
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:18,160
will enter the reincarnation.

436
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,080
How could one not enter the cycle of death?

437
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,120
Moths passing through flames
will only turn to ashes,

438
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,920
cannot enter the reincarnation.

439
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:26,000
How can they come back to life?

440
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,640
Is the person you've seen

441
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,680
Chen Huo'e?

442
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,960
I told you

443
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,920
not to get involved,

444
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:43,920
yet, you insisted.

445
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,040
Actually, I've never reported

446
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,920
the matter of the Half-faced Demon
causing trouble.

447
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,520
Someone has been using my name.

448
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,680
From the very beginning,

449
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:54,360
you've fallen into someone's trap.

450
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,480
Why would one do so?

451
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:06,360
Before we arrive Xiang'an

452
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,440
and meet the Empress Dowager,

453
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,920
I won't say a word.

454
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,360
No matter what,

455
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,600
you are still my senior.

456
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,280
Ms. Yan.

457
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,120
Ms. Yan.

458
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,600
- Xiuxiu.
- Ms. Yan.

459
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:38,240
Why are you here?

460
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,800
Does Mo Qianzhi have to die?

461
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:44,920
Once in Xiang'an,

462
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,480
the Empress Dowager will judge for herself.

463
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,440
The journey is long.

464
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:53,120
May I give him some food?

465
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:58,320
Rest assured, we will take care of him.

466
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,040
Anyway,

467
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,880
Mr. Mo

468
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,440
gave me this name.

469
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,760
You are here

470
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,320
not just for this, right?

471
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,216
Please.

472
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Please help me.

473
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,280
Jing Lin.

474
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:27,480
I want to see Mo Qianzhi.

475
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,520
I'm not like other girls.

476
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:34,680
I knew what Mr. Mo wanted to do.

477
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,200
I did it willingly.

478
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,840
Xiuxiu.

479
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,328
Stop.

480
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,880
You shouldn't be here.

481
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,544
Go back.

482
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,280
Liuniang.

483
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:55,304
Don't come closer.

484
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,920
I just want to see you

485
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,160
and talk to you.

486
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,000
Well,

487
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,920
the days when you were around

488
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:14,199
were the happiest days of my life.

489
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:15,960
Without you,

490
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,560
I'd be dead already.

491
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Thank you for giving me a name.

492
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,480
Xiuxiu.

493
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,880
What a beautiful name!

494
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:01,224
Xiuxiu.

495
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,280
But I know

496
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,240
whenever you call her name,

497
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,680
it's so different.

498
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,640
I know

499
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,960
there's always only one thing you want.

500
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,520
That is to bring Xiuxiu back to life.

501
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,640
Mr. Mo, I'm gone.

502
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,160
Xiuxiu.

503
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:51,200
Xiuxiu, Xiuxiu.

504
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,280
Mr. Mo, Xiuxiu is here.

505
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,816
Xiuxiu.

506
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:17,080
Why did you do so?

507
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,840
Du.

508
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:33,320
Ask everyone to step back.

509
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,720
You come here, I have something to tell you.

510
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,480
Du.

511
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,520
I know that you have come
out of the detention center.

512
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,000
And I heard you've become
the Chief of the Imperial Guards.

513
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,080
And I heard you've become cold-blooded,

514
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:10,920
cruel and ruthless.

515
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:13,720
But I'm still glad

516
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,560
that only you've survived in the Shen family.

517
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,400
If you were still so mild and soft,

518
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,000
how would you avenge my teacher

519
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,720
and all the others in the Shen family?

520
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,360
After establishing the Imperial Guards,

521
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,280
I've been investigating all the way.

522
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:33,560
On the surface, the evidence
in the Shen family case

523
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:34,760
is solid and flawless.

524
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,560
But I still found something suspicious.

525
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:40,120
It's not something

526
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,080
one person could do alone.

527
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,200
Shen Bingzhu had a naturally mild nature,

528
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,560
never wanting
to get involved in court disputes.

529
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,440
All he cared about is the people.

530
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,400
No matter what happened,

531
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,200
he only did what he should do,

532
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:00,880
as long as the civilians can live well.

533
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,320
But that alone

534
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,480
offended others' interests.

535
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,120
What the Empress Dowager
you are loyal to wanted

536
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:09,120
was his submission.

537
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,880
The ones who killed
the people of the Shen family

538
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,040
are the people of the Zhou family.

539
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,920
I will definitely find out
what happened back then,

540
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:20,480
no matter how many years it takes,

541
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,840
no matter who did it.

542
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:26,160
I will always get justice from them

543
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,800
to console

544
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,520
those souls of the Shen family.

545
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,880
Du.

546
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:37,520
I've never thought

547
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,000
you and I would go against each other

548
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,640
because of the same hatred.

549
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,040
If you did make it one day,

550
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,880
remember to offer me an incense,

551
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:47,920
so I could rest in peace

552
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,920
in the underworld.

553
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,360
Senior.

554
00:38:56,695 --> 00:38:59,400
♫ Grudges and karma, right and wrong ♫

555
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,920
Behind Xiuxiu's painting,

556
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,320
there is something I want

557
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,480
♫ A parting lasting for years ♫

558
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:05,560
to give you.

559
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:09,175
♫ Keeps the truth hidden ♫

560
00:39:09,175 --> 00:39:12,360
♫ Fate is full of twists and turns ♫

561
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,600
Senior.

562
00:39:15,575 --> 00:39:20,511
♫ Let the wind take away obsessions and lies ♫

563
00:39:20,511 --> 00:39:26,783
♫ Through storms and uncertainties,
I devote myself to you ♫

564
00:39:26,783 --> 00:39:32,991
♫ At least you share my joy and sorrow ♫

565
00:39:32,991 --> 00:39:39,370
♫ Unraveling mystery fearlessly in this dream ♫

566
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:46,545
♫ Hand in hand with you,
I wander this splendid world ♫

567
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,880
Ghosts!

568
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,720
Retribution has come!

569
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,000
This happens just after Mr. Mo died.

570
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,320
This is divine retribution!

571
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,720
They got poisoned.

572
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:57,224
Move.

573
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:01,520
Great Chief.

574
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,000
There are already many places in the city
where such weird things happened.

575
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,560
It's absolutely terrifying.

576
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,480
The number of victims has reached more than 30.

577
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:10,960
If this continues,
I'm afraid it will lead to chaos.

578
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,680
It's by the Huo'e Sect.

579
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,160
If we can't find a solution,

580
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,880
then the Huo'e Sect would poison

581
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,680
all the people of Yingzhou

582
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:21,000
effortlessly.

583
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,960
Although the poison is potent,

584
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,400
its onset is very slow.

585
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,560
There is no immediate threat to their lives.

586
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:31,520
I'll find a way to get the antidote.

587
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,960
Yes.

588
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:34,560
You take care of this.

589
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,904
Yes.

590
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,600
Behind Xiuxiu's painting,

591
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:52,680
there is something I want to give you.

592
00:42:39,607 --> 00:42:43,425
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

593
00:42:43,425 --> 00:42:47,102
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

594
00:42:47,102 --> 00:42:51,799
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

595
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,743
♫ We are forever bound ♫

596
00:42:54,743 --> 00:42:58,198
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

597
00:42:58,198 --> 00:43:01,745
♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫

598
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:06,719
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

599
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:09,663
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

600
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:14,175
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

601
00:43:14,175 --> 00:43:17,503
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

602
00:43:17,503 --> 00:43:19,103
♫ Your palm lines ♫

603
00:43:19,103 --> 00:43:21,866
♫ Your gaze ♫

604
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:24,927
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

605
00:43:24,927 --> 00:43:29,183
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

606
00:43:29,183 --> 00:43:33,215
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

607
00:43:33,215 --> 00:43:34,655
♫ Your palm lines ♫

608
00:43:34,655 --> 00:43:37,215
♫ Your gaze ♫

609
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:40,095
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

610
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:44,889
♫ You are the one for me ♫

611
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:01,486
♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

612
00:44:01,486 --> 00:44:05,156
♫ Every moment is treasured ♫

613
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:09,815
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

614
00:44:09,815 --> 00:44:12,848
♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

615
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:16,074
♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

616
00:44:16,074 --> 00:44:19,814
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

617
00:44:19,814 --> 00:44:24,831
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

618
00:44:24,831 --> 00:44:27,711
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

619
00:44:27,711 --> 00:44:31,999
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

620
00:44:31,999 --> 00:44:35,775
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

621
00:44:35,775 --> 00:44:37,345
♫ Your palm lines ♫

622
00:44:37,345 --> 00:44:40,095
♫ Your gaze ♫

623
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:43,007
♫ Our love is deepening ♫
