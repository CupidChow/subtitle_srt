00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,640
This whistle was given to me by my dad.

184
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,840
Look, there's the character "Shen" on it.

185
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:28,000
♫ Who will guide me through right and wrong ♫

186
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,160
I'll go first.

187
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,600
Otherwise, they'll come to catch me again.

188
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,528
♫ Who will guide me through grudges and karma ♫

189
00:12:33,528 --> 00:12:36,560
♫ Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape ♫

190
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,760
Will you come back?

191
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,240
Of course.

192
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
Someday

193
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,400
I will overturn the case for the Shen family

194
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:47,480
and take you out with honor and integrity.

195
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,040
When you were in the detention center,

196
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,200
it was such a difficult situation

197
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,000
and you could get through it.

198
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,680
This time,

199
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:03,720
you can surely turn misfortune
into fortune too.

200
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,920
So it really was you.

201
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,360
You will.

202
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,872
You will.

203
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,520
Great Chief Shen,

204
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,320
even if you are sick,

205
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,480
you must stay spirited.

206
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:29,560
Change into some fresh clothing.

207
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,520
Perhaps it could speed up the recovery.

208
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,240
Fortunately, it was you.

209
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:10,200
I've stitched up the wound.

210
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:13,720
He's lying here

211
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:16,680
just like any other corpse.

212
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,640
I've dissected so many male corpses.

213
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,240
Am I afraid to change his clothes?

214
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
He places this wicker piglet under his pillow

215
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,120
every night.

216
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,120
The handwriting on the letter
is delicate and graceful.

217
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:13,400
It must come from the woman he can't forget.

218
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:20,360
Rest assured.

219
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,000
I won't cling to you.

220
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,520
You saved me.

221
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,680
I took care of you.

222
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:30,240
We are even now.

223
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,560
When the three months are up,

224
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,480
I will divorce you as promised.

225
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:46,360
Three months.

226
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,840
Divorce as promised?

227
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
What did I hear?

228
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,880
- Chuichui.
- Liuniang.

229
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
How did you get here?

230
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,280
Such a big thing happened.

231
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,600
How could I not come?

232
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:03,960
After this morning's court session,

233
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
all Six Ministries are talking about it.

234
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,520
The White Ghost was fatally wounded
by Chen Huo'e.

235
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:11,040
Is he going to pass away?

236
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,600
He is badly injured, but…

237
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,640
But what?

238
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,280
You're going to worry me to death.

239
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,480
Liuniang,

240
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:20,200
what exactly happened
between you and White Ghost?

241
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,800
Nothing.

242
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:25,760
At this point, you still want
to hide it from me?

243
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:29,120
You two are a fake couple?

244
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
Chuichui, you must keep this a secret for me.

245
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,440
I had no other choice.

246
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
Did Shen Du threaten you?

247
00:16:38,840 --> 00:16:41,120
Most certainly.

248
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
Three months.

249
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,880
Then you could escape

250
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,240
from the White Ghost's lair?

251
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,640
That would be a good thing.

252
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,080
But,

253
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,040
in his current condition,

254
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,160
what if he won't wake up in three months?

255
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,360
It won't happen.

256
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,400
He will definitely wake up.

257
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,080
But what if he won't wake up?

258
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
Will you just keep guarding him like this?

259
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,480
He became like this trying to save me.

260
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,599
Yes, I know.

261
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:09,119
But you have to think for yourself.

262
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,528
In case,

263
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,839
he…

264
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:16,480
Will you just keep living like a widow for him?

265
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,800
Bah. What nonsense are you talking about?

266
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,480
- You say bah.
- Bah.

267
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,599
Since the two of you are a fake couple,

268
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,599
no matter what happens to him,

269
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,800
you have to plan for yourself.

270
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,880
Just think,

271
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,840
when you return
to the Yan Mansion in the future,

272
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:31,320
if you end up as a divorced woman,

273
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,440
your family's madame

274
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
along with your siblings,

275
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,000
will they still give you good days to live?

276
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,280
Wouldn't you and Lady Jin

277
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:41,920
be subjected every day
to all kinds of disdain and exclusion?

278
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,280
I think it's better for you

279
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,400
to find another good man to remarry.

280
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,600
No, Chuichui,

281
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,920
what are you talking about?

282
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,208
The Ministry of Justice.

283
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:56,640
I think the Ministry of Justice seems
to have no good men to remarry.

284
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,000
Jiang Langxing.

285
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,640
Why not consider Jiang Langxing?

286
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,640
Although Jiang Langxing

287
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,960
always

288
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,200
has a sour face

289
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,800
and behaves properly,

290
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,560
he truly is a good man.

291
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,360
At times, he's quite adorable. He is good.

292
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,320
You want to set me up with Jiang Langxing?

293
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,744
Isn't he good?

294
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:25,600
Alright. I'll think about it some more.

295
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:27,800
I've thought

296
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,320
of a more suitable candidate.

297
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
Marshal Inspector.

298
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,960
Although Marshal Xu

299
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,320
comes from humble origins,

300
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,480
he is tall and imposing

301
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,560
and has a generous character.

302
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:42,760
If you can't become

303
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,400
the lady of the Shen family,

304
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,040
being Marshal Inspector's wife

305
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,680
would also carry great prestige.

306
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,640
Mr. Xu is a good man,

307
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,800
but I have no personal feelings for him.

308
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,640
Chuichui, please don't keep playing
matchmaker anymore.

309
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,680
Affection can be cultivated.

310
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,880
From Marshal Xu's appearance,

311
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,240
at first glance, he is

312
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,640
someone who would dote on his wife.

313
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,200
That's so much better.

314
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,920
That's better than being with the White Ghost

315
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:06,920
who annoys you all day long.

316
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,080
I am only injured,

317
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,200
not dead.

318
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:16,920
Shen Du.

319
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,080
You are awake.

320
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,760
Take it slow.

321
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,088
Lu Chuichui,

322
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,680
it's not your place to run to my mansion

323
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,920
and point fingers.

324
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,808
Get out!

325
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:38,200
Liuniang,

326
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:39,200
I'll wait for you outside.

327
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,800
You…

328
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:44,072
Slow down.

329
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,440
You…

330
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,960
When did you wake up?

331
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,920
Just now.

332
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,368
Just now?

333
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,040
You just

334
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,040
suddenly…

335
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,800
I just woke up all of a sudden.

336
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,584
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

337
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,720
If it weren't for you,

338
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:41,480
I would have died at the hands of Chen Huo'e.

339
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:44,240
You got so seriously injured because of it.

340
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,880
It's Chen Huo'e who was wrong,

341
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,256
not you.

342
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,600
Weren't these injuries on me

343
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,880
treated by you?

344
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,320
Where's the body of Chen Huo'e?

345
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,120
At the time, you were injured.

346
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,400
Jing Lin and I rushed to bring you back.

347
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,040
The corpse of Chen Huo'e

348
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,640
was secretly taken away by someone.

349
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,360
Jing Lin went to investigate overnight

350
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:22,280
and speculated that it was someone
from the Imperial Inspectorate

351
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:25,200
who took her corpse.

352
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,240
Lai Luozhi.

353
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,600
I'm thinking,

354
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:32,880
Chen Huo'e's previous disappearance

355
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,800
was a dereliction of duty by Lai Luozhi.

356
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,160
Now the people from the Imperial Inspectorate

357
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,640
have stolen Chen Huo'e's corpse.

358
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm afraid there must be a scheme.

359
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,720
We might as well wait a bit.

360
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
Use stillness to control action.

361
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,280
Let's see what move they will make.

362
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,440
You should rest well first.

363
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,360
Housekeeper.

364
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,160
The Great Chief has already woken up.

365
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,640
Go quickly and ask
the physician to take a look.

366
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,000
My Lord has awoken.

367
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,120
Thank goodness.

368
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:48,240
Quick, go call the physician.

369
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,640
Liuniang.

370
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,120
Chuichui.

371
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:06,280
You have finally come out.

372
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,560
You go manage these people of the Shen Mansion.

373
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:09,960
Mrs. Shen's good friend is here.

374
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,680
Not even providing me with a meal.

375
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:13,680
Miss Lu,

376
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:16,160
are you lacking silver?

377
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,720
You don't know.

378
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,000
The new plays at the Furong Garden

379
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,520
are really good.

380
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,800
The actor's performance is absolutely stunning.

381
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:27,120
I just

382
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,760
used my pocket money to tip them.

383
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,360
My father has cut off

384
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,560
my pocket money.

385
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,640
And this month's allowance
hasn't been issued yet.

386
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,040
Well,

387
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,200
we are besties.

388
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,480
Just say whether you'll take care
of the meal or not.

389
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,400
Mr. Shen.

390
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,440
Coming.

391
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,440
What's your order?

392
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,640
Please arrange for Chuichui and Miss Yun Que

393
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
to have their meals.

394
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,480
Prepare another meal box.

395
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
- I will take it to the main bedroom.
- Alright.

396
00:23:58,320 --> 00:23:59,640
Yan Liuniang,

397
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,720
we rarely get to have a meal together.

398
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,600
Won't you join me?

399
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
Shen Du is bedridden with injuries.

400
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,680
He just woke up and can't be left alone.

401
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,440
There are so many people in the Shen Mansion.

402
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,080
They won't miss one person.

403
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,840
Yun Que,

404
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,800
weren't you the one claiming
that you would marry the White…?

405
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,160
Shen Du?

406
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,680
Shen Du was seriously injured.

407
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:38,440
You're not going to claim your merits.

408
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:41,000
Instead, you're here seeking tranquility.

409
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,200
I see through it.

410
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,440
You see through it?

411
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,840
She sees through it.

412
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:53,080
The White Ghost is not a good person?

413
00:24:53,080 --> 00:24:54,760
Not a good match?

414
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:57,680
During this time, I have indeed seen
one thing clearly.

415
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,680
Yan Xing,

416
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,040
your ambition lies not with being Mrs. Shen.

417
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,160
Why spend a lifetime at the Shen Mansion?

418
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,640
Well said.

419
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,440
You two are still in the Shen Mansion.

420
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,520
Keep your voices down.

421
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:16,840
Madam, the food you want is ready.

422
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,872
Servant!

423
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:48,320
At your service.

424
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,560
Carry out my orders.

425
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,960
Now that they have entered the game,

426
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:54,120
let's add

427
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:56,280
a bit more spice to it.

428
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,880
Right?

429
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,680
Let me tell you, he really is super handsome.

430
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,520
You're absolutely right.

431
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,280
In just the time it takes for a meal,

432
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,760
you two have become so intimate.

433
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,760
My meeting with Yun Que was very joyful.

434
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,120
As if we were old friends at first sight.

435
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,760
Close like sisters.

436
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,480
Chuichui and I both believe

437
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,520
that only women truly understand women.

438
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,040
Our fate should not be decided by others.

439
00:26:41,040 --> 00:26:44,880
Exactly, we should find our own path forward.

440
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,040
Therefore, we have decided

441
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,880
to invite you to join us in three days

442
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,840
to seek marriage fate together
at Mingsheng Temple.

443
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:52,880
Mingsheng Temple?

444
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,880
Praying for a marriage match?

445
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,160
You don't really want

446
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:00,960
to be Mrs. Shen
for the rest of your life, do you?

447
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,920
Although I've lost interest in Shen Du,

448
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:06,920
could it be that you and Shen Du
are really a harmonious couple?

449
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:09,280
The three-month agreement no longer counts?

450
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,160
Of course, it counts.

451
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,480
Then why are you hesitating?

452
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,680
You couldn't be

453
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,480
in love with the White Ghost, could you?

454
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:28,360
When the agreed time comes,

455
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,880
I will naturally leave him.

456
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,120
I am only focused on career and reputation.

457
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:37,080
I haven't thought about remarriage.

458
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,120
Marital fate and career success
are not mutually exclusive.

459
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,520
Exactly.

460
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,000
Three days later, we'll go
to Mingsheng Temple first

461
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,520
and pray for a marriage match.

462
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:46,800
It's settled then.

463
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:49,480
Oh right. In my room, there are
freshly pickled fruits.

464
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,600
I don't feel like eating recently.
Please go try some.

465
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,600
I want to eat them.

466
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,560
Let's go.

467
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,200
We're leaving. Don't miss me too much.

468
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,840
So much consideration.

469
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,400
Do you want me to choose for you?

470
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,320
What?

471
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,520
Do you want me to help you choose?

472
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,760
That's true.

473
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,680
You are seriously injured now.

474
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:36,640
It's really not proper for me
to leave you and go out.

475
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,480
Later, I will

476
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,560
send those few dresses

477
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
to Chuichui

478
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,040
and let her choose for herself.

479
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,760
I won't be going after three days.

480
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,720
The dress is chosen for Lu Chuichui?

481
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,000
Right.

482
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,200
She has been staying at the Shen Mansion
for the past few days.

483
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,680
It's a pity

484
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,720
that the colors of my dresses

485
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,400
are all not bright enough.

486
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,880
I'm afraid she won't like them.

487
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,240
Since you will go out with besties,

488
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,480
you don't have to worry about me.

489
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:09,400
The Shen Mansion is not without people
to rely on.

490
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,560
As for three days from now,

491
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,880
I should be able to get out of bed by then.

492
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,080
I will join you at that time.

493
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,240
No need. You've suffered such a serious injury.

494
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,680
You need to rest a bit longer
before you'll be okay.

495
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,760
You rest first, okay?

496
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,640
Isn't it just because I watched
a couple of extra plays?

497
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:23,120
How did I fall asleep?

498
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,240
It must've been that

499
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,640
that play was just too captivating.

500
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,240
Then, I just…

501
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:34,360
It's fine.

502
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,240
Today really is

503
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,960
bright and sunny

504
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,400
with a clear sky as far as the eye can see.

505
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,800
Oh no.

506
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:01,480
Is it a human or a ghost?

507
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,656
It's a ghost.

508
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,480
What's there to fear about ghosts?

509
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:09,080
They were all people before they died.

510
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:12,400
You're not scared, but I am!

511
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,520
If it's a ghost, I'd be scared to death.

512
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,000
Every grievance has its perpetrator,
every debt its debtor.

513
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:19,080
Whoever owes you, go find them.

514
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:20,320
I'm begging you, please go away.

515
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:21,640
I'm begging you, please go away.

516
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:23,920
Back at the cemetery,

517
00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:25,320
how come I didn't notice

518
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,560
that you were such a scaredy-cat?

519
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,288
Oh, it's you!

520
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,840
Mr. Mask,

521
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,240
it's so strange.

522
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,760
I was so scared just a moment ago.

523
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,640
But as soon as you sit beside me,

524
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,840
suddenly this place seems

525
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,520
not so scary anymore.

526
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,440
Perhaps it's because

527
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,000
all the ghosts and ghouls here
are afraid of me.

528
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,400
Why do you belittle yourself?

529
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,400
It's just a fact.

530
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,680
In this world,

531
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,600
not to mention people,

532
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:02,760
even all evil spirits and ghosts

533
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:05,240
fear to not escape me in time.

534
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:06,760
You're talking nonsense.

535
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,920
Why do you have to say something so scary?

536
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:11,320
You're clearly so good.

537
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:14,040
Look.

538
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:15,360
It's just like

539
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,400
in this void,

540
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,320
the invisible little fairies

541
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,760
all want to be your friends.

542
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,272
If you don't believe me, look.

543
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,792
Watch carefully.

544
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,560
Little fairy.

545
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,040
Would you like to be friends

546
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,200
with Mr. Mask?

547
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,600
If you're willing,

548
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
just jump from this bowl

549
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,200
into this bowl.

550
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,504
Is that okay?

551
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,360
You need Mr. Mask to personally invite you?

552
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,840
Mr. Mask, please extend
an invitation to the little fairy.

553
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,080
Please join me, little fairy.

554
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:14,480
Look, the little fairy agreed.

555
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:21,639
The little fairy is willing
to be friends with you

556
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:23,199
and play games with you.

557
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:25,159
You are the most likable.

558
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:28,120
Everyone will like you.

559
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,880
Alright, don't cry anymore.

560
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,560
You are the most likable.

561
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,719
Everyone will like you

562
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:41,320
and they must all like you.

563
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,679
Yes.

564
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:54,800
Little fairy,

565
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,120
since you are also a friend of Lu Chuichui,

566
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,680
can you do me a favor?

567
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,520
The little fairy agreed.

568
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,000
Well, got scared?

569
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,760
You

570
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,440
are really strange.

571
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,200
You're not afraid of the graveyard at night,

572
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,160
but you get scared so easily.

573
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,360
To say you're timid and scared of ghosts,

574
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,200
yet you're not scared of my mask.

575
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,120
What is there to fear in that graveyard?

576
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,480
Lying in that graveyard is my dearest

577
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,280
mother I've been longing to see.

578
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,960
And you,

579
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,600
you don't want to remove your mask

580
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,320
simply because of the birthmark on your face.

581
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,280
There's nothing to fear about that, either.

582
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,760
By the way, I found out

583
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:06,200
that it seems the golden ring

584
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:08,000
is not so effective

585
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,680
in removing birthmarks.

586
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,200
Maybe you shouldn't use it.

587
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,800
What if it ends up scratching your face?

588
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:15,760
Well?

589
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,320
Do you want to take back the golden ring?

590
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:20,640
You keep it.

591
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:23,640
If I can't remove the birthmark,

592
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,280
I'll never dare

593
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,720
to show my true face before you.

594
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:28,960
How can that be?

595
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Having a birthmark is not your fault.

596
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,160
Whatever the appearance may be,

597
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:36,360
it should not affect the goodness
inside a person.

598
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,400
I believe

599
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,920
a person's appearance

600
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,480
is just like

601
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
the ones for the roles in Chinese opera,

602
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,640
Sheng, Dan, Jing, and Mo.

603
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,400
It's just a part of the character.

604
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,720
So what do you think of my look?

605
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,440
Is it good or evil?

606
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
Is it loyal or treacherous?

607
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,680
When you are willing to take off the mask,

608
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,120
I'll tell you.

609
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,440
What if I take off the mask

610
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,040
and you don't wish to look?

611
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,480
What then?

612
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,200
Rest assured.

613
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,920
I gave you the golden ring

614
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,280
in the hope that you could
remove the birthmark.

615
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,440
But whether or not you can remove it

616
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,920
is no longer important now

617
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,320
because I have long

618
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,280
treated you as a friend.

619
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,760
I definitely won't judge a book by its cover.

620
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,048
Take it off from me.

621
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,472
Then I'll do it.

622
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:25,280
Lai Luozhi.

623
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,360
Lu Chuichui, today,

624
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,920
I've presented my true self to you.

625
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,120
Whether you are frightened or not,

626
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:06,520
please keep my secret for me.

627
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,760
Do not disclose this matter

628
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,920
to a third party.

629
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,960
Remember what you promised me.

630
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,960
Don't go back on your word.

631
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,976
I trust you.

632
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:58,240
What are you thinking about?

633
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:02,720
Nothing. Look, Liuniang.

634
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,880
So many beauties and fair ladies,
scholars and literati,

635
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,240
have come here to seek marital fate.

636
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:11,624
They are here.

637
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:15,920
What a coincidence!

638
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,600
You have also come to seek marital fate.

639
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:24,400
How come, only allowing female officials
from the Ministry of Justice to come,

640
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,920
yet not allowing us inspectors to come?

641
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,480
Of course not.

642
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,800
I am just marveling

643
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,160
at this fate.

644
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,840
How it's so ingeniously arranged.

645
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,000
Isn't that right, Liuniang?

646
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,800
Stop talking. Let's go quickly.

647
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:46,344
Where to?

648
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Didn't you say you were going
to seek marital fate?

649
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:53,520
Seek…

650
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,600
Who would have thought, Jiang the stickler,

651
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,880
you would have this request too?

652
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,000
It's not apparent, Jiang the stickler.

653
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:06,880
Fine.

654
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,680
Considering your age,

655
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,520
wanting to find a beauty beyond the books

656
00:41:10,520 --> 00:41:11,840
is only human nature.

657
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,480
Then I, Lu Chuichui, will

658
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,240
accompany you.

659
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:18,800
Liuniang, have a good chat with Marshal Xu.

660
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,800
I'll go and come right back.

661
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:23,464
Let's go.

662
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:27,040
You seldom come visit Mingsheng Temple, right?

663
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,320
Let's walk around together.

664
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,440
You guys go ahead. Don't mind me.

665
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,640
Shen Du.

666
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,440
You must drink this bowl of medicine.

667
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:05,320
Pray for a marriage match at Mingsheng Temple.

668
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,240
Jing Lin.

669
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,056
Great Chief.

670
00:42:13,318 --> 00:42:17,364
[Mingsheng Temple]

671
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,600
Mr. Xu,

672
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:30,960
you must have something to say.

673
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,960
Liuniang,

674
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,160
the other day I overheard by chance

675
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,440
Lu Chuichui mention your marriage.

676
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,960
Isn't this a joke?

677
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,680
How can a woman propose a divorce?

678
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:44,600
Why can't she propose it?

679
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,920
Don't forget it.

680
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:47,560
According to Dacang's legal code,

681
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,600
if husband and wife

682
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:51,120
get a divorce due to incompatibility,

683
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,760
they shall not be punished.

684
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
Moreover,

685
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:57,000
they didn't have

686
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,920
the actual marital relationship.

687
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,000
They've agreed to divorce.

688
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,680
Anyway, I've long told her to make arrangements

689
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,880
and to find another good person.

690
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:08,240
It's just a pity. The inspectors

691
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,320
and those from the Ministry of Justice,

692
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,960
none of them are suitable

693
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,160
apart from Marshal Xu.

694
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,680
I have to tear

695
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,320
Lu Chuichui's mouth sooner or later.

696
00:43:37,143 --> 00:43:40,961
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

697
00:43:40,961 --> 00:43:44,638
