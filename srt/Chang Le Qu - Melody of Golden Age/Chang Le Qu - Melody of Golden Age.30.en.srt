00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm sorry

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,080
for not capturing Shen Du in Yingzhou.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,120
Is the Huo'e Sect in Yingzhou

19
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,480
all gone?

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,912
Yes.

21
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,456
Trash

22
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:11,160
is useless.

23
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,680
You got seriously injured.

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,960
It seems you have to take a break for a while.

25
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,440
Have you dealt with

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,800
those Half-faced Demons in Yingzhou?

27
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,920
I've already planted poison in advance.

28
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,080
No one survived.

29
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,520
Very well.

30
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,840
What about

31
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,560
the thing that Mo Qianzhi left for Shen Du?

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,040
This is what Shen Du was looking for.

33
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Mo Qianzhi

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,120
had been watching Yingzhou for so long,

35
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,120
must have known

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,080
many secrets of the officials
in the imperial court.

00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:10,376
Poetry collection?

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,200
What?

39
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,360
Shen Du must have switched it

40
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:15,560
around that time.

41
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:17,120
You got fooled by Shen Du.

42
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,272
I…

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,280
Shen Du.

44
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,280
I really wonder

45
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,240
what you are going to do.

46
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,160
I didn't expect Prime Minister Zhang's faction

47
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,600
have been using the Gannandao

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,000
to smuggle with Xichen

49
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
to reap huge profits for years.

50
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,640
And Princess of Valor

51
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,399
even has been buying the frontier soldiers off

52
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:21,240
in the name of funding.

53
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:24,840
The senior has quietly gained secrets
over the two factions in the court,

54
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,600
yet never reported it.

55
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,560
He didn't trust the imperial court.

56
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,280
Chen Huo'e must know about it,

57
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,680
so she wanted to use me

58
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,280
to find this.

59
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,320
So what are you going to do about this?

60
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,880
- I think…
- Great Chief.

61
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,880
Great Chief, something's wrong.

62
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,080
Why the panic?

63
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,320
Before we could interrogate

64
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,320
the Half-faced Demons captured, they all died.

65
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,680
Great Chief.

66
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,800
These people must have died of poisoning.

67
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,880
When they were captured,

68
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,120
I've searched them carefully,

69
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,160
even checked
every single tooth in their mouths.

70
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,200
There's no way
they could have taken the poison.

71
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,040
This mark…

72
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,440
Why?

73
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,480
Did you notice anything?

74
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,880
Jing Lin is right.

75
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,680
Before these people were captured,

76
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,560
they must have been poisoned
with some slow-acting poison.

77
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,440
Coroner, can you identify
what kind of poison it was?

78
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,720
Yes, but it will take some time.

79
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,360
Report to me as soon as you find out.

80
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,440
Yes, Great Chief.

81
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,600
It's time to go back to Xiang'an.

82
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,640
What are you reading?

83
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,200
Along the way,

84
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,960
we've passed through many places.

85
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,000
These are some records of my casual chats

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,280
with local people.

87
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,360
Any problem?

88
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,320
From the memories of these people,

89
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,720
I indeed found something suspicious.

90
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,920
The year before the Shen Mansion case,

91
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,080
Dacang experienced a flood disaster.

92
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Many people suffered greatly
and lived in extreme hardship

93
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,360
due to the lack of food.

94
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,280
But here in Gannandao,

95
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,920
in the memories of the people,

96
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,920
there were also some areas

97
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,720
affected by the flood disaster.

98
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,800
Logically speaking,

99
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,760
there should have been
a shortage of surplus grain.

100
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,840
But the local grain prices

101
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,440
had fallen rather than risen.

102
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,440
Where did all this grain

103
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,680
come from?

104
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:02,040
Do you mean…?

105
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,640
There's one possibility.

106
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Someone secretly

107
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,320
took the official grain from the granary.

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,848
Assassin!

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,720
Liuniang.

110
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,544
Let's go.

111
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,960
Don't fight them. Let's enter the palace.

112
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,160
Mr. Shen, you indeed are
so loyal to the country.

113
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,280
You have just entered the Imperial City,

114
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:34,880
and came straight here.

115
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,480
No wonder the Mother Empress
thinks so highly of you.

116
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,200
Your Highness, I'm flattered.

117
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,920
I'm just trying my best

118
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,960
to live up to the Empress Dowager's trust.

119
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:49,080
It's best if you really think in this way.

120
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,160
I think the Mother Empress

121
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,920
will be glad.

122
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,560
She hopes you will rise high.

123
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,920
What do you mean, Your Highness?

124
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:06,000
Forget it. It is late at night.

125
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:11,240
Jia'an, you must be tired too.

126
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,040
Shen Du, come to my mansion later.

127
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,760
Empress Dowager, please have some tea.

128
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,280
Empress Dowager, they have arrived.

129
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:50,000
May you be well, Empress Dowager.

130
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,480
May you be blessed, Empress Dowager.

131
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,144
Rise.

132
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,840
Minister Shen.

133
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,480
I've read the memorial

134
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,960
you asked someone to send.

135
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,240
Mo Qianzhi is already dead.

136
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,400
The rebels have been suppressed.

137
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,120
And the Half-faced Demons
have also been annihilated.

138
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,960
You did a good job in Yingzhou.

139
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:17,640
During the process,

140
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,800
did you encounter any difficulties?

141
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:23,560
Thanks to your blessing,

142
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:25,960
everything went smoothly.

143
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,920
What should I

144
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
reward you?

145
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,400
Shen Du is already the Great Chief,

146
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,280
leading officials of all levels,

147
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,160
already a first-rank senior official.

148
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
Then I wonder he can't be

149
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,160
promoted anymore.

150
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,680
You!

151
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,680
I've spoiled you so much.

152
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,040
And you're speaking recklessly.

153
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,200
Fortunately, Minister Shen is not an outsider.

154
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,320
Otherwise,

155
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,720
it would make others think

156
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,000
that I want to warn

157
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,760
Minister Shen via you.

158
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,120
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

159
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,520
I'm really sorry.

160
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:06,000
Minister Shen.

161
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,920
What do you think?

162
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,120
What reward do you desire?

163
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,880
Just tell me,

164
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,400
and I shall grant it.

165
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,360
This is my job.

166
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,480
I don't need any reward.

167
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,720
This trip to Yingzhou,

168
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
if my wife didn't go with me,

169
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm afraid it wouldn't have been so smooth.

170
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,400
If there's a reward,

171
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,200
then please reward to Yan Xing.

172
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,000
It turns out

173
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,520
you want to get a reward for your wife.

174
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,360
It seems that this trip to Yingzhou

175
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,520
has brought you two closer together.

176
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:50,120
I did a good thing.

177
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,440
Empress Dowager, you are really wise.

178
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,720
Rise.

179
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Minister Shen, you are a pillar of the state,

180
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,640
meritorious but not seeking rewards.

181
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,800
Good.

182
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,160
I'll grant

183
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,800
the reward to your wife

184
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,920
as you requested.

185
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:13,200
Minister Yan, you were instrumental
in putting down the rebellion in Yingzhou.

186
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,800
I'll promote you as the Chief Director
under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Justice,

187
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,240
of the sixth rank.

188
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:24,480
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,040
Minister Yan.

190
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Is there

191
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,800
any special reward you want?

192
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,640
Empress Dowager.

193
00:13:33,640 --> 00:13:36,960
I desire no other reward.

194
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,560
Think it twice.

195
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
It's a rare opportunity.

196
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,320
I mean it.

197
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,080
I don't desire rewards.

198
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,640
I only wish the world be peaceful.

199
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,720
Very well, Minister Yan.

200
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,200
As a woman,

201
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,360
you concern for the world.

202
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,080
Dacang

203
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:03,000
really needs officials like you.

204
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,960
I heard you were attacked

205
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,360
in Yingzhou,

206
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,840
almost killed.

207
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,720
Send the imperial physician to their mansion.

208
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,088
Yes.

209
00:14:13,088 --> 00:14:17,394
[Shen Mansion]

210
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,160
What's wrong?

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,680
You just got a promotion,

212
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:32,920
why are you so upset?

213
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,480
Director Yan.

214
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,240
I just figured it out.

215
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,640
The trip to Yingzhou was a big deal.

216
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:44,560
It would be inappropriate
for the Empress Dowager not to grant a reward,

217
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,360
but she doesn't want to reward you either.

218
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,480
That Zhang Baohuan

219
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,640
must have understood
what the Empress Dowager thinks.

220
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,640
So he put on a show with Madam Xu,

221
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,240
saying you can't be promoted anymore.

222
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,040
They just didn't want you to take credit.

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,320
If you weren't that smart

224
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,760
and got this thing over,

225
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,240
no one knows what will happen.

226
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,000
To the booklet Mr. Mo left for you,

227
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,560
what are you going to deal with it?

228
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,360
That booklet is so important.

229
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,200
I'll present it later.

230
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,400
You are so cunning.

231
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,720
You went to the palace at night
to meet the Empress Dowager,

232
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,240
yet, you didn't mention the booklet.

233
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,920
It's just a fake move

234
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,200
to scare some people.

235
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:22,600
I'm afraid none of them
will sleep well tonight.

236
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,320
You know me

237
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,240
so well.

238
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,360
So,

239
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,320
I had received a reward doing nothing.

240
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,000
Princess of Valor said
you are loyal to your duty.

241
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
But you don't have to be loyal to your duty
even in the middle of the night,

242
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:42,080
not going home, right?

243
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:48,920
There's a place I need to show you.

244
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:19,848
Let's go.

245
00:16:59,368 --> 00:17:03,583
[Late father Shen Bingzhu's tablet]

246
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,120
This is…

247
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,120
This is what I want to tell you.

248
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,720
When the Shen family encountered disaster,

249
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,280
my mother was seriously ill,

250
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,000
knowing that she would die soon,

251
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
so she had me write a confession.

252
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,160
I don't know how,

253
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,520
nor can I write it.

254
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,560
Father

255
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,800
would rather die to prove his innocence.

256
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,360
I would rather, like my father,

257
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,880
die to prove my integrity.

258
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,600
But if even you die,

259
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,080
then this unjust case

260
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,280
will truly end.

261
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,520
So many people

262
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,800
in the Shen family who died in vain.

263
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:16,000
And your father.

264
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,720
Their grievances,

265
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,960
the truth they have always wanted,

266
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,160
would truly remain unknown.

267
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,880
She told me

268
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,520
to become an official,

269
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,360
only then will there be a chance

270
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:31,120
to clear the Shen family's name.

271
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,240
From that day on,

272
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,744
I have nothing

273
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,160
to live for but resentment.

274
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,680
I carry too much burden

275
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,440
of clearing the Shen family's name.

276
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,040
Seeking the truth

277
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,840
became my only reason to live on.

278
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,840
Perhaps people have already forgotten,

279
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:21,480
or rather, no one cares.

280
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
But I remember it vividly.

281
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,080
I never forget

282
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:31,960
those innocent people

283
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,480
who died for the Shen family.

284
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
It's not just you,

285
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,200
but also me.

286
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,200
I remember it.

287
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
I've never forgotten Uncle Shen.

288
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,400
[Late father Shen Bingzhu's tablet]

289
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,520
When something happened to the Shen Mansion,

290
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,400
people said Uncle Shen committed treason.

291
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,616
I don't believe it.

292
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,000
He was the most upright

293
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,480
and selfless person I've ever met,

294
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,920
never doing anything

295
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:14,480
damage to the country or the people.

296
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,400
I vowed

297
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:22,360
to become a female official

298
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,360
of the Ministry of Justice since then,

299
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,360
hoping one day

300
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,000
to find out the truth for myself.

301
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,440
People call me the White Ghost,

302
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,440
so I thought

303
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,320
that I was a lonely ghost,

304
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:58,400
wandering alone in this hell.

305
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,720
I really didn't expect

306
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,080
that anyone would be as foolish as me.

307
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:46,240
You are so warm

to show her merit

374
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,880
and spread the grace.

375
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:15,680
Empress Dowager, thank you.

376
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,960
The Empress Dowager has another decree.

377
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:39,080
The Empress Dowager has decreed.

378
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,720
The Great Chief, Shen Du,

379
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,240
has put down a rebellion

380
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,960
and brought peace to the various counties,

381
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,320
with outstanding merits

382
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,240
and strong observations.

383
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,080
Princess Jia'an is

384
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,920
gentle, beautiful,

385
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,800
polite, mannered,

386
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,280
graceful, elegant,

387
00:27:55,280 --> 00:27:57,040
educated and dignified,

388
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,080
who has reached the age of marriage,

389
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,840
awaiting for a great husband.

390
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,120
The two share a match made by heaven.

391
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,280
Today, I hereby bestowed them the marriage,

392
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,280
hoping they devote themselves
to the country with respect

393
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,880
and unite in heart and virtue.

394
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,520
Great Chief, this is
the Empress Dowager's decree,

395
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,520
not something you can say no.

396
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:33,120
At least, accept the decree first.

397
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:05,200
Mr. Zhang, you know it.

398
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:08,280
I have no intention
of marrying Princess Jia'an.

399
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,760
My wife

400
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,120
does not want me to marry another woman.

401
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,680
Please tell the Empress Dowager about it.

402
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,120
Do you know why the Empress Dowager

403
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,080
had me announce this decree?

404
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,240
Such a work

405
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,280
should be performed by the people
of the Astronomical Bureau.

406
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,560
Why me?

407
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,136
Why?

408
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,080
You don't understand.

409
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,120
Neither does Great Chief?

410
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,760
Please explain it.

411
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,240
Don't play riddles with me.

412
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:53,960
Considering Han Shiyuan

413
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,600
has now married into your Yan family,

414
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,080
I shall tell you this,

415
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,200
lest Shiyuan knows about it later

416
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,440
and blames me.

417
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,880
Just think,

418
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,280
Princess Jia'an is the most beloved daughter

419
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,360
of Princess of Valor.

420
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,680
And Princess of Valor is

421
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,560
the most beloved princess
of the Empress Dowager.

422
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:13,840
Princess of Valor's temperament

423
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,000
is most similar to that of the Empress Dowager,

424
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,280
so she receives the most favor,

425
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:21,680
even overshadowing Prince Xian.

426
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,560
Under such a circumstance,

427
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,160
yet she bestowed Princess Jia'an

428
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:29,960
upon Great Chief as a wife. What does she mean?

429
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,280
The Great Chief is so powerful,

430
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,840
with outstanding merits,

431
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:33,920
and unprecedented honor

432
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,080
and wealth.

433
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,920
No one can exceed him.

434
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,480
But the Great Chief is alone,

435
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
without any support behind him.

436
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,240
Moreover,

437
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:48,680
he has married you,
a minor official of the sixth rank.

438
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,920
Even if Princess Jia'an were to marry,

439
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,960
she should choose her husband

440
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,400
from the royal family.

441
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,720
She has no reason to marry Shen Du.

442
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,240
Your father has said,

443
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,280
only Shen Du remains in the Shen family now.

444
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:04,920
Only Mo Qianzhi and that butler

445
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:08,520
were associated with the Shen family.

446
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,280
Mo Qianzhi is already dead.

447
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:13,520
Then Shen Du is really

448
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,520
the most alone person

449
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,240
in the imperial court.

450
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:19,760
Also he holds the position
of supervising hundreds of officials.

451
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,960
Any slight mistake

452
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,960
could make him dead.

453
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,480
So,

454
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,360
danger can never be overcome
without taking risks.

455
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,480
And Shen Du is the key.

456
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:51,688
Mr. Zhang.

457
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,640
No matter
how the Empress Dowager be wary of me,

458
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,640
I can endure it.

459
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,000
But I don't need the bestowed marriage.

460
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,360
I already have a wife.

461
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,400
And I will not marry another woman in my life.

462
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,120
Mr. Zhang.

463
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:34,160
I will now go to the palace with you
to ask for the cancel.

464
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,040
Shen Du.

465
00:32:40,040 --> 00:32:42,120
- Great Chief.
- Shen Du.

466
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:59,960
Are you thinking of
defying the imperial decree?

467
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,280
Empress Dowager.

468
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,960
My wife and I share a very deep affection.

469
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,360
Moreover, I am in charge of the cabinet,

470
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,200
supervising the officials
and receiving many complaints.

471
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:07,720
It really isn't a cushy job.

472
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,800
I don't want Princess Jia'an

473
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,160
to marry me and suffer.

474
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,440
If I didn't bestow the marriage,

475
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,400
you could never marry Princess Jia'an.

476
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,280
Princess Jia'an is so noble.

477
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,720
I know I don't deserve it.

478
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,240
And I dare not want it.

479
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,280
Empress Dowager, please cancel the decree.

480
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:26,280
You!

481
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:28,712
How dare you!

482
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,160
I have been an official for many years,

483
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,400
never wanted anything.

484
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,160
Except for today alone,

485
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,120
Empress Dowager, please cancel the decree.

486
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,720
I will surely

487
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,760
devote myself to the country.

488
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,080
Great Chief Shen has always been loyal.

489
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,200
Everyone knows it.

490
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,920
Think it twice.

491
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,800
I know

492
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,360
you have paved the way for me.

493
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,280
I am sincerely loyal to you,

494
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,400
wholeheartedly sharing your worries.

495
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,080
If I need to marry Princess Jia'an

496
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:14,199
to survive in the imperial court,

497
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,320
then it must be you

498
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,920
who do not trust my ability.

499
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,560
Empress Dowager.

500
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,120
What is wrong?

501
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:25,280
Something's wrong at the Ming Hall.

502
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,072
What?

503
00:34:29,266 --> 00:34:34,513
[Chengtian Gate]

504
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,520
The people I sent have checked many times,

505
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:44,040
no problems were discovered.

506
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,440
But this time,

507
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,760
it was their excessive greed

508
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:47,960
that exposed a flaw,

509
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,480
which got noticed.

510
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,120
When we went back to check,

511
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,840
and discovered the problem.

512
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,200
Someone made two account books.

513
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
Two account books?

514
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:02,080
What's difference between them?

515
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,280
One

516
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,080
is an open account book,

517
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,720
using the Longmen accounting method.

518
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,240
And the other one is kept in secret,

519
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,040
using the Sijiao accounting method.

520
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,320
Go ahead.

521
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,760
The one

522
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,400
who makes the open one
with Longmen accounting method

523
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,600
is really skillful.

524
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,960
At first glance,

525
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,720
one can't find any mistakes.

526
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:28,720
Therefore, from the beginning
of the Ming Hall to the present,

527
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,240
the officials of the Ministry of Revenue

528
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,160
could not find any problems.

529
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
The other account book

530
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,440
that has just been discovered

531
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,200
uses Sijiao accounting method.

532
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,600
Therefore, at first glance,

533
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,880
one can't detect any connection

534
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,800
to the Ming Hall's account book.

535
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,960
By how much is it off?

536
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,800
How dare they

537
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,000
to embezzle

538
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,640
over two million taels of silver!

539
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,640
Officials involved in the reconstruction

540
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,440
were all involved,

541
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,120
apart from Zhang Baohuan.

542
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,480
Baohuan is not good at this accounting,

543
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,960
nor does he have the nerve.

544
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:22,040
But the matter of the Ming Hall

545
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,240
was entrusted to him,

546
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,040
so he was guilty of inadequate supervision.

547
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,000
Arrange him

548
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,600
to some other place for a while.

549
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,600
Yes.

550
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,920
As for the others…

551
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,640
These officials

552
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,480
belong to various factions
in the imperial court.

553
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,080
Various factions?

554
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,560
Including someone in the Zhou family?

555
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,600
I said something wrong.

556
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,120
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

557
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,120
There's nothing wrong in your words.

558
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:12,280
I just assumed that the court officials
each have their own plans,

559
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,080
but they all cared about the world.

560
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:17,920
I never expected

561
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:24,360
that the sin started from something trivial.

562
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,160
Now,

563
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,560
the imperial court is so unsteady

564
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,840
and nothing can be predictable.

565
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,120
Empress Dowager,
you sincerely serve the country.

566
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,720
While the court officials

567
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,560
harbor their own thoughts.

568
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,760
Especially after the incident of Yingzhou
involving the Governor, Mo Qianzhi,

569
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,080
no one has yet taken over
the post in Gannandao.

570
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:45,520
I think

571
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,680
they all seem quite impatient.

572
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:52,240
It's time to give them a warning.

573
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:57,840
Empress Dowager.

574
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,080
Shen Du's Imperial Guards

575
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:00,680
seldom interacts with others,

576
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:03,040
and works with dedication and effort.

577
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,960
It would be a good choice.

578
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,120
But

579
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:08,880
if he marries Princess Jia'an,

580
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,000
I'm afraid there will be

581
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,440
more constraints for him.

582
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,160
You want to help him,

583
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:27,160
let's see if he is clever enough.

584
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,040
For the incident at Ming Hall,

585
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,200
don't make it public

586
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,600
and investigate secretly.

587
00:38:37,600 --> 00:38:39,480
Yes.

588
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:41,560
The Imperial Inspectorate,

589
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,200
Imperial Guards.

590
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:47,040
Pass on my decrees separately.

591
00:39:34,389 --> 00:39:36,784
[Shen Mansion]

592
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,640
You really aren't afraid of anything.

593
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,960
I thought

594
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,920
that a beating was inevitable.

595
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,800
It went smoother than I thought.

596
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,640
Are you saying the matter
of the bestowed marriage just passed like that?

597
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,800
Not necessarily.

598
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,960
The Empress Dowager
still hasn't vented her anger.

599
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,480
But the matter of the bestowed marriage
came quite weirdly.

600
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,240
I'm afraid it has something
to do with that booklet.

601
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,960
Princess of Valor must have been afraid

602
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:25,480
that I would reveal
her funding to the Yingzhou army,

603
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,080
so she asked the Empress Dowager
to bestow me a marriage,

604
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:30,280
wanting to constrain me.

605
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,560
But unfortunately,
the Empress Dowager has no time for this.

606
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:41,520
A major incident occurred at the Ming Hall.

607
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:46,320
You knew about this all along?

608
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:53,080
Shen Du.

609
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:54,640
Madam Xu

610
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,120
just happened to report this matter,

611
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,600
did she do it on purpose?

612
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,520
People don't know

613
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:04,680
that the Ming Hall has a deep meaning
for the Empress Dowager.

614
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,280
It is the place that witnessed the affection

615
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,200
between the Empress Dowager
and the former emperor.

616
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
After the fire at Ming Hall,

617
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,440
the Empress Dowager is extremely

618
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,840
concerned about the reconstruction.

619
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,600
She not only sent
Zhang Baohuan she trusts mostly

620
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,960
to oversee it,

621
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,000
but also said

622
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,640
that renovation expenses are uncapped.

623
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,080
Uncapped?

624
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,520
Unlimited expenses

625
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,800
don't mean that the corrupt officials

626
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:28,200
can line their own pockets.

627
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,520
I wonder how many people involve in it.

628
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,600
It could probably shake
the entire imperial court.

629
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:38,640
They were totally pissed off

630
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,760
the Empress Dowager.

631
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:01,377
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

632
00:42:01,377 --> 00:42:05,054
