[Episode 14]

15
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,688
Great Chief.

16
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,800
What brings you here?

17
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:24,240
There are too many lanterns here.

18
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,960
Over here, put it here.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,720
The Great Chief's residence
is always like this?

20
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,880
The Shen Mansion is much brighter than this.

21
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,960
Great Chief, come on.

22
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,280
Mr. Han.

23
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,440
On such a night with a full moon,

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
do you also think of

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,800
your own family like I do?

26
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,200
I…

27
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
lost my parents at a young age.

28
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,400
I have had no family for a long time.

29
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Once I marry Caiwei.

30
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,800
the Yan family will be my family.

31
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,432
Right.

32
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,240
Your parents have gone.

33
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,480
What about your siblings?

34
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,360
You must inform them

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,800
about your wedding, right?

36
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,040
Before getting married,

37
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,160
- the two families should meet.
- Right.

38
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,856
No need.

39
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,800
I left home to study at a young age,

40
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,360
and I've long lost contact with relatives.

41
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,960
As long as Caiwei and I truly love each other,

42
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,080
that's enough.

43
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,600
I don't care about

44
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,264
those tedious formalities.

45
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,240
Really?

46
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,680
Why do I think that these tedious formalities

47
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,264
are necessary?

48
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,840
Even if you two truly love each other,

49
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,640
you would also hope to get

50
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,000
recognition and blessings
from friends and family.

51
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,960
Moreover,

52
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,880
you'll get to know

53
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,000
both family backgrounds from this meeting,

54
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,240
so as not to be deceived.

55
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,720
Right.

56
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,760
When I married you,

57
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,080
we didn't have these formalities.

58
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,480
Mr. Han truly loves Caiwei.

59
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,600
That's what matters.

60
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,160
It's getting late,

61
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,000
and a bit chilly.

62
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Well,

63
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:04,040
let's head back to rest.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,680
Yes, let's go.

65
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,120
Right.

66
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,480
Great Chief, we're leaving.

67
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Let's go.

68
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,240
Mr. Han.

69
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,640
If you really love her

70
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,280
so much,

71
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
then try to be sincere

72
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,760
and face the challenge together.

73
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,520
Mr. Han, let's go.

74
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,080
What do you want to do?

75
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,640
You insist on having a meal here,

76
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,000
and scare everyone away.

77
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,000
I don't want to tell you.

78
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,280
I shouldn't be the one to tell you.

79
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:03,640
What a bluff.

80
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,840
It's getting late.

81
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,760
Let's go back.

82
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,080
It's too late to get back.

83
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,288
- Then…
- Great Chief.

84
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,120
Great Chief.

85
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,960
Master has already prepared a bedroom

86
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,480
for you two.

87
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,520
Since father

88
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,720
has already prepared a bedroom for me,

89
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,600
then I won't go back.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,960
You can just go.

91
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,520
What are you doing?

92
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,080
What?

93
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,480
He has said the bedroom

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,320
is for the two of us.

95
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:20,680
If you stay,

96
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,600
then how are you going
to explain this tomorrow?

97
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,400
If you're not leaving,
at least put me down first.

98
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,240
It's not nice to be seen.

99
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,560
So what?

100
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,640
I just want others to see

101
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:34,600
how close we are.

102
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,840
So you'll be spared from explaining.

103
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:42,728
Wait.

104
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,176
Go back to rest.

105
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:56,392
Alright.

106
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,920
Now drop the play.

107
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,920
Time to sleep.

108
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,040
Yan Mansion is not like Shen Mansion.

109
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,920
Tonight, you'll just make do there.

110
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,200
I am someone with injuries.

111
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,360
Making me sleep on a bamboo chair

112
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,160
is inappropriate.

113
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,880
Who told you to…

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,960
You look even healthier than me.

115
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,080
Forget it.

116
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,280
You can have the bed.

117
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,720
If you want to stay,

118
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,320
there's still half a spot inside.

119
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,520
You can sleep on the inside.

120
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,600
If you don't want to,

121
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,920
you can go outside

122
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,400
and spend the whole night with the stars.

123
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
Today,

124
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,640
let's make do.

125
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,920
But we have to follow the rules.

126
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,760
No one is supposed to cross this blanket.

127
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,960
I can't sleep.

128
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,320
Might as well go outside
and spend the night with the stars.

129
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,600
Why are you here?

130
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,440
I've given you the room.

131
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,920
The candles in the room have gone out.

132
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,320
It's too dark in the room for me to sleep.

133
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,960
Get someone to light the candles.

134
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,200
Shen Du.

135
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
You just have to bother others
in the middle of the night, don't you?

136
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,160
You weren't asleep when the candles were lit.

137
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:46,160
You're tossing and turning,
keeping me from sleeping.

138
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,600
Because candles weren't bright enough
when they're lit,

139
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,984
it's still a bit dim.

140
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,360
You're a really weird guy.

141
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,640
My father even

142
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,840
lit a few more candles.

143
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,960
And you still complain about the darkness.

144
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,760
You're sleeping, not reading or writing.

145
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,480
Why do you need it to be as bright as day?

146
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
Are you blind or something?

147
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:18,280
Now I understand

148
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,000
why Shen Du is called White Ghost.

149
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,120
Just look at these.

150
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,120
In broad daylight, it's like a memorial hall.

151
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,360
When evening comes,

152
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,280
it is still as brightly lit as day.

153
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,160
Who beats someone up with a lantern in hand?

154
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,200
I can't do it without a lantern.

155
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,752
Does he

156
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,160
have night blindness?

157
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,440
Tonight is truly rare.

158
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:33,720
Look, those Canglong Seven Stars in the east,

159
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,200
and those Zhuque Seven Stars in the south,

160
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,200
are so bright.

161
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,880
Look over there.

162
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,960
Those four stars over there are connected,

163
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:53,880
do they look like the four corners of a square?

164
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,240
Those four over there

165
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,920
are Dituluo Stars.

166
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,160
There are four more below.

167
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
They are the Jiaomujiao Stars.

168
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,520
Indeed, he cannot see.

169
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:07,360
There are no stars over there at all.

170
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:11,000
You know so many

171
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,320
names of the stars.

172
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,800
You are really impressive.

173
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,800
Well, those over there.

174
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,160
What's the name of those stars over there

175
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,440
that look like a rabbit?

176
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,400
Biyuewu Stars.

177
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,480
What about this one over here?

178
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,080
I think this one
looks like a glutinous rice cake.

179
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,080
And those in the south.

180
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,080
Those in the south

181
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,560
look like

182
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,880
a cherry.

183
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,880
It's called Jingmu'an Star.

184
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,600
It doesn't sound good. Change the name.

185
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,400
I think…

186
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,200
it should be called

187
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,800
Cherry Biluo Star.

188
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,280
The one next to it is

189
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,680
Glutinous Rice Cake Star.

190
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:54,600
It doesn't sound good.

191
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Such strange names.

192
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,400
And they are all pastries.

193
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,720
I'm telling you.

194
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,800
It's nice to name them after food.

195
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,960
When I was little, I had a poor appetite.

196
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,720
So, my mother would name the stars in the sky

197
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,680
all after pastries.

198
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,680
She even tricked me by saying
that whichever star was shining,

199
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,000
then I had to eat more of that kind of pastry.

200
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,440
Otherwise, that star

201
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,760
would never shine again.

202
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,200
Today, you must eat more glutinous rice cakes.

203
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Because today,

204
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,280
the star that looks like
a glutinous rice cake is shining.

205
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,520
My mother said,

206
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,040
if not, then

207
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,240
the star that looks like a glutinous rice cake

208
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,720
will go out.

209
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,192
Eat up.

210
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:38,848
♫ Heart burnt once,
a body lonesome and withered ♫

211
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:42,808
♫ A lifetime of solitude ♫

212
00:16:42,808 --> 00:16:46,089
♫ Love once burned, where has it scattered ♫

213
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:49,496
♫ The mottles ♫

214
00:16:49,496 --> 00:16:52,288
♫ Drifting in the mist ♫

215
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:57,816
♫ Through vast smoky waves,
groping in the darkness ♫

216
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:02,861
♫ You pass by, igniting fireworks ♫

217
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,359
W-What are you doing?

218
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,760
Is

219
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,127
that you?

220
00:17:11,127 --> 00:17:17,740
♫ Love is elusive,
stinging you and scorching me ♫

221
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:22,559
♫ Along the way,
flowers bloom and fall, heavy rain pours ♫

222
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,103
♫ Lights will intertwine ♫

223
00:17:26,103 --> 00:17:31,671
♫ You are my final destination ♫

224
00:17:31,671 --> 00:17:34,825
♫ Who will guide me through loneliness

225
00:17:34,825 --> 00:17:38,871
♫ Understand my vulnerability.
No need for words ♫

226
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:41,791
♫ Who will guide me through helplessness
and persistence ♫

227
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:45,975
♫ Take me in, alone but never falling ♫

228
00:17:45,975 --> 00:17:50,260
♫ Can't escape the fetters of fate
set for you and me ♫

00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:53,855
♫ Embracing the gentleness you've given ♫

230
00:17:53,855 --> 00:17:59,991
♫ Help me to see myself clearly, who I am ♫

231
00:17:59,991 --> 00:18:02,949
♫ Who will guide me through right and wrong ♫

232
00:18:02,949 --> 00:18:06,862
♫ Through the sea of people,
just hold me tight ♫

233
00:18:06,862 --> 00:18:10,018
♫ Who will guide me through grudges and karma ♫

234
00:18:10,018 --> 00:18:13,982
♫ Soothe my sense of loss, never to escape ♫

235
00:18:13,982 --> 00:18:18,168
♫ Dust settled,
we've encountered several times♫

236
00:18:18,168 --> 00:18:23,144
♫ Who can break free from fate ♫

237
00:18:24,215 --> 00:18:30,317
♫ Plunging into fire for you ♫

238
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,672
Great Chief.

239
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:54,960
What's the matter?

240
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,120
Early in the morning, Mr. Han

241
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,280
went to find Master,

242
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,800
saying to announce something.

243
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,000
He asked me to invite you and Madam.

244
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,136
Okay.

245
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,880
We're on our way.

246
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:20,520
- Great Chief.
- Save it.

247
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
Great Chief, you are here.

248
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,880
Thank you for giving me the chance to confess.

249
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:28,280
Mr. Han.

250
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,600
What exactly do you want to say?

251
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,360
Caiwei.

252
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,200
I lied to you.

253
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,320
My parents still have a son alive.

254
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,560
He is the Empress Dowager's favored official,

255
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:48,680
Zhang Baohuan, the Minister of Rites.

256
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,120
Mr. Zhang?

257
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,640
But I don't understand.

258
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,760
Since you are Mr. Zhang's brother,

259
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,040
why didn't he use his connections
to protect you

260
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:08,080
from persecution by Princess of Valor?

261
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,480
Brother…

262
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,680
In fact, Princess of Valor knew

263
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:14,000
about my relationship with Zhang Baohuan.

264
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,080
That's why she wanted

265
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,720
to take me in

266
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,400
as one of her gigolos.

267
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,040
I rejected her many times,

268
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,880
but still found it hard to escape.

269
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,800
Though we are born of the same mother,

270
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,360
he does not deserve to be my elder brother

271
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:35,600
because he failed to protect our sister.

272
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,992
Sister?

273
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,680
The owner of Jinxiu Workshop back then

274
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:47,120
was your sister, Zhang Baoying?

275
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:54,560
Caiwei, I'm sorry.

276
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,200
I lied to you.

277
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,560
When the incident at Jinxiu Workshop occurred,

278
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,720
the Zhang family was executed to the last.

279
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,440
Yet Zhang Baohuan used his connections

280
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,720
to save me.

281
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,720
I can't figure out

282
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,400
why he can't keep our sister

283
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,520
if he can keep me.

284
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,240
I hate that he didn't protect our sister,

285
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,600
and hate myself for being incompetent.

286
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,960
Since then, I made up my mind

287
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,640
to have nothing to do
with the Zhang family anymore.

288
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,200
My mother's surname is Han,

289
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,560
so I took her surname

290
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:30,720
and renamed to Han Shiyuan.

291
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,240
Maybe he had a compelling reason too.

292
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,720
You should know

293
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,040
how difficult life he is living

294
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,840
by the side of the Empress Dowager.

295
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,640
Serving the emperor is at risk.

296
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
I think

297
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:51,240
you should understand it.

298
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:59,280
You've never seen how bloody that scene was.

299
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,560
How can you truly empathize with me?

300
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:12,440
[Zhang Baoying]
Don't be afraid.

301
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,360
I will never forget that day.

302
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,960
If you were me,

303
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,600
you wouldn't be able to say such words.

304
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,120
You are wrong.

305
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,600
They died uncleared of a false charge,

306
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,320
so you should try your best

307
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,640
to seek justice for them,

308
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:58,480
instead of lying to yourself

309
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,120
and distancing yourself from them.

310
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,280
What a twisted fate!

311
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,800
What a twisted fate!

312
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,976
Mr. Han.

313
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,640
Please allow me to consider

314
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,680
the marriage between you and my daughter.

315
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,280
Please don't mind.

316
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:01,840
The Yan Mansion is not strong,

317
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,720
truly cannot withstand any more turmoil.

318
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,240
Today, I tell you the truth.

319
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,520
And I'm well aware of the consequences.

320
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,240
I did not sleep all night.

321
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:31,160
I realized I couldn't lie to Caiwei

322
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,480
and marry her.

323
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,040
Staying here these days

324
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,280
has bothered you a lot.

325
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:42,280
I

326
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:45,192
take my leave.

327
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,280
Mr. Han.

328
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,480
Caiwei.

329
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,856
Caiwei.

330
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,280
Mr. Han

331
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,280
Is indeed Mr. Zhang's

332
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,320
family.

333
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:39,120
The Jinxiu Workshop case

334
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,640
involves the royal past

335
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,400
and the close servant of the Empress Dowager,

336
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
having extensive connections.

337
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,000
Be cautious.

338
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,320
Understood, I will be careful.

339
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,080
Actually, there is one more thing.

340
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,520
Back then, in the detention center,

341
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,720
there's a little girl

342
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
who often came to see me at midnight,

343
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,920
bringing me food and news from the outside.

344
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:08,840
But since one day,

345
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,120
I've never seen her again.

346
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,880
I thought I'd never see her again.

347
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,280
But yesterday,

348
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,640
I seemed to have found her.

349
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,840
Or perhaps,

350
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,760
someone just like her.

351
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:30,040
Many years ago,

352
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:31,080
you asked me

353
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,320
to check the detention center's
entry and exit records

354
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,480
to find her, right?

355
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,560
But in the records,

356
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,360
there was no entry of a little girl.

357
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,600
So I couldn't help but wonder

358
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:45,160
whether she was real

359
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,800
or merely a figure in my dreams.

360
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,720
If she did come and go at night,

361
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:53,200
then might not be recorded.

362
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,720
That detention center

363
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,560
was also where I was confined in my youth.

364
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,720
Thinking back now,

365
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,920
I still often have nightmares.

366
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,880
She dared to

367
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:08,520
go into the detention center
at night to care for you.

368
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,080
She must be a kind-hearted woman.

369
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:14,920
If fate brings you together again,

370
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,440
make sure to tell her this and treat her well.

371
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,880
If fate indeed brings us together again,

372
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,560
there's no need to tell her this.

373
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,000
As I am now the well-known

374
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,640
ruthless official in Dacang,

375
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:33,160
being so ruthless

376
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,240
and with a vicious dog that bites people.

377
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,240
I'm too ashamed to face

378
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,280
my childhood playmate again.

379
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,840
A vicious dog that bites people?

380
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,240
You're talking about
that time at the Ming Hall?

381
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,560
If you hadn't let out the vicious dog

382
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,000
to screen criminals,

383
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,480
I'm afraid that everyone below

384
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:51,360
would have perished under arrows.

385
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,880
Madam Xu, you have been living in the palace,

386
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,440
yet known everything.

387
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,000
Even the affairs outside the palace.

388
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:58,720
Don't flatter me so.

389
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,080
Everyone in Xiang'an City

390
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,920
knows this.

391
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,320
This became another tally under your reputation

392
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,440
as White Ghost.

393
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,760
Shen Du.

394
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:16,200
Bearing such a notorious name,

395
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,440
do you think it is worth it?

396
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,920
Yan Xing.

397
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,560
You overstepped your authority again!

398
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,120
And yet you still deny it?

399
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,360
This is the encrypted file

400
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,520
sent by the Imperial Guards,

401
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,920
designated for you to read only.

402
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,240
Originally,

403
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,480
cases from the Imperial Guards

404
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,760
were to be assigned to you.

405
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,960
However, by law, they must be archived first

406
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,280
and then assigned from the top down.

407
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:56,680
There's no reason to go over me
and straight into your hands.

408
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,400
Regarding this matter, you must…

409
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:03,120
remind the Imperial Guards.

410
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,880
Alright, Director Wu.

411
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,080
I will tell them

412
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,320
all the files and evidence

413
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,560
that are sent over

414
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,960
must be reviewed and assigned by you.

415
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,080
That's more like it.

416
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,520
What is this?

417
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,840
Is this a code using landmarks?

418
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,400
Jushengnu Stars?

419
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:43,480
[Glutinous Rice Cake Star]

420
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:47,560
Glutinous Rice Cake Star.

421
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,312
Cherry…

422
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,360
This must be the work of my husband,

423
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,240
who has recently taken an interest

424
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,800
in astronomy.

425
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:01,880
While observing,

426
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,800
he has drawn maps of the stars

427
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,240
and presented them to the Ministry of Justice

428
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,920
for use in our investigations.

429
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:11,680
Nonsense.

430
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,840
Are these things of any use to us? Any at all?

431
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,960
This is the Ministry of Justice,
not the Astronomical Bureau.

432
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,760
Nonsense.

433
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:21,400
Do they think that we are idle?

434
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,920
Without eating pastries,

435
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,280
you can still retain a sky full of stars.

436
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,600
He has remembered

437
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:39,280
all the positions and names
I spouted last night.

438
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,320
Shen Du.

439
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,760
I will find a way to cure your night blindness.

440
00:30:53,094 --> 00:30:56,632
[Ocean Fall]

441
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,040
One can see things during the day.

442
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:12,160
When twilight falls, one can't see anything.

443
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,480
It is called Night Blindness.

444
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,280
Suggest nourishing the liver
and replenishing blood.

445
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:30,760
Did Madam ask to prepare the offal

446
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,520
to make three meals a day for Master?

447
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,560
Are you cooking?

448
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,160
You look like doing a witchcraft to me.

449
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:05,000
What are you all gathered around here for?

450
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,200
Dismissed, everyone.

451
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't you have things to do?

452
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,480
Pipewort.

453
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,480
You go busy.

454
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,560
Alright.

455
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:25,240
Hurry. Come with me.

456
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,080
Faeces Vespertilionum.

457
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,640
My lord.

458
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,600
This is what Madam cooked for you,

459
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,040
sheep liver soup.

460
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,600
Great Chief.

461
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,000
Madam said,

462
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,480
at noon, you have to have this

463
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:03,480
steamed Pipewort, Faeces Vespertilionum
and chicken liver.

464
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,560
Again?

465
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,760
Again and again?

466
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:12,072
I'm not eating.

467
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,400
I know why you keep the lanterns lit at night.

468
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,360
If you wish to see the starry sky,

469
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:28,440
you must eat all three meals a day.

470
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:29,760
If you do not,

471
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,296
read the second note.

472
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,120
If you don't want
the entire Xiang'an City to know

473
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,480
your secret,

474
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,360
then do what I told you to.

475
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,600
What did you just say this thing is called?

476
00:35:55,600 --> 00:36:03,760
Steamed Pipewort, Faeces Vespertilionum
and chicken liver.

477
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,680
I know what Pipewort is.

478
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,520
But what is

479
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,960
the Faeces Vespertilionum?

480
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,760
Great Chief.

481
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,040
Are you sure you want me to tell you?

482
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,080
What exactly is it?

483
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,360
Bat droppings.

484
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,680
Yan…

485
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:26,920
Liu…

486
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,240
Yan Liuniang!

487
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,560
Great Chief.

488
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:32,800
Let's not eat it then.

489
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,440
You go to the Ministry of Justice

490
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:51,840
and bring her here.

491
00:37:16,637 --> 00:37:19,750
[Chief's Office]

492
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,720
Madam, be careful.

493
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:25,680
Great Chief was in a bad mood
after eating the chicken liver.

494
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,160
I'm going to watch the training.

495
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,280
What are you looking at?

496
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,880
And you.

497
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,080
Yan Liuniang.

498
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,680
If you want to kill me,

499
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,200
just stab me with a sword.

500
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,640
Why beat around the bush?

501
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:54,400
Making these nauseating soups.

502
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,880
Shen Du, I'm doing it for you.

503
00:37:57,880 --> 00:37:59,840
This is the recipe I've found

504
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,440
in medical books.

505
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,240
It's written

506
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:05,000
that for those with night blindness should take

507
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,680
substances that nourish the liver and the eyes.

508
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,360
Such as animal offal, and…

509
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:09,920
It's not just animal offal,

510
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,200
but also animal droppings.

511
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,560
What?

512
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:22,040
Are you talking about

513
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:26,088
Faeces Vespertilionum?

514
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,440
That

515
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:38,640
steamed Pipewort, Faeces Vespertilionum
and chicken liver

516
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:41,960
is

517
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,120
recorded in the
Treatise on the Origins of Various Diseases.

518
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,320
Faeces Vespertilionum

519
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,400
is one of the most important materials.

520
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,560
Mr. Shen bought it after going through

521
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,640
all the city's drugstores.

522
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,240
And I've steamed it all night.

523
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,800
I'm doing all this for you.

524
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,320
Don't ever do it again.

525
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:03,400
It's good for you.

526
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,760
Venting like this

527
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,360
doesn't make any sense.

528
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,760
I…

529
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,240
If you have nothing important to say,
I'll go back to my department.

530
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,400
Chen Shoujie has been recuperating
at the medical hall these past few days,

531
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:15,000
sometimes lucid, sometimes dull.

532
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:18,720
I have already brought him
to the Imperial Guards.

533
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,040
If you want to question him, come with me.

534
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,800
Mr. Chen, can you tell me

535
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,320
what exactly happened?

536
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,960
Why are there
Jinxiu Workshop's works in your house?

537
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,880
She's my concubine.

538
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,480
Previously at Jinxiu Workshop,

539
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,960
she also worked as an embroideress

540
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,760
and even had apprentices.

541
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,840
Her craftsmanship is truly exquisite.

542
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,760
When Jinxiu Workshop got involved in a case,

543
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,840
she just happened to be out.

544
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:24,040
Afterwards, the imperial court
searched for the remaining party,

545
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,240
and she was hiding everywhere

546
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,800
and met me.

547
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,080
I appreciated her merits,

548
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,680
so I took her in as a concubine.

549
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,400
She made

550
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,320
these embroidery works

551
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:41,720
in her leisure time.

552
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,160
Fire!

553
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,800
Fire!

554
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,000
I don't think

555
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,400
we can get any clue from him.

556
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,960
So Mrs. Chen

557
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,040
was once an embroideress
at the Jinxiu Workshop.

558
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,880
So the murderer

559
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,720
wanted to eliminate all those

560
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,520
related to the Jinxiu Workshop case?

561
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,680
If that's the case,

562
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,720
does it mean that

563
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,480
the Jinxiu Workshop case

564
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,240
has a big secret?

565
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,160
A secret that the murderer would kill people

566
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,080
to keep it quiet.

567
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,120
But right now it's all speculation.

568
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:33,400
We have no evidence.

569
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:34,640
Indeed.

570
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,200
Further investigation is required.

571
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,640
And it should be a targeted investigation.

572
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:40,040
I have decided

573
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,360
to write an application today

574
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:43,120
and submit it
to the Ministry of Justice tomorrow,

575
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,840
to apply for a combined investigation

576
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:45,880
of the Chen Huo'e case and

577
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,960
the Jinxiu Workshop case.

578
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,400
I'm afraid it will be difficult.

579
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,600
These two cases involve too many people.

580
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,360
None of them want the old cases
to be brought up again,

581
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,360
so they will do everything they can

582
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,520
to obstruct the investigation.

583
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,760
But if we don't try,

584
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,240
we'll never know the results.

585
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,400
What's going on?

586
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,080
The people from Princess of Valor's mansion
are making things difficult for Han Shiyuan

587
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:09,640
and blocking our way.

588
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,760
Mr. Han, Princess of Valor invites you to come.

589
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,400
Wait.

590
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:20,640
Don't act rashly.

591
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,600
Jing Lin, go find Zhang Baohuan.

592
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,768
Yes.

593
00:42:40,343 --> 00:42:44,161
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

594
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:47,838
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

595

♫ You are the one for me ♫

612
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:02,222
♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

613
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:05,892
♫ Every moment is treasured ♫

00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:10,551
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

616
00:44:13,584 --> 00:44:16,810
♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

617
00:44:16,810 --> 00:44:20,550
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:25,567
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

619
00:44:25,567 --> 00:44:28,447
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

620
00:44:28,447 --> 00:44:32,735
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

621
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:36,511
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

622
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:38,081
♫ Your palm lines ♫

623
00:44:38,081 --> 00:44:40,831
