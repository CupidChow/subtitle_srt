♫ Tears and blood in the past life ♫

[Episode 7]

15
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,520
I've practiced the pipa for two hours.

16
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:47,680
It's exhausting than having a day of autopsy.

17
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
Qin, get me some preserved fruits.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,872
Yes.

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,216
Great Chief.

20
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,320
What are you doing here?

21
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,840
This is the Shen Mansion.

22
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,960
I can do

23
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,160
whatever I want.

24
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
But you…

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,840
Do you really consider yourself
the hostess here?

26
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,520
How dare you to ask my servant late at night

27
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,840
to get the preserved fruits from the kitchen,

28
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,760
and play that noisy sounds on the pipa.

29
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,200
I bought these preserved fruits
from west street.

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,800
Next time, I will get them myself,

32
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,320
and won't trouble your servants.

33
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:28,200
As for the noisy sounds,

34
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,200
in order to make them pleasant
as soon as possible,

35
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,600
I can only practice all night

36
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,920
to make it sound good.

37
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,040
Please forgive me.

38
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,160
Singing and dancing require talent.

39
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,600
Cramming at the last minute

40
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:40,280
will only invite ridicule.

41
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,280
I advise you

42
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,280
give it up to pretend to be a courtesan.

43
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
What if I succeed?

44
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,400
Even if you succeed,
won't solve the case anyway.

45
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,520
Don't forget

46
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,400
the murderer targets one man and one woman.

47
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,440
Just you alone is not enough.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,000
There must also be

49
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,960
a man constantly entangled with the courtesan.

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
Well,

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:02,680
I do have a candidate in mind.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,720
Great Chief.

53
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,320
Please invite him over.

54
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Well, I…

55
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,680
Director Wu.

56
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,320
Today,

57
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,440
please accompany Mrs. Shen

58
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,600
to the Mizar Festival together.

59
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,360
She insisted you

60
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,600
to be this role.

61
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,120
Great Chief, you have misunderstood me.

62
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
I am wronged.

63
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
If you don't believe me,

64
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,680
inquire at the Ministry of Justice.

65
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,160
Mrs. Shen and I are by no means close.

66
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,160
We can't get along well,

67
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,320
and are at loggerheads with each other.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,640
You don't have to be that anxious.

69
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,800
Today,

70
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,120
Mrs. Shen only disguises herself

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,040
as your pretty mistress.

72
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,120
Great Chief, well…

73
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:01,160
Why me?

74
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,880
Great Chief, don't drag me.

75
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,960
Great Chief.

76
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,160
Why me?

77
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,760
Because your mistress

78
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,520
is so beautiful,

79
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,480
and famous in the Imperial City.

80
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,560
You!

81
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,200
Let me go.

82
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,480
Great Chief.

83
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
Mrs. Shen rarely dresses up like this,

84
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,240
looking quite charming indeed.

85
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,120
If you have time to flatter me here,

86
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,000
better do something practical.

87
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,320
Yes.

88
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,080
Follow me.

89
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:58,800
Good, good.

90
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:04,240
Good, good.

91
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,040
On the Mizar Festival,

92
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,800
the Empress Dowager will make a street parade,

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,480
requiring my escort.

94
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,600
You must keep a close watch on Mrs. Shen.

95
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,000
If there's any weird movement,

96
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
capture him immediately.

97
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,680
If something happens to her,

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,760
you will be held accountable.

99
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:28,880
Long live Your Majesty!

100
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,640
Empress Dowager.

101
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:35,040
May you live long!

102
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,920
Good.

103
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,040
Splendid!

104
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,480
I wonder

105
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,720
if there is any talented man or lady

106
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,480
would like to perform on stage.

107
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,440
Everyone.

108
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,880
My beloved concubine

109
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,800
wishes to present to you a piece of

110
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,680
pipa music.

111
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,280
Good.

112
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,720
How dare this Wu Taiming

113
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,320
to bring his mistress

114
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,640
here openly!

115
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,560
How can he call the courtesan
who has not been married in his family

116
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,520
his concubine?

117
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,200
He's embarrassing Mrs. Wu.

118
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:25,840
Long live Your Majesty!

119
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,560
Empress Dowager.

120
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:31,960
May you live long!

121
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:36,320
Greetings, Your Majesty.

122
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,000
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

123
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,440
You two

124
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,880
are coming to west street

125
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,640
to parade for blessing.

126
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,960
May the Heaven bring good luck

127
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,680
and the great prosperity to Dacang.

128
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,360
May wind and rain come on time.

129
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,840
May the country be prosperous
and the people at peace.

130
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,320
Good, good.

131
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,160
Really good.

132
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,880
Look, it's a phoenix.

133
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
It is a phoenix.

134
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
It is really beautiful. It's a divine bird.

135
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:57,160
Good, good.

136
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,800
It's heaven's will.

137
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,760
May the Heaven bring good luck

138
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,720
and bless our Dacang.

139
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,560
What is this fragrance? It's so strange.

140
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,360
A thousand butterflies dance,
dancers' sleeves swing.

141
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,680
Nine branches of the night pavilion
awaken the song and bell.

142
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,360
Well matched, good!

143
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,560
Madam.

144
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,960
Madam.

145
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,080
- Jing Lin
- Great Chief.

146
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,240
Wu Taiming and Madam are missing.

147
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,416
Get on.

148
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,160
Say it.

149
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,800
Who is the mastermind behind the murder case?

150
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,200
Murder case? What murder case?

151
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,480
Where is Mrs. Shen?

152
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Spare my life.

153
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,880
Great Chief, spare him.

154
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,000
This is a scandal in my family.

155
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,200
My brother-in-law had an affair.

156
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
I wanted to teach him a lesson,

157
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
is this a crime?

158
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,240
Most of these paired corpses

159
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:33,000
knew each other well in life.

160
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,440
They were often seen together.

161
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
However, there are two pairs,

162
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,600
for whom no entanglements have been
found prior to their deaths.

163
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,968
Terrible!

164
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,280
I am Shen Du, are you okay?

165
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,360
Shen Du.

166
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,560
Shen Du, do you still recognize me?

167
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,200
Of course, I recognize you.

168
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,640
Yan Xing.

169
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,920
I would never forget it.

170
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,000
None of this is real.

171
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,640
Should I recognize you?

172
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,480
Don't try to be

173
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,280
the real Mrs. Shen.

174
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,800
You are not the wife I want to marry,

175
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:14,000
don't try to survive in the Shen Mansion.

176
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,760
Where is this?

177
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,920
You don't need to know.

178
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,000
Why have you killed so many people?

179
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,280
You don't need to know.

180
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:45,680
Why do you talk so much nonsense?

181
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:46,680
It seems today,

182
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,040
I can't escape from you.

183
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,080
Why don't you take off the mask

184
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,640
and show me your face?

185
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,040
Everyone knows you

186
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,240
are smart, Yan Liuniang.

187
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,160
If I show you my face,

188
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,432
after you die,

189
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,960
you will be a ghost

190
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,680
and tell your husband in the dream,

191
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,880
then what would I do?

192
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,280
You have killed so many people.

193
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:20,440
Their resentment

194
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,520
has long turned into
fierce ghosts surrounding you

195
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,840
and accompanying you day and night.

196
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,360
Can't you see them?

197
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,720
They are nothing,

198
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,520
but people who deserved to die.

199
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,040
Even if they turned into ghosts,

200
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,640
would still not dare to appear before me.

201
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:39,720
Or I'll kill them again.

202
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,000
Am I also someone who deserves to die?

203
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,320
The people you mentioned

204
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:44,560
all share common traits,

205
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,920
and you think they deserve to die.

206
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,320
In your eyes,

207
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,640
do I also deserve to die?

208
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,360
Even if you ask so many questions,

209
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,880
you have to die anyway.

210
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,200
But…

211
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,760
I have to wait

212
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,760
a little longer.

213
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,440
What are you waiting for?

214
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,920
I'm waiting for your blood to coagulate.

215
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,520
Then when I take your heart out,

216
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:32,080
you won't even bleed.

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,400
I am Mrs. Shen.

218
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,440
If you dare to kill me,

219
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,960
when they find you,

220
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,960
they will certainly skin you.

221
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,600
Even if I don't kill you,

222
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,040
Shen Du won't let me go if he catches me.

223
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,560
I have to die anyway.

224
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:59,640
I might

225
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:02,400
kill you as well.

226
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,440
I can plead for you.

227
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,720
He might leave you an intact body.

228
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,640
We have a very good relationship.

229
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,320
The whole Xiang'an City knows it well.

230
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,680
He will listen to me.

231
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,200
He will listen to me.

232
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,800
He will listen to me.

233
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,800
He will listen to me.

234
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:24,000
Shut up!

235
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,560
You shut up!

236
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,160
You shameless hussy!

237
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,440
He won't listen to you.

238
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:31,680
He is mine, mine, mine!

239
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,496
Stop.

240
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,016
Let me go.

241
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,408
Liuniang.

242
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,200
Are you okay?

243
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,608
Liuniang.

244
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:10,280
Thank you for arriving in time.

245
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,440
Fortunately,
you've sprinkled flour on your clothes,

246
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,079
so the dog could follow your scent over here.

247
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,368
How do you feel?

248
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
I-I'm fine.

249
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,920
But…

250
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,040
Have you caught the murderer?

251
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:05,120
But I had a dream.

252
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,584
Jing Lin.

253
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,640
Take off her mask.

254
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,712
It's you.

255
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,888
Liuniang.

256
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
Take her into the Imperial Guards.

257
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,680
Yes.

258
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,760
Take her away.

259
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,880
Yes.

260
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,720
Liuniang, you're awake.

261
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:13,480
Chuichui, how long have I slept?

262
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,240
Where is Mrs. Tang?

263
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,440
Has she been interrogated?

264
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
You've only slept for two hours.

265
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
Why are you asking these questions
right after waking up?

266
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:27,120
No wonder Shen Du asked me
to keep a good eye on you.

267
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,200
What's the outcome?

268
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,880
Of course, she won't admit it.

269
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,920
But

270
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,440
the Empress Dowager visits the Imperial Guards

271
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,120
to interrogate her personally.

272
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,600
Let's see if she will admit it this time.

273
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,480
I'll go.

274
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,640
You stay.

275
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,160
You're not even off your meds yet.

276
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,080
I've been investigating
this murderer for a long time.

277
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,040
I know how to make her talk.

278
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,720
No way.

279
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,640
You've almost lost your life today.

280
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,680
The sky won't fall without you.

281
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,760
Besides,

282
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,960
Shen Du told me to keep an eye on you.

283
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,240
Are you my friend or his friend?

284
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,560
Chuichui, you know me.

285
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:11,720
No one can stop me

286
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,800
from doing anything I want.

287
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,120
There is one thing

288
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,400
I need your help with.

289
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,080
I truly never expected

290
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:29,880
that the one who committed this heinous crime

291
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,000
would be

292
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,760
the widow of Tang Chengyi, a loyal official.

293
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,720
Why would you do such a thing?

294
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,880
I remember

295
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,800
you and Mrs. Tang

296
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,080
were very close.

297
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,960
Now,

298
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,440
she is the suspect in the murder case.

299
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,840
Princess of Valor.

300
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,000
Do you know any inside story?

301
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,040
Mother Empress,

302
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,280
although I had some interactions

303
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,480
with Mrs. Tang,

304
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,240
I really didn't know anything

305
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,680
about her committing murder.

306
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,760
If I had known she was the murderer,

307
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:17,160
I would never have been close to her.

308
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,640
Let me ask you.

309
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,000
Why would you kill

310
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,280
so many innocent people?

311
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,880
They are not innocent.

312
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,680
Dacang has its own laws.

313
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,680
If they are innocent or not,

314
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,240
it's not for you to decide.

315
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I am Yan Xing,
a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

316
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,320
Sorry for the abruptness
in this urgent situation.

317
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,080
Empress Dowager, please forgive me.

318
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,360
I have failed to manage my wife strictly.

319
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,760
Sorry to disturb you.

320
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,520
Empress Dowager, please punish me.

321
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:09,160
It's alright.

322
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,520
I've heard that Mrs. Shen is quite skilled at

323
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,880
solving cases through deduction.

324
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:16,120
This Meng Ceran

325
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,200
refuses to confess.

326
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,760
What do you think?

327
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,040
Empress Dowager.

328
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:29,280
Those men

329
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,440
Mrs. Tang killed

330
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,960
all had matrimonial engagement,

331
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,920
yet loved to have fun

332
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,360
with courtesans.

333
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,160
And those women all had a similar appearance,

334
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,680
with flying fairy hairstyle,

335
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:42,000
and were courtesans
skilled in playing the pipa.

336
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Shut up! Who would believe such nonsense?

337
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,120
Empress Dowager.

338
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,760
All the bodies that have been found

339
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,080
have been treated with cinnabar

340
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,520
to delay decomposition,

341
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,800
resulting in the inaccurate

342
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,800
estimated time of death.

343
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,960
Later, we deduced

344
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,280
the correct date of death.

345
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,400
Astonishingly,

346
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,200
we found they were
all during the Mizar Festival

347
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,960
calculated by the Astronomical Bureau.

348
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Mrs. Tang.

349
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,200
Are you really doing all this

350
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,680
just to vent your hatred?

351
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,800
At first,

352
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:17,160
I was guessing you did it

353
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,240
based on the similarities in the faces.

354
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,880
But later I discovered

355
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,240
that it involved much more

356
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,320
about a deep fixation on their status.

357
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,520
I think

358
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,520
the women you killed

359
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,080
were mostly associated with someone

360
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,720
very close to you.

361
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,240
Shut up!

362
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,040
Have you suffered any trauma?

363
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,080
Or perhaps,

364
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,320
did you have any emotional entanglements

365
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,280
with other men

366
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,240
that occurred on Mizar Festival?

367
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,720
Nonsense!

368
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,840
What

369
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,080
a hang speech!

370
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
Right, a few days ago,

371
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,520
my husband caught a cold at night.

372
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,680
The weather has turned colder recently,

373
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,440
you must take care.

374
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,320
It's much better now.

375
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,440
If you take care more of me,

376
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:15,360
I wouldn't catch cold.

377
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,040
But you…

378
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,480
You have been frightened,

379
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,160
why don't you take rest well?

380
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,480
I am

381
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:28,240
worried about you.

382
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,600
Great Chief, you really treat
the Imperial Guards as your home.

383
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,400
Mrs. Shen even treats this place

384
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,160
as her own room.

385
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,440
Seeing how much in love you are,

386
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:42,360
I am very pleased.

387
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,840
But Mrs. Shen,

388
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,240
the case matters.

389
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,040
You have to do your job well.

390
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,680
Yes, I'm sorry.

391
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,760
Xu Xiangren requests to come.

392
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:12,640
I'm Xu Xiangren.

393
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,080
Greetings to you, Empress Dowager.

394
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:19,280
Liuniang.

395
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,360
I take my leave.

396
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:30,200
Another pair of male and female bodies
were dug up at inspector's place.

397
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,080
This is the reconstruction portrait
of the male victim's face

398
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,360
that I have made.

399
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,080
You give it to me!

400
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,000
Give it to me!

401
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:56,840
Just as expected.

402
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,160
In your mind,

403
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:01,000
you are the victim, right?

404
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,240
You know nothing.

405
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,040
This is not my fault.

406
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,560
They betrayed me first.

407
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:17,320
It's them…

408
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,440
This is all their fault.

409
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,800
I treated him so well.

410
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,280
Why did he betray me?

411
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,680
The one you're talking about

412
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,760
is the person in the portrait,

413
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,360
your first husband.

414
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,640
It is him.

415
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,920
During my childhood,

416
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,800
my younger sister was kidnapped.

417
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,080
When we met,

418
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,080
she had become

419
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,960
a courtesan who's skilled at pipa.

420
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,800
At that time,

421
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:08,880
I was already married.

422
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,080
But I never expected

423
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,840
on the Mizar Festival…

424
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,840
On the Mizar Festival, I discovered

425
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,000
she was having an affair with my husband.

426
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,760
The two people I loved the most.

427
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:25,920
The two people I trusted the most.

428
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,880
Both betrayed me.

429
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,680
To save face,

430
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,160
I gave her a cup of poisoned wine.

431
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,600
But unexpectedly,

432
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,680
my husband

433
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:40,000
drank the wine.

434
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,408
No!

435
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,120
After my husband passed away,

436
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,280
my younger sister also disappeared.

437
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:53,440
I really looked for her for a very long time.

438
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,720
In the end,

439
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,960
I found her in a grave.

440
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:04,520
The two of them

441
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:08,440
were still tightly embracing each other!

442
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,320
No.

443
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:23,240
It's not like that.

444
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:25,512
It's not like this.

445
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,400
It's not like that.

446
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,680
It's not like that.

447
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,000
That despicable woman

448
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,720
wasn't my younger sister at all.

449
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:35,240
She was just

450
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,200
a courtesan

451
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,760
who seduced my husband.

452
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,040
She deserved to die.

453
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,600
She did not choose to be a decent person,

454
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,880
instead, went to seduce my husband.

455
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,520
She deserved to be torn to pieces.

456
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,480
She deserved to be skinned and deboned.

457
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
She deserved to be humiliated by the world

458
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:54,120
and laughed at by everyone.

459
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,120
So you killed those

460
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,960
who resembled

461
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,160
your younger sister?

462
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,112
Does it look good?

463
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:10,376
Pretty.

464
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,280
They deserved to die.

465
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,800
And those despicable men!

466
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,080
Why do they always

467
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,760
love those courtesans?

468
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,360
In this world,

469
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:25,680
not everyone has the right
to choose their own life.

470
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,680
Among them,

471
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,080
many were born in the music house

472
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,520
and can only serve others with beauty,

473
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:31,720
without any choice.

474
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,280
Moreover, you can't

475
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:35,880
kill others for this.

476
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,320
Actually, at first,

477
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:48,040
I also blamed myself.

478
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,320
If it weren't for me,

479
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,960
my younger sister wouldn't have died,

480
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:56,240
nor would my husband.

481
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,000
If it wasn't for my mistake,

482
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,560
I wouldn't have

483
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:04,800
lost both my loved ones at the same time.

484
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,000
So, you regret it.

485
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,760
You put those bodies

486
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:10,920
in a hug posture

487
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,480
to fulfill their wish.

488
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,520
Mrs. Shen.

489
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,200
You're indeed smart.

490
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,720
You hit the nail on the head.

491
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,600
But do you think

492
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:26,520
that with your wisdom,

493
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:30,280
you can forever win a man's heart?

494
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:44,920
Do you think he's going to
keep protecting you like that?

495
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:46,480
He said to love you,

496
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,800
but he only loves himself.

497
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,480
He will lie to you,

498
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,440
get your heart break

499
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,000
and wish to die.

500
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,720
What's wrong with loving yourself?

501
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,760
Everyone should love themselves

502
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,960
before they love others.

503
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
Between a couple,

504
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
it should never be one-sided taking,

505
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,880
nor should it be one-sided protection.

506
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,000
A couple

507
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,120
should weather the storm

508
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,400
and face the challenges together.

509
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:13,200
That's what a family should be.

510
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,760
Empress Dowager.

511
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,800
The truth is now clear.

512
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:56,200
And the murderer has confessed her crime.

513
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,960
As for how to deal with Mrs. Tang,

514
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,480
Empress Dowager, please give your instructions.

515
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,040
Empress Dowager.

516
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,280
In my opinion,

517
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,200
the murderer has become insane.

518
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,200
Empress Dowager, please

519
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,880
do not dwell on past affections

520
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,560
and close the case quickly.

521
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:16,320
Considering she is
the widow of a loyal official,

522
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,040
leave her an intact body.

523
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,104
Yes.

524
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:45,840
Like a moth to a flame,

525
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,680
live at dawn, die at dusk.

526
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,360
Not entering samsara,

527
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:53,880
undying.

528
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,440
Jing Lin, put out the fire.

529
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,704
Yes.

530
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,480
Isn't that what Chen Huo'e said

531
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,480
before she died

532
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,760
five years ago?

533
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,400
Take this madwoman away.

534
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,760
Yes.

535
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:41,120
Have you been this nosy since you were a kid?

536
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,600
It's a matter of life and death.

537
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,320
How can you say so?

538
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,120
I know.

539
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,680
You asked Chuichui

540
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,880
to keep an eye on me.

541
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,560
But if I hadn't gone there,

542
00:33:51,560 --> 00:33:52,840
how can Madam Tang's case

543
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:54,520
be that easily settled?

544
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,904
Today,

545
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:08,040
you did well.

546
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,800
Aren't

547
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,280
you going to scold me?

548
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,920
Another pair of male and female bodies dug up.

549
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:20,719
It's what you made up yourself, right?

550
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:22,159
I asked Mr. Xu

551
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:23,320
to get the portrait

552
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,880
of Mrs. Tang first husband,

553
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,400
in order to provoke her into telling the truth.

554
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,360
The truth is clear now.

555
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,679
But…

556
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:36,440
But we're missing something

557
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,080
on this case.

558
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,600
What exactly are we missing?

559
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
The hearts.

560
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,040
Mrs. Tang has killed so many people

561
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,560
and all the deceased
had their hearts taken out.

562
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,440
So where have all those hearts gone?

563
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,200
Mrs. Tang.

564
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,800
I have something important to ask you.

565
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,880
Murder is easy.

566
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:26,960
Moving the body,

567
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:27,960
digging a hole,

568
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,000
and reburying

569
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,120
are not something

570
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,760
a woman could easily do.

571
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,320
You must have had help.

572
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,120
To go to such great lengths,

573
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,200
what's it really for?

574
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,840
Like a moth to a flame.

575
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:47,200
Like a moth to a flame.

576
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,040
She's gone mad.

577
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,800
She's very important.

578
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,960
How can she be mad?

579
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:10,080
I will never die.

580
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:13,040
I would become a moth

581
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:15,720
and live forever.

582
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,120
Flying.

583
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,640
You've killed so many people,

584
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,000
where have all the hearts gone?

585
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,600
I'm flying.

586
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,760
- Meng Ceran.
- I'm flying.

587
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,880
Please burn me to death.

588
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,880
Please.

589
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,400
I want to be reborn from the flames.

590
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,360
I want to be reborn from the flames.

591
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,000
Please. Please.

592
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,280
No need to ask. Whatever

593
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,600
a madwoman says

594
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:52,880
lacks credibility.

595
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,920
Burn me. Burn me now.

596
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:57,160
She will be executed soon.

597
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,040
Burn me.

598
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,000
Burn me now.

599
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,240
What are you thinking about?

600
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,520
I'm thinking about Mrs. Tang's case.

601
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:26,080
Her love turned into hatred,

602
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,960
and became her obsession.

603
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,480
Yet it's a mix of love and hatred,

604
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,640
which she can't let go of.

605
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,000
It's so sad.

606
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,920
A fool would indulge himself

607
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:41,280
in a relationship.

608
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,880
And in this world,

609
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,520
fools often do evil deeds.

610
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,880
What's there to be sad about?

611
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,000
Yes.

612
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,920
That sounds like something
someone as smart as you

613
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:53,640
would think.

614
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,760
Great Chief, I am exhausted.

615
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,632
I need to rest.

616
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,960
Prince Xian has successfully completed

617
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:05,320
the disaster relief affairs

618
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,120
and will soon arrive safely at Xiang'an.

619
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,160
That's good news.

620
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,000
From now on,

621
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,640
there's no need to wander over
to the pigeon coop.

622
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:26,200
I wonder who gave you the false information.

623
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:29,080
But the secret letters from the Imperial Guards

624
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,160
don't need the carrier pigeons.

625
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,720
I know that.

626
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:38,720
Those pigeons in the coop
all have soft feathers,

627
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:41,520
and are simply incapable
of long-distance flight.

628
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,720
But I have to

629
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,680
wander around the mansion.

630
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,440
You have your jobs.

631
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,240
And I have my jobs.

632
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:52,640
I have to pretend to do something.

633
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,840
But no real action will be taken.

634
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,264
Rest assured.

635
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,760
Now you can believe

636
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,600
that even a tiger will not eat its cubs.

637
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,840
Let alone

638
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,240
the strongest of them all.

639
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,160
Stop it, I don't want to hear it.

640
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:08,880
I don't want to hear what I shouldn't,

641
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,160
lest trouble finds me.

642
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Right, I have something

643
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,400
to tell you.

644
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,360
The Ministry of Justice and the inspectors
are holding a celebration banquet

645
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,440
and have sent over invitations,

646
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,840
inviting both you and me to attend.

647
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,720
- I know.
- I…

648
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:26,960
You won't go.

649
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,440
I'm just letting you know.

650
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,440
Jing Lin.

651
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,936
Yes, Great Chief.

652
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,120
Tell Mr. Zhong

653
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,600
to make another set

654
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:52,240
of the light-blocking curtains.

655
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,280
Yes, Great Chief.

656
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,720
What beautiful flower buds.

657
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,672
What a pity.

658
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,840
Your Highness.

659
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,880
Sir.

660
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,400
Your disaster relief
and pacification efforts this time

661
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,720
are of immense merit and hard work.

662
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,640
I've heard

663
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:33,720
that the Empress Dowager
will reward you greatly.

664
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:36,920
Was your journey back peaceful?

665
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,760
Rest assured.

666
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,640
Imperial Guards escorted me
throughout the journey.

667
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,640
It's very safe.

668
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,120
I have brought back some
local specialties this time.

669
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,160
Prepare one portion

670
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,320
and let him take it back.

671
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,600
Prepare another portion

672
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,840
and send it to my imperial sister.

673
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:02,760
It's my kindness to her.

674
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,320
Yes.

675
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,120
Your Highness, you are kind-hearted

676
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,560
and love your sister.

677
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,440
I am truly moved.

678
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,040
But recently, Princess of Valor

679
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:16,720
was involved in the case of Mrs. Tang.

680
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,800
I am afraid
she's having a difficult time these days.

681
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,520
When I was on the way back,

682
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,600
I also heard about this.

683
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:27,640
She has always been
on good terms with Mrs. Tang,

684
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:29,440
and both support the poor scholars.

685
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:31,200
But the public opinion now

686
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,080
is very unfavorable towards them.

687
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,560
Indeed.

688
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,680
On the Mrs. Tang's case,

689
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,720
I didn't expect

690
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,040
Yan Liuniang

691
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,640
could make great contributions.

692
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:43,520
I didn't expect this concubine's daughter

693
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,280
would have

694
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,680
some tactics

695
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:49,520
at the critical moment.

696
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,240
Prince Xian.

697
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,840
Do you think this Yan Liuniang

698
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,000
could be…

699
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,000
The one you value

700
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,400
would naturally be excellent.

701
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,920
I think

702
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:10,320
she is the one

703
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,160
who breaks the deadlock.

704
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,160
This flower needs to be fertilized.

705
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,679
[Princess of Valor Mansion]

706
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:20,840
Your Highness.

707
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,240
Seems like

708
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,000
many women are claiming illness

709
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,480
and not attending this Floral Banquet.

710
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,000
Understood.

711
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:33,160
Those who don't want to come

712
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,840
don't have to come anymore.

713
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,200
Those who cannot be used by me…

714
00:43:05,942 --> 00:43:09,760
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

715
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:13,437
