Chuichui, come and see.

16
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:56,040
Here's the finest silk delivered from Jiangnan.

17
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,200
Check out the pattern and fabric.

18
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,320
Should I find embroideresses
to make you a bridal gown?

19
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:13,192
Chuichui.

20
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,000
Look.

21
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,440
I'll wear this at the wedding.

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:21,224
What do you think?

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,520
Are you crazy?

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,560
I won't marry you.

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,400
Of course, you will.

26
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
One day,

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,440
you will be willing to marry me.

28
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,360
Look.

29
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,120
These two garments

30
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,880
look so well-matched together.

31
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,680
Let me go!

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,400
You lecher. Let go!

33
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,720
Before you fall for me like you fell

34
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,480
for Jiang Langxing

35
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,080
and agree to marry me,

36
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,520
I wouldn't let you go.

37
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,840
I won't fall for you.

38
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,040
No way.

39
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,560
What's wrong?

40
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,760
Are you still expecting someone to save you?

41
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,760
It won't happen.

42
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,480
Be it Jiang Langxing or Yan Xing,

43
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,800
no one will come to save you.

44
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,120
I'm warning you.

45
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,320
Do not hurt them.

46
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,040
I won't hurt them

47
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,760
unless they ask for it.

48
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,496
Chuichui.

49
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,720
Chuichui.

50
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,800
It's everyone

51
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,760
for themselves in this world.

52
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,360
You can't count on anyone.

53
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,720
You only have me.

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,960
Only me.

55
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,240
What's wrong?

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,520
You're not going to hit me?

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,680
Chuichui.

58
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,040
I truly adore you.

59
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,640
From now on,

60
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,720
I won't force you again.

61
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,280
I will wait patiently

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,280
until you

63
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:50,320
fall in love with me.

64
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,720
Jin.

65
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,880
Excuse me.

66
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,240
Excuse me.

67
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,640
- Yan Xing.
- Slow down.

68
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,040
Liuniang.

69
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,960
Mother.

70
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:29,600
They released you?

71
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,000
Thankfully, your father filed a complaint

72
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
saying that I was already

73
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,560
a member of the Yan family.

74
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,400
It was Prime Minister Zhang.

75
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,000
He sent me a message,
permitting me to file the complaint.

76
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
The Great Chief sent Imperial Guards

77
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,560
with me to pick her up.

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:46,640
Madam, the Great Chief went to the palace.

79
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,960
Mother.

80
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,480
You've been wronged.

81
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,720
I'm fine.

82
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:53,160
But your uncle…

83
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,720
Your uncle…

84
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
Empress Dowager, please think twice.

85
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,520
Someone despicable composed those lyrics.

86
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,360
It has nothing to do with Prince Xian

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,200
and even less with my clansmen.

88
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,080
Prince Xian appreciates me

89
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:10,720
just like Boya appreciates Ziqi.

90
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,760
This is all plotted

91
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:13,960
by Lai Luozhi.

92
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,880
Empress Dowager, please think twice.

93
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
Do Prince Xian justice.

94
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,880
Jinzang.

95
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,120
- Mother.
- Jinzang.

96
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,160
- Mother.
- Jinzang.

97
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,040
Still babbling nonsense at death's door.

98
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,920
Guards, stuff him in the urn.

99
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,040
Lai Luozhi.

100
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,840
How dare you carry out a private execution?

101
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,520
Vice Minister Lai.

102
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,440
I have something to tell you.

103
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,560
It's a secret

104
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,400
I'm telling you only.

105
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,384
Back off.

106
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:49,720
You're just a powerless

107
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,960
musician.

108
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,640
I'd like to hear

109
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,000
what you have to say

110
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,400
before you die.

111
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,080
My clansmen and I

112
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,800
are suffering this calamity

113
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,600
all because of you!

114
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
- Uncle.
- Zang.

115
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,320
- Uncle.
- Zang.

116
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,480
Stay back!

117
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,520
- Zang.
- Step back.

118
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,480
Uncle.

119
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,000
Chest. Huo'e.

120
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,760
Xing, you must deliver this blood letter

121
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:31,120
to the Empress Dowager.

122
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,560
Take care of yourself.

123
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,680
And you.

124
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,480
Zang.

125
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,800
Uncle.

126
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,248
Zang.

127
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,792
Zang.

128
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,920
No!

129
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,000
Uncle.

130
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,552
Mr. Jin.

131
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,920
Lai Luozhi.

132
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:32,000
Are you going to snatch the testimony

133
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,360
for the Empress Dowager

134
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,760
in front of everyone?

135
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,072
Step back.

136
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,920
What?

137
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,120
Jinzang is dead?

138
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,840
When…

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,080
When did I order anyone

140
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,320
to kill him?

141
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,200
Mr. Jin couldn't bear the humiliation

142
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,480
and cried out injustice

143
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,840
for Prince Xian in the parade,

144
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,800
claiming it was plotted by Vice Minister Lai

145
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:13,240
and then killed himself.

146
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,760
This is the blood letter written by Mr. Jin.

147
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,400
I beg for your discernment.

148
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,000
E-Empress Dowager.

149
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:59,240
When did I…

150
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,640
When did I

151
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,560
want the Jins dead?

152
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
Empress Dowager.

153
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,320
Jinzang bewitched the people

154
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,080
with seditious words

155
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,640
and attempted to frame me before he died.

156
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,560
I've been wronged.

157
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,280
Vice Minister Lai made a fuss

158
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,760
about an ordinary banquet

159
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,240
and turned it into a bloody case.

160
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,240
Now everyone's discussing Mr. Jin's

161
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,440
tragic death on the street.

162
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,120
The Imperial Inspectorate

163
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,280
should no longer be in charge.

164
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,480
Please entrust the Jin family

165
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,760
to the Imperial Guards for custody.

166
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,680
Empress Dowager, I disagree.

167
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,232
Enough.

168
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:39,520
You're still vying for power at this point.

169
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:42,880
You just won't give me a break.

170
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,400
Minister Shen.

171
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,400
Since you are not afraid of
getting your hands dirty

172
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,040
and insist on intervening,

173
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,680
then I'll entrust

174
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,480
the Jin family to you.

175
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,240
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

176
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:29,720
<i>[Zichen Palace]</i>

177
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,280
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

178
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,920
You are truly wise.

179
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,200
But I didn't summon you.

180
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,040
Aren't you afraid

181
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,840
that I shall convict you

182
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,240
for intruding into the palace
in the middle of the night?

183
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,720
If you wish to punish me,

184
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,520
I can only accept the penalty.

185
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,200
You know?

186
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,920
Only after

187
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,640
I read all these

188
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,920
musical scores left by Jinzang tonight

189
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,160
did I realize that

190
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,520
he had accompanied me for so long.

191
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,080
Why do you never give me some leeway?

192
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,800
How can I do that in a game?

193
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,960
Even if you lose,

194
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,240
I won't punish you.

195
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,680
In that case,

196
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,440
will there be

197
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,600
rewards if I win?

198
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,880
What reward do you want?

199
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,920
If I win this game,

200
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,800
will you

201
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,720
make me the Crown Princess?

202
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,080
Alright.

203
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,160
Deal.

204
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:53,040
The wise foresee the future.

205
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,280
Your "Paired Swallows" move

206
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,200
may seem simple,

207
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,080
but it has endless follow-up moves.

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,080
I have…

209
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:07,680
I have actually lost this game.

210
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,800
You must keep your word, Huan.

211
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,480
Alright.

212
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,296
Your wish will be granted.

213
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,440
Ever since I entered the palace,

214
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,440
from every dance performance

215
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:20,160
to every significant day of mine

216
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,280
and every sleepless night,

217
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,040
he and his konghou

218
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,200
have never missed out on a single event.

219
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:35,960
This scroll is not yet complete.

220
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,600
He meant to perform it

221
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,520
at the grand ceremony after the reconstruction

222
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,760
of the Ming Hall.

223
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,200
He never spoke much.

224
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,720
Never.

225
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,760
He was so quiet

226
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,000
that I often forgot

227
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,320
about his existence.

228
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,640
It's like

229
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,440
there's only a konghou

230
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,800
behind the curtain.

231
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:13,280
When I'm troubled,

232
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:16,119
this konghou

233
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,119
would play

234
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:25,319
soothing melodies by itself.

235
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,760
This konghou

236
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,920
will never sound again.

237
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,360
It's all my fault.

238
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,960
But I only have this one son.

239
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,000
You know?

240
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,680
I had my fortune told when I was young.

241
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:03,200
The fortune teller said that

242
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:08,480
my brilliance was too great

243
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:14,520
that it would scorch those around me.

244
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,840
He also said

245
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,920
that I would end up in solitude.

246
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:26,800
I was infuriated at the time.

247
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,440
I even found someone

248
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,520
to beat up that fortune teller.

249
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,000
But now that I think about it,

250
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,320
he was right.

251
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,760
Not a single person

252
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,360
could stay with me until the end.

253
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,680
Minister Shen.

254
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:21,000
I know.

255
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:25,640
You've been seeking an answer, too.

256
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,760
Once this matter

257
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,520
is completely settled,

258
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:37,760
I will give you an answer.

259
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
You're still up?

260
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,840
I was thinking about my uncle.

261
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,480
I know you were close to him

262
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,760
and would grieve over his death.

263
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,600
Tomorrow, I will send you back

264
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,000
to keep your mother company.

265
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,760
The deceased can't be revived.

266
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,440
Grieving serves no purpose.

267
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,720
I was thinking about

268
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,920
what my uncle had said

269
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
before he died.

270
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:57,520
Chest. Huo'e.

271
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,080
Did Mr. Jin learn

272
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:05,640
something about the Huo'e Sect?

273
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:09,160
My uncle was just a musician.

274
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,480
He knew he couldn't

275
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,640
hurt Lai Luozhi,

276
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:13,760
but he charged toward him

277
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:15,400
to tear at his collar at all costs

278
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,720
before he died.

279
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,840
What for?

280
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,640
Just to humiliate him?

281
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:30,152
<i>[Lu's Pawnshop]</i>

282
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,720
Is Chuichui back?

283
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,760
Did you find her?

284
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,720
Where on earth did she go?

285
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:39,240
If anything happens to her,

286
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,400
how will I explain to her deceased mother?

287
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
Rest assured, I will keep looking

288
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,080
and bring her back.

289
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:47,080
Alright.

290
00:21:54,759 --> 00:21:58,205
<i>[Lai Mansion]</i>

291
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,720
So suicidal.

292
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,360
How dare you minor inspector

293
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,360
barge into my mansion?

294
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,040
Where did you hide Lu Chuichui?

295
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:29,080
Do you know what you are talking about?

296
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:34,600
Inspector Jiang Langxing raided

297
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:37,120
the Vice Minister's mansion at night

298
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,600
and spoke disrespectfully.

299
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,080
Take him into custody.

300
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,920
I won't allow another inspector

301
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:59,960
to end up like Sun Tan.

302
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,360
You rookie.

303
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,480
Get out of here.

304
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,360
You injured my people

305
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:22,280
for no reason.

306
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,080
Don't you owe me an explanation?

307
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,720
Lai Luozhi.

308
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,840
You know

309
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,280
what you've done.

310
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,600
If you make a scene,

311
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,800
guess who will be

312
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,800
in deeper trouble.

313
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:37,320
And don't you forget.

314
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,880
I can easily get things

315
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,800
from the imperial palace.

316
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,800
If you've hidden

317
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,240
something here,

318
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,920
I have my way to get it.

319
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,040
Chuichui.

320
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,880
Chuichui.

321
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,280
Chuichui.

322
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,000
Chuichui.

323
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,400
She's just a random girl.

324
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,120
Yet you're so obsessed with her.

325
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,160
What do you know?

326
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,200
I am all alone

327
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,680
in this world.

328
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,160
Only she understands me

329
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,880
and feels for me.

330
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,000
I am also your family.

331
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,680
I am your older sister.

332
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,360
I won't spare anyone

333
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,920
who ruins my plan.

334
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,240
I will take down

335
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,960
all of them

336
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,080
one by one.

337
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
I've been thinking

338
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,000
about how to make you

339
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,280
vanish into thin air

340
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:16,680
and never come back

341
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:22,600
without him realizing that it is my doing.

342
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,960
Unfortunately,

343
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,400
he knows how to poison and kill people

344
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,960
much better than me.

345
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:39,080
But I have figured it out.

346
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:43,720
Rather than killing you,

347
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,920
I'd better make it impossible

348
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,120
for him to get you.

349
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:09,096
Marshal Xu.

350
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Chuichui.

351
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,200
Chuichui.

352
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:37,760
Are you alright?

353
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,520
Let me see. Are you hurt?

354
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:45,040
Chuichui.

355
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,360
Chuichui.

356
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,968
It's me.

357
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,760
You fool.

358
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,000
What took you so long?

359
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,400
You are such a fool!

360
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:05,200
I went to rescue you at the Lai Mansion

361
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,120
and Marshal Xu came.

362
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,400
Only then did I realize
that he had gotten you out.

363
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm sorry.

364
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:32,360
I thought

365
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,440
I wouldn't be able to see you again.

366
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,040
I failed to protect you.

367
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,480
From now on,

368
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,520
I will not let you suffer any harm.

369
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,240
Chuichui.

370
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,920
I'm sorry.

371
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,272
I'm sorry.

372
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,608
I'm sorry.

373
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,880
What?

374
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,440
You were abducted?

375
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,560
When did it happen?

376
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,640
How come I have no idea?

377
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,040
He didn't hurt you, right?

378
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,440
I'm fine.

379
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,480
Am I not sitting

380
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,880
right in front of you here?

381
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,840
Why did Lai Luozhi abduct you?

382
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:34,680
I'm afraid

383
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:36,640
she's been implicated by me.

384
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,400
No, that's not it.

385
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,880
Liuniang.

386
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,440
I'm sorry.

387
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,240
Actually,

388
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,200
there's something

389
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,880
I've been hiding from you.

390
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:53,880
In fact,

391
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,640
the friend from

392
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,160
the Imperial Inspectorate

393
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,320
I mentioned was Lai Luozhi.

394
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,320
It was him?

395
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,560
At first,

396
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:12,720
I kept seeing him in my mother's graveyard.

397
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:13,960
I thought

398
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:17,120
he was mourning for his mother
and could be my friend.

399
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,280
Later,

400
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,880
he saved me once by chance.

401
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,560
Then I…

402
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,480
Then I…

403
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:27,960
When Caiwei was poisoned,

404
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,360
he gave me the antidote formula that worked

405
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,280
and urged me

406
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,920
not to tell anyone.

407
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,360
So I…

408
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,680
I had this hope that

409
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:39,360
perhaps

410
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:43,120
he wanted to be a good person.

411
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,000
What should I even say?

412
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,600
Chuichui.

413
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,120
Have you read too many dramas?

414
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:51,520
How could you believe him?

415
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,840
Chuichui.

416
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,080
If Jiang Langxing and I had arrived any later,

417
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,680
I'm afraid you would have been

418
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:59,280
forced to marry the Black Fiend.

419
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,920
Right, Chuichui.

420
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,440
I remember your father

421
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,800
built your mother's graveyard at great expense.

422
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,880
Why would Lai Luozhi go there so often?

423
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,720
His mother's graveyard

424
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,800
just happens

425
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,280
to be close to my mother's.

426
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,280
I've visited it once.

427
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,160
It looks

428
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,320
quite inconspicuous.

429
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,120
There's a name on it.

430
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,320
Bi Luo.

431
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:35,040
Bi Luo?

432
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,920
Lai Luozhi's mother

433
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,200
had such a beautiful name.

434
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,400
I'd say he was only pretending to be filial

435
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,000
in front of Chuichui.

436
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,040
I think that

437
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,720
Lai Luozhi has tried so hard

438
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,520
to approach Chuichui

439
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,040
not just to win her over.

440
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,440
Right.

441
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,440
I think I saw something

442
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,040
in Lai Luozhi's secret chamber.

443
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,960
The garment

444
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,080
for the coronation.

445
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,560
Lai Luozhi probably thought

446
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,400
I didn't know what that was.

447
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,920
So he just showed it to me directly.

448
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,600
At first, I pretended not to care.

449
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:17,200
But upon closer inspection, I realized that

450
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,280
the embroidery

451
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:21,080
was not a dragon,

452
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,200
but a Taotie.

453
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:27,200
Among the nine sons of the dragon,

454
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,800
the fifth, Taotie, is the most insatiable.

455
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,520
It seems that

456
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,720
Lai Luozhi's ambition

457
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,040
has been laid bare.

458
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,120
I have things to do. See you around.

459
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,680
I'll see him out.

460
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:05,480
You can't go.

461
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,920
Have you forgotten Sun Tan?

462
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:11,080
He knew about
Lai Luozhi's treacherous intentions

463
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:14,080
but could do nothing
because he lacked evidence.

464
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,679
Now we know that

465
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,960
there is a garment but you're stopping me.

466
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,000
I know you want to

467
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,639
avenge Sun Tan and clear his name.

468
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:21,719
But don't you forget.

469
00:34:21,719 --> 00:34:23,400
You took Chuichui away last night.

470
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,080
Lai Luozhi knows she has seen that garment.

471
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,760
He would be on guard.

472
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:29,360
Would the Lai Mansion
and the Imperial Inspectorate

473
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,520
be more guarded than the imperial palace?

474
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,080
There is nothing I can't steal

475
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,239
as long as

476
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,080
I want to steal it.

477
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:38,480
I will dig into the ground

478
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,800
to find what Lai Luozhi

479
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,880
has hidden.

480
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,719
You've earned your title
as the Saint of Thieves.

481
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,880
But the Lai Mansion
and the Imperial Inspectorate

482
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,480
may be heavily guarded now,

483
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,639
waiting to trap you.

484
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:50,679
They can be way more dangerous

485
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,960
than the imperial palace.

486
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:56,320
Shen Du.

487
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,360
Why did you become so indecisive?

488
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,400
Do men become like this

489
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:01,440
when they get married?

490
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:06,240
You may become like this very soon too.

491
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:16,560
Something is wrong in Xiang'an these days.

492
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,680
People from Nanlang and Xichen

493
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,840
are everywhere,

494
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,040
stationed at street corners,

495
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,480
looking for houses and shops to rent.

496
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,800
Something is going to happen.

497
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,600
We are keeping an eye on them.

498
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:30,000
You can only keep tabs on

499
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,160
a few of them.

500
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:42,088
Shen Du.

501
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,176
If something happens to me,

502
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,280
take care of Yun Que for me.

503
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,104
You'll do the same for me.

504
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:25,200
See you, Great Chief.

505
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,480
Jinzang.

506
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:59,120
Play something light, please.

507
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:02,824
Jinzang.

508
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,080
Empress Dowager.

509
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,800
Empress Dowager.

510
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,264
I'm fine.

511
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,960
It's the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month

512
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:59,120
when the Empress Dowager should
reward the court officials.

513
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,960
Why hasn't she

514
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,720
showed up yet?

515
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,960
Indeed.

516
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:07,080
The Great Chief hasn't shown up, either.

517
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,680
The Empress Dowager felt unwell.

518
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,720
Vice Minister Lai shall

519
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,680
decide on the rewards

520
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,520
according to

521
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,680
last year's record.

522
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,320
Yes, Your Majesty.

523
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,880
I respectfully see you off, Your Majesty.

524
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,360
On behalf of the Empress Dowager,

525
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,640
I shall

526
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,600
decide on the rewards
and punishments based on your performance.

527
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:00,800
How could Lai Luozhi take over such a job?

528
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,560
Indeed, the Imperial Inspectorate
is just a supervisory organ.

529
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,280
How can he break the boundaries?

530
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,520
This is inappropriate.

531
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,520
This is the Empress Dowager's decree.

532
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:09,680
Do you want to bother Her Majesty

533
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,640
when she's sick in bed?

534
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,800
You.

535
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,160
And you.

536
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,800
Do you

537
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:18,240
intend to defy the decree?

538
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Vice Minister Lai.

539
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,680
I'm the Director of the Ministry of Rites.

540
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:37,640
I'm the Chief Clerk of the Ministry of War.

541
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:40,360
You're rewarded.

542
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,800
You're rewarded.

543
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,920
Thank you, Vice Minister Lai.

544
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,160
Auntie, Mother Empress is seriously ill

545
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:03,080
yet no one is allowed to visit her.

546
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,160
Prince Xian is still under house arrest.

547
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,840
Lai Luozhi is gaining momentum.

548
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,120
Auntie.

549
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,680
Half of the court officials

550
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,280
have pledged loyalty to him.

551
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:21,080
The other half are at home doing nothing.

552
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,160
This court is about to descend into chaos.

553
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:55,040
The court is not yet in chaos,

554
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,520
but your heart is in disarray.

555
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,240
Once the heart is in disarray,

556
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:00,600
you lose focus.

557
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,040
Auntie.

558
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,880
How can I stay calm?

559
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,680
No matter what,

560
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,120
you are always the princess.

561
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,360
Why are you panicking?

562
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,080
Auntie.

563
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,600
You know very well

564
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:16,600
that this title

565
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,560
means nothing in the court.

566
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,880
His Majesty still doesn't speak.

567
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,040
The imperial physicians say

568
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,080
that the sage speaks late.

569
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,000
But what if he never speaks?

570
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,280
Now that Mother Empress is ill.

571
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,640
If anything happens,

572
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,120
Auntie,

573
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:39,080
the Regent

574
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:42,840
will be in charge of the entire court.

575
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,520
You want me to help you?

576
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:55,528
Of course.

577
00:41:56,040 --> 00:41:58,240
You said it just now.

578
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,000
Your status as the princess

579
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,560
means nothing in the court.

580
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,480
I've been cultivating for years

581
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,800
and I've seen through the worldly affairs.

582
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,000
No matter what happens,

583
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:11,840
just remember one thing.

584
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:14,600
Serve His Majesty well.

585
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,256
Auntie.

586
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,680
No rush.

587
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,344
This is

588
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,840
only the very beginning.

589
00:42:53,911 --> 00:42:57,729
<i>♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫</i>

590
00:42:57,729 --> 00:43:01,406
<i>♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫</i>

00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:06,103

<i>♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫</i>

594
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:16,049
<i>♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫</i>

595
00:43:16,049 --> 00:43:21,023
<i>♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫</i>

596
00:43:21,023 --> 00:43:23,967
<i>♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫</i>

<i>♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫</i>

598

<i>♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫</i>

599
00:43:31,807 --> 00:43:33,407
<i>♫ Your palm lines ♫</i>

600
00:43:33,407 --> 00:43:36,170
<i>♫ Your gaze ♫</i>

601
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:39,231
<i>♫ Our love is deepening ♫</i>

602
00:43:39,231 --> 00:43:43,487

607
00:43:54,399 --> 00:43:59,193
<i>♫ You are the one for me ♫</i>

608
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:15,790
<i>♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫</i>

609
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:19,460
<i>♫ Every moment is treasured ♫</i>

610
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:24,119
<i>♫ From dawn to dusk ♫</i>

611
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:27,152
<i>♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫</i>

612
00:44:27,152 --> 00:44:30,378

613
00:44:30,378 --> 00:44:34,118
