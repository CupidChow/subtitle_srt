00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,960
Why do we have to come so far?

191
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,320
Only here

192
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,480
can you taste the flavor you want.

193
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,400
Try it if you don't believe me.

194
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,760
Is that how you drink tea?

195
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,800
You just downed it in one gulp.

196
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,320
Master, this is the powder
from the crime scene.

197
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,680
It once appeared near the Jinxiu Workshop.

198
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,120
But I can't tell what it is.

199
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,872
Don't sniff it.

200
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:59,880
Interesting.

201
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,200
Flammable.

202
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,960
Burns without a trace.

203
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,920
This is not something

204
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,440
a common cultivator would use.

205
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,040
I'm afraid that

206
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,720
it's something introduced from foreign regions.

207
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,600
From foreign regions?

208
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,520
Someone in the Ghost Market

209
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,800
might know

210
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,800
where this thing is from.

211
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:20,840
Master.

212
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,840
It's a pity not to use your skills

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:25,160
to solve cases.

214
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,000
I've taught you

215
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,720
most of those skills.

216
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:32,800
It seems

217
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,680
it's time for me to let go.

218
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,120
I've reached this age

219
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,520
where I only look for some peace.

220
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:42,040
Every day I'm alive

221
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,640
is a blessing.

222
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,560
If I can enjoy my tea leisurely

223
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,880
every day,

224
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,640
I'll be content.

225
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,744
It's burning.

226
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,480
Look at you.

227
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
You can't have tea in a hurry.

228
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,520
It's the same for solving cases.

229
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,680
If you're eager for success,

230
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,080
you will inevitably

231
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:09,040
be misguided by

232
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,760
what you see.

233
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,640
Misguided by what I saw.

234
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,960
That's right, Master.

235
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,200
The evidence I have in hand

236
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,280
does strike me

237
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,680
as if it was handed to me on purpose.

238
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,880
Investigating a case

239
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,360
is not just about seeking the truth.

240
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,160
It's also a contest

241
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,960
with an enemy in the dark

242
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:33,160
to see who can gain control

243
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,000
one step ahead.

244
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,600
If the case

245
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,360
of the Jinxiu Workshop

246
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:41,560
was a scheme to ruin the relationship

247
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,520
between the Empress Dowager,

248
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,840
Princess Runing, and the Xiao family,

249
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:47,200
then this time,

250
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:49,240
we are still unaware of

251
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,680
the culprit's intention.

252
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:52,320
Easy.

253
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,600
Handling a case is like tasting tea.

254
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:58,320
It requires a lot of effort.

255
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,480
Everything is like having tea.

256
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,800
[Jingshen Pavilion]
You got it right.

257
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:07,000
It's the same for married couples.

258
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
Master, I'm talking about the case.

259
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,680
And that's what I'm talking about.

260
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,200
Discussing heroes over wine.

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,960
Talking about love over tea.

262
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,560
Tea tastes

263
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:24,400
better and better with every sip.

264
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,920
It's the same with people.

265
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,880
Time reveals a person's true nature.

266
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,240
Nice tea.

267
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,840
Nice tea.

268
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,320
Liuniang, wait.

269
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,928
Come here.

270
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,800
Why aren't you resting at home?

271
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,119
That old geezer Wu Taiming

272
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,760
wouldn't let you come because

273
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,240
you might bring "bad luck".

274
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,119
It's all my fault.

275
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,640
Was Ji Fangming implicated

276
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,079
or scolded?

277
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:23,280
The Historical Archive
was almost burnt down under his watch.

278
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,839
Wu Taiming dare not vent his anger on you.

279
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,880
So, Ji Fangming

280
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,400
took all the scoldings.

281
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:31,080
I'd better figure out

282
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,800
how to apologize to him.

283
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,920
Right.

284
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,200
I heard that

285
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,360
Great Chief Shen carried you home

286
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,760
in his arms in front of everyone.

287
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,000
Do you expect him

288
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,480
to stand by and let me die?

289
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
Listen to yourself.

290
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,240
You never say anything sweet.

291
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,680
So sharp-tongued.

292
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:54,760
Listen to you.

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,600
There's nothing you wouldn't say.

294
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,920
So reckless.

295
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,600
Look at you.

296
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,280
You just returned to the mansion

297
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:05,840
and you're already glowing.

298
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,080
Let me see.

299
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,600
What tricks did they play

300
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,640
to make your eyes

301
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,840
so bright and spirited?

302
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,280
Well…

303
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,200
You don't say.

304
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,080
I fell asleep as soon as

305
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,680
I laid down last night.

306
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:25,240
Could it be that I've gotten used
to sleeping with the lights on

307
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,560
in the Shen Mansion?

308
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,480
On the contrary,

309
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,800
I couldn't sleep here.

310
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:33,240
Alright.

311
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,560
I'm serious.

312
00:18:37,890 --> 00:18:40,898
[Shen Mansion]

313
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,600
This is…

314
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:45,760
My savior.

315
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,040
To repay your kindness,

316
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,120
I've prepared dishes

317
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,720
that could help your eyes recover.

318
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,400
From now on,

319
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,000
you have to keep a healthy diet
with no exception.

320
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,240
I will cook for you until you recover.

321
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,160
Why aren't you eating?

322
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,320
Could it be

323
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:08,840
that you're picky with food?

324
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,240
Or you don't want to eat?

325
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,200
I made these out of goodwill.

326
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,120
Don't waste the food.

327
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,912
I'll leave you to eat.

00:19:23,447 --> 00:19:27,265
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

329
00:19:27,265 --> 00:19:30,942
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

What's the rush, honey?

332
00:19:38,455 --> 00:19:42,882
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

333
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,520
Since when

334
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,840
do you need someone

335
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:50,040
to keep you company over meals?

336
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,040
But you cooked for me.

337
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,495
I'll enjoy the food better in your presence.

what's the rush, honey?

343
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:11,400
You're a grown-up.

344
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,560
Do you still

345
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:15,360
need someone to feed you?

Honey, please dig in.

352
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
From now on,

353
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:57,160
always join me for meals.

354
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,960
Do you agree?

355
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,200
I depend on you for a living.

356
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,440
Do I even have a choice?

357
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:10,360
Good that you know.

358
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,440
What's wrong?

359
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,200
You have no table manners.

360
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,200
That's not true.

361
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,600
I have manners.

362
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,960
What's going on?

363
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,880
What a loving couple.

364
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,640
Others can only be envious.

365
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,760
This must be what it's like

366
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:41,880
to be inseparable.

367
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,680
I just don't know

368
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,960
how long they can stay like this.

369
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,120
Every grievance has a source.

370
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,160
Don't come after me.

371
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,080
Don't come after me.

372
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,240
It wasn't me.

373
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,800
Don't come after me.

374
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,880
It wasn't me.

375
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,880
Don't come after me.

376
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,432
Don't come after me.

377
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,800
Great Chief, when we arrived,

378
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,480
we found him tied up to the eaves.

379
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,920
We waited for you

380
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:54,880
lest we destroy the crime scene.

381
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,080
Great Chief.

382
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:00,240
Chen Shoujie survived.

383
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,440
The guards we sent to protect him
saved him in time.

384
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,840
But it seems that he has been quite shocked.

385
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,560
He's been acting crazy all along.

386
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,760
Now he can't even speak

387
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,120
a complete sentence.

388
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,800
It looks just like the Furong Garden.

389
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,360
Back then, Han Shiyuan and Caiwei

390
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,720
were also tied up and hung midair

391
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,600
with fires burning beneath them.

392
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,720
But it was the cold flame

393
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,680
of the jugglers from the Western Regions.

394
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,960
This looks like

395
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,440
a real attempted murder.

396
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
Who on earth

397
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,520
would want to murder Chen Shoujie

398
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:33,360
in such a cruel way?

399
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,640
Let's go.

400
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,440
How did the Chen Mansion get burned?

401
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,520
How tragic!

402
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,560
Who is that? Why is he hiding?

403
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,000
Jing Lin.

404
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,680
What's going on?

405
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,840
What's going on?

406
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,480
Someone is arrested.

407
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
It's you.

408
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,720
This is Ji Fangming,
who was guarding the Historical Archive.

409
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,760
We need your testimony and signature

410
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,320
regarding the fire.

411
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,960
I saw you guys hurrying here

412
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,400
when I was on my way

413
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,880
to the Shen Mansion.

414
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,040
Someone was burned to death
in the east of the city.

415
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,360
What?

416
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,080
Burned to death? Who was it?

417
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,400
It's one of us.

418
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,920
Officer Sun.

419
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,440
It was him?

420
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,440
Do you know about the Huo'e Sect?

421
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,760
It was Chen Huo'e

422
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,720
who gave him a punishment, you know?

423
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,920
A few days ago,

424
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,760
the fire at the Ministry of Justice

425
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,040
was a punishment

426
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,480
for Mrs. Shen.

427
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,920
- Mrs. Shen?
- She almost got burned to death.

428
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:01,720
Perhaps the White Ghost has done too much evil.

429
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,440
Retribution fell upon his wife.

430
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,200
Hearing wind and rain at night,

431
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,880
sitting still as a bell.

432
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,280
Stuffed from the night snack,

433
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,640
a few drinks are needed.

434
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,480
Did you figure out

435
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,920
where the powder is from?

436
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,720
It's from the Western Regions.

437
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,160
It's very mysterious.

438
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,320
I put in some serious effort

439
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,600
to figure it out.

440
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,720
Want a higher commission?

441
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,360
No way.

442
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,360
You took the trouble to memorize the code

443
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,720
and yet you came empty-handed?

444
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:47,760
In the worst case,

445
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,600
you could have brought me some wine.

446
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:53,000
If you admit that you are the famous

447
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,680
folksy detective Pan Chi,

448
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,000
I may consider

449
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,160
buying you the best

450
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:58,880
osmanthus wine in Xiang'an.

451
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,288
I am.

452
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,800
If I were the detective,

453
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,240
would you pay me more for my work?

454
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,400
You wish.

455
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,040
It sounds pretty good.

456
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,120
Hurry back home.

457
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,720
The Ghost Market is not safe these days.

458
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,800
Great Chief.

459
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,720
You asked me to look into Ji Fangming.

460
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,240
I found that he once
prescribed medicine for himself.

461
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
He's sick?

462
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,520
I didn't know he had studied the herbs.

463
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,600
I followed him

464
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,520
and found that he had health issues,

465
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,840
something chronic.

466
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
Take this prescription to the pharmacy.

467
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:45,040
I'd like to know

468
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,800
what sickness he has.

469
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,080
Are you suspecting him?

470
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,120
That fire in the Historical Archive

471
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,040
was set way too coincidentally.

472
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:07,560
The Great Chief must be busy.

473
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:08,640
I just came to ask

474
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,960
what tea he would like.

475
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,160
Please don't bother.

476
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,080
Miss Yun Que, please go back.

477
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,080
Did you find something

478
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,160
about the Jinxiu Workshop?

479
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,880
Miss, rest assured.

480
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:21,200
The Great Chief will inform you when necessary.

481
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:29,672
I've got something.

482
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
This powder

483
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,720
is from a plant unique to

484
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,880
the Western Regions.

485
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,600
It produces a unique scent once burnt.

486
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,840
Those who smell it

487
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,360
become exceptionally excited

488
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,880
and even hallucinate.

489
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,120
It is said that if someone

490
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,480
implies something

491
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,800
to those who smell it,

492
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,160
it may induce an illusion

493
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:49,680
based on the description.

494
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,000
Is it available in the Ghost Market?

495
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,720
Not really.

496
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,160
It is said that this plant

497
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:58,360
may be common in the Western Regions,

498
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,040
but it's hard to survive

499
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,320
without the specific soil.

500
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,560
Therefore, for this powder

501
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,840
to create a strong hallucination,

502
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,880
one can't store it for too long.

503
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,920
Could it be that

504
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,040
someone has secretly

505
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:11,160
planted it in Xiang'an?

506
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,560
Is the information true?

507
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,480
I learned from my friend Pan Chi

508
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,600
in the Ghost Market.

509
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,200
The tips from him can't be wrong.

510
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,480
Do you know that Ji Fangming is ill?

511
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,640
You count on your connections

512
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,240
while neglecting the clues around you.

513
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,200
Back at Chen Shoujie's Mansion,

514
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,920
the way he showed up and his reactions

515
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,960
were strange.

516
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,080
Others were interested in

517
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,440
what happened in the house.

518
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,800
But he was curious about

519
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,800
our reactions to the incident.

520
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,408
Exactly.

521
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,520
And it occurs to me

522
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:24,640
that I've once smelled

523
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,400
a faint scent on Ji Fangming.

524
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,080
I didn't pay much attention to it.

525
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,200
Now that I think of it,

526
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,440
it was somewhat familiar

527
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,600
but not common.

528
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,280
I've only smelled it in one place.

529
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,720
Mingsheng Temple.

530
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,880
He's been there as well?

531
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,360
I told Chuichui to look into Ji Fangming

532
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,080
and inquire about his background.

533
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,560
He entered the Ministry of Justice

534
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,120
with someone's recommendation.

535
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,320
Guess who that person was.

536
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:58,920
Could it be…

537
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,160
That's right.

538
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,320
It was Chen Shoujie.

539
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,600
Apart from that,

540
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,600
he had a clean record,

541
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:09,840
nothing suspicious.

542
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,360
That makes it all the more suspicious.

543
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,360
There must be some secrets.

544
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,000
Chen Shoujie had kindly

545
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,480
recommended him to take on a job.

546
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,440
But that day at the crime scene,

547
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,880
he pretended not to know him.

548
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,800
Chen Shoujie had made recommendations.

549
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,680
I've looked into them.

550
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,920
Their paths never crossed.

551
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,240
That means

552
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,120
there is some middleman

553
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:40,480
that ties them together

554
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,680
and we haven't found out about it.

555
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,160
It seems

556
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,880
we have to ask them in person.

557
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:04,400
Mr. Ji, here.

558
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,560
Clerk Yan, this is…

559
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,240
Finally, I don't have to read

560
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,360
those random records anymore.

561
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:15,840
So you've found the murderer?

562
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,320
Yes, that's right.

563
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,720
Chen Shoujie

564
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,560
committed all those crimes.

565
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,720
He played dumb and deceived everyone.

566
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,520
In fact, those were his confessions.

567
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,600
What? He confessed?

568
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,960
Yeah.

569
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:31,040
You know my husband.

570
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,880
The famous White Ghost.

571
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,960
In less than a day,

572
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,280
Chen Shoujie confessed to everything.

573
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:41,000
He was playing dumb?

574
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,240
How is that possible?

575
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,920
Why not?

576
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:51,400
He was the one

577
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:52,680
who hid the key evidence

578
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,880
of the case of the Jinxiu Workshop back then.

579
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,320
So many innocent people died.

580
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:57,640
They bought him off

581
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,840
with 1,000 taels of gold.

582
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,640
He buried those in his own courtyard.

583
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,360
It took us several hours to dig them all out.

584
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,040
That was unexpected.

585
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,440
He hid it so well.

586
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:18,200
Yeah.

587
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,160
If it hadn't been for my husband,

588
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:22,200
we might still be kept in the dark.

589
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,920
Is he detained by the Imperial Guards?

590
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:27,720
He's detained in the Ministry of Justice.

591
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:28,920
Tomorrow,

592
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,560
there will be a secret execution.

593
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,480
Secret execution. Why?

594
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,880
That's what they decided.

595
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,800
Perhaps

596
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,480
there is something

597
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,800
behind this case.

598
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,000
If Princess Runing

599
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,760
was put away in the Mingsheng Temple
due to a false accusation,

600
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,320
then the Jinxiu Workshop

601
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:54,840
was merely used

602
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,080
by the culprits to frame her.

603
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:58,440
What?

604
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,880
Are you saying those deceased
of the Jinxiu Workshop…

605
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,600
Please mind your words.

606
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:07,600
Therefore,

607
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,040
we can't investigate more.

608
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,680
It's all my fault.

609
00:33:35,800 --> 00:33:38,200
It's all my fault.

610
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,240
It's all my fault.

611
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,200
Who incited you to set up

612
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:48,760
those people at the Jinxiu Workshop?

613
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:49,840
Still pretending?

614
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,240
You shall perish today.

615
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,480
An imposter?

616
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,080
Those who offend Huo'e

617
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,520
must suffer the punishment.

618
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,920
Ji Fangming.

619
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,440
It's really you.

620
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,400
You told me those things

621
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,840
just to lure me here.

622
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,440
You had many chances to kill Chen Shoujie.

623
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:49,639
But you didn't.

624
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:51,040
So we speculated that

625
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,560
the murderer preferred

626
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,280
to torture him rather than

627
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:56,159
kill him.

628
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,640
The killer wanted him

629
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:59,040
to be sober more than anyone.

630
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
Otherwise, the torture

631
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,840
wouldn't be so satisfying.

632
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,320
Ji Fangming.

633
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,880
We caught you in action.

634
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,160
Do you have anything to say?

635
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,960
I'm not the murderer.

636
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,640
Nor do I know why I've come here.

637
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,360
Perhaps I was bewitched and came here

638
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,680
in a state of confusion.

639
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,320
Great Chief Shen, Mrs. Shen.

640
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,200
You have seen something like this.

641
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,680
I bet you understand.

642
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:27,960
I have absolutely no reason
to kill Chen Shoujie.

643
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,720
It was for the owner of the Jinxiu Workshop,

644
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:31,840
Kong Xianrong, right?

645
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,120
After so many years,

646
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,360
hardly anyone dares

647
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,560
to mention the convicts of that case.

648
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,112
I didn't expect that

649
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,880
someone still remembers his name.

650
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:54,320
You set fire to the Historical Archive

651
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,960
not to kill me.

652
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,000
You intended

653
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,880
to burn the things there.

654
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:00,640
You meant to erase the clues

655
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,800
tying you to

656
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,920
Chen Shoujie and Kong Xianrong,

657
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,880
the owner of the Jinxiu Workshop.

658
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,120
Is that all you've got

659
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,360
to convict me

660
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:11,320
as the culprit, Clerk Yan?

661
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,720
So you admit it.

662
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,160
I met Xianrong at a young age.

663
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:24,160
Fate brought us to meet in a tea house

664
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,840
while taking shelter from the rain.

665
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,040
[Kong Xianrong]

666
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:28,320
Xianrong was articulate

667
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,840
and talented.

668
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,120
We hit it off

669
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,320
right away

670
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,880
and soon became close friends.

671
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,600
After I failed the exam,

672
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:42,800
[Jinxiu Workshop]
he introduced me to Chen Shoujie

673
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,720
who got me a job.

674
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,800
Who would have expected
that injustice would fall upon

675
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,320
the Jinxiu Workshop?

676
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,640
Kong Xianrong was executed
with his entire family.

677
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,640
I just stood in the crowd,

678
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,960
watching them executed,

679
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,920
their blood forming a pond.

680
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,280
Why were you so certain

681
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,520
that Kong Xianrong was wrongly convicted?

682
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,560
Over the years,

683
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,600
I've examined all local gazetteers

684
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,520
and criminal records.

685
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,480
My persistence was rewarded.

686
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,040
Finally, I discovered something.

687
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,000
Xianrong saw Chen Shoujie as his brother.

688
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,000
But Chen Shoujie

689
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,480
betrayed that trust

690
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,800
for his selfish desires.

691
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,000
So you killed his wife

692
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,960
and tried every means to torment him.

693
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,160
She deserved to die.

694
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,920
Chen Shoujie was even worse.

695
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:31,920
Are you responsible

696
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,080
for the death

697
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,160
of Officer Sun?

698
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,720
What does it

699
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,880
have to do with me?

700
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,880
So who told you

701
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,840
to imitate Chen Huo'e as you commit crimes?

702
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,520
The moths flying to the flame.

703
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,440
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

704
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,880
Not entering the cycle of death.

705
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,520
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

706
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,600
Put Ji Fangming in jail.

707
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,640
Await court trial.

708
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,680
I'm avenging those who were wronged.

709
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,680
I did nothing wrong.

710
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,000
I did nothing wrong.

711
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,240
Chen Shoujie deserves to die!

712
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,760
The dishes are not so tasty today?

713
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,480
Why are you so silent?

714
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,560
What a reckless move

715
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,960
to enrage Ji Fangming.

716
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,520
If anything happened--

717
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,480
Anyway, I made him confess.

718
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,120
Indeed.

719
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,160
A simple and rough method

720
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,960
works best in some cases.

721
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,480
Now I'm counting on you,

722
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:01,280
the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

723
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,880
to proceed with the court trial.

724
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:07,680
I'm afraid it's not so simple.

725
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,640
Ji Fangming has been detained.

726
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,920
If we find evidence to convict him,

727
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,960
then we can close the case, right?

728
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,920
If Ji Fangming was the only culprit,

729
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,000
then it's fine

730
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,480
to close the case like this.

731
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,160
But something

732
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:21,880
is not right.

733
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,200
What is it?

734
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,000
The Huo'e Sect is gaining momentum

735
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,440
much faster than we imagined.

736
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,600
While Ji Fangming

737
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,240
was trying to burn Chen Shoujie alive,

738
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,600
someone committed murder

739
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:36,520
in the eastern city without any restraint.

740
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,680
Huo'e Sect.

741
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,200
Don't tell me that

742
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:42,280
the person behind it

743
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:44,920
is really the resurrected Chen Huo'e.

744
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,840
Your cooking

745
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:08,200
hasn't improved at all.

746
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,600
But now that I'm used to it,

747
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:18,200
it's not so unbearable anymore.

748
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,880
It's fine if my cooking doesn't improve

749
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,960
as long as you have the appetite.

750
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,600
The man you arrested was avenging the innocent.

751
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,440
I offered you the evidence

752
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,720
at the risk of my life.

753
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,720
You have to let me watch the interrogation.

754
00:40:56,782 --> 00:40:58,920
[Ministry of Justice]

755
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,640
Ji Fangming.

756
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,240
You killed the wife of Chen Shoujie

757
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,040
and got caught while attempting to

758
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,880
murder Chen Shoujie.

759
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,680
What's the whole story?

760
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:12,200
Do you have any accomplices?

761
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,960
Confess everything.

762
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,040
You surely sound majestic.

763
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:17,880
I've seen too many people

764
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,000
bluffing at the Ministry of Justice.

765
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,440
It doesn't work for me.

766
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,160
Ji Fangming.

767
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,520
At this point, you'd better come clean.

768
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,320
Stop playing tricks.

769
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,920
If you refuse to speak here,

770
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,240
I'll take you somewhere else.

771
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:40,120
I have plenty of methods to make you talk.

772
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,800
Are you trying to force a confession

773
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,320
through torture?

774
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,400
Vice Minister Lai, you're right on time.

775
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:55,240
It's better to be timely than early.

776
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,560
If I didn't come,

777
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,040
how could I observe

778
00:41:58,040 --> 00:42:00,960
your majestic aura?

779
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,320
The Empress Dowager

780
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:04,480
entrusted this case to me.

781
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,280
I have my own judgment.

782
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,160
Just sit in and listen.

783
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,760
Do not cause trouble.

784
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,640
Or you'll be charged

785
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:14,536
with disrupting the court trial.

786
00:42:28,894 --> 00:42:32,712
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

787
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:36,389
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

788
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:41,086

00:42:51,032 --> 00:42:56,006
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

793
00:42:56,006 --> 00:42:58,950
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

796
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:08,390
♫ Your palm lines ♫

797
00:43:08,390 --> 00:43:11,153
♫ Your gaze ♫

798
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:14,214
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

799
00:43:14,214 --> 00:43:18,470
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

♫ You are the one for me ♫

805
00:43:46,896 --> 00:43:50,773
♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

806
00:43:50,773 --> 00:43:54,443
♫ Every moment is treasured ♫

807
00:43:54,443 --> 00:43:59,102
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

808
00:43:59,102 --> 00:44:02,135
♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

809
00:44:02,135 --> 00:44:05,361
♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

810
00:44:05,361 --> 00:44:09,101
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

811
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:14,118
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

812
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:16,998
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

813
00:44:16,998 --> 00:44:21,286
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

814
00:44:21,286 --> 00:44:25,062
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

815
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,632
♫ Your palm lines ♫

816
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:29,382
