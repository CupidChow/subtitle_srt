I knew it would be more interesting like this.

16
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,160
Lai Luozhi.

17
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,320
How dare you

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,120
act so recklessly in court?

19
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,840
As a minister, you're showing

20
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,560
no respect for the laws.

21
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,360
His Majesty is incapable

22
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,720
of ruling the nation.

23
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:58,960
Vice Minister Lai

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,800
serves the court wholeheartedly.

25
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,400
We shall not let him

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,600
suffer injustice.

27
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,040
You ungrateful traitors.

28
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
How dare you treacherous ministers

29
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,160
spout such nonsense?

30
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,720
To be ruled by a woman

31
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,480
is the real calamity of Dacang.

32
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,680
Very well.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,520
You've shown your true colors.

34
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:24,360
I'd like to see

35
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,880
who is

36
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,480
the bane of Dacang.

37
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,432
Guards.

38
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,680
May I give it a try?

39
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,976
Guards.

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,840
Look around.

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,840
These are the Imperial Personal Guards

42
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,840
of Dacang.

43
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,000
I've long heard that

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,920
the Imperial Guards are colluding with

45
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,200
the Imperial Inspectorate.

46
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,240
I didn't expect that

47
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,120
even the Imperial Personal Guards
have sided with Lai Luozhi.

48
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:27,400
Your days in the sickbed

49
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,880
must have taken a toll on you.

50
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,120
Maybe I should

51
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,800
remind you

52
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,000
what to say and what to do.

53
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:56,000
Are you sure you don't have anything

54
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,400
to tell the ministers?

55
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,400
Lai Luozhi.

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,080
How dare you besiege the palace

57
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,680
for usurpation?

58
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,320
The mandate of heaven shall be

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,400
entrusted to the one chosen by the people.

60
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,560
Lai Luozhi, how dare you?

61
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,240
That's unexpected.

62
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,200
You actually choose

63
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,440
to fight to the death.

64
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,640
What a pity.

65
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,360
It doesn't have to be like this.

66
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:21,160
At this point,

67
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,720
I bet you know

68
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,760
how to write

69
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,480
the edict of abdication, right?

70
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,480
This is ridiculous! How are you qualified

71
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,000
to inherit the throne?

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,760
What if I am qualified?

73
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,720
Then, you shall ascend the throne

74
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,680
as appointed by Heaven.

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,600
Your wild ambition is insatiable.

76
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,680
It calls for punishment.

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,920
Clamorous.

78
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:46,160
Drag these pedants out

79
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,560
and cut off their tongues.

80
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:55,280
Shen Du, what are you waiting for?

81
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,000
You're not qualified

82
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,920
to claim the throne.

83
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,448
Royal Guards.

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,960
I, Shen Du,

85
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,760
have purged the traitors

86
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,440
among the Royal Guards.

87
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,880
We're here to arrest the rebels

88
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,360
and protect Their Majesties.

89
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,040
Don't you want to avenge

90
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,760
those dozens

91
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,280
of your family members who died from injustice?

92
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,560
Think about your father Shen Bingzhu.

93
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,160
Don't you want to vindicate him?

94
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,880
I will find out the truth myself

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,960
and bring justice to my family.

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,200
Want me to join you?

97
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,488
You don't deserve it.

98
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,640
So,

99
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,680
according to your speculation,

100
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,840
the Huo'e Sect

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,520
has gained momentum over the years

102
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,640
due to the support of someone in the court,

103
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:02,200
and this person is very likely Lai Luozhi.

104
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:03,200
There's no solid evidence,

105
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,720
but various signs indicate

106
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,560
that he has everything to do with this.

107
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,880
The Huo'e Sect coveted control over the court

108
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,240
and sought to incite discord
within the royal family

109
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
with dirt on Princess Yong'an and others.

110
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,120
It is evident that

111
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,560
the mastermind is elusive

112
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,800
and plotting something huge.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,880
They even dared to get their hands
on the cinnabar controlled by

114
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,520
the imperial court.

115
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,520
I am certain that your speculation

116
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,320
is most probably the truth.

117
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,600
What is your plan?

118
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,072
Our enemies lurk in the dark.

119
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,320
We'd better play along

120
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,600
and lure them into the trap.

121
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,880
Lure them into the trap?

122
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,040
Alright.

123
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,200
I'd like to see

124
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,000
how your tactic

125
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,640
will work.

126
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,920
Empress Dowager.

127
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,920
This is the medicine

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,240
Shen Du discovered

129
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,640
from the Jinwu Tribe.

130
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,400
He sent it here secretly.

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,000
It is said to be the remedy

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,920
that can cure you in half a month.

133
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:59,480
What a smart double agent.

134
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,440
You feigned allegiance

135
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,480
and put yourself

136
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,480
and those around you at risk.

137
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,720
It wasn't my trick

138
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,800
but your arrogance

139
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:12,080
that led you into this trap.

140
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,960
Say no more.

141
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:17,160
It's not certain who will win yet.

142
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,320
The Huo'e rises,

143
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,560
revealing the masses.

144
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,840
They are not real envoys.

145
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,880
I have never fully trusted you, either.

146
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:34,000
The captains of the Six Garrisons

147
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
have pledged loyalty to me.

148
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,840
Just now,

149
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,680
they've besieged the palace.

150
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,680
Do you think you stand a chance?

151
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,440
The tide has turned.

152
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,800
You're regretting it.

153
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,520
But it's too late.

154
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,880
Shen Du.

155
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,960
You could have been

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:50,360
the founding minister to my kingdom.

157
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,520
What a pity.

158
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:56,360
Kill them all.

159
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,400
Now.

160
00:08:44,911 --> 00:08:47,151
It's going to be fine.

161
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:49,791
I will protect you.

162
00:08:50,671 --> 00:08:52,511
You will surely

163
00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:55,351
ascend the throne.

164
00:08:55,351 --> 00:08:57,791
You surely will.

165
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,471
I won't let you die in vain.

166
00:10:48,951 --> 00:10:51,031
General Zhenyuan, you reacted swiftly

167
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,111
and took out the rebels.

168
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,471
You're truly the leading general

169
00:10:53,471 --> 00:10:56,311
guarding the border of Dacang.

170
00:11:11,191 --> 00:11:12,431
<i>Prince Xian.</i>

171
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:15,271
<i>The Six Garrisons have sided with Lai Luozhi.</i>

172
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,671
<i>The troops within the city</i>

173
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,191
<i>are no match for them.</i>

174
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:20,031
<i>Now all the counties are under the watch</i>

175
00:11:20,031 --> 00:11:21,271
<i>of the Huo'e Sect.</i>

176
00:11:21,271 --> 00:11:23,351
<i>Only one person can turn the tide.</i>

177
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:24,711
<i>To not alert the enemies,</i>

178
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:27,071
<i>please lend us your helping hand</i>

179
00:11:27,071 --> 00:11:28,671
<i>to lift the siege of Xiang'an</i>

180
00:11:28,671 --> 00:11:30,151
<i>and pacify the turmoil.</i>

181
00:11:30,151 --> 00:11:32,031
Thankfully, you sent me a confidential letter

182
00:11:32,031 --> 00:11:33,311
conveying the decree.

183
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:34,711
I didn't expect that someone

184
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,471
would dare to collude with the enemies

185
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,111
to create chaos at the borders

186
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,831
to keep me there.

187
00:11:39,831 --> 00:11:41,471
<i>[General Zhenyuan]</i>
He wouldn't have expected that

188
00:11:41,471 --> 00:11:42,911
a squad of elite warriors

189
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:45,271
had already set out for Xiang'an.

190
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:47,431
Lai Luozhi bewitched the people.

191
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:48,951
But he didn't realize that

192
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:49,951
those were

193
00:11:49,951 --> 00:11:52,191
my close kin in the palace.

194
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,631
His Majesty is my nephew.

195
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,071
As a civilian of Dacang,

196
00:11:56,071 --> 00:11:57,431
I must stand by Dacang

197
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:00,191
and its people at the moment.

198
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,551
The Huo'e Sect has numerous disciples.

199
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:04,911
The various branches

200
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:06,111
of Huo'e Sect in Dacang

201
00:12:06,111 --> 00:12:08,231
will join me in rising against you.

202
00:12:08,231 --> 00:12:10,031
What are you going to do?

203
00:12:10,031 --> 00:12:11,951
Do you want all the people in Xiang'an

204
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:13,751
to be buried with you?

205
00:12:13,751 --> 00:12:17,231
Great Chief, the rebels out there
have been annihilated.

206
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,511
Lai Luozhi.

207
00:12:37,511 --> 00:12:39,151
It's time to surrender.

208
00:12:39,151 --> 00:12:40,591
Just now,

209
00:12:40,591 --> 00:12:41,991
the Huo'e Sect branches you deployed

210
00:12:41,991 --> 00:12:44,231
have all been eradicated.

211
00:12:45,511 --> 00:12:48,271
Your momentum

212
00:12:48,271 --> 00:12:50,271
is lost.

213
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,511
<i>During the grand assembly,</i>

214
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:54,111
<i>Lai Luozhi will deploy his troops
around the palace.</i>

215
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,151
<i>Jiang Langxing informed</i>

216
00:12:55,151 --> 00:12:56,911
<i>the inspectors in different areas.</i>

217
00:12:56,911 --> 00:12:58,671
<i>The inspectors will uproot</i>

218
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,991
<i>the Huo'e Sect strongholds.</i>

219
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:15,631
All inspectors, listen up.

220
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:16,831
Destroy all the strongholds

221
00:13:16,831 --> 00:13:17,831
of the Huo'e Sect.

222
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,471
Arrest all the cultists.

223
00:13:19,471 --> 00:13:20,471
Don't let anyone run away.

224
00:13:20,471 --> 00:13:22,632
Understood.

225
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:40,031
<i>Liang.</i>

226
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,191
<i>If you produce the new crossbows you designed</i>

227
00:13:42,191 --> 00:13:43,271
<i>which fires</i>

228
00:13:43,271 --> 00:13:44,791
<i>multiple arrows at once,</i>

229
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,951
<i>then our troops can fight
ten times the enemies.</i>

230
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:49,071
<i>Then, with just a squad of elites,</i>

231
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,671
<i>we may triumph over the many.</i>

232
00:13:51,671 --> 00:13:53,671
What marvelous weapons you make.

233
00:13:53,671 --> 00:13:54,671
You have contributed greatly

234
00:13:54,671 --> 00:13:56,431
to the pacification.

235
00:13:56,431 --> 00:13:57,991
All thanks to Mr. Shen's support

236
00:13:57,991 --> 00:13:59,991
and encouragement.

237
00:14:28,431 --> 00:14:31,111
You petty ants

238
00:14:31,111 --> 00:14:32,911
and hypocrites.

239
00:14:32,911 --> 00:14:35,231
You let the Empress Dowager rule the nation.

240
00:14:35,231 --> 00:14:37,391
Deluded and incompetent.

241
00:14:37,391 --> 00:14:38,871
Who is leading Dacang

242
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:40,671
to a downslope?

243
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,791
It's her.

244
00:14:41,791 --> 00:14:43,151
Zhou Xu!

245
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:44,911
Lai Luozhi.

246
00:14:44,911 --> 00:14:46,991
You established Huo'e Sect,
bewitched the people,

247
00:14:46,991 --> 00:14:48,311
and persecuted loyal ministers.

248
00:14:48,311 --> 00:14:51,071
You have hurt so many people.

249
00:14:51,071 --> 00:14:53,951
And you're pointing the finger at someone else?

250
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,791
My Huo'e Sect thrived

251
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:57,631
throughout Dacang

252
00:14:57,631 --> 00:14:59,751
because I created a beautiful dream

253
00:14:59,751 --> 00:15:03,591
where the dead could be brought back to life.

254
00:15:03,591 --> 00:15:05,831
Who can escape

255
00:15:05,831 --> 00:15:09,871
a life consisting of
birth, aging, sickness, and death?

256
00:15:09,871 --> 00:15:12,431
Who can avoid

257
00:15:13,231 --> 00:15:17,071
the pain of losing loved ones?

258
00:15:17,071 --> 00:15:18,991
Let alone the common people,

259
00:15:18,991 --> 00:15:21,391
even the high officials had no choice.

260
00:15:21,391 --> 00:15:24,271
Didn't Mo Qianzhi also yield to me

261
00:15:24,271 --> 00:15:27,191
and act based on my instructions?

262
00:15:28,271 --> 00:15:30,231
Despicable creature.

263
00:15:30,231 --> 00:15:32,871
I just hate people like you,

264
00:15:32,871 --> 00:15:35,631
who uphold so-called righteousness

265
00:15:35,631 --> 00:15:37,151
and morality.

266
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:38,311
How could I work with

267
00:15:38,311 --> 00:15:39,671
a rebel like you?

268
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:41,351
If my father were alive,

269
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:43,751
he wouldn't allow it, either.

270
00:15:44,951 --> 00:15:47,511
I am first a civilian of Dacang

271
00:15:47,511 --> 00:15:50,071
and then a member of the Shen family.

272
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:56,831
Your father was also a fool.

273
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,471
I only seek to have a clear conscience

274
00:15:58,471 --> 00:16:00,791
and not let the people down.

275
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,511
How can I collude

276
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:05,151
with you?

277
00:16:05,151 --> 00:16:07,471
He thought he upheld integrity,

278
00:16:07,471 --> 00:16:10,791
unaware that he had made many enemies.

279
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,031
Many people wished to

280
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,711
put him to death.

281
00:16:13,711 --> 00:16:14,751
You are

282
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,111
as stupid as your father.

283
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:20,111
With nothing but some petty tricks,

284
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:21,111
I managed to bring down

285
00:16:21,111 --> 00:16:22,631
your entire family.

286
00:16:22,631 --> 00:16:24,351
You're sinister enough to persecute

287
00:16:24,351 --> 00:16:25,471
the loyal ministers.

288
00:16:25,471 --> 00:16:26,911
Even Heaven's law

289
00:16:26,911 --> 00:16:28,351
wouldn't grant you power.

290
00:16:28,351 --> 00:16:30,551
Heaven's law?

291
00:16:30,551 --> 00:16:32,591
Then let me ask you.

292
00:16:33,231 --> 00:16:37,391
Who convicted your father?

293
00:16:37,391 --> 00:16:39,151
Who was responsible

294
00:16:39,151 --> 00:16:42,151
for the misery of your family?

295
00:16:49,111 --> 00:16:50,711
Zhou Xu.

296
00:16:50,711 --> 00:16:52,270
You hold the young mute emperor as hostage

297
00:16:52,270 --> 00:16:53,791
to dominate the court.

298
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,911
Have you ever woken up in the deep night,

299
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,671
feeling guilty toward the late emperor,

300
00:16:57,671 --> 00:16:59,871
who was my father?

301
00:17:02,071 --> 00:17:04,631
I am the chosen one

302
00:17:04,631 --> 00:17:07,191
with the supreme bloodline.

303
00:17:07,191 --> 00:17:08,230
Today,

304
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:09,990
I shall restore order to Dacang

305
00:17:09,990 --> 00:17:11,951
and reclaim my power.

306
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:13,351
<i>The late emperor?</i>

307
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,391
<i>Could he be…?</i>

308
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,631
I am the son of the late emperor

309
00:17:19,631 --> 00:17:22,071
and Ms. Shu.

310
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:28,351
The phoenix leads nine chicks.

311
00:17:28,351 --> 00:17:30,951
The world is at peace.

312
00:17:30,951 --> 00:17:33,351
Clarify the source.

313
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,831
Re-establish the order.

314
00:17:37,271 --> 00:17:39,311
Clarify the source.

315
00:17:39,311 --> 00:17:41,671
Re-establish the order.

316
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,471
Could it be that

317
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,151
the Imperial Preceptor's prophecy

318
00:17:47,151 --> 00:17:49,391
really had a second half?

319
00:17:50,551 --> 00:17:52,591
That is not true.

320
00:17:56,031 --> 00:17:57,631
I'm the Chief Director Yan Xing
of the Ministry of Justice.

321
00:17:57,631 --> 00:17:58,871
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

322
00:17:58,871 --> 00:18:01,391
I pay my respect, Empress Dowager.

323
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:04,751
Please rise.

324
00:18:07,551 --> 00:18:09,191
Empress Dowager.

325
00:18:09,191 --> 00:18:12,311
There was a second half to the prophecy

326
00:18:12,311 --> 00:18:14,231
that wasn't handed in.

327
00:18:14,231 --> 00:18:16,631
But it was not what Lai Luozhi just said.

328
00:18:16,631 --> 00:18:18,351
Do you have evidence?

329
00:18:18,351 --> 00:18:19,871
The true prophecy

330
00:18:19,871 --> 00:18:22,631
is hidden in this baby's clothes.

331
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,511
Azure sky at sunset.

332
00:18:33,511 --> 00:18:36,031
Brings upon misfortune.

333
00:18:37,191 --> 00:18:38,471
That's right.

334
00:18:38,471 --> 00:18:40,591
The Imperial Preceptor made a prophecy.

335
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:41,911
The latter half

336
00:18:41,911 --> 00:18:44,831
referred to someone
with wild ambitions in the court

337
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:46,631
so that you would stay alert

338
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:48,351
of those around you.

339
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:49,631
Lai Luozhi managed

340
00:18:49,631 --> 00:18:51,111
the Huo'e Sect for years.

341
00:18:51,111 --> 00:18:53,511
The cultists were committing crimes.

342
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,151
The Imperial Preceptor noticed it

343
00:18:55,151 --> 00:18:56,951
and had doubts about Lai Luozhi's

344
00:18:56,951 --> 00:18:59,151
real identity.

345
00:18:59,151 --> 00:19:00,831
But without evidence,

346
00:19:00,831 --> 00:19:02,831
he had to convey his suspicions

347
00:19:02,831 --> 00:19:05,711
to the world through the prophecy.

348
00:19:10,951 --> 00:19:12,911
<i>[Azure sky at sunset. Brings upon misfortune.]</i>
He probably realized

349
00:19:12,911 --> 00:19:15,271
that Lai Luozhi was watching him.

350
00:19:15,271 --> 00:19:17,751
He had to embroider the prophecy
within the patterns

351
00:19:17,751 --> 00:19:19,751
on the brocade

352
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,031
to send it away

353
00:19:21,031 --> 00:19:22,591
when he had a chance.

354
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,631
However,

355
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:25,511
Lai Luozhi sent assassins

356
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:28,111
to silence him first.

357
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:34,951
Heaven's vengeance is slow but sure.

358
00:19:34,951 --> 00:19:36,831
Yuanniang who couldn't read

359
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,271
found the brocade

360
00:19:38,271 --> 00:19:40,151
with the latter half of the prophecy

361
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:42,351
and made it into the lining
of a baby's clothes.

362
00:19:42,351 --> 00:19:45,005
And thus it remained.

363
00:19:45,005 --> 00:19:50,804
<i>[Triangle Sewing]</i>

364
00:19:51,631 --> 00:19:55,391
If Yuanniang were just an ordinary woman,

365
00:19:55,391 --> 00:19:58,551
how could she afford such fabric?

366
00:19:58,551 --> 00:20:00,711
The fabric on the inside

367
00:20:00,711 --> 00:20:02,071
wasn't something accessible

368
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,351
to an ordinary person.

369
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:08,311
The Imperial Preceptor

370
00:20:08,311 --> 00:20:10,071
was pedantic and obstinate.

371
00:20:10,071 --> 00:20:11,191
Should I give up Dacang

372
00:20:11,191 --> 00:20:13,471
to a stupid child,

373
00:20:13,471 --> 00:20:15,991
or that inept Prince Xian,

374
00:20:15,991 --> 00:20:18,791
or that bossy Princess Yong'an?

375
00:20:18,791 --> 00:20:19,991
As long as the Empress Dowager

376
00:20:19,991 --> 00:20:21,071
is still in court,

377
00:20:21,071 --> 00:20:23,751
no one can be at ease.

378
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,551
Once upon a time,

379
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:28,911
Princess Runing

380
00:20:28,911 --> 00:20:31,711
was honored and distinguished.

381
00:20:31,711 --> 00:20:33,711
But someone changed

382
00:20:33,711 --> 00:20:36,751
the pattern of her clothes,

383
00:20:36,751 --> 00:20:39,911
and she was accused of treason

384
00:20:40,511 --> 00:20:43,471
and ended up as she is now.

385
00:20:45,431 --> 00:20:48,751
So Princess Runing

386
00:20:48,751 --> 00:20:52,151
was also framed by you?

387
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:54,111
How could I have succeeded so easily

388
00:20:54,111 --> 00:20:56,391
had you not been paranoid?

389
00:20:56,391 --> 00:20:58,231
It's all your fault.

390
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:02,511
You are the greatest threat to my clan.

391
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:04,311
As a descendant of the Xiao family,

392
00:21:04,311 --> 00:21:07,991
I shall right the wrongs for Dacang.

393
00:21:07,991 --> 00:21:09,631
The throne

394
00:21:09,631 --> 00:21:11,471
is rightfully mine.

395
00:21:11,471 --> 00:21:14,351
I am the rightful heir to the throne.

396
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:16,831
But you are not the son of the late emperor.

397
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:19,271
You are the son of Ms. Shu

398
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,951
and her lover.

399
00:21:32,831 --> 00:21:34,031
Ms. Shu used to be

400
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:36,271
the carefree Princess Bi Luo of Nanlang.

401
00:21:36,271 --> 00:21:37,831
She was in love and engaged with

402
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:39,271
General Kongshan in secret.

403
00:21:39,271 --> 00:21:41,111
It could have been a beautiful story.

404
00:21:41,111 --> 00:21:42,471
Yet her father, King of Nanlang,

405
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:44,551
forced her to marry the late emperor

406
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,631
of Dacang.

407
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,791
Princess Bi Luo wouldn't comply.

408
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:49,951
In a rage, the King of Nanlang

409
00:21:49,951 --> 00:21:51,391
killed General Kongshan

410
00:21:51,391 --> 00:21:54,271
and threatened to kill his entire clan.

411
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,191
Bi Luo had no choice but to bribe the eunuch

412
00:21:56,191 --> 00:21:58,111
to avoid the inspection

413
00:21:58,111 --> 00:21:59,351
and became who we knew

414
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,671
as Ms. Shu.

415
00:22:00,671 --> 00:22:04,031
Thus, she lost her love

416
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:06,191
and her name.

417
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,871
She stayed alive for the sake of

418
00:22:07,871 --> 00:22:09,831
General Kongshan's clan,

419
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:11,151
and because she was pregnant

420
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:14,391
with General Kongshan's child.

421
00:22:25,071 --> 00:22:27,671
It can't be true.

422
00:22:27,671 --> 00:22:29,271
No way.

423
00:22:29,271 --> 00:22:31,591
My mother wouldn't lie to me.

424
00:22:31,591 --> 00:22:33,671
I am a descendant of the Xiao family,

425
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:36,351
a son of the late emperor of Dacang.

426
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:37,631
Back then,

427
00:22:37,631 --> 00:22:38,751
one of those who

428
00:22:38,751 --> 00:22:40,391
escorted Princess Bi Luo to Dacang

429
00:22:40,391 --> 00:22:42,471
noticed that she was unwell

430
00:22:42,471 --> 00:22:43,791
and discovered the truth.

431
00:22:43,791 --> 00:22:45,671
That person was attacked by assassins

432
00:22:45,671 --> 00:22:48,391
but made it out alive.

433
00:22:48,391 --> 00:22:49,631
Lai Luozhi.

434
00:22:49,631 --> 00:22:52,551
You are not a descendant of the Xiao family.

435
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,351
Lai Luozhi.

436
00:23:00,351 --> 00:23:05,151
Your life is a complete lie.

437
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,711
No way.

438
00:23:20,711 --> 00:23:22,431
My mother wouldn't lie to me.

439
00:23:22,431 --> 00:23:24,551
My mother wouldn't lie to me.

440
00:23:24,551 --> 00:23:26,151
You petty people

441
00:23:26,151 --> 00:23:28,071
are Zhou Xu's lackeys.

442
00:23:28,071 --> 00:23:29,151
You fabricate lies

443
00:23:29,151 --> 00:23:30,231
to deceive everyone,

444
00:23:30,231 --> 00:23:32,551
just to prevent me from ascending the throne

445
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:34,871
and rectifying the mistake.

446
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:53,551
The moths flying to the flame,

447
00:23:53,551 --> 00:23:55,951
born at dawn,

448
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:58,991
dead by dusk.

449
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:41,800
It turns out

450
00:24:42,551 --> 00:24:45,751
that the moth flying to the flame

451
00:24:47,551 --> 00:24:53,071
is nothing but a splendid dream.

452
00:25:10,751 --> 00:25:13,192
- Open the door.
- Understood.

453
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:16,191
Greetings, Mr. Jing.

454
00:25:16,191 --> 00:25:19,191
Lai Luozhi was arrested.
The Great Chief asked me to send you home.

455
00:25:19,191 --> 00:25:20,351
You have suffered.

456
00:25:20,351 --> 00:25:21,591
Please forgive us

457
00:25:21,591 --> 00:25:23,351
for our negligence.

458
00:25:23,351 --> 00:25:24,671
That's great.

459
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:26,271
Mr. Jing, you're being too polite.

460
00:25:26,271 --> 00:25:27,351
The Great Chief

461
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:28,631
locked us up

462
00:25:28,631 --> 00:25:29,751
to protect us

463
00:25:29,751 --> 00:25:31,431
from Lai Luozhi's persecution.

464
00:25:31,431 --> 00:25:33,591
How could we not understand that?

465
00:25:33,591 --> 00:25:36,391
That's right.

466
00:25:39,311 --> 00:25:40,471
Shen Du.

467
00:25:40,471 --> 00:25:42,191
You need to understand.

468
00:25:42,191 --> 00:25:43,751
An arrow shot from a bow

469
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:46,271
can't be taken back.

470
00:25:46,271 --> 00:25:47,991
I've thought it through.

471
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:51,151
Please inform the Empress Dowager.

472
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:20,351
Come back another day, Director Yan.

473
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:23,071
The Empress Dowager is going to summon me.

474
00:26:23,071 --> 00:26:25,751
She won't have time for you.

475
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,151
Lai Luozhi and his people

476
00:26:27,151 --> 00:26:29,551
have been convicted.

477
00:26:29,551 --> 00:26:31,751
Why are you here to see

478
00:26:31,751 --> 00:26:34,151
the Empress Dowager?

479
00:26:35,791 --> 00:26:37,351
I have made a great contribution

480
00:26:37,351 --> 00:26:39,071
to the pacification this time.

481
00:26:39,071 --> 00:26:42,071
Do I need to tell a Sixth-Tier official

482
00:26:42,071 --> 00:26:45,111
about what reward I'm going to ask for?

483
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,111
Then I must see Her Majesty

484
00:26:48,111 --> 00:26:49,631
together with you.

485
00:26:49,631 --> 00:26:51,271
The merit shouldn't be yours alone.

486
00:26:51,271 --> 00:26:52,791
I also made an effort.

487
00:26:52,791 --> 00:26:56,471
You can't keep the reward all to yourself.

488
00:26:56,471 --> 00:26:57,911
If you want a reward,

489
00:26:57,911 --> 00:26:58,951
have your supervisor

490
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,391
hand in a memorial.

491
00:27:00,391 --> 00:27:03,351
Director Yan, go back.

492
00:27:04,431 --> 00:27:06,871
Who brings a gift

493
00:27:06,871 --> 00:27:09,471
to ask for rewards?

494
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:13,791
I bet it's the evidence

495
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:17,311
that can disturb the court in this box.

496
00:27:17,311 --> 00:27:19,191
You came for the Shen family--

497
00:27:19,191 --> 00:27:21,631
Director Yan.

498
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:24,392
Speak cautiously.

499
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:27,231
Now that we are divorced,

500
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,991
you have no ties with the Shen family.

501
00:27:28,991 --> 00:27:31,991
So stay out of my family business.

502
00:27:37,711 --> 00:27:40,831
Fine.

503
00:27:40,831 --> 00:27:42,951
Even if I am not a member of the Shen family,

504
00:27:42,951 --> 00:27:45,431
I will see to the end of this matter.

505
00:27:45,431 --> 00:27:47,271
I'm not standing here

506
00:27:47,271 --> 00:27:50,191
as your wife

507
00:27:50,191 --> 00:27:52,991
but as the Chief Director
of the Ministry of Justice.

508
00:27:52,991 --> 00:27:54,271
It's my pursuit

509
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,711
to reinvestigate the wrongful cases

510
00:27:55,711 --> 00:27:58,471
and bring justice to the innocent.

511
00:28:03,031 --> 00:28:04,311
Great Chief Shen.

512
00:28:04,311 --> 00:28:07,271
The Empress Dowager summoned you.

513
00:28:09,151 --> 00:28:10,551
As an official, you should

514
00:28:10,551 --> 00:28:11,991
know very well that

515
00:28:11,991 --> 00:28:13,071
the Empress Dowager

516
00:28:13,071 --> 00:28:14,191
only summoned me,

517
00:28:14,191 --> 00:28:17,111
so you shouldn't come uninvited.

518
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,391
Are you breaking into the hall?

519
00:28:21,271 --> 00:28:23,431
If you go in there alone,

520
00:28:23,431 --> 00:28:25,991
I won't see you again.

521
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:05,751
His Majesty caught a mild cold.

522
00:29:05,751 --> 00:29:07,751
He will rest for a day

523
00:29:07,751 --> 00:29:09,911
and attend the court meeting tomorrow.

524
00:29:09,911 --> 00:29:12,151
My ministers.

525
00:29:12,151 --> 00:29:15,111
Do you have any reports to make?

526
00:29:20,031 --> 00:29:22,111
Qiao Wenzhi.

527
00:29:22,111 --> 00:29:24,311
You're temporarily in charge of Gannandao.

528
00:29:24,311 --> 00:29:25,671
Do you have

529
00:29:25,671 --> 00:29:28,271
matters to report today?

530
00:29:28,271 --> 00:29:30,431
Empress Dowager,

531
00:29:30,431 --> 00:29:32,511
ever since Lai Luozhi was convicted,

532
00:29:32,511 --> 00:29:35,471
all has been well and prosperous in Dacang.

533
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:37,911
Gannandao has been thriving.

534
00:29:37,911 --> 00:29:39,831
The world is at peace.

535
00:29:39,831 --> 00:29:42,311
There is nothing to report.

536
00:29:42,311 --> 00:29:44,951
"The world is at peace"?

537
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:47,991
Lai Luozhi has been brought to justice.

538
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:50,791
But the brochure he left behind

539
00:29:50,791 --> 00:29:53,151
was very useful.

540
00:29:54,271 --> 00:29:55,751
Qiao Wenzhi.

541
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:58,831
You illegally imported goods from Xichen

542
00:29:58,831 --> 00:30:04,111
through Gannandao
to sell them in Dacang for profit.

543
00:30:05,351 --> 00:30:07,431
Empress Dowager, I have been wronged.

544
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:08,791
The so-called evidence

545
00:30:08,791 --> 00:30:10,351
left behind by those rebels

546
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:11,391
in Gannandao

547
00:30:11,391 --> 00:30:12,431
is absolutely invalid.

548
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:14,631
Absolutely invalid?

549
00:30:20,751 --> 00:30:22,031
Then

550
00:30:22,031 --> 00:30:23,991
what do you say about

551
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,311
the fabricated ledger?

552
00:30:27,311 --> 00:30:30,871
It wasn't submitted by Lai Luozhi's people.

553
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,191
The forged ledger

554
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:35,631
documented twice the real cost

555
00:30:35,631 --> 00:30:38,591
of the reconstruction of Ming Hall.

556
00:30:39,911 --> 00:30:41,031
But all the ministries

557
00:30:41,031 --> 00:30:43,391
were involved in this. I'm not the only one--

558
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:46,471
Qiao Wenzhi.

559
00:30:46,471 --> 00:30:49,751
Don't talk nonsense.

560
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:55,111
Empress Dowager.

561
00:30:55,111 --> 00:30:56,551
Qiao Wenzhi

562
00:30:56,551 --> 00:30:58,591
is my subordinate.

563
00:30:58,591 --> 00:31:00,151
He embezzled the money

564
00:31:00,151 --> 00:31:01,871
from the court out of greed,

565
00:31:01,871 --> 00:31:03,751
which is a serious crime.

566
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:07,311
I was negligent.

567
00:31:07,311 --> 00:31:10,151
I deserve any punishment.

568
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:12,911
Negligent?

569
00:31:12,911 --> 00:31:15,391
Prime Minister Zhang
truly has a wealth of knowledge.

570
00:31:15,391 --> 00:31:17,351
What an exquisite choice of words.

571
00:31:17,351 --> 00:31:19,431
But Qiao Wenzhi

572
00:31:19,431 --> 00:31:21,951
is indeed loyal to you.

573
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:23,511
I bet most of

574
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:25,391
the embezzlement ended up

575
00:31:25,391 --> 00:31:28,191
in your pocket, Zhang Xingwei.

576
00:31:29,671 --> 00:31:31,111
Zhang Xingwei.

577
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:33,831
What else do you have to say?

578
00:31:35,871 --> 00:31:39,791
I have nothing to say.

579
00:31:39,791 --> 00:31:42,344
Prince Xian.

580
00:31:42,991 --> 00:31:44,391
Mother Empress.

581
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:46,511
Let me ask you.

582
00:31:46,511 --> 00:31:49,591
How should we deal with him?

583
00:31:49,591 --> 00:31:50,991
Mother Empress, I believe

584
00:31:50,991 --> 00:31:52,311
you have your opinion.

585
00:31:52,311 --> 00:31:54,471
I have my opinion.

586
00:31:54,471 --> 00:31:56,991
But now I am asking

587
00:31:56,991 --> 00:31:59,431
for your opinion.

588
00:32:00,071 --> 00:32:02,231
Prime Minister Zhang
has been my mentor since I was young.

589
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:04,031
He has always led by example

590
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:07,111
and taught me to prioritize the nation.

591
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:08,151
I don't believe that

592
00:32:08,151 --> 00:32:09,311
he would commit such a crime

593
00:32:09,311 --> 00:32:11,311
just for money.

594
00:32:11,311 --> 00:32:15,271
There must be something behind this.

595
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:19,671
Prince Xian.

596
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,471
How foolish!

597
00:32:21,471 --> 00:32:24,511
I have deceived you for years,

598
00:32:24,511 --> 00:32:26,311
acting like a decent minister.

599
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:29,751
Yet you still plead for me.

600
00:32:33,791 --> 00:32:35,271
Very well.

601
00:32:35,271 --> 00:32:37,831
What a touching bond
between the mentor and the disciple.

602
00:32:37,831 --> 00:32:39,111
Prime Minister Zhang.

603
00:32:39,111 --> 00:32:41,751
Let me speak on your behalf.

604
00:32:41,751 --> 00:32:43,671
You didn't spend

605
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:45,671
a single dime on yourself.

606
00:32:45,671 --> 00:32:47,191
You bribed others

607
00:32:47,191 --> 00:32:48,631
in the court

608
00:32:48,631 --> 00:32:49,871
so that

609
00:32:49,871 --> 00:32:53,671
they supported Prince Xian with you.

610
00:33:04,671 --> 00:33:07,191
Empress Dowager.

611
00:33:07,191 --> 00:33:08,831
At this point,

612
00:33:08,831 --> 00:33:13,751
I will no longer conceal the truth.

613
00:33:13,751 --> 00:33:15,831
Prince Xian

614
00:33:15,831 --> 00:33:17,871
knows absolutely nothing

615
00:33:17,871 --> 00:33:20,791
about all this.

616
00:33:21,991 --> 00:33:24,591
It was all my doing alone.

617
00:33:24,591 --> 00:33:27,711
Please sentence me to death

618
00:33:27,711 --> 00:33:29,431
as a warning to others.

619
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:31,311
Do you think your sins will be erased

620
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:34,631
as long as you sacrifice yourself?

621
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:39,671
Those loyal officials
who died wrongfully accused

622
00:33:39,671 --> 00:33:42,551
because of you

623
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:47,671
could never be brought back to life.

624
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,830
Minister Shen.

625
00:33:54,830 --> 00:33:56,911
Bring it up.

626
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:08,631
By heavenly decree,

627
00:34:08,631 --> 00:34:10,310
here comes the edict.

628
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,350
The criminal, Shen Bingzhu,

629
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:15,031
secretly corresponded with the enemy,

630
00:34:15,031 --> 00:34:17,631
burned down our army's granary,

631
00:34:17,631 --> 00:34:20,350
leaked the weapon designs,

632
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,191
colluded with foreign forces,

633
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:24,231
and conspired with the rebel army.

634
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:26,551
He shall be sentenced to death.

635
00:34:26,551 --> 00:34:29,711
The entire Shen family
shall be detained and exiled.

636
00:34:29,711 --> 00:34:34,111
Convey the edict widely.

637
00:34:34,111 --> 00:34:37,551
<i>I do not seek to be renowned.</i>

638
00:34:37,551 --> 00:34:39,790
<i>I only seek to have a clear conscience</i>

639
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,071
<i>and not let the people down.</i>

640
00:34:42,071 --> 00:34:44,431
<i>Shen Bingzhu was indifferent
to wealth and fame,</i>

641
00:34:44,431 --> 00:34:46,351
<i>never wanting to get involved
in court disputes.</i>

642
00:34:46,351 --> 00:34:48,111
<i>All he cared about was the people.</i>

643
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:50,071
<i>No matter what happened,</i>

644
00:34:50,071 --> 00:34:51,911
<i>he only did what he should do,</i>

645
00:34:51,911 --> 00:34:53,751
<i>as long as the people lived well.</i>

646
00:34:53,751 --> 00:34:55,791
<i>I receive my wage from His Majesty.</i>

647
00:34:55,791 --> 00:34:58,151
<i>Naturally, I shall share his burden</i>

648
00:34:58,151 --> 00:35:00,511
<i>even at the cost of my life.</i>

649
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:06,831
<i>♫ Through storms and uncertainties,
I devote myself to you ♫</i>

650
00:35:06,831 --> 00:35:09,991
I, Shen Du, am here

651
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:12,551
to seek justice for my father,

652
00:35:13,791 --> 00:35:14,991
Shen Bingzhu.

653
00:35:14,991 --> 00:35:18,551
I, Shen Du, the son
of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu,

654
00:35:18,551 --> 00:35:20,991
denounce my father

655
00:35:20,991 --> 00:35:23,111
for colluding with enemies

656
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:25,471
and conspiring with the rebels.

657
00:35:25,471 --> 00:35:27,871
I denounce.

658
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:31,351
I, Shen Du, the son
of the criminal official Shen Bingzhu,

659
00:35:31,351 --> 00:35:33,991
denounce my father

660
00:35:33,991 --> 00:35:36,591
for colluding with enemies.

661
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:44,871
<i>♫ Unraveling mystery fearlessly in this dream ♫</i>

662
00:35:44,871 --> 00:35:47,431
Seek justice for my father,

663
00:35:48,351 --> 00:35:50,952
Shen Bingzhu.

664
00:35:51,960 --> 00:36:01,229
<i>♫ My heart remains untainted
by the mortal dust ♫</i>

665
00:36:06,231 --> 00:36:08,471
Sixteen years ago

666
00:36:08,471 --> 00:36:12,271
when Dacang was at war with Xichen

667
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:15,351
and in dire need of provisions and fodder,

668
00:36:15,351 --> 00:36:18,231
the main granary

669
00:36:18,231 --> 00:36:23,711
that stored the provisions
suddenly caught fire.

670
00:36:23,711 --> 00:36:25,951
All the provisions of Dacang

671
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:28,311
were burned to the ground.

672
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,751
Shen Bingzhu, who was guarding the provisions,

673
00:36:30,751 --> 00:36:33,431
was found guilty of conspiring with the enemy

674
00:36:33,431 --> 00:36:35,871
and severely punished.

675
00:36:45,431 --> 00:36:48,911
The grain bag bearing

676
00:36:48,911 --> 00:36:50,631
the granary's seal

677
00:36:50,631 --> 00:36:55,871
should have been burnt to ashes.

678
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,791
But it appeared

679
00:37:00,071 --> 00:37:04,111
a thousand miles away in Gannndao.

680
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:07,711
The traitorous letter

681
00:37:07,711 --> 00:37:09,831
you presented to the late emperor

682
00:37:09,831 --> 00:37:14,351
was found not to have been written
by Shen Bingzhu.

683
00:37:15,071 --> 00:37:16,351
Prime Minister Zhang,

684
00:37:16,351 --> 00:37:20,031
will you explain it to me?

685
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,791
When the war began,

686
00:37:21,791 --> 00:37:23,831
my disciple came to me.

687
00:37:23,831 --> 00:37:25,431
It was then I learned

688
00:37:25,431 --> 00:37:27,671
that he had colluded with local officials

689
00:37:27,671 --> 00:37:29,871
to scalp the provisions.

690
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,591
They bought the provisions at a low price

691
00:37:31,591 --> 00:37:33,631
and sold them when the price rose

692
00:37:33,631 --> 00:37:35,631
to profit from the price difference.

693
00:37:35,631 --> 00:37:39,871
However, the war with Xichen broke out.

694
00:37:39,871 --> 00:37:40,871
But they had sold out

695
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:42,551
all the provisions,

696
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,991
leaving only piles of thatch in the granary.

697
00:37:51,551 --> 00:37:53,991
Prime Minister Zhang.

698
00:37:53,991 --> 00:37:57,791
It has never crossed my mind that

699
00:37:57,791 --> 00:38:01,871
such a heinous crime
concerning the foundation of Dacang

700
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:05,391
would have something to do with you.

701
00:38:05,391 --> 00:38:07,991
Empress Dowager.

702
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:11,631
Nor have I imagined that

703
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:14,911
one day

704
00:38:14,911 --> 00:38:16,191
I would do something

705
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:18,991
utterly heartless

706
00:38:18,991 --> 00:38:23,911
to cover up my disciple's crime.

707
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:33,631
I found someone

708
00:38:33,631 --> 00:38:38,071
to fabricate that treasonous letter,

709
00:38:38,071 --> 00:38:43,311
imitating Minister Shen's handwriting.

710
00:38:43,311 --> 00:38:45,791
You forged the letter.

711
00:38:45,791 --> 00:38:47,551
Then how did the granary

712
00:38:47,551 --> 00:38:50,071
catch fire?

713
00:38:50,591 --> 00:38:53,128
Prime Minister Zhang.

714
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:57,151
Do you want me to investigate further?

715
00:38:58,751 --> 00:39:00,911
Empress Dowager.

716
00:39:00,911 --> 00:39:03,871
I am solely responsible for this.

717
00:39:03,871 --> 00:39:08,791
My family and I
shall pay the price. Let it end here.

718
00:39:08,791 --> 00:39:10,271
If you keep looking into it,

719
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:14,071
it may shake the foundation of Dacang.

720
00:39:14,071 --> 00:39:15,791
We will be caught

721
00:39:15,791 --> 00:39:17,471
in a dilemma, trying to protect

722
00:39:17,471 --> 00:39:18,511
someone important.

723
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:22,071
It's not worth it, Empress Dowager.

724
00:39:25,391 --> 00:39:27,911
Protect some important?

725
00:39:29,231 --> 00:39:32,711
Who are you referring to?

726
00:39:37,871 --> 00:39:40,351
There are things

727
00:39:40,351 --> 00:39:45,031
I can't speak about openly.

728
00:39:51,071 --> 00:39:53,431
Great Chief Shen, please.

729
00:40:17,711 --> 00:40:19,911
Do you trust me so much?

730
00:40:19,911 --> 00:40:21,951
Aren't you afraid

731
00:40:21,951 --> 00:40:26,871
that you will disappear along with this box?

732
00:40:26,871 --> 00:40:28,191
Over these years,

733
00:40:28,191 --> 00:40:29,591
I have seen you

734
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:32,431
serving the people of Dacang at all costs.

735
00:40:32,431 --> 00:40:33,511
I believe you will

736
00:40:33,511 --> 00:40:35,671
make a fair judgment.

737
00:40:35,671 --> 00:40:38,152
I am not afraid

738
00:40:38,991 --> 00:40:41,351
to risk my life.

739
00:40:53,871 --> 00:40:59,031
Then let me speak on your behalf.

740
00:40:59,591 --> 00:41:03,591
Before Minister Shen took over the granary,

741
00:41:03,591 --> 00:41:05,191
the local official there

742
00:41:05,191 --> 00:41:07,831
was my nephew Zhou Miao.

743
00:41:07,831 --> 00:41:10,187
<i>[Zhou Miao]</i>

744
00:41:11,631 --> 00:41:13,511
He feared that he'd be caught

745
00:41:13,511 --> 00:41:15,631
and colluded with Lai Luozhi

746
00:41:15,631 --> 00:41:17,991
to set our Dacang granary on fire

747
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:20,271
with Wujin Tribe's

748
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:22,831
Fire Fueling Technique.

749
00:41:24,471 --> 00:41:26,951
Empress Dowager, you…

750
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,391
Guards.

751
00:41:28,391 --> 00:41:31,471
Take Zhou Miao out
for a thorough interrogation.

752
00:41:31,471 --> 00:41:34,551
All those involved in this from the Zhou family

753
00:41:34,551 --> 00:41:37,071
shall receive more severe punishment.

754
00:41:37,071 --> 00:41:39,511
Empress Dowager, spare me.

755
00:41:39,511 --> 00:41:42,071
Please spare me.

756
00:41:48,871 --> 00:41:51,271
Prince Xian.

757
00:41:51,271 --> 00:41:54,271
Let me ask you one more time.

758
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:58,511
What will you do with Prime Minister Zhang?

759
00:41:59,031 --> 00:42:01,671
Mother Empress, I beg you

760
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:05,631
to punish Zhang Xingwei according to the law.

761
00:42:05,631 --> 00:42:08,711
But please consider his past merits

762
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:11,551
and deal with the members of the Zhang family

763
00:42:11,551 --> 00:42:13,911
with some leniency.

764
00:42:38,895 --> 00:42:42,713
