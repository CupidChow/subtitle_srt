[Episode 33]

15
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:45,720
It's my first time

16
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,840
hearing someone sing a nursery rhyme
in the cemetery.

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,600
On a dark and windy night,

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:53,800
it's quite interesting.

19
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:55,360
It's you.

20
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,960
You are the one who saved me?

21
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,800
Just think of me as the man in black,

22
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,376
Mr. Mask.

23
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,920
Consider me as your friend.

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,680
Miss Lu, it's rare you've come
to the Imperial Inspectorate.

25
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,840
I can't believe you're leaving
without saying hello to me.

26
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,800
Lai Luozhi

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:18,320
did so many bad things.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,800
That must be a disguise.

Perhaps

30
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,640
he approached me

31
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,960
with an ulterior motive.

32
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,240
Excuse me.

33
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,280
Make way.

34
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,616
Excuse me.

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,024
Stiffy Jiang.

36
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,152
Thank you, boss.

37
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,080
Come on, have a taste.

38
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,048
Have a taste.

39
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,200
What are you up to?

40
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:39,280
Why are you following me?

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,840
To, to protect you.

42
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,560
Protect me?

43
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,680
How long have you been following me?

44
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,600
Not, not very long.

45
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,520
So,

46
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:03,600
recently, around Marshal Xu,

47
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,920
it is always Yun Que following.

48
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,960
It's because you spent all your time
following me?

49
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,800
Not really, Yun Que…

50
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,880
Idiot.

51
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,240
That's your boss.

52
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,400
Why are you following me?

53
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:23,360
I'm afraid you might be in danger.

54
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,160
Then you should have just told me.

55
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,000
Why act like a thief?

56
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,520
You wouldn't agree.

57
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,800
Boss, how much is it?

58
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,800
I have already paid.

59
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,320
You

60
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,000
are still like when you were a child.

00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,520
Ready to use gold ingots at any moment

62
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,840
without considering if it's worth it.

63
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,720
Nonsense, I have always been very meticulous
and frugal.

64
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,960
I don't spend money recklessly.

65
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:20,000
How do you know that I've been like this
since I was little?

66
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,120
Your face is flushed.

67
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:27,160
Why is your face flushed?
You haven't even eaten wontons.

68
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,376
Follow me.

69
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,360
This…

70
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,120
Such a big ingot of gold.

71
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,160
When did you become so wealthy?

72
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,120
A man for a lifetime.

73
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,800
How can one serve others?

74
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,840
He must go do more meaningful things

75
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,160
and protect more people.

76
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
Miss.

77
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
Miss,

78
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:02,120
from now on, I am yours.

79
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,904
From this moment on,

80
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,480
I am yours.

81
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,720
It was you.

82
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,280
That lad who was so poor that he sold himself.

Chuichui,

84
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,120
I listened to you

85
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:47,880
and strove to help a lot and a lot of people.

86
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,760
When you gave me this gold ingot,

87
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,976
I, Jiang Langxing,

88
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:07,440
was a person of yours.

89
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,592
Your Highness.

Great Chief Shen.

93
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,960
I've heard that you

94
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,200
never liked to attend such banquets.

95
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,240
I didn't expect that today,

96
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:07,680
you would come with Mrs. Shen.

97
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,880
It's truly a delightful surprise to me.

98
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,720
Great Chief Shen has arrived.

99
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,240
Why is there still no sign
of Vice Minister Lai,

100
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:17,240
who is as famous as the White Ghost?

101
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,520
I'm late.

102
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:28,240
It's about to snow.

103
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,760
I wonder if my sister would be fortunate enough

104
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,560
to join Princess of Valor and the ladies

105
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,120
to appreciate the snow together.

106
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,832
My sister.

107
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,240
I didn't expect you would actually
bring your elder sister along.

108
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,720
It really gives me full face.

109
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,840
I'm late.

110
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,320
I ask for everyone's forgiveness.

111
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,120
How about everyone takes a seat?

112
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,320
I will personally

113
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,600
pour wine to apologize.

114
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:09,800
Okay.

115
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,072
Please be seated.

116
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,920
Your Highness.

117
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,200
I'm sorry.

118
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,360
She seems so nimble.

119
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,040
Not at all like someone who's been injured.

120
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:21,760
Could it be that you really mistook
the wrong person

121
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,040
in Gannandao?

122
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,040
It is said that Mrs. Shen's talents
are peerless.

123
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,280
How about dancing to a piece of music

124
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,440
and adding to the fun?

125
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,400
This is indeed true.

126
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,760
Mrs. Shen rarely attends feasts.

127
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:01,560
Of course, she should give face to Prince Xian.

128
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:04,760
She can't be arrogant
because she is now favored

129
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,280
by the Empress Dowager, can she?

130
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,160
Everyone, isn't that so?

131
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,640
- Right.
- Right.

132
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,440
Prime Minister Zhang,

133
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,720
I still remember when you tried to unite

134
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,120
the Shen family and Yan family
before His Majesty,

135
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
you said that the Yan family had a daughter

136
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,480
who was skilled in poetry and dance

137
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,640
and her reputation of a gentlewoman

138
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,480
was unsurpassed in Xiang'an.

139
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,080
Today we have this opportunity.

140
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,120
Indeed we should let everyone

141
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,320
witness it for themselves.

142
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,360
I have also heard

143
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,920
at the Kaiyang banquet,

144
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,920
Mrs. Shen performed a dance to the pipa music

145
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,320
and amazed everyone present.

146
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,360
I wonder

147
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:00,160
if you can perform

148
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,560
a new dance today in my mansion.

149
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,440
The daughter taught by Mr. Yan

150
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,480
must be well-versed in the six arts.

151
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,880
You may add to the enjoyment for everyone.

152
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:15,920
Today, my wife…

153
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,632
Honey.

154
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,080
Since the hospitality is hard to decline,

155
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:25,480
I will gladly add to the fun for everyone.

156
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:30,800
Honey,

157
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,880
may I borrow your sword?

158
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,680
Fortunately, Shen Du practices the sword daily.

159
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,040
I have secretly observed it.

160
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,312
I'm sorry.

161
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,800
Vice Minister Lai, isn't your sister
a cloistered lady?

162
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,200
How could she possess
such formidable martial skills?

163
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
Why do the stance and technique

164
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,360
look somewhat familiar?

165
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,840
It seems I've seen it somewhere.

166
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,080
I'm sorry.

167
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,480
Vice Minister Lai,

168
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,920
Liuniang's swordsmanship is not skilled.

169
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,160
She offended your sister.

170
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,560
Fortunately, your sister

171
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,600
has profound martial arts skills.

172
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,920
She exchanged a few moves with me.

173
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,520
We did not disturb the elegance of the banquet.

174
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,320
It's all right.

175
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,160
Wonderful! Marvelous indeed!

176
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,320
Mrs. Shen

177
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,720
and Vice Minister Lai's sister's

178
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,160
sword dance was indeed spectacular.

179
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,160
It was truly a feast for my eyes.

180
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,520
How embarrassing.

181
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,200
Go and fix your appearance at once.

182
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,760
You were too bold just now.

183
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,360
But it was useful, wasn't it?

184
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,080
Now you can be sure

185
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,560
about the doubts in your heart, can't you?

186
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:37,760
The one you encountered in Gannandao

187
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,800
was indeed Lai Luofu.

188
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:43,120
Honey,

189
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,800
this may look easy.

190
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,920
But the sword is very heavy
when dancing with it.

191
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,120
I almost smashed it to the ground
several times.

192
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,080
Mrs. Shen is exceptional
in both talent and skill

193
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,760
and shares a deep affection
with Great Chief Shen.

194
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,360
Truly enviable indeed.

195
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,640
The sword dance of the Great Chief and his wife

196
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,760
really broadened everyone's horizon.

197
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,080
However, the piece played by Mr. Jin just now

198
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:28,240
seemed like one I had never heard before.

199
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,680
It was a new composition by me

200
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,320
for the winter solstice scene.

201
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,584
Joy and Sorrow.

202
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,400
Mr. Jin is the musician most beloved
by the Mother Empress.

203
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,960
It's extremely difficult to hear
his performances on regular days.

204
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,240
I did not expect that in today's banquet
hosted by Prince Xian,

205
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:47,320
we could not only invite Mr. Jin

206
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,000
to perform for us

207
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,760
but also have him compose new piece for us.

208
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,880
It is truly enviable.

209
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,400
I did not expect

210
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
that during this banquet,

211
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,800
I would hear a new piece by Mr. Jin.

212
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,520
It is indeed a pleasant surprise.

213
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,720
The sky is cold, about to snow.

214
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:09,920
It's such an elegant banquet.

215
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us raise our glasses together

216
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,040
to thank Prince Xian for his invitation.

217
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,629
[Spacious and elegant mansion]

218
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,544
[Lai Mansion]

219
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,880
Save me.

220
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,640
It hurts so much.

221
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,800
Save me, please.

222
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,560
You were injured by Shen Du in Gannandao.

223
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,200
I went to great expense to find
a miraculous medicine from the Western Regions.

224
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,760
Only to temporarily control

225
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,320
your wound.

226
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,440
Making you seem alright today

227
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,160
to attend the banquet to prove your innocence.

228
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,840
Yet you recklessly fought fiercely,

229
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,840
exposing your skills.

230
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,320
You're still unaware of your mistake.

231
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:16,280
I want to kill Shen Du.

232
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,360
Now you are injured on top of injuries

233
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,560
and you have aroused suspicion among everyone.

234
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:34,120
You can't show yourself publicly anymore
for the time being.

235
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:39,080
No.

236
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,320
No.

237
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,440
Give me some time.

238
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:42,960
Give me a little time.

239
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,840
I'll recover soon,
I'll be as good as new very quickly.

240
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,920
Recover?

241
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:50,240
Let others suspect that you were impersonating
Chen Huo'e again?

242
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,880
Trust me.

243
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:57,440
I am still useful.

244
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,000
I am still of use.

245
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,320
I still need to play

246
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,520
your sister well, right?

247
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:03,680
Give me some time.

248
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,680
Trust me.

249
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,120
I will be fine.

250
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,640
I will be obedient.

251
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,920
Save me, please.

252
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,480
I am still of use.

253
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:24,000
Quick, save me.

254
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,360
It hurts.

255
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,480
Quick, save me, please.

256
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,840
This year's Winter Solstice didn't bring snow.

257
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,040
Are you planning to turn yourself
into a snowman?

258
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,320
I plan to make dumplings for you to eat.

259
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,800
Make dumplings, see.

260
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:42,240
Madam,

261
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,400
the palace eunuch is here again.

262
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,200
The Empress Dowager summons you.

263
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:51,120
The number of times you enter the palace now

264
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,280
is more than mine.

265
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:56,440
Okay, I will go change my clothes right away.

266
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,400
I'll take care of it when I return.

267
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,800
I am off.

268
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,600
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

269
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,760
Dispense with formalities.

270
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:24,240
Come closer,

271
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,480
Minister Yan.

272
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

273
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,080
Winter solstice has arrived.

274
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,760
I allowed them to take a holiday.

275
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:42,640
I've taken you alone to accompany me.

276
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
You won't blame me, right?

277
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,480
Your Majesty must be joking.

278
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,320
Come, please sit down.

279
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,120
I've heard

280
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,520
yesterday, Minister Lai

281
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:02,680
joked

282
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,560
with you, right?

283
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,848
Yes.

284
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,480
Both of them are my right-hand men.

285
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,880
You should persuade Minister Shen

286
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,000
not to create conflict

287
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,880
with Lai Luozhi.

288
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,560
It's best for matters to be settled here.

289
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,800
Thank Your Majesty for your concern.

290
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,720
Although I don't know the details,

291
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,120
my husband wholeheartedly serves Your Majesty.

292
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,240
Naturally, there won't be

293
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,320
any bias or selfishness.

294
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,800
It's about time for the snow to fall.

295
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,320
The end of the year is nearing.

296
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:50,400
I have aged another year.

297
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,880
Long live Your Majesty.

298
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,040
Enough of this.

299
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,360
Sit down.

300
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,880
Today,

301
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,320
there are no outsiders in the palace.

302
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,000
No need to be so formal.

303
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,200
I am just

304
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,160
a mortal with a fleshly body.

305
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:17,640
How can I live too long?

306
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,920
They respect me

307
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:24,560
and fear me even more

308
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:28,600
because in this vast palace,

309
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:31,080
not a single person

310
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:34,040
can stand shoulder to shoulder with me.

311
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,160
I can see that Minister Baohuan

312
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,080
and Madam Xu

313
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,840
both hold Your Majesty in the highest respect.

314
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,200
That is due to the affection I have shown.

315
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:48,440
Your Majesty,

316
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:49,920
there are Princess Yong'an

317
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:51,400
and Prince Xian.

318
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:54,480
They are both Your Majesty's children.

319
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:09,040
They only care

320
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:10,400
about the position of the future Prince Regent

321
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:13,360
by Qi's side.

322
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,960
They hope that I age sooner

323
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:18,880
so that they can hold great power.

324
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,080
How could they remember

325
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:23,160
their duty as children?

326
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,760
Alright.

327
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,520
Let's not talk about them.

328
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,680
I have called you here today.

329
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:37,360
It is said that Minister Shen
has been so protective of you.

330
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:44,920
I suddenly remembered my days
with the late emperor.

331
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,160
The late emperor also protected me
in the same way.

332
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,840
He had always

333
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,320
been a person
who didn't cause trouble for others.

334
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,760
But he would

335
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:59,480
stand against the court's ministers for me.

336
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,560
I am truly old.

337
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,088
I'm old.

338
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,840
Lately,

339
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,480
I have loved to reminisce.

340
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,760
Yan Xing,

341
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,200
Minister Shen's love for you

342
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,080
is pure and sincere.

343
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,720
It makes my arranged marriage for you seem

344
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,000
somewhat inconsiderate now.

345
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,240
Your Majesty is speaking too seriously.

346
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,960
In Shen Du's heart,

347
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,600
he holds you in high regard.

348
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,520
It is precisely for this reason

349
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:54,600
that I must urge you even more

350
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:58,760
not to let dark clouds cloud your vision.

351
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,040
No matter when or where,

352
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:07,400
you must cherish the one in your heart.

353
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,520
I will carefully remember.

354
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,411
[Shen Mansion]

355
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:30,504
Si.

356
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:34,560
The lord insists you return to Yan Mansion.

357
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,920
My father? Now?

358
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:39,320
Right, get on the carriage.

359
00:30:49,194 --> 00:30:52,567
[Shen Mansion]

360
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,240
Liuniang, come here.

361
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,120
Prime Minister Zhang
has a few questions for you.

362
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,120
You talk first.

363
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,120
Prime Minister Zhang,

364
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,840
we just met yesterday at Prince Xian's banquet.

365
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,000
I wonder why

366
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,440
you've come to the Yan Mansion
specifically to see me.

367
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,680
I heard that these past few days,

368
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,360
you had repeatedly entered the palace
for an audience

369
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,960
and received the deep favor of Her Majesty.

370
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
You place too much importance on it.

371
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,440
The Empress Dowager only wanted
to speak with me.

372
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,640
To chat about some household matters.

373
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,560
To be able to converse with the Empress Dowager
about household matters,

374
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:10,760
this is a fortune that many people
cannot achieve in several lifetimes.

375
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:12,560
You've been by Shen Du's side

376
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,200
and have been through life and death
several times.

377
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,680
Now you're favored by the Empress Dowager.

378
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,520
It is truly fortunate.

379
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,680
Now, you are in the spring breeze of success.

380
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:24,200
Do you still remember

381
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,360
why you were married to Shen Du?

382
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,320
Today is the Winter Solstice.

383
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,240
I will not tangle with you too much.

384
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:44,440
Just tell me what the Empress Dowager

385
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:45,800
said to you

386
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:46,880
and during this period of time,

387
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,120
what happened

388
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,160
in the Shen Mansion.

389
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,440
I don't know.

390
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,480
Are you trying to rebel?

391
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,880
You've been using my father and the Yan Mansion

392
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,880
to manipulate me for a long time.

393
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,400
Indeed, for my sister,

394
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,840
I married into the Shen Mansion.

395
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,680
But I am wholeheartedly involved
in reviewing cases at the Ministry of Justice

396
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:17,000
and sharing the worries of the Empress Dowager.

397
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,880
I'm unaware of anything else.

398
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,920
I should not know anything else, either.

399
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,400
I hope you will show mercy.

400
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,560
Liuniang,

401
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,600
you have obtained

402
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:29,280
the favor of the Empress Dowager and Shen Du.

403
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,840
Now that you have them to rely on,

404
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,920
you think I can do nothing to you

405
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:35,000
and the Yan Mansion

406
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,440
now?

407
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,200
Imperial favor changes in a blink of an eye.

408
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:45,160
Shen Du is hard-pressed
to secure his own safety.

409
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:48,400
Do you believe that he can protect you

410
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,040
and your Yan family?

411
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:53,400
I don't wish to rely on anyone.

412
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,640
I only want to rely on myself.

413
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,680
Okay.

414
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:59,400
Your wings have grown strong, huh?

415
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,520
This time,

416
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,720
my husband and I

417
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,800
went together to Gannandao.

418
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,320
Along the way, we pursued the Half-faced Demon

419
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,880
and the Huo'e Sect.

420
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,800
We gained a lot of knowledge
about the borderlands.

421
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,360
Following the leads,

422
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,480
we also learned a lot

423
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,800
of unimaginable stories.

424
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:19,480
Are you

425
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,639
interested in them?

426
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:26,800
What do you want to say?

427
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,000
Yan Liuniang, don't go making
baseless accusations.

428
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,719
If you don't want to listen,

429
00:34:31,719 --> 00:34:34,080
I will not talk about them.

430
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,400
Today,

431
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,280
I reviewed the Ministry of Justice's archives.

432
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,600
I do have a question in mind.

433
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
Regarding the old case of the Shen Mansion,

434
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,280
why didn't you submit a single memorandum

435
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,920
or show any stance on such a major case?

436
00:34:52,920 --> 00:34:53,920
For public cause,

437
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:56,719
you were then the pillar of the court.

438
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,920
For personal reasons,

439
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,240
weren't you once

440
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:03,360
classmates with Mr. Shen Bingzhu?

441
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,760
What are you trying to say?

442
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,240
What exactly do you know?

443
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,480
I do not know much.

444
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,200
Nor do I know what I should know.

445
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,920
You have no evidence.

446
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,320
Yet you seek to threaten me?

447
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:24,360
If you have any questions,

448
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,440
just come to the Shen Mansion and ask me.

449
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,000
Going in such a big circle

450
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,480
to trouble my wife at the Yan Mansion.

451
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,936
Isn't it inappropriate?

452
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,960
I thought you were the clear stream
of the court,

453
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,960
disdaining the vile acts of the officialdom.

454
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,440
How come now you start threatening
a mere woman?

455
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:54,600
I take my leave.

456
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,072
Liuniang.

457
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,320
Mother.

458
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:29,400
Caiwei, Yijiao, Mojie,

459
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,800
why have you all come out?

460
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,368
Come.

461
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,960
Your father

462
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,960
is spineless.

463
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,400
He only knows how to harm his daughter.

464
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,480
You came back for the Winter Solstice.

465
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,520
Now you are without even having a meal.

466
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:06,200
I know you must feel wronged in your heart.

467
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:08,560
Yes.

468
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,600
Mother and auntie made
steamed rice cakes and dumplings

469
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,720
for you and my brother-in-law.

470
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,920
While waiting for you,

471
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,880
it was reheated several times already.

472
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:18,240
Hearing you would leave directly,

473
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:21,240
Auntie was so anxious she was about to cry.

474
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,280
Mother, I'm sorry.

475
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,960
What are you apologizing for?

476
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,200
It's all your father's fault.

477
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:33,520
Haven't you loved eating this
since you were little?

478
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:43,240
Eat it up, Liuniang. It's still hot.

479
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,080
Thank you, Yijiao. Thank you, Mojie.

480
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:49,360
Liuniang, have you been well these days
at the Shen Mansion?

481
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,000
I'm fine.

482
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,200
That's good.

483
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:53,520
That day, I heard our father

484
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,480
and Mojie talk to Mr. Han.

485
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:56,720
I heard that the Empress Dowager

486
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,080
favored Lai Luozhi

487
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,600
and suppressed the Great Chief.

488
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,080
But it seems for the sake
of checks and balances,

489
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,640
she calls you to accompany Her Majesty
in the palace every day.

490
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,080
It's not that serious.

491
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,800
Liuniang,

492
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,120
I still say the same thing.

493
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,600
If you and the White Ghost

494
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,160
can live in harmony

495
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,480
as husband and wife,

496
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,200
that's good.

497
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,360
But if every day you're putting your neck

498
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,760
on the knife's edge,

499
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,560
living in fear and trepidation,

500
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
it's better to return home.

501
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,520
After all, the Yan Mansion has a place for you.

502
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,760
Yes, Lady Jin was quite straightforward,

503
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,480
but it's all for your own good.

504
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:33,800
No matter what, your happiness
is the most important.

505
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,960
Do not make too many sacrifices

506
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,240
for the Yan family.

507
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,440
Thank you to Mother

508
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,760
and my brother and sisters for your concern.

509
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,320
I am doing very well now.

510
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:48,712
Really very well.

511
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,520
Then we are relieved.

512
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,480
Right, today is the Winter Solstice,
a day of rest.

513
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,480
We're rarely without matters to attend to.

514
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,480
Why not take a stroll down the street together?

515
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,600
He won't eat people anyway.

516
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,400
Let's go then.

517
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,640
Your family members all care for you deeply.

518
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:02,640
The Yan family estate is peaceful.

519
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,640
Although there are occasional disputes,

520
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,360
they mainly stem from goodwill.

521
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,160
I don't know

522
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,400
whether this is my father's blessing

523
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,440
or our siblings' fortune.

524
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:19,160
It's my good fortune.

525
00:40:23,080 --> 00:40:25,720
My parents passed away early.

526
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,920
What I envy most

527
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:30,480
is a whole and complete family.

528
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:35,480
Actually, ever since my first visit
to the Yan Mansion, I've been wondering

529
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,520
why you are so determined

530
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,600
to clear the grievances of the people.

531
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,840
Turns out it's because you've been happy
and well since childhood.

532
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,760
There is pure justice in your heart,

533
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,160
without a trace of impurity.

534
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,680
In the future, they

535
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,120
will all be your family.

536
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:18,280
Honey,

537
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,368
be careful.

538
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,640
The greatly-feared Great Chief,

539
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,640
in front of his beloved wife,

540
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,480
is so tender-hearted.

541
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,920
Why have you come along with an inspector?

542
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,280
Yan Liuniang, you don't know that Lu Chuichui

543
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:50,040
is going to be the wife of an inspector.

544
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,160
No way.

545
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,240
You and Jiang Langxing,

546
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,520
you two are dating?

547
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,000
Just go ahead and laugh at me.

548
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:05,440
Why would I laugh at you?

549
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:07,880
I'm happy for you.

550
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,480
You've finally seen the light.

551
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:10,480
How did you find out

552
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,400
that Jiang Langxing had you in his heart?

553
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:16,440
How did I…?

554
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:17,800
Naturally, it's because

555
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:18,840
you are beautiful, kind-hearted,

556
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,400
and exceptionally intelligent.

557
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:26,400
You're shy.

558
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,600
I was going to ask you when you plan
to have your wedding banquet.

559
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,560
I want to get married on the same day as you.

560
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:31,880
You're also getting married?

561
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,280
Who are you marrying?

562
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:35,040
Yan Xing, have you been investigating
too many cases

563
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,320
and gotten your brain muddled from them?

564
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,720
Can't you see?

565
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,320
Of course, I'm marrying Marshal Xu.

566
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:43,240
Congratulations.

567
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:44,440
Thank you.

568
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,800
Shen Du, I don't like you anymore.

569
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,840
So you have to be nice to Liuniang
in the future.

570
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,480
If you scare away Liuniang,

571
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,840
I'm afraid no other woman will like you.

572
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:53,680
Then you won't be able to get a wife.

573
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,000
So what?

574
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,560
In this life, I am

575
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,960
content with having Yan Xing alone.

576
00:43:28,311 --> 00:43:32,129
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

577
00:43:32,129 --> 00:43:35,806
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

600
00:45:04,778 --> 00:45:08,518
