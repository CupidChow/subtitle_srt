The White Ghost is here.

189
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,760
The White Ghost is also here.

190
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,160
So this is the White Ghost.

191
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,280
The White Ghost is the Great Chief
of the Imperial Guards.

192
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,120
The Imperial Guards report directly

193
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,520
to the Grand Empress Dowager.

194
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,880
Investigation, surveillance,
assassination. You name it.

195
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Stop crying. The White Ghost is here.

196
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,920
His name

197
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,640
dispels clouds in daylight

198
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,800
and stops children's crying at night.

199
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,760
These two are running into each other.

200
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:24,560
It's going to be a good show.

201
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,880
The road is only so wide. Who will yield?

202
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Who knows?

203
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,720
Look…

204
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,944
Stop the carriage.

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,040
Great Chief Shen, you came after all.

206
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
I thought you were busy

207
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,120
preparing for the wedding

208
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,600
and couldn't make it.

209
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,080
How can my wedding

210
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,880
be as important as the state affair?

211
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,480
Prime Minister Zhang proposed it.

212
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,560
The Grand Empress Dowager approved of it.

213
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,120
It shows that your wedding

214
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,280
is also a major event.

215
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,960
What a pity.

216
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,960
Your previous brides

217
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:07,160
lacked a bit of luck.

218
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,200
Please stop making fun of me.

219
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,200
To avoid missing the auspicious time,

220
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,920
we'd better get going.

221
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,000
The west street is too narrow

222
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,600
even for two entourages to pass by each other.

223
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,480
Tear down everything blocking the way

224
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,960
so that our caravans can pass

225
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,160
at the same time.

226
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,080
Great Chief.

227
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,432
Let's go.

228
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,840
Shen Du.

229
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:06,563
[Ming Hall]

230
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:36,288
You two have kept me waiting.

231
00:14:36,288 --> 00:14:37,480
Prime Minister Zhang.

232
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,560
Prime Minister Zhang, I'm late.

233
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,560
Not really.

234
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
You're just on time.

235
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,960
Everyone, start the ceremony.

236
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,040
The auspicious time has arrived.

237
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,000
Thank you, Clerk Yan.

238
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,240
The real culprit was caught

239
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:01,280
[Jiang Langxing, Inspector]
all thanks to you.

240
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,560
Don't mention it. It's my job
at the Ministry of Justice.

241
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,800
Right, the other day,
you asked us to find herbs

242
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,960
that could detect poison.

243
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,320
I found out that they're available

244
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,480
in the nearby mountains.

245
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,880
Why don't you come with us

246
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,680
and gather them?

247
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,760
No need. Get back to work.

248
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,360
I'll gather them myself.

249
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Then I'll take my leave.

250
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,632
Take care.

251
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,440
Prime Minister Zhang,

252
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,280
thank you for presiding over

253
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:45,720
the sacrificial ceremony.

254
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,760
Dacang will surely

255
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:48,360
witness a peaceful

256
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,440
and prosperous year

257
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,840
as the Imperial Preceptor prophesied.

258
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,040
We held this ceremony

259
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:53,240
on this auspicious day

260
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:54,960
picked by Prince Xian

261
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,080
on behalf of the Grand Empress Dowager

262
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,400
after he consulted with a folk diviner.

263
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,440
I simply followed orders

264
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,840
and fulfilled my duty as a minister.

265
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,840
Dacang is blessed with

266
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,880
a noble emperor

267
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,280
and wise ministers.

268
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,000
We're truly lucky to witness

269
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,200
this golden age of peace and prosperity.

270
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,320
Indeed.

271
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,480
Indeed.

272
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,656
Assassin!

273
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:19,976
Seal the mountain.

274
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:37,450
Sister.

275
00:16:38,368 --> 00:16:40,640
Are you picking the leaves to make medicine?

276
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,800
No, I'll use them for autopsy…

277
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,240
Yeah.

278
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,240
I'm using them to make herbal medicine.

279
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,360
How do you know?

280
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,040
I can tell by the way you're dressed.

281
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,720
[Qi Yeyun]
Are you a physician?

282
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,720
You could say that.

283
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,440
Here, take it. I've picked enough.

284
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,839
Ms. Zhang from the village fell ill.

285
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,240
I came to pick some for her.

286
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,720
A doctor said that the tea

287
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,568
made from it was useful.

288
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:19,000
Let me pay for it.

289
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,720
I don't want money.

290
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,160
I picked it in passing.

291
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,000
Thank you, then.

292
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,560
Sister.

293
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,560
My name is Qi Yeyun.

294
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,120
What's your name?

295
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,520
Are you going down the mountain?

296
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,240
There's a shortcut. It's faster.

297
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,600
Stop there.

298
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,600
No one shall leave the mountain today.

299
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,320
What happened?
I'm from the Ministry of Justice--

300
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,520
Be quiet. Come with us.

301
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,240
Hurry up.

302
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,360
What is this all about?

303
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,880
Vice Minister Lai.

304
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Here are the people

305
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,720
in the mountains at the time of the incident.

306
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,480
Someone dared to attack a high official

307
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,040
during the sacrificial ceremony
at the Ming Hall.

308
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,560
I was lucky enough to dodge the arrow.

309
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,800
Yet, I have lost a trusted subordinate.

310
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Today,

311
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,360
I will surely make the assassin pay.

312
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:21,640
Assassin.

313
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,240
Who's the assassin?

314
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,560
The assassin is among you.

315
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,040
I advise the assassin

316
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,640
to confess now.

317
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,960
I can grant you an easy death.

318
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,680
You can't escape even if

319
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,200
you don't confess.

320
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
If no one confesses

321
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,320
before the incense burns out,

322
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,360
everyone dies.

323
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,120
Hold on.

324
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
Vice Minister Lai.

325
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,960
I am Yan Xing,
a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

326
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,880
May I take a look at the body?

327
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,840
Perhaps I can find out who the assassin is.

328
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,944
Approved.

329
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:20,000
It's five in the afternoon.

330
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,360
The sun is in the west.

331
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,800
So the arrow must have…

332
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,560
How's it going, little clerk?

333
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:34,720
Can you tell me

334
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,920
who the assassin is now?

335
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,240
I haven't found out

336
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,240
who the assassin is.

337
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,800
But the assassin shot the arrow from afar.

338
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:55,840
The direct sunlight

339
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,600
would have affected his aim.

340
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,040
So he must have shot the arrow

341
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:01,200
with the sun on his back.

342
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,240
Judging from

343
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,240
the trajectory,

344
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,160
the best hiding spot

345
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:07,280
would be in the trees.

346
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,280
In the forest

347
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,760
on the northwest peak.

348
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,840
After the incident,

349
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,600
you sealed the mountain right away.

350
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,120
So people from other mountain ranges

351
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,240
couldn't be the assassin.

352
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,840
Vice Minister Lai, please kindly

353
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,000
release those

354
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
who can't be suspects.

355
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,240
I have made myself clear.

356
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,280
I will release them

357
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,120
if you find out who the assassin is.

358
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,720
You failed.

359
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,760
Shoot them all.

360
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,080
Vice Minister Lai.

361
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,280
I have a better idea.

362
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,720
Shooting the assassin

363
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,600
is not enough to deter others.

364
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,000
I have raised a few fighting dogs,

365
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,200
capable of tearing apart

366
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,320
criminals.

367
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,240
Why not let my dogs have a try at it?

368
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:23,160
It may be a slow death,

369
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,448
but

370
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,320
it's more interesting.

371
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:30,520
I haven't lived up to my title

372
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,400
as the "Black Fiend".

373
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,480
Now that I've learned your measures,

374
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,960
I have no choice but to

375
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,240
admit my inferiority.

376
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,960
Jing Lin.

377
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,360
Stay back.

378
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,408
Stop.

379
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:28,880
Go away.

380
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,840
Go away.

381
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,760
The assassin is among them.

382
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:40,680
The assassin must be strong and fast

383
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:43,120
and know how to climb.

384
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Vice Minister Lai, you can

385
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:53,720
give these people a good disciplining.

386
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,280
Let me think.

387
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:56,960
What kind of death

388
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,320
suits them better?

389
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:05,520
Vice Minister Lai,

390
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,680
please wait a little longer.

391
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,000
Give me some time

392
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,960
and I will surely catch the assassin.

393
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,680
I swear with my life.

394
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,560
Great Chief Shen.

395
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,720
How many hours

396
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,680
should I give her?

397
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,960
Six hours.

398
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,360
In six hours,

399
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:29,680
if you can't solve the case,

400
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:35,000
you shall perish with them.

401
00:23:36,362 --> 00:23:39,177
[Imperial Guards]

402
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,120
Archers tend to have calluses

403
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,840
on three parts of their hands.

404
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,280
This person only has calluses on the palm.

405
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
Excluded.

406
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,240
[Chief's Office]

407
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,400
Great Chief.

408
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,520
Lai Luozhi wanted to catch the assassin.

409
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,920
But he tossed the case and suspects to us

410
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,520
and asked for execution with our fighting dogs.

411
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,560
Do you think

412
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,640
he's up to something?

413
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,720
Isn't it obvious?

414
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:07,400
He was sure that
the clerk couldn't solve the case.

415
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,560
He didn't want to mess with

416
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,000
the Ministry of Justice.

417
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,640
He didn't want to mess with them.

418
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:15,520
Aren't you afraid of taking the blame?

419
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,600
I've been the son of a convicted official.

420
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:23,400
What else could scare me?

421
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:25,240
The assassin was located

422
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,320
at the northwest peak of the mountain,

423
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,520
which was covered

424
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,520
with lacquer trees.

425
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,920
The lacquer tree branches

426
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,760
gave some suspects blotches.

427
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,960
But none of them had any blotches

428
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,520
when they were caught.

429
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,240
Those who developed severe blotches

430
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,000
didn't hide among the lacquer trees.

431
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,200
The one in the middle.

432
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,520
The mud on his shoes was not
from the lacquer tree forest. Excluded.

433
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:45,640
Find the murder weapon

434
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,240
and we will convict the assassin.

435
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,240
Why is it so bright?

436
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,040
Any last words?

437
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,120
Time is almost up.

438
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,920
You still haven't found the assassin.

439
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,680
Once we find the murder weapon
in the lacquer tree forest,

440
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,160
- we can--
- Save it.

441
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:44,800
You're running out of time.

442
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,960
You may still fail

443
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,360
even if you find the murder weapon.

444
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:52,680
Am I right?

445
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:55,080
Should I give up just because I may fail?

446
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,280
You may fail

447
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,560
yet you bet with your life.

448
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,600
You're either foolish

449
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,600
or undervaluing yourself.

450
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,160
I'll write a will when the time comes.

451
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,840
Please deliver it

452
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:17,240
to the Yan Mansion in the east of the city.

453
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,960
Take her away.

454
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,080
See her off.

455
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,400
Understood.

456
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:30,024
Great Chief Shen.

457
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,840
You really don't recognize me?

458
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,480
Should I recognize you?

459
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,040
Great Chief, we found the murder weapon.

460
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,720
Just as Clerk Yan had guessed,

461
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,360
it was buried under the fallen leaves.

462
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
It seems that you're quite lucky.

463
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:01,320
The murder weapon was found at the last moment.

464
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,720
Once I match the suspects' calluses
to the weapon,

465
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,000
I will determine who the assassin is.

466
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,760
It seems I am quite lucky today.

467
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,000
It's just the right time.

468
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:17,280
Vice Minister Lai, I doubt you're here

469
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:20,160
at the right time out of sheer luck.

470
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,160
The murder weapon was brought back
from Yangui Mountain.

471
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,400
I bet you heard about it quite some time ago.

472
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,960
Six hours have passed.

473
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,440
Clerk Yan, hurry up.

474
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,560
I can't wait to see

475
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,040
who's audacious enough

476
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,520
to come after me.

477
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,640
Both of you.

478
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,840
Please grip the bow

479
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,840
as you normally do.

480
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,360
I think I've found the assassin.

481
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:07,840
The calluses on their hands

482
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
are almost identical.

483
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,800
But the calluses from nocking the arrow

484
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,920
are different.

485
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,560
One person has calluses

486
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:19,400
on the inner side of the thumb,

487
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:21,480
which means he nocks the arrow with his thumb.

488
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,000
Any skilled archer knows

489
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,640
that it's a slanted grip

490
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,440
with a low push, which results in

491
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,120
less accurate shooting.

492
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:30,800
The other one has calluses on the purlicue.

493
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,040
Such a straight grip

494
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:34,520
with a high push ensures precision.

495
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,760
Therefore,

496
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,840
you are the assassin.

497
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,840
Stay put!

498
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:46,080
Step back.

499
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,080
Stay back.

500
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:49,080
Let me go, or I'll kill her.

501
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,520
Don't you know where you are?

502
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,560
Do you think you can escape?

503
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,240
Name the mastermind.

504
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,400
I might let you die with dignity.

505
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,520
Let her go.

506
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,040
Since we have evidence,

507
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:09,600
we don't need a confession.

508
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:10,960
Prepare to shoot him.

509
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:14,320
A-Are you going to shoot her as well?

510
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,160
She is not an Imperial Guard.

511
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,360
She's just a lowly clerk
without any official rank.

512
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,240
It's no big deal if she dies.

513
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
Shen Du.

514
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,720
You heartless White Ghost.

515
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,680
How can you be so cruel?

516
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,800
If you die here today, I will honor

517
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:32,360
your loyalty to the nation.

518
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,240
As far as I know,
the salary of a clerk is meager.

519
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,840
But the Ministry of Justice offers

520
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:44,880
the highest compensation
amongst the Six Ministries.

521
00:29:46,280 --> 00:29:48,920
Consider it a tribute to your parents.

522
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,200
My spirit will haunt you forever.

523
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,040
What a coincidence.

524
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:58,320
The thing I fear the least

525
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,520
is an evil spirit coming for my life.

526
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:10,200
Don't move.

527
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:28,200
Thank you.

528
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:29,880
You are not that dumb.

529
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,280
Since there's no way out,

530
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,696
all right.

531
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,080
Confess.

532
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,520
Who sent you to kill me?

533
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:46,056
It was…

534
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:50,000
It was him.

535
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,040
Great Chief Shen.

536
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,080
No wonder you were eager to kill him.

537
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:09,320
Impressive.

538
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,640
Vice Minister Lai.

539
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,120
Isn't it ridiculous to fall for the nonsense

540
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,440
made up by a dying criminal?

541
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,480
How dare you

542
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,080
talk to our Vice Minister like that?

543
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,520
Please think twice, Vice Minister Lai.

544
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,440
If Great Chief Shen sent the assassin,

545
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,160
why would he make the arrest

546
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,480
and look for the murder weapon

547
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,000
instead of killing the assassin?

548
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,520
I was just kidding.

549
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:37,880
How could I believe you would want to kill me?

550
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,160
Don't take it seriously.

551
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,696
I never

552
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,360
took it seriously.

553
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,560
Now that the assassin is dead,

554
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,120
I can rest assured.

555
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,960
I have no reason to stay.

556
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:00,456
I'll take my leave.

557
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,280
I failed to watch the suspect.

558
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,600
I deserve to be punished.

559
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,120
Forget it. He's dead.

560
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:31,080
You guys.

561
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,160
Take Clerk Yan

562
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,360
and the rest of them

563
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,160
out there.

564
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,392
Understood.

565
00:33:03,104 --> 00:33:04,600
Great Chief.

566
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,840
That clerk has been

567
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,960
staring at you.

568
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,120
She's not afraid of you.

569
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,080
What's so fancy about that?

570
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,680
Don't you know that Xiang'an

571
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,040
is full of dull women?

572
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:17,000
True. Your look certainly attracts

573
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,920
some lustful and fearless women.

574
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:20,360
No more nonsense or I'll send you

575
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,000
to serve at the Imperial Inspectorate.

576
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,640
Please don't.

577
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:26,520
I want to work here for the rest of my life.

578
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,320
Now I get it.

579
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:30,560
Your fiance Yan Sanniang

580
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,040
is the daughter of Mr. Yan.

581
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,200
So this Yan Liuniang

582
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,600
will be your sister-in-law.

583
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:39,760
She seems to have some brains.

584
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,920
She knew I did that

585
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,880
to save her.

586
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:45,200
Whether we'll be in-laws

587
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,560
depends on whether her elder sister

588
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,640
has the courage

589
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,760
to marry me.

590
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,400
What…

591
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,600
Thank you for saving us, Clerk Yan.

592
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:04,880
Please rise.

593
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:06,120
I serve in the Ministry of Justice.

594
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,400
This is my job.

595
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,600
Thankfully, you solved the case.

596
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:11,880
Otherwise, we would have been killed.

597
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,520
It's getting late. Hurry up and go home.

598
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:16,600
Thank you, Clerk Yan.

599
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,888
Let's go.

600
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,656
Sister.

601
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,880
I saw how you solved the case.

602
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,880
You were wise,

603
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:28,920
brave, and composed.

604
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,080
And you saved me.

605
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,880
Get up.

606
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,679
Therefore, I'd like to learn from you.

607
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,520
Please don't turn me down.

608
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I am just

609
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,400
a minor clerk without a title.

610
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,840
How can I accept disciples?

611
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,719
Besides, your parents

612
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,480
wouldn't allow you to learn from a woman.

613
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,800
I'm an orphan.

614
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,840
The people

615
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,239
on the Yangui Mountain brought me up.

616
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:53,120
I'm free to pick anyone as my master.

617
00:34:54,688 --> 00:34:55,880
[Imperial secretariat
of the Ministry of Justice, Lu Chuichui]

618
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,080
But you are not the disciple she wants.

619
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,584
Kiddo.

620
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,880
Sister.

621
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:05,000
Is it true?

622
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:08,160
Hop on, Liuniang.

623
00:35:13,080 --> 00:35:15,240
See you.

624
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
How did you know
I was with the Imperial Guards?

625
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,800
That nosy little fellow

626
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,800
from my family's shop

627
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:22,920
told me about it.

628
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,240
He said his cousin's classmate's

629
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,240
cousin's cousin-in-law

630
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:27,560
saw a few villagers

631
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,720
and a female clerk

632
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,280
in the Yangui Mountain

633
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:32,240
getting arrested by the Imperial Guards.

634
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,240
A clerk

635
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,680
and a female.

636
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,240
Who else could it be?

637
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,640
It seems that your fellow would work better

638
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,240
at the Ministry of Justice than you.

639
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,680
I was so anxious when I heard about it.

640
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,000
Thankfully, I heard
you were working on the case.

641
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,720
Then I felt reassured.

642
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,760
Is there any case you can't solve

643
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,600
in this world?

644
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:56,440
Besides, don't you have

645
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:58,920
an acquaintance there?

646
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,080
No way.

647
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:07,040
Shen Du still hasn't recognized you?

648
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,040
Did he go blind?

649
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:23,200
Never mind, I'll take you home first.

650
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,200
I'm not going home.

651
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,920
Just take me to the Ministry of Justice.

652
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,480
Ministry of Justice?

653
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,200
Yan Liuniang.

654
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,160
I must sign up for
the female official's assessment tomorrow.

655
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,000
Women from Xiang'an City

656
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,640
want to be elegant ladies

657
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,760
well-known far and wide

658
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,880
like your third sister.

659
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,560
Only you wish to become

660
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,840
a female official.

661
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,480
You are already a female official.

662
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:46,480
I can't be left too far behind.

663
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:49,040
Rest assured, I will become a female official

664
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,840
of the Ministry of Justice this year.

665
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:54,080
Turn right to the Ministry of Justice.

666
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:57,440
The assassin you sent
committed suicide on the spot.

667
00:36:57,440 --> 00:36:58,640
In that case,

668
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,040
the two major powers

669
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,840
will confront each other.

670
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,000
Have you figured out about

671
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,400
the prophecy given

672
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,160
by the Imperial Preceptor before he died?

673
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:10,520
It is said

674
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,320
that apart from our nation witnessing

675
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,680
a peaceful and prosperous year,

676
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,240
there was something else.

677
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,440
But no one could tell what it was.

678
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,960
It seems that no one knows.

679
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,960
On the night the Imperial Preceptor died,

680
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:24,040
both the White Ghost and the Black Fiend

681
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,400
were at the Ming Hall.

682
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,313
They are truly unpredictable.

683
00:37:32,313 --> 00:37:35,000
[Yan Mansion]

684
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,240
What happened?

685
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:39,000
I am Yan Liuniang. Let me in.

686
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,960
By the heavenly decree,

687
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,280
here comes the edict.

688
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,520
Miss Yan

689
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,960
is widely praised

690
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,400
for her talents in art,

691
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,960
literacy, and handicrafts.

692
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:56,320
With knowledge

693
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,800
of the past and present,

694
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,840
her reputation as a virtuous lady

695
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,280
- is unmatched in Xiang'an.
- Mother.

696
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,600
I am delighted to hear that.

697
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,360
Now, Shen Du,
the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

698
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:08,120
is at the age to get married.

699
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,360
Only a virtuous woman can be his match.

700
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:13,120
It happens that Miss Yan is still single,

701
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:15,360
who is a perfect match for Shen Du.

702
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:16,720
Therefore, I bestow

703
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,080
on them a grand wedding

704
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,120
in three days.

705
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,536
Respect this!

706
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,280
Mr. Yan, accept the decree.

707
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,640
Shen Du?

708
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,600
[Yan Kuo, Head of the Yan Family]
Thank you, Grand Empress Dowager.

709
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,080
Thank you, sir.

710
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,320
Congratulations, Mr. Yan.

711
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,920
You've raised a talented

712
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,320
and virtuous lady renowned in Xiang'an.

713
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,360
My dear Caiwei.

714
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:56,560
We can't marry her off.

715
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,280
A young lady's marriage

716
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,040
has always been at the behest

717
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,680
of her parents and the matchmaker.

718
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,800
Moreover,

719
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:08,000
this is a marriage bestowed
by the Empress Dowager.

720
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
That's the White Ghost.

721
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:11,920
If Caiwei marries him,

722
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,200
how

723
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,800
can she ever live in peace?

724
00:39:21,642 --> 00:39:24,040
[Lady Jin, Concubine of Yan Kuo]

725
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:31,760
This is so unpredictable.

726
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
It's completely out of my imagination.

727
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:39,000
What a tragedy.

728
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,840
Mother.

729
00:39:51,840 --> 00:39:54,320
Why are you staring at me?

730
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,400
People say that

731
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,720
great wisdom appears stupid.

732
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:01,560
Perhaps you're the best illustration.

733
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,080
I always feel that

734
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,640
I lack ability and status,

735
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,720
rendering you a concubine's

736
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
unappreciated daughter.

737
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,360
So I always want you

738
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,960
to learn from your sister

739
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,880
and adopt the manners of a lady.

740
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,640
Then you can marry into

741
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:19,520
a good family to secure a promising future.

742
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,680
Mother, you know I don't want that.

743
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,920
Yeah, I used to be so mad,

744
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,680
blaming you for being foolish,

745
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,000
ignorant, and uneducated.

746
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,680
But now

747
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,240
I suddenly feel that it's fine

748
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:35,480
to be ignorant and uneducated.

749
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,160
It's quite good to be ignorant

750
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,200
and uneducated.

751
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,600
Mother, I'm not ignorant and uneducated.

752
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,480
Think about it.

753
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:48,000
Among all the women in Xiang'an City,

754
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,800
why did the Grand Empress Dowager

755
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,920
choose your third sister?

756
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:56,320
It's because of her exceptional talents.

757
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,400
The Madame has been teaching her

758
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,320
music and painting, poetry and songs.

759
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:01,840
She is proficient in everything.

760
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:04,240
Who would have thought that

761
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,800
she'd marry the White Ghost

762
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,000
and jump into the fire?

763
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,280
Mother, Shen Du is the Great Chief
of the Imperial Guards.

764
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,000
He's not as bad as you say.

765
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,720
So you think that

766
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,520
Madame and your third sister

767
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,800
are making a fuss and putting on a show?

768
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:28,400
Anyway, if she manages to marry him,

769
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:30,800
she will be so tormented that

770
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,800
she'll wish for her death.

771
00:41:52,184 --> 00:41:56,002
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

772
00:41:56,002 --> 00:41:59,679
