Squeeze it.

Prime Minister Zhang today?

54
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,240
You can't pretend to be a spy

55
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,040
for Prime Minister Zhang forever.

56
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,240
You have to end this one day.

57
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,760
But you suddenly brought up

58
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,440
my family's old case today.

59
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:03,080
Was it due to some new conjectures?

60
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,440
I kind of did it

61
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,960
on purpose to see his reaction.

62
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,040
It seems that

63
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,880
Prime Minister Zhang
definitely knows something.

64
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:17,640
There are so many confusing leads these days.

65
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,960
Nothing is certain.

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,600
But I'm certain that

67
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,640
long before my family was caught in trouble,

68
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,880
multiple forces of power

69
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:28,360
had been plotting things.

70
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,960
I have an intuition.

71
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:31,520
What is it?

72
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,520
I think

73
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,040
that the situation your father faced

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:39,400
resembles what you're facing now.

75
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,960
You're mediating among several powers.

76
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,000
It's hard to remain neutral

77
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
and uphold your integrity.

78
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,360
A slight misstep could…

79
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,520
Lead to total disaster.

80
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,480
But sticking to your aspirations is not wrong.

81
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:59,000
Nor is it wrong to not
bend over to those in power.

You always liked the winter snow.

You said that

133
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,160
the snow was the purest

134
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,560

My eyes

Why did you come back?

150
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,240
Didn't I tell you

151
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,560
to take days off for the holiday?

152
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,080
I'm used to dealing with state affairs.

153
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,760
Now that I'm idle, I feel bored.

154
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,280
Besides, I feel that the snowy night

155
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,000
is most boring and lonely.

156
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,400
That's why I begged Mr. Jin

157
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,760
to come along with me

158
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,600

you think that

I am all alone,

166
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,520
I just composed a new song

167
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:40,280
named "Joy and Sorrow".

168
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,080
I wonder if Your Majesty would be

169
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,480
interested in listening to it.

170
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,320

Vice Minister Lai is here.

189
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,120
Bring him in.

190
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,200
Why did he come

191
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,960
on such a snowy night?

192
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,440
Minister Lai.

193
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,800
Why did you come here in the snow

194
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,440
instead of celebrating at home?

195
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,560
Is there anything urgent?

196
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:50,880
Empress Dowager.

197
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,920
I just received an anonymous tip

198
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,920
that Yan Xing

199
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,320
was sent to Great Chief Shen

200
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,680
to win him over

201
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:58,280
by Prime Minister Zhang.

202
00:14:58,280 --> 00:14:59,440
Earlier today,

203
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,720
Prime Minister Zhang even threatened her

204
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,120
with the safety of her family.

205
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:07,600
Someone is trying

206
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,600
to stir things up.

207
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:14,320
Does Yan Xing

208
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,280
truly work for Prince Xian?

209
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,400
Empress Dowager.

210
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:18,520
I'm afraid that

211
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:20,520
there are some misunderstandings.

212
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,160
The informant also stated

213
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,200
that you bestowed

214
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,280
the marriage decree

215
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,080
on Yan Sanniang.

216
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,400
Yet the Yan family swapped her

217
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,640
with Yan Liuniang on purpose.

218
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:29,920
Yan Liuniang has been promoted

219
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,160
to the Chief Director
of the Ministry of Justice.

220
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,640
The Yan family obviously

221
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,600
had an ulterior motive.

222
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,200
Does Yan Liuniang

223
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,800
truly work for Prince Xian?

224
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,040
Empress Dowager.

225
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,480
Please allow me to say something.

226
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,680
Yan Liuniang

227
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,640
is my niece.

228
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:49,880
I know that

229
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,760
she has always wanted to become

230
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,800
a female official who solves cases.

231
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:56,040
She was married to Shen Du by mistake,

232
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,880
but her heart remained sincere

233
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,040
without a trace of malice.

234
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,560
I beg for your discernment.

235
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,440
Jinzang.

236
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,440
This is the first time

237
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,760
you have commented on court affairs

238
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,440
ever since I allowed you
to play music in my palace.

239
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,920
I apologize.

240
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,360
Minister Lai.

241
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,200
Did you come here

242
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:24,280
in the middle of the night
just to talk about Yan Xing?

243
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,960
If there is anything else,

244
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,840
tell me at once.

245
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,880
I also learned that

246
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,120
a nursery rhyme

247
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,120
suddenly started spreading in Xiang'an,

248
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,600
which sounded highly inappropriate.

249
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,080
A nursery rhyme?

250
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,640
Red porridge with dates.

251
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:40,600
Five feet from the sky.

252
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,000
Citrus and persimmon cakes.

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,520
Difficult for a child to grasp.

254
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,720
Do not speak carelessly.

255
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:45,840
Who permitted this?

256
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,040
The old lady frowns upon it.

257
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,520
Salt shall rise.

258
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,880
Madam Xu is clever.

259
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:52,040
You must have figured out the problem.

260
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:54,320
This nursery rhyme targets the Empress Dowager.

261
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,400
Five feet from the sky.

262
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,560
Difficult for a child to grasp.

263
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,840
This is clearly disrespectful

264
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,120
to Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

265
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,760
Outrageous!

266
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,880
This nursery rhyme didn't just spring up.

267
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,079
Someone must have plotted this.

268
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,640
Please tell me what to do.

269
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,680
Can you find out

270
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:20,560
who is spreading such rumors?

271
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,560
The rumors spread from mouth to mouth.

272
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:25,920
It's hard to find the source.

273
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,080
All these years…

274
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,920
All these years, I have

275
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,400
dedicated myself to the cause
of the Xiao family's empire,

276
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,320
yet there are always people who think

277
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,240
that I did it for my selfish desires.

278
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:51,360
They bewitch people

279
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,720
with such a nursery rhyme.

280
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,600
It's truly detestable.

281
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,800
The Imperial Inspectorate will investigate it

282
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,840
and help Your Majesty

283
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,640
find this evil mastermind.

284
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,880
But…

285
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:05,480
What's wrong?

286
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,880
But this nursery rhyme adopts the tune

287
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,240
of the song newly composed

288
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,320
and performed by Mr. Jin
at the Winter Solstice feast

289
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,520
at Prince Xian's mansion.

290
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,712
"Joy and Sorrow".

291
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,880
I beg for your discernment.

292
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,160
I composed this piece,

293
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:28,040
inspired by the Winter Solstice.

294
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:29,760
Indeed, it was first performed

295
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,640
at the feast,

296
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,960
but it did not have lyrics,

297
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,000
let alone disloyal intentions.

298
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,240
What if the listeners

299
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,520
harbored ill will

300
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,960
although the player didn't?

301
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,720
The last line of that nursery rhyme says,

302
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:43,880
"The old lady frowns upon it.

303
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Salt shall rise."

304
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,760
"Salty" sounds just like "Xian".

305
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:49,320
I'm afraid it refers to Prince Xian.

306
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,000
Summon Prince Xuan.

307
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,000
Mother Empress.

308
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,280
I am unaware of it.

309
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,360
I am innocent.

310
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:08,040
I first heard "Joy and Sorrow"
on the feast and paid no further attention

311
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,160
to it.

312
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,160
I had no idea that

313
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,000
someone would compose lyrics

314
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,800
to insinuate you.

315
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,960
I don't believe

316
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,400
it was done by Mr. Jin

317
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
or instigated by Prince Xian.

318
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,120
But Mr. Jin just performed

319
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,200
the song at Prince Xian's mansion,

320
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,480
and someone immediately spread it

321
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,360
with disrespectful lyrics.

322
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:26,920
What's more,

323
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:28,680
the ending line implies

324
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,560
that Prince Xian is seeking greater power.

325
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,080
Please discern the truth.

326
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:39,120
Someone is using this nursery rhyme

327
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,960
to sow discord between you and me

328
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,080
and even to kill me, Mother Empress.

329
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
Empress Dowager.

330
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
Seditious words bewitch the people.

331
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,000
If we allow this

332
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,280
to carry on,

333
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,280
it would at least

334
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,800
harm Prince Xian and Mr. Jin.

335
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,320
At worst, people with evil intentions

336
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,320
may accuse Prince Xian

337
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,840
of plotting a usurpation.

338
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,960
Empress Dowager, please allow me

339
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:05,040
to arrest all the guests

340
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,080
at the feast in Prince Xian's mansion

341
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,240
for a thorough investigation.

342
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,160
This matter

343
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:19,920
arose from the feast

344
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,520
held by Prince Xian.

345
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:24,240
From now on,

346
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,720
Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong,

347
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,560
will be placed under house arrest.

348
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,680
Jinzang, who composed the song,

349
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:35,800
shall await trial under the custody
of the Imperial Inspectorate.

350
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:41,080
The other musicians who attended the banquet

351
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,640
shall be investigated by

352
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:46,696
the Imperial Inspectorate.

353
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:51,112
Yes, Your Majesty.

354
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,000
Great Chief, Madam.

355
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,440
Madam Xu sent a confidential letter.

356
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
What happened?

357
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,200
Things changed last night.

358
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,440
Be very careful.

359
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,600
Don't let the Shen and Yan families

360
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,960
go through what had happened.

361
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,000
Help!

362
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,280
- Go.
- Help!

363
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,560
Save me, master.

364
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,120
Master, save me.

365
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,440
Hurry up.

366
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,560
Get Liuniang.

367
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,800
Get Great Chief.

368
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,880
Find Liuniang

369
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,240
and the Great Chief.

370
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,846
Hurry up!

371
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:44,880
[Yan Mansion]

372
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,320
Find them

373
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,160
to help me!

374
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,880
Hurry. Inform Liuniang.

375
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,840
Hurry. Close the door.

376
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,400
Close the door.

377
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,152
Get in.

378
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,888
Zang.

379
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:21,080
What happened?

380
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,360
My sister.

381
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,184
Zang.

382
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,520
What happened?

383
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,440
- Go.
- Zang.

384
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:34,120
- Hurry up. Behave.
- No.

385
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,560
- No.
- Go.

386
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,000
- Zang.
- Hurry up.

387
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,840
Father.

388
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,880
What happened?

389
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,160
Why did they arrest my mother?

390
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:56,120
Liuniang, your mother was arrested by

391
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,280
the Imperial Inspectorate.

392
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,320
Your uncle Jinzang is accused

393
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,040
of colluding with Prince Xian for a usurpation

394
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,000
and the whole clan will be implicated.

395
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,520
My uncle is just a musician.

396
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:04,840
How could he plot a usurpation?

397
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,800
No way. It's a setup.

398
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,640
Liuniang, calm down.

399
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Lady Jin may have been arrested,

400
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,440
but the Yan family hasn't been implicated.

401
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,560
The Imperial Inspectorate

402
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,560
wouldn't

403
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,560
go after you just yet.

404
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,200
The Yan family hasn't been implicated.

405
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,920
That's right, Father.

406
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,160
Mother is from the Jin family,

407
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,360
but she has married into the Yan family.

408
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,000
It shouldn't have affected her.

409
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:31,000
They have no reason to arrest her.

410
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,760
Those people are like

411
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,800
the soul reapers from the underworld.

412
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,440
How can we reason with them?

413
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,480
They just arrest

414
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,800
whoever they want to arrest.

415
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:47,920
No.

416
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,000
It's not that they are unreasonable.

417
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,240
You didn't dare to reason with them, did you?

418
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,480
Father, Mother.

419
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:56,520
You let the Imperial Inspectorate

420
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,440
arrest my mother for no reason,

421
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,680
without stepping up

422
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,360
to ask a question, right?

423
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,680
Fine.

424
00:24:10,680 --> 00:24:12,400
You all fear the Black Fiend.

425
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,120
I don't. I'll save her if you don't.

426
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,120
Liuniang.

427
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,488
Liuniang.

428
00:24:30,016 --> 00:24:31,280
Liuniang.

429
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:33,240
Chuichui.

430
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:35,080
There you are.

431
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,120
The Great Chief

432
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,080
sent Jing Lin to convey the message that

433
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,760
he would meet with the Empress Dowager

434
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,400
to plead for the Jin family.

435
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,120
Stiffy Jiang and I split up to look for you.

436
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:46,880
I thought I could find you here.

437
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,080
Chuichui, thank you.

438
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,800
But Prince Xian is involved.

439
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
It's very tricky.

440
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,560
It's not enough to have Shen Du's help.

441
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:57,760
Go back first. I'll meet Prime Minister Zhang.

442
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,680
Okay, be careful.

443
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:26,280
Stiffy Jiang, is that you?

444
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,344
Lai Luozhi.

445
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,320
Are you disappointed

446
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,680
that it's me?

447
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,800
I…

448
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,480
I have a date with Jiang Langxing.

449
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,720
He will be coming soon.

450
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,600
Jiang Langxing.

451
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,160
Jiang Langxing.

452
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,200
Is he the only one

453
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
you care about now?

454
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,000
So obedient.

455
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,336
How nice.

456
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,360
The Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice

457
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,920
is here to meet Prime Minister Zhang.

458
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,840
Mrs. Shen, our lord is not home today.

459
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,240
I have asked around.

460
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,520
He's shut himself in

461
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,080
ever since what happened.

462
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,680
He didn't even go to court today.

463
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,800
The Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice,

464
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,360
[Zhang Mansion]
wife of the Great Chief,

465
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:47,080
the sixth daughter of Mr. Yan,

466
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:50,160
is here to meet Prime Minister Zhang.

467
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,760
Mrs. Shen, please don't
make things hard for us.

468
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,240
I won't.

469
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,080
I will just wait here.

470
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,320
In a day or two,

471
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,720
he's bound to come out, right?

472
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,240
Surely, Prime Minister Zhang
wouldn't take the back door

473
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:04,880
or sneak through the dog hole

474
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,360
just to avoid me, right?

475
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,840
I knew I couldn't

476
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,680
easily get rid of you.

477
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,600
If I do not come out,

478
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,440
are you going to turn my mansion

479
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,880
upside down?

480
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:30,360
Prime Minister Zhang,
please save the Jin family.

481
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,960
Stop pushing me.

482
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,400
I can't help you

483
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,240
with what you're asking.

484
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,440
My lord,

485
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,840
you are the Prime Minister

486
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,080
and the chief counselor.

487
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,560
The Jin family suffers injustice.

488
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,040
You can't ignore this.

489
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,040
Since you have the Empress Dowager's tablet,

490
00:27:51,040 --> 00:27:54,240
why do you seek my help but not hers?

491
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,960
I am just a minor official

492
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,680
to the Empress Dowager.

493
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:00,960
I would be

494
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,960
overestimating myself to believe that

495
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:05,680
I can interfere with court affairs.

496
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:08,960
Since you understand that,

497
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,160
then how come

498
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,920
you don't get why Lai Luozhi

499
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:15,600
is blaming this on Mr. Jin?

500
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,680
It's because of me?

501
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,720
This is happening because

502
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,440
you are both married to Shen Du and working as

503
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,520
the Chief Director

504
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,680
of the Ministry of Justice

505
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,840
who keeps causing trouble.

506
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,120
Of course.

507
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:32,280
It's not just that.

508
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,360
It is said that

509
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,760
on the night of the Winter Solstice,

510
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:37,680
Lai Luozhi reported to the Empress Dowager

511
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:40,680
that you were sent by me

512
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,560
to win over Shen Du

513
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,520
and serve Prince Xian in the power struggle.

514
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:47,840
Mr. Jin refuted him and defied

515
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,720
the Empress Dowager right on the spot.

516
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:57,000
My uncle

517
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,120
defied the Empress Dowager for me?

518
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,000
Our laws forbid

519
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,040
palace attendants and musicians

520
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,160
from discussing court affairs.

521
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,280
Violation is met with the death penalty.

522
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,200
But Jinzang

523
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:11,760
grew arrogant from favoritism.

524
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,840
He overestimated himself.

525
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:18,000
Uncle wasn't arrogant from favoritism.

526
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,560
Nor did he overestimate himself.

527
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,600
He did that because he's my uncle.

528
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,000
He sees me as his family.

529
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,520
He'd rather risk his life

530
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,400
than see me in trouble.

531
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,040
Liuniang.

532
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:32,880
All these years,

533
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,280
I've been using you people

534
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:36,480
instead of caring for you.

535
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,800
But regarding this matter,

536
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,000
I've said all that can be said.

537
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,240
Between Prince Xian and the Jin family,

538
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,280
I have no choice.

539
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,680
Back then,

540
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,560
were you faced with

541
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,360
the same choices regarding

542
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,920
the Shen family's case?

543
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:29,576
My lord.

544
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,520
Prince Xian is under house arrest.

545
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:41,320
And yet I've remained silent.

546
00:30:41,320 --> 00:30:43,280
Do you know why?

547
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,280
No, I don't.

548
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,880
I've watched Prince Xian grow up.

549
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:52,360
My feelings for Prince Xian

550
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,600
are just like those

551
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,520
of Jinzang for Yan Xing.

552
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:58,360
Of course, I wish to risk myself

553
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:01,200
to get Prince Xian out of this.

554
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,840
About the nursery rhyme,

555
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,040
I know very well that

556
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:09,240
Prince Xian has no heart for usurpation.

557
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,520
The Empress Dowager knows that as well.

558
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:16,120
But she is not

559
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:19,160
just a mother,

560
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,520
but also the Empress Dowager

561
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,680
of Dacang.

562
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,480
If I step forward,

563
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,960
then my disciples will

564
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,760
follow my footsteps

565
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,440
and file petitions to the Empress Dowager,

566
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,960
urging her to release Prince Xian.

567
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,920
The more pressure we apply,

568
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:46,694
the more we push Prince Xian to a dead end.

569
00:31:46,694 --> 00:31:50,160
[Ministry of Justice]

570
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,608
Chuichui.

571
00:31:52,608 --> 00:31:54,320
What's wrong? What's the rush?

572
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,680
Has Chuichui come back?

573
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,720
Didn't she go out

574
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,080
with you earlier?

575
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,600
We split up to look for Yan Xing.

576
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,200
Hasn't she returned yet?

577
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,280
Then maybe

578
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,000
she found Director Yan

579
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,560
and went off for fun somewhere.

580
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,080
Why don't you just

581
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,080
ask Director Yan?

582
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,320
- Alright.
- Ask--

583
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,080
Why would he bother

584
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,280
Director Yan?

585
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,600
What's wrong, my lord?

586
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,360
Director Yan…

587
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,320
Her maiden family is in deep trouble.

588
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
The Jin family was suspected

589
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,120
of inciting Prince Xian to plot a usurpation

590
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,760
and was arrested by the Imperial Inspectorate.

591
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,240
Right.

592
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,840
Do not bother Director Yan

593
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,960
no matter what.

594
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,000
Director Wu, you're right.

595
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
I'll look for her by myself.

596
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,120
I take my leave.

597
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,800
Be careful.

598
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,600
Where am I?

599
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:24,280
People call me the Black Fiend.

600
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,640
So perhaps,

601
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,000
this is the Underworld.

602
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,120
What do you want?

603
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,360
Are you going to kill me?

604
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,200
The eighteen levels of inferno

605
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:47,400
are meant for others.

606
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,080
Even if you truly arrive
at the Underworld one day,

607
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:52,800
I will light up the bones as lamps

608
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,120
and burn the evil spirits

609
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:56,960
to illuminate this Palace of Death

610
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:01,520
and make it as cozy as home for you.

611
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:06,120
You can't escape.

612
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,600
Why are you scared?

613
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,159
I

614
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:39,840
will not hurt you.

615
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:48,296
Chuichui.

616
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,159
Look around.

617
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,360
Look.

618
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,719
What do you think? Do you like it?

619
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:10,920
This is…

620
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,160
I heard you liked the betrothal gifts

621
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:19,360
Jiang Langxing sent to you.

622
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:26,120
It turned out you like these things.

623
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,040
So I bought everything

624
00:35:28,040 --> 00:35:30,680
a girl may like

625
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,120
or may be used

626
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:34,240
as betrothal gifts

627
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,080
from the streets.

628
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,240
What do you think?

629
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,440
What do you want?

630
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,960
Propose to you, of course.

631
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
Propose to me?

632
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,040
I'll ask your parents

633
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:47,920
to marry you off to me.

634
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,840
What are you talking about?

635
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,960
I am engaged to Jiang Langxing.

636
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,280
I am going to marry him.

637
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,840
What's so good about

638
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,000
that stiffy inspector?

639
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,000
Whatever he offers,

640
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,640
I can give you ten times of it.

641
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,960
It's not about that.

642
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:06,640
I have agreed to marry him.

643
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:15,080
So what?

644
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:18,240
You can get a divorce even if you're married.

645
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,640
If you feel sorry for him,

646
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,520
I can compensate him on your behalf.

647
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,760
I can kill Xu Xiangren

648
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,320
and make him the Marshal of Inspectors

649
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,960
as long as he wants me to.

650
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:39,040
Don't be ridiculous.

651
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,200
Fine.

652
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,880
I'll do as you say.

653
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,560
How come you just don't get it?

654
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:52,040
Jiang Langxing and I

655
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,600
like each other.

656
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,200
We like each other, too.

657
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,840
I like you so dearly.

658
00:36:56,840 --> 00:36:59,360
I've never cared for a woman so much before.

659
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,680
But I don't like you.

660
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:03,960
You're lying. You obviously like me too.

661
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,960
Didn't you call me Mr. Mask

662
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,480
and consider me a good friend?

663
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,560
Besides…

664
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,640
Besides, our mothers
are buried in the same place.

665
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,440
This is fate.

666
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,920
The affection between friends

667
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,480
is different from that between a couple.

668
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,760
I have no feelings for you.

669
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,840
No way.

670
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:21,880
You will find out

671
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,320
that I'm right very soon.

672
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,440
Let go of me.

673
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,640
It's okay.

674
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:02,480
I can wait.

675
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,640
One day,

676
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,960
you will fall in love with me.

677
00:39:27,837 --> 00:39:30,040
[Imperial Inspectorate]

678
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,120
Stop right there.

679
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,160
The Jin's case

680
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,880
is assigned to the Imperial Inspectorate.

681
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,720
The Ministry of Justice
has no right to intervene.

682
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,360
Director Yan, please go back.

683
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,384
Hold on.

684
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,760
Vice Minister Lai.

685
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,120
Mrs. Shen.

686
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,120
There is an easy way

687
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,680
to save your family.

688
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,560
File a lawsuit

689
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,080
against Shen Du

690
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:53,120
for framing the Jin family.

691
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,960
Then I will clear your name

692
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,600
and save your family.

693
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,720
Please stop

694
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,080
teasing me for fun.

695
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:05,080
You want me to frame my husband.

696
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,400
No way.

697
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,240
I didn't know

698
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,600
that the woman who had

699
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,920
married into the Shen family as a spy

700
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,720
ended up deeply in love

701
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,120
with Great Chief Shen.

702
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:18,840
Vice Minister Lai,

703
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,400
you can stop using that

704
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,720
as leverage.

705
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:22,840
I've clarified it

706
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:25,600
with my husband and Prime Minister Zhang.

707
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,360
I have a clear conscience.

708
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,040
I haven't done anything wrong.

709
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:31,280
I've worked hard

710
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,880
in the Ministry of Justice,

711
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,880
striving to look for the truth

712
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,080
and do people justice.

713
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:39,160
We're talking about Shen Du, my husband.

714
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,960
But even if we're talking about a stranger,

715
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,040
I, Yan Liuniang,

716
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,480
would never do anything

717
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,040
to disgrace the title I uphold.

718
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,440
Mrs. Shen, you don't have to talk tough.

719
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:51,360
One day,

720
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,360
you will comply.

721
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,120
Director Yan, please go back.

722
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,680
Please.

723
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,144
Liuniang.

724
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,840
You're back.

725
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,416
Liuniang.

726
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,560
The Empress Dowager didn't change her mind.

727
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:55,920
I will think of something else.

728
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:58,480
I've guessed as much.

729
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,560
I went to see Prime Minister Zhang today

730
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,880
and came to understand

731
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:04,280
Her Majesty's difficult situation.

732
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:07,320
I wasn't there in person,

733
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,640
but I could imagine how it happened.

734
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:11,480
If Lai Luozhi managed

735
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,600
to pin

736
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,400
those charges on Prince Xian,

737
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:18,120
then it wouldn't just be
a catastrophe for the Jin family.

738
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,040
The court will see turbulences

739
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:22,200
and a power struggle.

740
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,320
Who knows how many families

741
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:30,320
will be annihilated?

742
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:32,440
I will figure something out.

743
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:37,320
Tomorrow,

744
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,360
the Imperial Inspectorate will parade the Jins

745
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,360
through the streets.

746
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,920
We may have a chance afterward.

747
00:43:14,871 --> 00:43:18,689
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

748
00:43:18,689 --> 00:43:22,366
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

749
00:43:22,366 --> 00:43:27,063
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

750
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,007
♫ We are forever bound ♫

751
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:33,462
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

752
00:43:33,462 --> 00:43:37,009
♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫

753
00:43:37,009 --> 00:43:41,983
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

754
00:43:41,983 --> 00:43:44,927
