[Episode 24]

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:43,200
The embroidery on your clothes

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,040
is really exquisite.

17
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,400
I wonder which young lady

18
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,400
embroidered this peach blossom pattern

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,640
at the neckline for you.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,360
Please don't make fun of me.

21
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,720
I just ordered this ready-made garment

22
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,800
with this pattern because I like peach blossom.

23
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,360
I see.

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,080
No wonder it looks so familiar.

25
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,400
It turns out that

26
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,440
I've seen this pattern

27
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,800
in a clothes shop.

28
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,160
This is indeed a trendy style this year.

29
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,360
If I remember correctly,

30
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,880
this set of clothes comes with an overcoat.

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,600
Why aren't you wearing it?

32
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,560
I must have forgotten it somewhere

33
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,400
because I was too busy tonight.

34
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,680
You were indeed busy tonight.

35
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,880
It's normal to make mistakes in the rush.

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:50,920
Then what is this powder?

37
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,080
If I'm right about the scent,

38
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,840
this must be the Mandragora powder

39
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,960
we've heard about.

40
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,280
I-I have never heard of

41
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,680
any Mandragora powder.

42
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:04,640
I don't know why it would be on me.

43
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,400
My lord, please look into it.

44
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,600
The abduction of Miss Du

45
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,720
has nothing to do with me.

46
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,000
Nothing to do with you?

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,672
Mr. Jing.

48
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,560
Xu Jize, we found this overcoat on the road.

49
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,968
It's yours, isn't it?

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,080
Are you going to say

51
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:35,640
that this overcoat isn't yours?

52
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,200
You threw away your overcoat

53
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,440
in panic during the escape,

54
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,520
but you didn't realize

55
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,440
that the silver thread on the collar

56
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,440
had caught your undershirt.

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:47,680
You also forgot about

58
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,440
the Mandragora powder

59
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,960
inside the inner pocket of your overcoat.

60
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,520
And there is also residue

61
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:56,360
on your undershirt.

62
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,160
Xu Jize.

63
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,520
You're a repeat offender

64
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,720
of drugging the brides.

65
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,640
You are the mastermind of the abduction

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,680
and you killed your accomplice.

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,920
No.

68
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,560
It's not like that.

69
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,600
I didn't kill anyone.

70
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,400
I swear I didn't kill anyone.

71
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,120
My lord, I did drug the bride.

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,560
I lusted after her beauty.

73
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,920
But… But my lord,

74
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,120
I didn't kill anyone.

75
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,760
What a shameless scoundrel.

76
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,280
You're full of lies.

77
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,120
Senior Clerk Yan, say no more.

78
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,040
Put him on the clamps.

79
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,600
Understood.

80
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,080
Governor Mo, allow me--

81
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,920
No, no.

82
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,240
My lord.

83
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,800
I confess.

84
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,760
I'll confess everything!

85
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,640
Confess everything you've done tonight

86
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,560
without holding back.

87
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,600
I used to be pedantic,

88
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,160
believing that one could only
find beauty in books.

89
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,360
But once I became a wedding host,

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,560
I suddenly realized

91
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,480
that I could enjoy real beauty
outside of the books.

92
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,280
With just some powder,

93
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,600
the brides from those noble families

94
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,360
could all become my beauties.

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,480
Because it is something too shameful

96
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,280
to talk about,

97
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:45,120
so I succeed most of the time,

98
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,120
and no one ever speaks of it.

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,960
So why did you target

100
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,960
Miss Du this time?

101
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,600
I don't have many hobbies.

102
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,040
I just like beautiful women.

103
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,120
I have long heard of

104
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,320
Miss Du's beauty.

105
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:02,440
How could I miss the chance

106
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,640
to spend some time with

107
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,360
the beauty of Yingzhou?

108
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,880
What was the name

109
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,480
of the deceased,

110
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,440
who was also your accomplice?

111
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:14,680
How did you know him?

112
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
He was just a hooligan.

113
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,920
I only know him

114
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,240
as Er Laipi.

115
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,520
He was an orphan

116
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:25,160
and had been in jail for burglary.

117
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:27,040
Before the man in black arrived,

118
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,720
you were already arguing.

119
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,760
About what?

120
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:39,640
I decided to stop the criminal act

121
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,120
and send Miss Du back.

122
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,960
No, I was mistaken.

123
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,040
Let her go.

124
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,600
Are you kidding me?

125
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,720
What's done is done. You have to do it now.

126
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
I said I was mistaken. Let her go.

127
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,360
You--

128
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,080
But we suddenly heard something.

129
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,160
I'll take a look.

130
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:59,480
I suspected that we were being followed

131
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,720
and stopped arguing.

132
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,200
Er Laipi stayed

133
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:04,200
to hide Miss Du

134
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
in the cellar.

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,160
I went to look around.

136
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,960
There was nothing.

137
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:11,280
Maybe it was a stray cat.

138
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,320
Er Laipi.

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,440
I didn't see anything

140
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,080
apart from a stray cat in the bushes.

141
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,640
Perhaps the cat made the noise.

142
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,920
I was scared witless.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,240
I was scared the killer

144
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,120
would come back to kill me.

145
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:26,360
So I ran away.

146
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,520
Xu Jize.

147
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,920
Are there any other witnesses

148
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,160
who can testify

149
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,560
to what you've said?

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,200
In that case,

151
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,080
how can you prove that you didn't kill him

152
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,560
because you had a fallout?

153
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,040
If I had fought with Er Laipi,

154
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:48,120
he would certainly have won.

155
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,120
How can I possibly

156
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,000
manage to kill him?

157
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,120
My lord.

158
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,240
Please look into it.

159
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,360
I will certainly investigate

160
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,520
the case of Er Laipi

161
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,240
before giving the verdict.

162
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,880
But there is solid evidence in Miss Du's case.

163
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,320
Guards.

164
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:05,400
Take the prisoner Xu Jize into custody.

165
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:06,480
Understood.

166
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:09,128
Let's go.

167
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,680
What?

168
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:47,600
Won't you rest after such a long night?

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,880
Is the fearless Senior Clerk Yan so scared

170
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,920
to share a bed with her husband?

171
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,960
I do want to rest.

172
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,440
But I can't stop thinking
about the case when I lie down.

173
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,040
The case was solved smoothly.

174
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,520
But I just feel that there are hidden stories.

175
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,200
Smoothly?

176
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,920
We chased the killer until midnight.

177
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,480
It took a long time

178
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,280
and a little torture for him to confess.

179
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,440
I'm not just referring to the bride's case.

180
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,880
Even if this case is closed,

181
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,480
the abductor Er Laipi is dead.

182
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:18,480
There's a new murder case.

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
Er Laipi was a burglar.

184
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,520
I bet he had quite a few

185
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,400
enemies in Yingzhou.

186
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,680
What kind of enemy

187
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,360
would make the murder a mystery

188
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,400
by gouging out

189
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,640
his eyes after killing him?

190
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,440
Did the murderer happen to be there

191
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,800
or was it well planned?

192
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
You can't figure it out just yet.

193
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,400
Rest first.

194
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,040
I told you I couldn't sleep.

195
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,800
Among Er Laipi's acquaintances,

196
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,920
the major suspect must be…

197
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:50,800
Since you're so energetic,

198
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,840
let's do something else.

199
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,400
What…

200
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,600
What do you want?

201
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,280
Something a couple should do, naturally.

202
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,600
A-Are…

203
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,520
Are you crazy?

204
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,600
People call me the White Ghost

205
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:22,680
who always keeps

206
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,480
his promises.

207
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,320
How come my wife

208
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,160
calls me crazy?

209
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,000
What did you give me?

210
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,120
A sleeping pill.

211
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,880
It will help you fall asleep.

212
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,560
Sweet dreams to you, honey.

213
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,520
Great Chief.

214
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,640
Great Chief.

215
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,400
A letter from Xiang'an.

216
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,440
What's the rush?

217
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,080
My wife was about to rest.

218
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:02,000
I didn't let you in.

219
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,400
Please forgive me.

220
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,800
But you said that letters from

221
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,000
this person are a top priority.

222
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,000
Urgent letter from Xiang'an?

223
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Who sent it?

224
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,432
Madam Xu.

225
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,880
There's nothing fancy.

226
00:11:41,664 --> 00:11:42,920
[Xu Wan to Shen Du]

227
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:45,080
Want to read it first?

228
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,160
No, no.

229
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,400
I don't want to read your love letters.

230
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,680
I'm going to sleep.

231
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,480
There's nothing between

232
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:56,360
Madam Xu and me.

233
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,920
Besides, I'm in love with

234
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,120
someone else.

235
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,256
Yan Xing.

236
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,080
The pill kicked in just at the right time.

237
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:08,760
We are Half-faced Demons.

238
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:11,840
When will you find my head?

239
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,640
Give me your head.

240
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,064
Who's there?

241
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,480
Who is it?

242
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,760
Come out.

243
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:24,760
Eyes.

244
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,120
My eyes.

245
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,288
No.

246
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,240
This is

247
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,960
the gray messenger pigeon.

248
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,120
The gray messenger pigeon came.

249
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,640
It means that there are informants

250
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,240
of Empress Dowager in Yingzhou
who can't show up.

251
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,200
So they reminded me with the pigeon

252
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,640
to report to Her Majesty.

253
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:09,480
Sister.

254
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,760
Did you bring this pigeon?

255
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,960
So you're--

256
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,160
No, I saw this gray messenger pigeon

257
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,400
flying into your courtyard

258
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,040
and wouldn't leave.

259
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,080
Sister.

260
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,600
Do you know the legend?

261
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:27,320
It brings you luck if a gray messenger pigeon

262
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,720
settles in your home.

263
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,960
We must keep it.

264
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,560
So I rushed to the main street

265
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:33,280
and bought a birdcage for you.

266
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:35,592
I see.

267
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,520
So you came to bring me the birdcage.

268
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,720
One more thing.

269
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,920
We ran out of deer antlers.

270
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:45,000
But Gannandao lacks herbal medicine.

271
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,160
I went to the Guangchun Clinic,
which is the biggest,

272
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:49,680
but they haven't heard of deer antlers.

273
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,120
They only have Cistanche.

274
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,520
We might have to get it from somewhere else.

275
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,360
They have Cistanche?

276
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
It may be less effective,

277
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,080
but it works as a substitute.

278
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,720
The shopkeeper would sell me the last bit,

279
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:01,120
but I didn't buy it.

280
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,760
Take me there now. Let's get some.

281
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:04,968
Okay.

282
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,560
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

283
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,648
[Guangchun Clinic]
Be careful.

284
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:31,040
Big clinics surely have good business.

285
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,280
They even have to use
huge pots to boil medicine.

286
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,040
These are not for boiling medicine.

287
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,800
I think they're used for storing herbs.

288
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:40,600
Right, Yeyun.

289
00:15:40,600 --> 00:15:42,320
I asked you to keep an eye

290
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,520
on the governor's mansion.

291
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,520
Anyone suspicious?

292
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:45,720
I take the task

293
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,040
you entrust to me seriously.

294
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,360
I didn't find anyone suspicious.

295
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:53,320
But I did hear about a suspicious place.

296
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,640
I heard there's a secluded courtyard

297
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,400
that nobody is allowed to enter.

298
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,360
But Governor Mo visits it very often.

299
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,640
There are such blooming peonies

300
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,600
in the freezing weather of Yingzhou.

301
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,800
Pink peonies.

303
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,184
Alright.

00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,000

[Jade-like Faint Clouds]

with a lot of snow in winter.

308
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,400
You set up a warm room for flowers.

309
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:39,480
It must have cost you a great effort.

What did the women and children
of the Shen family do wrong?

from the death penalty because of you.

363
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,840
That's how I made it into the detention center.

There is no need to dwell on that.

and he treated me like his own.

369

00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,000
my father's reputation for a bright future.

380
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,784
Senior.

381
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:07,000
If you had known about this,

382
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,960
would you have regretted it?

383
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,000
Looking back,

384
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,880
I have many things I regret.

385
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,080
But I have never

386
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,680
regretted saving you.

387
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,160
You had no choice

388
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,120
but to do what you did.

389
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,160
My late mentor

390
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,600
would surely understand.

391
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,240
Your mother

392
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,880
"drove you out" of the house

393
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,000
only as an act for those scoundrels
who were watching.

394
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,880
She did that

395
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,400
to protect her only child.

396
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,040
Senior.

397
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:51,320
You really don't blame me?

398
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,800
Do you recognize this flower?

399
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,976
Yes.

400
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,560
It's Xiuxiu's favorite "Child's Face".

401
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,120
Where are we going?

402
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:24,320
Hurry up.

403
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
See, Brother Du is the best, after all.

404
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,560
He grew the "Child's Face" for me.

405
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,920
Du.

406
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,200
You're going to spoil Mo Xiuxiu.

407
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,560
It's hard to grow

408
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:40,880
one "Child's Face"

409
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,280
out of ten peonies.

410
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:43,480
Other young ladies

411
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,280
are happy to wear peonies on their heads.

412
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:47,480
But you have to ask for "Child's Face".

413
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:50,120
What's wrong? I just love "Child's Face".

414
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,440
Brother Du.

415
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,120
This one I'm wearing will wither in a few days.

416
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:57,000
Remember to get me the best one then.

417
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,320
Rest assured, I have picked one for you

418
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,920
and I'll cut it in a few days.

419
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,200
After Xiuxiu left,

420
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,560
I built this small courtyard
full of peonies for her.

421
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Only then did I realize

422
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,560
how difficult it was

423
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:13,760
for you to grow

424
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,080
"Child's Face" back then.

425
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:22,800
Du, how could I blame you?

426
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,040
I was only glad.

427
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:27,360
I'm glad that you assessed the situation

428
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,680
and survived.

429
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,840
Then there is one more person like me

430
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,760
who cherishes Xiuxiu

431
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,560
and remembers her.

432
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,600
Life is unpredictable.

433
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,000
I did not expect that

434
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,520
I would never see Xiuxiu again

435
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:50,240
after we parted in the Imperial City.

436
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,680
If Xiuxiu were still alive,

437
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,880
she would be the same age as Miss Du now.

438
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:06,888
Senior.

439
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,040
I've been scared to ask you.

440
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,680
How did Xiuxiu die?

441
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,360
I didn't take care of her.

442
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,800
She died of illness
due to poor acclimatization.

443
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:38,080
Xiuxiu.

444
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,680
I remember now.

445
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,360
The rattan piglet and the letter

446
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,800
were gifts from Mo Xiuxiu.

447
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,320
That's why he kept them for so long.

448
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:57,080
Mo Xiuxiu.

449
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,520
What were you writing?

450
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,680
Master, you scared them.

451
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,480
It's nothing.

452
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,880
Keep practicing.

453
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:14,240
It seems these children

454
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,360
haven't gotten over

455
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,880
the trauma of being kidnapped.

456
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,360
Du.

457
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,920
Go find some rattan.

458
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:25,032
Alright.

459
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,560
Master.

460
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,680
My lord.

461
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,680
Let's call it

462
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,320
a day now.

463
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,520
Understood.

464
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,160
Kids.

465
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,240
I'm going to

466
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,920
teach you

467
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,120
how to make small animals with rattan, okay?

468
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,624
Okay.

469
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,880
Brother, am I doing it right?

470
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,080
Brother.

471
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,720
Help me get started, please.

472
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:32,240
You're so good.

473
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:33,680
I also want to make one

474
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,680
as a birthday gift for Brother Du.

475
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,080
Can you swap with me?

476
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,320
Okay, take it.

477
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,720
Thank you.

478
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,360
What's your name?

479
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,800
Just call me Liuniang.

480
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,080
It was a gift

481
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,120
from Mo Xiuxiu.

482
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,880
That's why he has kept it for so long.

483
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:01,720
So the person he loves

484
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,720
is Mo Xiuxiu.

485
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,640
Why did you insist on meeting with me

486
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,960
in private today?

487
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,800
My family was wronged.

488
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:29,360
You knew what happened.

489
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,800
I was young back then

490
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,600
and there are things I don't remember.

491
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,520
I hope you can tell me in detail.

492
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,920
Great Chief.

493
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:41,040
It's been so many years.

494
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,280
You are a successful man

495
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:43,640
with a bright future.

496
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,440
Do not dwell on the past.

497
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,920
What do you mean?

498
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,280
Ordinary people couldn't have

499
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,280
endured the torment in the detention center.

500
00:28:56,280 --> 00:28:57,880
Du.

501
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,760
You have made it out alive.

502
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:03,040
So don't think about seeking revenge.

503
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,360
I'm not seeking revenge.

504
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:09,120
I'm merely seeking

505
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,960
the truth for my family.

506
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,120
You have won the Empress Dowager's trust.

507
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,680
You have a bright future

508
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,880
as long as you play safe.

509
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,400
Do you truly have the courage

510
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,800
to give up everything you have now?

511
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,320
To reopen the old case,

512
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,520
you must give up everything you have now.

513
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,000
Do you think it's worth it?

514
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:43,960
Throughout history,

515
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,160
those who can

516
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,880
overturn old cases are invincible.

517
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,840
But you're married.

518
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,640
Can you truly disregard everything
and burn your boats

519
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,960
just for yourself?

520
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,960
I stand by what I said.

521
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:04,080
Do not dwell on the past.

522
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,120
Great Chief.

523
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,480
I've given you

524
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,680
the answer you want.

525
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,800
Great Chief,

526
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,632
please think twice.

527
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:21,399
♫ Through vast smoky waves,
groping in the darkness ♫

528
00:30:21,399 --> 00:30:26,634
♫ You pass by, igniting fireworks ♫

529
00:30:27,543 --> 00:30:34,583
♫ For karma's sake,
you fall silent and become an Asura ♫

530
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:41,239
♫ Love is elusive,
stinging you and scorching me ♫

531
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:45,958
♫ Along the way,
flowers bloom and fall, heavy rain pours ♫

532
00:30:45,958 --> 00:30:49,559
♫ Lights will intertwine ♫

533
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:55,202
♫ You are my final destination ♫

534
00:30:57,581 --> 00:31:06,528
[Jade-like Faint Clouds]

535
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,880
He does have a close tie

536
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
with Mo Qianzhi.

537
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,920
But no matter how you see it,

538
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,160
Mo Qianzhi is an upright and dutiful official.

539
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,560
Oh, pigeon.

540
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,240
How should I report to the Empress Dowager?

541
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
Master Sister.

542
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,160
"Master Sister"? What did I teach you?

543
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Show some manners.

544
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,640
I knew it.

545
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,400
My sister is boiling medicine so early.

546
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,880
Who deserves such a good wife

547
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,880
in the world?

548
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,720
It's rare to find someone like Madam

549
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,440
who fits our Great Chief.

550
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,080
A perfect match.

551
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,680
"A perfect match"?

552
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,680
Listen.

553
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,000
Your Great Chief is indeed a mighty leader,

554
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,880
but he doesn't quite make a good husband.

555
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,040
Unlike my sister.

556
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,720
She's the top female detective

557
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,920
and a role model of feminine virtue.

558
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,560
How come he is not a good husband?

559
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
Shut up. Do you want anything?

560
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,480
Leave me alone if you want to idle around.

561
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,680
Yeah.

562
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,960
Who says I want to idle around?

563
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,160
I want to know

564
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:10,840
how well it works with Cistanche

565
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,960
instead of the deer antler.

566
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,040
Does it work?

567
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:14,840
After all, it's just a cheap substitute.

568
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,000
If it won't do,

569
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,400
let Mr. Jing get some
from the neighboring county.

570
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:19,560
This is medicine

571
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,560
for his Great Chief.

572
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:21,800
He has to put in some effort.

573
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:23,160
Stop saying "his" Great Chief.

574
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,760
We're supporting you, okay?

575
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,840
You're training with us.

576
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:26,960
And I'm forced to accept

577
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:28,160
a substandard disciple.

578
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,440
Mr. Jing, I must inform you seriously.

579
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,440
I only want

580
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,520
one master, which is

581
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,440
Senior Clerk Yan Xing right here.

582
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:35,760
She's not taking me in

583
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,840
so I reluctantly

584
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,000
accepted you as my master.

585
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,880
Speak properly. "Reluctantly

586
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,800
- accepted me as a master"?
- You started it.

587
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:43,320
You think I want you as a disciple?

588
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,440
Speak properly.

589
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,480
Get out.

590
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,896
Make yourself clear.

591
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,720
Substitute.

592
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,440
Meeting an old acquaintance

593
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,320
on a foreign land,

594
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,880
a lonely man took a woman

595
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,000
as a substitute.

596
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:02,200
Perhaps the romance

597
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,000
that I've felt

598
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,120
was due to the fact that

599
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,520
I was Xiuxiu's substitute.

600
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:09,880
Yan Liuniang.

601
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:12,800
How do you have the time for this?

602
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:15,240
Liuniang.

603
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,680
You mean,

604
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,800
Governor Mo has agreed

605
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:19,920
to combine the cases

606
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,680
of the brides and the headless corpse.

607
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,920
Not completed.

608
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,160
But he agreed that I could
cross-check both corpses

609
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,280
after the initial checking

610
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,440
by the coroner.

611
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,800
Combining the cases is possible.

612
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,640
Will you join me for the autopsy?

613
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,480
Alright, let's go now.

614
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,840
Sister, I'll get your toolbox.

615
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,920
Here you go, sister.

616
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,320
Let's go.

617
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:47,904
Be careful.

618
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:55,200
[Carrying the sunshine and auspicious energy]

619
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,600
Sister seems to have a lot
to talk about with him.

620
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,040
Madam just finds you noisy.

621
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,040
You're noisy.

622
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,760
You're noisier.

623
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,480
You're the noisy one.

624
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,912
Kid.

625
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,360
No.

626
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:13,679
I can't let them talk.

627
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:18,536
Where are you going?

628
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,056
Kid.

629
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,440
Any thoughts
on the characteristics of the killer?

630
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,800
Not much.

631
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,120
But the entire Yingzhou is abuzz with it.

632
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,880
Everyone speaks with certainty

633
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:38,800
that the killer is the Half-faced Demon
widely known in Gannandao.

634
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,120
They say the Half-faced Demon

635
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,520
eats only one part of the human body at a time.

636
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,280
It does match the previous

637
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,480
two cases.

638
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,560
There are many rumors
about supernatural beings.

639
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,480
The common people are excused.

640
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,960
But you also believe in it

641
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,080
as the top detective?

642
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,880
I don't believe in ghosts and deities.

643
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:57,000
I just have respect for the rumors.

644
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,120
No matter where these rumors originate from,

645
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,880
there must be a reason they're spread

646
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,200
throughout the city.

647
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,360
Perhaps there is an expert behind it.

648
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,280
Or it reflects the local situation.

649
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,520
Do you still remember

650
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,520
what the rumor says?

651
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,040
The Half-faced Demon

652
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,040
attacks people when they're unconscious.

653
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,600
The victims wake up

654
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,760
only to find themselves
missing an arm or a leg.

655
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,640
Yeah, this is why we can't

656
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,840
get to the bottom of the cases

657
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:21,400
regarding the Half-faced Demons.

658
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,480
First, there is no threat to life.

659
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Second,

660
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,160
everyone fears ghosts and deities.

661
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,360
The victims are terrified

662
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,680
and dare not cooperate.

663
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,280
The matter ends up being dropped.

664
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:33,920
And these two bodies…

665
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,520
These two victims

666
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,920
were both beheaded

667
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,800
or had their eyes gouged out alive

668
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,600
and ended up dead.

669
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,960
Either the killer

670
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,720
was not the Half-faced Demon

671
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:47,920
or the killer failed

672
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,720
to imitate the demon properly.

673
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,680
Only you are brave enough to not fear

674
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,800
ghosts and deities

675
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,040
and dare to join me

676
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:01,400
in this muddy water.

677
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,000
What's there to respect about a murderer?

678
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,720
Be it a human or a ghost,

679
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,200
a murderer should pay the price.

680
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Even if it's an evil ghost

681
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,640
it should be up to us

682
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,120
to judge in place of King Yama.

683
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,520
You…

684
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,184
What's wrong?

685
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,840
There are bruises on the body.

686
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,960
These are external injuries

687
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:30,240
from falling into the cellar.

688
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,520
No internal injuries.

689
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,400
The cause of death
is an instantly shattered heart.

690
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,480
The corpse has turned purple

691
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,880
and shows signs of decay.

692
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,960
The shattered heart
accelerated the decay of the body.

693
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,240
It must be

694
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
a pile of sludge in his abdomen now.

695
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:44,680
The wounds are completely different

696
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,560
from those on the headless body.

697
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:47,960
They're more clean-cut.

698
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,960
Did you find anything?

699
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,240
I can't remember what kind of

700
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:54,200
sharp weapon this is.

701
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:55,200
But it's definitely

702
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,280
not the curved blade

703
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,760
from the Western Regions.

704
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,440
It looks more like a customized one.

705
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,640
You mean the one
that is used to gouge out eyes?

706
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,000
It's something like that.

707
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,560
But I'm not sure

708
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,280
whether such a thing truly exists.

709
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:19,280
Brass knuckles.

710
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
There is such a thing?

711
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,520
This is a weapon worn on the fingers.

712
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,760
It's as sharp as

713
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,560
swords and knives.

714
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:29,120
It's just that this weapon is too sinister.

715
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,280
Only those who practice
mischievous arts would use it.

716
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,640
Someone used

717
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,400
such a thing on a petty thug.

718
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,560
This is worth

719
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,600
our attention.

720
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,520
In that case,

721
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:41,960
this is not directly related

722
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,840
to the headless body.

723
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,040
But I have no idea

724
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:47,040
why the murderer would

725
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,200
kill the victim

726
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,400
and take away his eyes.

727
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,920
Take a look over here.

728
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,760
Something is not right.

729
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,880
Above the outer layer of skin,

730
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,080
there are some blue traces

731
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:33,200
that are barely visible.

732
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,600
If you feel tired,

733
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,680
go back to rest.

734
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,120
Leave it to me.

735
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,240
I'm fine.

736
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:47,760
I just didn't rest well last night

737
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,600
and I'm a bit unfocused.

738
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:53,960
Last night, you…

739
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,760
What's wrong with you today?

740
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:59,080
Did you get into a fight?

741
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,360
Great Chief

742
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:08,600
is really protective.

743
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,520
She appears to be an ordinary young lady.

744
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:17,840
But every time,

745
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,400
she puts aside all the dreadful

746
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:20,520
smells and images

747
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,240
and immerse herself

748
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,160
in the cases she's working on.

749
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,240
Yan Liuniang

750
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:27,480
is truly a remarkable woman.

751
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,280
Mr. Pan.

752
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,000
You can space out in this morgue

753
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:32,280
filled with foul odors.

754
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,000
I am truly impressed.

755
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,120
Space out?

756
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,360
What were you thinking?

757
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,520
Any new thoughts on the corpse?

758
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:43,960
Not really.

759
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,440
It's just that I've never seen

760
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,320
a woman who is both

761
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:49,040
careful and brave like you.

762
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:50,120
Seeing what you're doing,

763
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,240
I truly admire you.

764
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:52,240
Keep it to yourself

765
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,560
if you don't want to tell me.

766
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:56,840
There's no need for something so far-fetched.

767
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,120
Right.

768
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,360
Had anyone

769
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,480
handled the body before we came here?

770
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,000
As far as I know,

771
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,240
the body hasn't been processed.

772
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,600
Only some embalming fluid has been

773
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:10,680
applied to the wounds.

774
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,800
Jing Lin, please fetch some embalming fluid.

775
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:18,480
What?

776
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,680
I'll go.

777
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,408
You go then.

778
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,120
What is this?

779
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:52,400
People laugh at

780
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,840
the moths flying to the flame,

781
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,880
yet they don't know that mayflies

782
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,600
live at dawn and die at dusk,
never entering samsara,

783
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:00,240
while moths survive the fire

784
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,520
and await reincarnation.

785
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,960
It's the Huo'e Sect again.

786
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,360
The brother is unlike a brother.

787
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,760
The human is unlike a human.

788
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,280
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

789
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,520
Disaster comes from the sky.

790
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,920
T-This is cursed.

791
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,880
It's not cursed.

792
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,680
Someone is playing tricks.

793
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,760
How do you know

794
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,640
about the embalming fluid?

795
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:26,560
My master once said that

796
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,040
people of the Western Regions

797
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,520
would write with rice soup

798
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,640
on sheepskin paper as secret letters.

799
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,800
Once it dries out,

800
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:35,200
the writing turns invisible.

801
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,560
The recipient would then

802
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,720
apply embalming fluid

803
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,360
to the sheepskin paper.

804
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,560
The writing

805
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,600
will turn blue and reappear.

806
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,640
I checked the skin

807
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,960
around the neck

808
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,240
and found blue traces.

809
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,400
So I tried it.

810
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,240
Rape, pillage, and plunder.

811
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,800
Deserving to die.

812
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,280
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

813
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:12,960
Disaster comes from the sky.

814
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,200
To preserve the body, the coroner

815
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,520
uses embalming fluid

816
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:18,680
to moisten the wounds.

817
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,240
The murderer used rice soup

818
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,600
that would react with the embalming fluid.

819
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,520
It means that

820
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:25,640
the murderer never

821
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:26,720
intended to

822
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,520
keep the writing a secret.

823
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,640
We can even say that

824
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:31,840
they want us

825
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,240
to see it with our own eyes.

826
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,520
These people

827
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,360
aren't scared of us

828
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,560
linking the Huo'e Sect

829
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,240
to Half-faced Demon.

830
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,520
The accusation

831
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,560
is more like a flaunt,

832
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,040
showing us that

833
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,840
the Huo'e Sect has infiltrated

834
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:48,840
Gannandao

835
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:50,600
much more than we imagined.

836
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,000
As we investigate the case,

837
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,200
each and every move

838
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,680
is under their surveillance.

839
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,000
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

840
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,160
Disaster comes from the sky.

841
00:43:14,775 --> 00:43:18,593
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

842
00:43:18,593 --> 00:43:22,270
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫
