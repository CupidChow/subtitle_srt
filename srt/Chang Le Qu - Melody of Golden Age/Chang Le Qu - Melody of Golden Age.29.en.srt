How come

16
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,440
you've forgotten me so quickly?

17
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:00,440
Chen Huo'e?

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,320
I don't care who you are impersonating.

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:07,520
Don't play tricks here.

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Before I take action,

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,880
I suggest you hand over the antidote to me.

22
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,920
Otherwise, I don't mind

23
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:17,800
killing Chen Huo'e again.

24
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:25,080
Anyone who has fought me

25
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,960
even just once,

26
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,880
no matter how much time has passed,

27
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,320
I can always recognize them.

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,920
Chen Huo'e has fought with me several times.

29
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,680
So no matter how hard you try to hide

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,440
your style of fighting,

31
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,480
it's all in vain.

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,880
The fake will always be fake.

33
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,920
It's just a pity

34
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,840
that there is only one bottle of antidote.

35
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,880
I wonder if you dare

36
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,160
to take it.

37
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:21,960
For the people,

38
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,400
you truly risk your own life.

39
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,640
I have no interest in taking the lives

40
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,840
of those lowly people.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
The antidote is real.

42
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,240
Of course.

43
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,600
Your target has always been only me.

44
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,840
What other tricks do you have?

45
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,960
Play it all at once.

46
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,760
The poison on that porcelain bottle

47
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,040
should be enough for you
to enjoy for a good while.

48
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
This poison will travel with the blood,

49
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,880
circulate and spread

50
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,720
throughout your entire body.

51
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,920
Then, your body will become extremely stiff.

52
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,079
Eventually, you will become like

53
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,519
a breathing tree.

54
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:53,880
You

55
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,480
are really troublesome.

56
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,800
Wouldn't it be nice for you

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,440
to just die here

58
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,440
quietly?

59
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,480
The grand master of the Huo'e Sect,

60
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,120
your real leader,

61
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,040
is that person in the royal court, right?

62
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,560
You have been impersonating Chen Huo'e

63
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,000
and playing tricks everywhere,

64
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,280
constantly changing identities
to expand your power.

65
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,280
It's not just for the sake

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,240
of establishing a Huo'e Sect in Yingzhou

67
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:29,760
but to covet the entire Dacang.

68
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,120
Great Chief Shen,

69
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,480
the more you know,

70
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,600
the quicker you will die.

71
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,560
My only mission this time

72
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,680
is to annihilate in one fell swoop

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,320
you Shen Du and your entourage.

74
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,880
Now

75
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,960
you are already in my grasp.

76
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:00,552
I wonder

77
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,840
who will be the next one.

78
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,000
Great Chief.

79
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,544
Shen Du.

80
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,160
Then I'll just pick one myself.

81
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,304
Shen Du.

82
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,520
Shen Du.

83
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,824
Great Chief.

84
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,112
Great Chief.

85
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,560
Shen Du.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,600
Shen Du.

87
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,680
Shen Du.

88
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,040
Shen Du.

89
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:00,240
Shen Du.

90
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,800
Shen Du.

91
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,360
Shen Du.

92
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:35,688
Shen Du.

93
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,112
Shen Du.

94
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,832
Shen Du.

95
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,640
The Great Chief seems to have been inflicted
with a strange poison.

96
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:08,720
Is there an antidote?

97
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,520
My medical skills are limited.

98
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,240
I cannot tell what poison it is.

99
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,640
You cannot tell what poison it is?

100
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,320
The townspeople who took the antidote

101
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,360
brought back by the Great Chief

102
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,640
have shown improvements.

103
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:31,680
However, the Great Chief…

104
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,159
These vile tricksters

105
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:35,799
keep inventing inexplicable poisons
to harm others.

106
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,080
I must uproot their den.

107
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,400
Saving him is the priority.

108
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,280
But I have already searched Guangchun Clinic
and Mo Mansion thoroughly.

109
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:46,920
I found nothing related to the poison.

110
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,280
All that's left is to turn over the places
the Huo'e Sect has been

111
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,600
and examine them all.

112
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,920
Chen Huo'e is treacherous and cunning.

113
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,240
She would not place the antidote
in an obvious location.

114
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:21,352
The Great Chief is cured?

115
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,560
Acupuncture to seal acupoints.

116
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,960
It's just a temporary measure.

117
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,240
I can't think

118
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,160
of other ways now

119
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,520
to slow down the stiffening of his body.

120
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,120
If no antidote can be found,

121
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:00,744
I'm afraid he…

122
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,280
The poison in Shen Du

123
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,840
is not a poison from the Central Plains.

124
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,480
I have translated books
from the Western Regions.

125
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,960
I discovered the tricks of the Huo'e Sect

126
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:21,520
were very similar to the sacred arts
of the Jinwu Tribe as told in legends.

127
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,120
Then let's go seek medical advice
and medicine now.

128
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,440
We must not.

129
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,560
Years ago, the Jinwu Tribe suddenly cut off

130
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,760
all contact with Dacang.

131
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,880
Towards the people from Dacang,

132
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,360
they have shown great resistance.

133
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,760
Going there rashly

134
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,120
will not only fail to save him

135
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,000
but might also trap us there.

136
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,880
Then what should we do?

137
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,120
If I remember correctly,

138
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,520
I am the one among us
who knows the Western Regions best.

139
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,440
I shall go and retrieve the antidote.

140
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll go too.

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,680
You need to stay here and watch.

142
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:54,960
Shen Du risked his own life

143
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,680
to protect the people of Yingzhou.

144
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,560
You should also protect him

145
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,720
and even more so,

146
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,880
take good care of Mrs. Shen.

147
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:08,600
Fortunately, we are not far
from the Jinwu Tribe.

148
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,200
Before I return,

149
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,280
do nothing.

150
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,360
Thank you, Mr. Pan.

151
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,160
We will repay your great kindness someday.

152
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,720
Be careful on your way.

190
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:55,744
[Carrying the sunshine and auspicious energy]

191
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,520
Mrs. Shen has still not eaten
these past few days?

192
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:06,560
She has been staying by the bed all this time,

193
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,120
administering acupuncture every two hours.

194
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,160
She refuses to rest no matter what anyone says.

195
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,440
She won't let anyone else get close.

196
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,360
If this continues,

197
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,280
Mrs. Shen might collapse first.

198
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:19,760
So what do you propose we do now?

199
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:20,920
Counting the days,

200
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,560
if things go well for Mr. Pan,

201
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,880
he should be back from Jinwu by now.

202
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,800
I'm afraid that before
the Great Chief's antidote arrives,

203
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,040
she would collapse first.

204
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,520
Madam,

205
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,080
please take a rest.

206
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:45,800
Or maybe you could eat something.

207
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,800
If the Great Chief wakes up and finds
you've collapsed from exhaustion,

208
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,120
he would certainly be very upset.

209
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
Before he wakes up,

210
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,920
I will not collapse.

211
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,240
Mr. Pan has returned.

212
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,680
I was afraid that if I didn't come back,

213
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,119
you wouldn't be able to hold on.

214
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:10,240
Did you find the antidote?

215
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,839
This is…

216
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,839
Su Guang.

217
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,160
The saintess of the Jinwu Tribe.

218
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:34,840
I asked you to invite him here discreetly.

219
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:36,240
It was to invite,

220
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,200
not to carry him over. What's wrong?

221
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,560
He's very cunning.

222
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:42,200
I simply couldn't invite him.

223
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,720
Alright, off you go.

224
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,576
You're awake.

225
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,584
It's you.

226
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,320
It's the vine-wrapped tree.

227
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,320
Do you understand this poison?

228
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,040
This poison is primarily made
from the larvae of the wood-boring moth

229
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:10,600
and supplemented with toxic plants
like poison dart wood, gelsemium,

230
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,080
and Aconitum from the Western Regions.

231
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,480
Who would have thought this little moth

232
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,200
could be turned into such a potent poison?

233
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,680
But only the saintesses of our tribe

234
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:23,720
know the secret method of making the poison.

235
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,400
It's never been passed on externally.

236
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,800
If it's not passed on, why does the leader
of the Huo'e Sect

237
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,200
have this concealed poison?

238
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,680
Could there be more to this matter?

239
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:37,880
I'll make a long story short.

240
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,480
Because this poison is too sinister,

241
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,000
it has long been banned by our tribe.

242
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,840
But many years ago,

243
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,840
a saintess of our tribe went missing.

244
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:47,000
There has been no news of her since.

245
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,160
So it seems

246
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,160
this saintess

247
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,720
might be connected to the Huo'e Sect

248
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
and could have taught them this poison.

249
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,640
Impossible.

250
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,280
Saintess Daisi would never collude
with a heretical cult.

251
00:19:56,280 --> 00:20:00,080
You're a saintess, you must have
the antidote to save people, right?

252
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,160
Before coming, I heard a rough account
from Pan Chi.

253
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,360
I looked through books

254
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:11,480
and specially compounded this antidote.

255
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,840
I hope it will be effective.

256
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:16,960
I am deeply grateful

257
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,400
for today's antidote.

258
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,360
You saved my life before.

259
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,840
I agreed to come with you.

260
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:33,440
But the antidote should be counted separately.

261
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,880
Don't forget what you promised me.

262
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,080
A man's word

263
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,080
is his bond.

264
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
Mr. Pan is really something.

265
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,800
He has even left a trail of romantic debts
in the Western Regions.

266
00:21:35,005 --> 00:21:39,509
[Carrying the sunshine and auspicious energy]

267
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,680
Shen Du.

268
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,760
Shen Du, you've awoken.

269
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
How are you feeling now?

270
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
Are you still feeling uncomfortable anywhere?

271
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,960
Take it slow.

272
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,600
You've been asleep so long.

273
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,080
I even started to miss you.

274
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,640
If you dare to bully me like this again,

275
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,640
I will ignore you from then on.

276
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,000
It won't happen again.

277
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:17,080
The Great Chief has awoken.

278
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,080
You little brat,

279
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,760
you must not look at things
you aren't supposed to see.

280
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,720
If you call me a brat again, I'll get angry.

281
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,880
If you don't accept it, let's duel.

282
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,920
Kid.

283
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,600
May the heavens protect
and turn peril into safety.

284
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,000
What's the matter with you, kid?

285
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,600
Didn't I tell you not to look at things
you shouldn't?

286
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,280
Can't look.

287
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,440
Why are you so thoughtless?

288
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,320
Shen Du,

289
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,360
I really miss you.

290
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,800
It seems

291
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,360
you truly fell for him.

292
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,160
You have been unconscious for days.

293
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,720
You should not drink too much tea.

294
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,248
Give me your hand.

295
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,400
The pulse is stable.

296
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,000
It seems the poison has mostly been resolved.

297
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,280
If you have something to say, just say it.

298
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,520
Do you want to have a meal
or bathe and change clothes?

299
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,392
Don't move.

300
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,536
Do you feel uncomfortable?

301
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:24,200
About Yingzhou,

302
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,960
I've asked Jing Lin to keep an eye on it.

303
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,520
In the city, Sun Tan leads the inspectors
to maintain order.

304
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,640
This matter

305
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,880
will soon come to an end.

306
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,840
What about the remnants of the Huo'e Sect?

307
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,600
I've had Jing Lin block the news
that my poison has been cured.

308
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,040
Will they really believe it?

309
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:48,520
The point is to make them afraid to be certain.

310
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,560
How is the information gathering going?

311
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:06,240
My Lord,

312
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,800
it's now being rumored in the city

313
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,840
that the White Ghost from the capital city
is near death

314
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:12,400
and his wife didn't even wait for her husband
to breathe his last

315
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,960
before getting involved

316
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,560
with that famous detective Pan Chi.

317
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,680
It's said that Shen Du's wife

318
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,400
is an old acquaintance of Pan Chi

319
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:19,840
and the relationship has always been ambiguous.

320
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,160
A needle on the tail of a wasp.

321
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,560
The most venomous is a woman's heart.

322
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,400
Although the camp has been destroyed
by the imperial soldiers,

323
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
as long as Shen Du dies,

324
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,720
there will inevitably be chaos.

325
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,600
By then, the entire Yingzhou

326
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,480
will be in your grasp.

327
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,120
To prevent deception, inquire again.

328
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:40,744
Yes.

329
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,120
It is cinnabar.

330
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,000
This is from the day of the fight.

331
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,920
It fell off Chen Huo'e.

332
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,520
I had Jing Lin search Guangchun Clinic again.

333
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:02,200
Indeed, in the corner,

334
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,680
we found the lost granules of cinnabar.

335
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:06,720
Cinnabar is often used in alchemy.

336
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,840
It is produced in very small quantities.

337
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,120
Hence, it's extremely precious.

338
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,840
Ten gold pieces per bushel is not too much.

339
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,120
How could the Huo'e Sect have it?

340
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:16,640
If one were to consume small amounts
over a long period,

341
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,160
it would act as a preservative in advance.

342
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,960
That's why the body can remain uncorrupted
for a long time after death.

343
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,720
So the Huo'e Sect had prepared

344
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,080
this technique of resurrection
for its followers long ago.

345
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,440
The mining of cinnabar

346
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,640
is strictly controlled by the imperial court.

347
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,760
Yet the Huo'e Sect can easily possess it
in large quantities.

348
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,400
It seems they infiltrated

349
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:38,480
the mining industry of Dacang long ago.

350
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,880
Such great ambition

351
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:42,000
is far beyond imagination.

352
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,200
You mean to say

353
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:53,680
the mastermind behind the Huo'e Sect wants to…

354
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,080
Cry.

355
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,696
Cry for what?

356
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,800
I can't cry out.

357
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:51,378
[Carrying the sunshine and auspicious energy]

358
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:04,600
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

359
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,520
Your bewitching incense

360
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:03,040
should change its variety.

361
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:31,360
You are indeed still alive.

362
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:34,360
Do you really think I am made of paper?

363
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,840
You are not Chen Huo'e.

364
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:16,600
Is your true face so impossible to show?

365
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,480
Have you really seen through everything,
Shen Du?

366
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:33,760
Shen Du.

367
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,600
Great Chief, she has escaped.

368
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,760
Watch them closely.

369
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,880
I want a live capture.

370
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:55,688
Yes.

371
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:26,080
There exists a way
to make items burn up so quickly.

372
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,320
The incident was sudden.

373
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,080
The smoke was too thick at the time.

374
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,960
I only smelled an acrid odor.

375
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:40,264
What are you thinking about?

376
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,960
Do you remember Saintess Daisi

377
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,800
I mentioned to you?

378
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,800
According to rumors,

379
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,880
she developed
a kind of combustion-aiding technique.

380
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,240
Not to mention this wall,

381
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,680
even this whole courtyard

382
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,760
could be consumed by flames

383
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,920
in an instant.

384
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,800
Great Chief,

385
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,040
a witness to the granary fire from that year

386
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,320
has been found.

387
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:07,400
According to him,

388
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:10,280
at that time, an extremely pungent odor
was smelled in the vicinity.

389
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,720
Moreover, the fire looked very strange.

390
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,120
Purple lights were flickering
out of it from time to time.

391
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:17,480
Jinwu combustion technique.

392
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,640
If one were to burn the granary
using this technique,

393
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,800
indeed, it wouldn't take half a day.

394
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,440
In that case,

395
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,200
Saintess Daisi of the Jinwu Tribe

396
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,200
seems to be inextricably linked
with the Huo'e Sect.

397
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,080
What do you mean?

398
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:34,000
What is the purpose of your visit here?

399
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,320
Although Dacang seldom interacts
with the Jinwu Tribe,

400
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,960
we know that the disappearance of the saintess

401
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,720
is a major event.

402
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:42,560
So peaceful.

403
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:45,080
I guess there might have been premeditation.

404
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,080
I did not intend to conceal it.

405
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,680
Saintess Daisi eloped with a man from Dacang.

406
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:52,840
Her whereabouts have been unknown ever since.

407
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:55,000
The tribe leader wanted
to calm the situation down.

408
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,120
However, during these years,

409
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:57,400
for many times,

410
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,760
there appeared
the illusion techniques and recipes

411
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:01,040
only our saintesses knew.

412
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,680
I think it is necessary
to quickly uncover the truth

413
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,560
to avoid unwarranted disaster
for the sacred sect.

414
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,560
Man from Dacang?

415
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,576
Jing Lin.

416
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,800
Great Chief.

417
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:27,639
Send someone on a fast horse
to report back to the capital

418
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:29,920
that the crisis in Yingzhou has been resolved.

419
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,200
Yes.

420
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,239
After being outside for so long,

421
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:43,400
you finally came in.

422
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,199
You really don't stand on ceremony.

423
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,400
There's something

424
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,880
I'm not sure if it's appropriate to say.

425
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,000
If it's inappropriate,

426
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,640
don't say it.

427
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:17,640
I advise you to fulfill the promise

428
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,000
to divorce Yan Xing amicably
as soon as possible.

429
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:24,080
In what capacity are you speaking to me now?

430
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,560
As her close friend

431
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,680
who dresses up as a woman?

432
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:39,120
Merely a couple in name.

433
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:40,560
Great Chief,

434
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,960
you really are confident.

435
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:55,048
It's better

436
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,760
to be careful with what you say.

437
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:10,440
The White Ghost on the knife's edge every day,

438
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:17,160
how should you bring Yan Xing happiness?

439
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:20,000
It seems there's no need to trouble you

440
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:23,200
to worry about the safety of my wife.

441
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,680
As long as I, Shen Du, am here,

442
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,880
no one can harm Yan Xing.

443
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:35,160
You are really arrogant and domineering.

444
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:38,320
I really don't know what Yan Xing sees in you.

445
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,560
Alright.

446
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:41,400
Since you've said it today,

447
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,480
please keep your word.

448
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,480
Otherwise…

449
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:48,400
Otherwise what?

450
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,120
Otherwise, even if it's the ends of the earth,

451
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:55,160
I will definitely return

452
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,320
and take her away.

453
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,760
You should have seen the affection

454
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,080
between me and my wife very clearly.

455
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,920
Today I'll lay my words here.

456
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,200
You won't wait until that day.

457
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,760
That's the best.

458
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,240
Are you leaving with the saintess?

459
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,080
Aren't you also interested in the whereabouts

460
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:20,320
of Saintess Daisi?

461
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,120
The saintess has a noble status.

462
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,480
She must be well-protected.

463
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,720
What a good cup.

464
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,920
Just smashed it like that.

465
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:43,760
What a pity.

466
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,800
Reckless.

467
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,600
Thanks to you risking your life

468
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:03,360
to obtain the antidote from Chen Huo'e.

469
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,440
After the poisoned residents in the city

470
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,760
took it,

471
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,960
they all quickly recovered.

472
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,440
Seeing the people recover

473
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,760
and lead a peaceful life,

474
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,680
I just feel

475
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
even if handling cases is tough,

476
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,344
it's all worth it.

477
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,720
Great Chief,

478
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:25,720
thank you.

479
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,960
Thank you, Great Chief.

480
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,160
Thank you for saving me.

481
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,360
Thank you for saving
all the residents of Yingzhou.

482
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:31,640
You are a good official.

483
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,400
This is a little token of our gratitude.

484
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,480
Please don't disdain it, accept it.

485
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:38,800
Great Chief, thank you for saving my life.

486
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,600
Thank you, this is a token of my gratitude.

487
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,360
Great Chief, this is a small token
of my gratitude.

488
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,400
You must accept it.

489
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,000
- Thank you, Great Chief.
- Thank you for saving my life.

490
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,680
You are truly a good official.

491
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,920
We'll never forget

492
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,120
your great kindness for the rest of our lives.

493
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
Yes, thank you, Great Chief.

494
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,480
Thank you, Great Chief.

495
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,040
You are really too kind.

496
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,080
It's all what the Great Chief

497
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,920
should do. No need.

498
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:57,960
Please don't say that, really.

499
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,160
Don't disdain it, please.

500
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,760
- Thank you, Great Chief.
- Thank you, Great Chief.

501
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,160
The Great Chief is really a good official.

502
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,640
Still laughing.

503
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,680
Help me hold it.

504
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:14,240
These are all given to you by them.

505
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,920
This full-hearted sentiment,

506
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,720
of course, you should hold it yourself.

507
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:21,760
I think you should deal less
with Pan Chi in the future

508
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,960
lest you learn his rebellious nature.

509
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:26,760
Glib and articulate.

510
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:27,880
Before he left,

511
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
he didn't even come to say goodbye.

512
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,600
It seems he has gone to provoke you.

513
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,960
The relationship between Saintess Daisi
and the Huo'e Sect

514
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,000
is a matter of great importance.

515
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,520
I think

516
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,840
his visit must have another purpose.

517
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,480
Then that's even better.

518
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:46,520
If he dares to covet someone else's wife again,

519
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,600
beware I break his legs.

520
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,120
You are shy.

521
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,400
There are people around.

522
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:01,587
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

523
00:40:01,587 --> 00:40:06,415
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

524
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,408
I'm cold.

525
00:40:09,408 --> 00:40:12,683
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

526
00:40:12,683 --> 00:40:16,230

♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

529
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,344
What about now?

530
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:29,660
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

531
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,520
Lean forward a bit more.

532
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:33,588
♫ Your palm lines ♫

533
00:40:33,588 --> 00:40:36,880
♫ Your gaze ♫

534
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:39,360
I am holding something in my hands.

535
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,360
Lean forward a bit.

536
00:40:43,668 --> 00:40:47,700
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

537
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,140
♫ Your palm lines ♫

538
00:40:49,140 --> 00:40:51,700
♫ Your gaze ♫

♫ You are the one for me ♫

♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

542
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,080
I'm cold.

543
00:41:19,641 --> 00:41:23,240
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

544
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,704
Really cold.

545
00:41:24,704 --> 00:41:27,240
♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

546
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,960
You are not allowed to tease me in the future.

547
00:41:30,559 --> 00:41:34,299
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

548
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:39,316
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

549
00:41:39,316 --> 00:41:43,196
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

550
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:46,484
