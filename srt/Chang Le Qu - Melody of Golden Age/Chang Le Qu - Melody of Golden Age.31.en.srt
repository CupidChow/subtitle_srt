[Melody of Golden Age]

14
00:01:37,354 --> 00:01:40,920
[Episode 31]

15
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
Unlimited expenses don't mean

16
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,640
that the corrupt officials

17
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,040
can line their own pockets.

18
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,360
I wonder how many people are involved.

19
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,440
It could probably shake
the entire imperial court.

20
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,480
They've completely enraged

21
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,600
the Empress Dowager.

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:03,160
It's a sensitive matter.

23
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,320
Nothing has happened yet.

24
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,560
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager plans

25
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,240
to investigate secretly

26
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,400
and eradicate the problem.

27
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,800
So what should we

28
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,840
do now?

29
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,440
They might find me

30
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,080
disrespectful for rejecting the marriage.

31
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,120
I'm afraid I will be sidelined.

32
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:39,200
You won't despise me for this, right?

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,800
I'm afraid

34
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,560
I can't find someone more shrewd than you.

35
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,880
Nor can you find someone

36
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,160
who loves you more than I do.

37
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,080
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

38
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,960
the Imperial Guards
will look into Princess Runing

39
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
and Prince Xian,

40
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,680
and monitor the Imperial Inspectorate.

41
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,880
Is the Empress Dowager

42
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,160
suspecting Prince Xian?

43
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,000
It's probably not just that.

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:50,800
By the Empress Dowager's decree,

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,840
the Imperial Inspectorate

46
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,960
shall secretly look into the Zhou family

47
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,440
and keep an eye on the Princess of Valor.

48
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,640
Report everything

49
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,360
without holding back.

50
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,600
Also, monitor the Imperial Guards in secret.

51
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,000
If anything comes up,

52
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,920
report it immediately.

53
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,320
I accept Her Majesty's decree.

54
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,200
Madam Xu.

55
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,680
I've prepared some fine tea from Junshan Island

56
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
brewed with snow water
from the Tianshan Mountains.

57
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,040
Won't you stay for some tea?

58
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,560
The tea is too cold in nature.

59
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,320
What a pity I can't taste it.

60
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,920
Vice Minister Lai, please stay.

61
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,840
I hope you carry out

62
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,480
the Empress Dowager's order

63
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,080
cautiously and prudently

64
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:43,120
without any mistakes.

65
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:50,160
Thank you for your kind reminder, Madam Xu.

66
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:11,848
Great tea.

67
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,720
Shen Du had the nerve to turn down

68
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,480
the marriage bestowed by Mother Express.

69
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,000
I have underestimated Yan Xing.

70
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,560
How interesting.

71
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,080
I didn't expect the cold and merciless Shen Du

72
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,640
to actually fall in love.

73
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,720
Anyway,

74
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,960
it's good news for us.

75
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,000
If the Imperial Guards
side with the Princess of Valor,

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,200
it will be even harder

77
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,400
for you to obtain

78
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:56,640
the position of Prince Regent.

79
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,920
Don't you find it weird

80
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,200
that Mother Empress hasn't punished

81
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
Shen Du severely?

82
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,960
After Mo Qianzhi died, the position
of Yingzhou Governor remained vacant.

83
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,000
I heard that

84
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,280
Shen Du had been attacked

85
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:09,840
before he returned to Xiang'an.

86
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,880
He entered the palace

87
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
to see Mother Empress overnight.

88
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
After that,

89
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,080
he was bestowed with a marriage.

90
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,640
Too much of a coincidence.

91
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:21,200
I wonder what secrets Shen Du

92
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,840
has discovered in Yingzhou.

93
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,120
I believe that

94
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,760
the Empress Dowager grew distant

95
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,840
from Shen Du due to his refusal.

96
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,800
She barely summons him these days.

97
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
Some palace maids have reached the age

98
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,320
to be sent back to their hometowns.

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,240
The Empress Dowager summoned Lai Luozhi

100
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,560
and bestowed several maids upon him.

101
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,000
It's obvious that Lai Luozhi

102
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
is favored

103
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,440
by the Empress Dowager nowadays.

104
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:50,520
The Imperial Inspectorate will eventually

105
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,520
overpower the Imperial Guards.

106
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,960
It is too early to say that.

107
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,400
Zhang Baohuan suddenly fell ill.

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
It's very fishy.

109
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,880
Sir.

110
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,520
I feel that something huge

111
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,840
is brewing in the court.

112
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,880
People are unfathomable.

113
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,120
I'll keep a closer watch
on the Princess of Valor.

114
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,800
Uncle Lan, he is a friend.

115
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,680
Men of Dacang are not to be trusted.

116
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,480
He is also after that person.

117
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,440
The Saintess Daisi wasn't the only victim.

118
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,480
You believe in him?

119
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,912
Yes, I do.

120
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,080
Here.

121
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,248
Thank you.

122
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,672
Thank you.

123
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
Uncle Lan.

124
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:55,160
You served Saintess Daisi for many years.

125
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,200
We want to know

126
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,560
what happened back then

127
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,880
in detail.

128
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,720
It's been over ten years.

129
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,960
Back then, Daisi was

130
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,920
still the saintess of the Jinwu Tribe.

131
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,040
After the Jinwu Tribe sent envoys

132
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,640
to pay homage to Dacang,

133
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,720
Dacang also sent envoys

134
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,960
to Jinwu in return.

135
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,720
The Jinwu Tribe and Dacang have been

136
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,560
in touch ever since.

137
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:19,520
The common folks were free

138
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,040
to travel back and forth.

139
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,280
Once the saintess

140
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,640
was doing charity work

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,680
on the street…

142
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,400
Easy. There's enough for everyone.

143
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,800
That's when she met that person.

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,120
It was just a random encounter.

145
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,320
The saintess didn't pay much attention to it

146
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,840
and soon forgot about it

147
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,080
after she returned.

148
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,560
Because she was a saintess

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:45,520
who was bound for life not to marry

150
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,120
or fall in love with anyone.

151
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,520
She lived solely for the people of Jinwu.

152
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:52,040
But somehow,

153
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,360
they met again very soon.

154
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,600
But this time,

155
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,560
they met at the court banquet

156
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,200
of the Jinwu Tribe.

157
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,480
(How could it be such a coincidence?)

158
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,680
- Saintess.
- The saintess had rarely met any men.

159
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,560
She was innocent and pure.

160
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,360
But once she fell in love,

161
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,400
she was like a wild horse

162
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,840
breaking free of its reins.

163
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,800
After the welcome banquet,

164
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,280
during the days that the envoys stayed,

165
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:23,320
[Daisi]
Daisi had frequent contact

166
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,680
with the envoys of Dacang as the saintess.

167
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,120
And she did that

168
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,680
to get close to that man from Dacang.

169
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,080
What is this?

170
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,320
Daisi. Your name.

171
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,760
Unexpectedly, this man

172
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,120
proposed

173
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,480
to learn the Jinwu language from the saintess.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:42,600
This man from Dacang

175
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,400
was gifted in language learning.

176
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,320
In just seven to eight days,

177
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,840
he learned quite a bit.

178
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,520
And then,

179
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,800
the saintess learned that man's name.

180
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,760
Those three characters

181
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,360
should be etched

182
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,200
in her memory.

183
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,720
But it remained a blur no matter

184
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,800
how hard she tried to recall it.

185
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,440
Their feelings for each other grew day by day.

186
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,280
Very soon,

187
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,160
they became deeply affectionate.

188
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:15,160
But the saintess had her duties.

189
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:16,840
In the presence of others,

190
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,280
she had to restrain herself.

191
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,120
But at that point,

192
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,440
all she could see and think about

193
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,400
was that man from Dacang.

194
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,520
She forgot

195
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,320
all about her duties.

196
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
But good times don't last.

197
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,240
Trouble arose

198
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,160
very soon.

199
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,320
Will you come to Dacang with me?

200
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,200
I know you have a special status.

201
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,840
I've used all my luck

202
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,720
just to meet you.

203
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,800
How could I ask for more?

204
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:55,000
No. I will go with you.

205
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Of course, I will.

206
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,440
From then on,

207
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,440
the saintess

208
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,960
could no longer be found.

209
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,200
Some said they saw her

210
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,440
dressed in the attire of a Dacang woman,

211
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,920
riding a horse towards Dacang,

212
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,280
following that man.

213
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,520
Jinwu did not want it to be a scandal

214
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:20,200
and proclaimed that

215
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,880
the saintess passed away due to illness

216
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,600
and erased her identity.

217
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,200
After that, the Jinwu Tribe

218
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,360
severed its tie with Dacang.

219
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,720
I thought that

220
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,760
this man from Dacang

221
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,240
and the saintess

222
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,040
would be together for life.

223
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,240
But to my surprise,

224
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:40,880
not long after,

225
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,240
I saw the dying saintess

226
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,360
right in this dilapidated house.

227
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,200
Saintess.

228
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,320
Saintess, what happened?

229
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,760
I am no longer the saintess.

230
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,760
Saintess.

231
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,840
Come back with me.

232
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,280
Everything will be fine.

233
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,680
It's too late.

234
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:07,360
Where is he? Where is that man?

235
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,640
He deceived me.

236
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,560
He tricked me

237
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,480
into revealing the secret I should keep

238
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,680
and teaching him how to

239
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,200
control moths with medicinal powder.

240
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,280
I was such a fool.

241
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,560
Why did I fall for the trick?

242
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,880
When I discovered that

243
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,960
he bore evil intentions,

244
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,680
practiced evil crafts,

245
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,400
and even tried to manipulate others

246
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,600
with those crafts to do his bidding,

247
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,640
he harbored the intent to kill me.

248
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,680
Saintess.

249
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,960
Saintess.

250
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,360
It's too late.

251
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:47,000
Everything is too late now.

252
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,920
I've sinned gravely.

253
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:54,120
- Death will do me justice.
- No!

254
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,768
Saintess.

255
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,920
This man truly deserves the most painful death.

256
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,080
Calm down first.

257
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,160
Sooner or later we will catch him

258
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,760
and expose him to the world.

259
00:14:21,856 --> 00:14:23,320
Uncle Lan.

260
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,600
Check these and see if he

261
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,800
looks like anyone in there.

262
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,920
This man.

263
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,336
[Imperial Inspectorate]
It's him.

264
00:14:48,047 --> 00:14:49,680
[Imperial Inspectorate]

265
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,320
It's the man from Dacang.

266
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,520
It's him.

267
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:53,560
You found him?

268
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,800
Where is he?

269
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,400
- I'm going to kill him.
- Uncle Lan.

270
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,440
Leave it to us.

271
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,680
Rest assured.

272
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,160
I will definitely

273
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,400
make him pay the price

274
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,360
to do Saintess Daisi justice.

275
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:15,200
Are you watching, saintess?

276
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,040
That man did so many evil deeds.

277
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,600
Surely, karma will get him.

278
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,440
He shall die a miserable death.

279
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,000
Saintess Daisi

280
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,520
once saw that treacherous man

281
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,360
teaching someone to burn down

282
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,160
a granary with evil crafts.

283
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,560
The saintess denounced him

284
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,080
for harming the people of Dacang.

285
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:43,400
Yet that treacherous man scoffed and said that

286
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,440
the one who harmed the people of Dacang

287
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,520
wasn't him,

288
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,840
but…

289
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,160
but

290
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,240
the Empress Dowager

291
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,080
of Dacang.

292
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,920
And the one who made him burn the granary

293
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:02,000
was the Empress Dowager's close relative

294
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,040
from the Zhou family.

295
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:07,000
When Saintess Daisi fled,

296
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,400
she took the token of communication
between the man

297
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,040
and the arsonist.

298
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,320
It is this jade pendant.

299
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,000
Yan Xing.

300
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,440
I hope it's not too late.

301
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,040
Empress Dowager.

302
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,880
I have something to report.

303
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,680
Minister Lai, what is it?

304
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,960
I wish to impeach Sun Tan,

305
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,040
the Marshal of Inspectors in Gannandao,

306
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,080
for dereliction of duty.

307
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,400
Sun Tan led the inspectors

308
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,400
in Gannandao to investigate the case

309
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,080
of the Half-faced Demon

310
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,800
as I have personally witnessed.

311
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,080
How did someone with merit

312
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,600
end up guilty in your story?

313
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,080
Empress Dowager.

314
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:01,200
I gathered evidence of Sun Tan

315
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,560
abusing his power

316
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,880
and profiteering from bribery.

317
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,200
I'm presenting them to you.

318
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,000
Please have a look.

319
00:17:16,960 --> 00:17:19,200
The laws of the Dacang regulate that

320
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:21,680
taking what is not one's own is theft.

321
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,119
The governor shall not

322
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,920
embezzle public property or accept bribery.

323
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,640
Those who accept bribes

324
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,720
shall be hanged to death.

325
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,480
Sun Tan abused his power

326
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,600
to amass wealth and collude with bandits.

327
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,440
The evidence is conclusive.

328
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,320
Empress Dowager, please allow me

329
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,480
to put him on sentence.

330
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,960
Empress Dowager.

331
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,480
The Imperial Inspectorate

332
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,520
may have convicted the suspect through torture.

333
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,680
Has Sun Tan really

334
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,160
committed such a heinous crime?

335
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,360
Please look into it.

336
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,520
Great Chief Shen.

337
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,400
Your courthouse is also known

338
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,840
as the Devil's Court.

339
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,640
You have cruel tortures just like we do.

340
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
But now,

341
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,160
you pretend to be merciful

342
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,080
to protect the criminal, Sun Tan.

343
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,120
Why is that?

344
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,200
Enough.

345
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,760
I'm a bit tired now.

346
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,720
Leave the evidence behind.

347
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,040
We will discuss it another day.

348
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:16,640
- I take my leave.
- I take my leave.

349
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,560
Leave us alone.

350
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,720
Prince Xia--

351
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,800
One must be concentrated when pruning

352
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:47,000
branches and leaves.

353
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,840
What do you think?

354
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:00,040
Doesn't it look much better than before?

355
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,320
Your Highness…

356
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,440
Your Highness.

357
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,720
Lai Luozhi has been dominating the court

358
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,160
and detaining officials

359
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,280
with random accusations.

360
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,800
Now he's even reached out to Gannandao.

361
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,960
Judging by his conduct,

362
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,160
he will be a great threat to you

363
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,680
even if you become the Prince Regent.

364
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,200
Should I find someone to impeach him

365
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,600
at the court meeting tomorrow?

366
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,360
Prime Minister Zhang.

367
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,560
Withered leaves will eventually fall.

368
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:40,040
Even if we stop the autumn breeze,

369
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,480
can we stop the winter snow?

370
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,920
What do you mean, Prince Xian?

371
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,040
Nothing.

372
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,920
These people from Xichen and Nanlang

373
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,440
showed up recently, right?

374
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,760
Yeah, people from all walks of life are coming

375
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,320
from all over the world.

376
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,160
These people from Xichen and Nanlang

377
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,960
came to Xiang'an for a living some time ago.

378
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,800
Pay extra attention

379
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,600
during the patrol.

380
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,200
Understood.

381
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,920
Your Highness.

382
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,312
It's Shen Du.

383
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,400
I really can't stand it.

384
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,640
How dare the White Ghost

385
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,360
openly turn down the marriage

386
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:40,760
and embarrass Princess Jia'an?

387
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,840
Your Highness.

388
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
You shouldn't let him off easily.

389
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,800
Shen Du

390
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,120
is just like his father.

391
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,200
They don't know what's good for them.

392
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,200
Mother Empress was kind to him.

393
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,200
Yet he didn't know

394
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:57,400
the importance
of seeking support from a patron.

395
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,080
You've watched Jia'an grow up,

396
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:01,320
spending more time with her

397
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,600
than I have as her mother.

398
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,160
Naturally, you would feel for her.

399
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:15,240
The dignity of the royal family
matters the most.

400
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,520
Mother Empress has been humiliated.

401
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,560
Things won't be easy

402
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:21,640
for Shen Du even if

403
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,960
we don't make a move.

404
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,640
Liuniang.

405
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,320
You are the best.

406
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,200
You've become a Chief Director,

407
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,440
yet you still help me sort out the files.

408
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,560
Have you ever

409
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,520
looked down on me

410
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:43,800
as a Senior Clerk

411
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:46,280
when I was nobody?

412
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,400
Right.

413
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,040
Try this.

414
00:21:49,040 --> 00:21:51,320
You brought it from Gannandao?

415
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,280
It's much sweeter than the ones in Xiang'an.

416
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:00,200
Here.

417
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,040
The honey from Gannandao
is exceptionally sweet.

418
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,920
It's not only used for fruits

419
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,160
but also human flesh.

420
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,840
Yan Liuniang.

421
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,520
I hate you.

422
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,560
Lu Chuichui.

423
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,400
How dare you let Director Yan

424
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:18,680
sort out the files for you?

425
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,288
What were you thinking?

426
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:28,600
Didn't you use to boss Director Yan around?

427
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,640
I…

428
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,240
That was in the past.

429
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:33,240
Right, Director Yan?

430
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:38,640
Director Yan.

431
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,760
Times have changed.

432
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,800
Now we are

433
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,080
colleagues of the same rank.

434
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,320
And you are married to the Great Chief.

435
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,280
Therefore, I will count on you

436
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,840
to look after me from now on.

437
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:59,320
Please don't say that, Director Wu.

438
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,760
Her Majesty was kind enough

439
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,720
to make me the Chief Director by honor,

440
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,360
but I'm still a staff
of the Ministry of Justice.

441
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,480
I still follow

442
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,760
your instructions to work on cases.

443
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,800
I'll count on you

444
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:13,880
to take good care of me.

445
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,000
Fair enough.

446
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,240
Your endless cliche

447
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,040
is making me sick.

448
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,528
Feng Gui.

449
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,160
Take a seat.

450
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,200
Since you still see me as the director,

451
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,960
I think I should

452
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,760
give you some advice.

453
00:23:57,320 --> 00:24:00,360
Now that you are married to Great Chief

454
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:02,160
and promoted,

455
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,280
you've become the leading female official.

456
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,360
But as the old saying goes,

457
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,280
"It doesn't last long
to burn oil with fierce fire."

458
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,560
Do you know that

459
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,720
the Empress Dowager

460
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,520
favors the Black Fiend

461
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:16,080
over the White Ghost now?

462
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:25,240
Look at you.

463
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,720
The wives of other high officials

464
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:32,600
are adept at dealing with people

465
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:36,800
to learn secrets
that may be useful for their husbands.

466
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,080
Who is silly enough

467
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,120
to bury her head

468
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,280
in files and stay in the morgue

469
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,640
all day long?

470
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,960
I'm just saying.

471
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,200
Vice Minister Lai is in power

472
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,240
and he's arresting officials quite often.

473
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,520
The Empress Dowager

474
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,800
indulges and spoils Vice Minister Lai

475
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,040
more than she does with Zhang Baohuan.

476
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,320
The Empress Dowager never refuses

477
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,000
his request for arrest.

478
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:17,280
The court officials all feel threatened.

479
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,400
How can Lai Luozhi be so autocratic?

480
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,880
So,

481
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,120
Liuniang.

482
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,360
Think about it.

483
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,680
How can the Black Fiend

484
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,720
allow the White Ghost

485
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,320
to be on an equal footing

486
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,520
with him?

487
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,480
To be honest, even if it were me,

488
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,920
I would surely hope

489
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,840
that there's only one

490
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,080
merciless law enforcer.

491
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,160
Thank you for the reminder, Director Wu.

492
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,240
The more

493
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,960
I know my husband,

494
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,440
the more I realize that

495
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,760
he's treading on thin ice

496
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,000
in that high position.

497
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:08,680
I don't know court politics.

498
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,120
Nor do I know how to help.

499
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:12,800
I can only do my job well

500
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,000
to not cause him any trouble.

501
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,040
You don't

502
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,360
cause him trouble?

503
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
Lai Luozhi is killing innocent people.

504
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,960
Can't anyone do something?

505
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,400
- What's going on?
- Marshal Xu.

506
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,880
If you refuse to deal with it,

507
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,120
I'll ask the Empress Dowager

508
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,080
in the imperial palace

509
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,480
whether Dacang is still

510
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,640
ruled by law.

511
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,160
Shut up.

512
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,800
Get back to work.
I don't care if you're suicidal.

513
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,480
But our staff and I don't want to

514
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,520
have our ears cut off by the Black Fiend
in the middle of the night.

515
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,560
Mr. Xu.

516
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,800
What happened?

517
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,080
Lai Luozhi arrested Sun Tan.

518
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,960
Sun Tan?

519
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:00,560
The Marshal of Inspectors of Gannandao?

520
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,960
Wasn't his file delivered

521
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,400
to the Dali Supreme Court
just after the court meeting?

522
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,200
The Empress Dowager hasn't given a verdict.

523
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,920
How could they arrest him already?

524
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,800
The Imperial Inspectorate took him

525
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:12,000
into custody without a verdict.

526
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,200
But one day
in the Imperial Inspectorate's prison

527
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
means ten fewer years to live.

528
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,160
If it goes on like this,

529
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,080
Sun Tan might be dead before

530
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,720
the Empress Dowager gives a verdict.

531
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,880
Vice Minister Lai has been dominant

532
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:24,720
for a very long time.

533
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,800
In the end, it's up to the Dali Supreme Court.

534
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,280
Aren't you crying to

535
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,560
the wrong people here?

536
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:32,360
Don't you know the staff
at the Dali Supreme Court?

537
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,800
They're timid and afraid of trouble.

538
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,920
This case was initiated

539
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,480
by the Imperial Inspectorate

540
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:39,080
and it involves the inspectors.

541
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,960
They have already handed it over to you.

542
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:44,560
They handed it over…

543
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:47,800
Headache. Feng Gui…

544
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,840
I am here. What's wrong?

545
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,120
Director Wu, rest and recover.

546
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,280
If the Ministry of Justice
can't do my buddy justice,

547
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,520
I don't mind barging into the palace again.

548
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,440
- Slowly.
- Let's go.

549
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,000
Director Wu isn't

550
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,280
any more courageous

551
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,960
than those at the Dali Supreme Court.

552
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,280
You're trying your luck with the wrong person.

553
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,560
Yun Que.

554
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,800
Why are you with Marshal Xu?

555
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,000
I am also an inspector.

556
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,520
Why can't I be with Marshal Xu?

557
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,080
Go back to work.

558
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,880
Understood.

559
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,200
I take my leave.

560
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,880
Mr. Xu.

561
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:33,000
You have always been outspoken.

562
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,880
Why are you so cautious today?

563
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,880
Don't you remember

564
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,240
that I'm also the Sixth-Tier

565
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:40,280
Chief Director

566
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,080
of the Ministry of Justice?

567
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,600
Speaking of ranks,

568
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,560
I'm on a par with Director Wu.

569
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,480
I also have the authority to try cases.

570
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:49,320
I can apply to be

571
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,480
the presiding judge.

572
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:51,960
I knew it.

573
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:53,360
Ask Liuniang for help.

574
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,520
Liuniang.

575
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,520
Aren't you going to

576
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,240
offend Lai Luozhi?

577
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:01,000
Didn't you say you wouldn't
cause trouble for Shen Du?

578
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,240
Yeah.

579
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:06,120
I just said I wouldn't cause him trouble.

580
00:29:08,160 --> 00:29:10,240
Liuniang, I know

581
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,880
things are tricky

582
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,440
in the court nowadays.

583
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,520
Shen Du must be having a hard time.

584
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,640
You'd better

585
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,680
stay out of it.

586
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,640
But it concerns you.

587
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,280
And Sun Tan has helped us

588
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,600
a lot in Gannandao.

589
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,840
He would help us

590
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,200
if we were in trouble.

591
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:36,320
Liuniang, thank you.

592
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,160
Since I've agreed to help,

593
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,440
we must plan it carefully.

594
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,840
Follow me.

595
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,288
Let's go.

596
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,600
Vice Minister.

597
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,040
That Sun Tan is tough.

598
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:02,040
We've tried everything that doesn't kill him,

599
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:04,320
yet he still refuses to talk.

600
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,800
Since when did we

601
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,840
become

602
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,360
so soft and lenient?

603
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,120
It doesn't matter whether he confesses.

604
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
As long as he is not in Gannandao,

605
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,600
the inspectors there

606
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,280
won't be able to do anything.

607
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:25,600
Whoever tries to block my path

608
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,000
will have a taste of my fierce measures.

609
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,800
Mr. Xu, do you know what solid evidence

610
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,360
Lai Luozhi has against Sun Tan?

611
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:36,960
Do you know how we became inspectors?

612
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,680
The court recruits chivalries

613
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:41,080
for investigation and arrest.

614
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:42,080
Exactly.

615
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,520
We managed to spread our network everywhere

616
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,840
and secured more access

617
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,760
to information than the court officials

618
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,800
because we were recruited

619
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,320
as people from all walks of life

620
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,120
in the first place.

621
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,080
Before we were recruited,

622
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,000
many were bandits who robbed people

623
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,120
or skilled thieves

624
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,920
with nimble fingers like me.

625
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,880
We couldn't just sever our ties

626
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,160
with our old friends.

627
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,400
Lai Luozhi could easily

628
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,680
pin any charges on anyone.

629
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,800
I'm worried that

630
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,560
Sun Tan isn't the only target in this case.

631
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:14,880
Lai Luozhi may have been
arrogant and domineering,

632
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,640
but he has never dared to provoke us.

633
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:19,160
But Gannandao was in dire need

634
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,520
of reconstruction

635
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,680
after the case was solved

636
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,600
and he arrested Sun Tan.

637
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,480
Was he targeting the inspectors

638
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,640
or Gannandao?

639
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Liuniang, you just came back

640
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,160
and may not know

641
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,720
what had happened in Xiang'an.

642
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,400
Mingsheng Temple,
where Princess Runing resides,

643
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,720
is often visited

644
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,640
by the carriages of Princess of Valor.

645
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,880
Princess Runing and Princess Yong'an?

646
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,680
His Majesty is young and slow to speak.

647
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:46,240
How much longer can the Empress Dowager
reign over Dacang?

648
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:47,640
Nowadays, many people believe

649
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,320
that the Princess of Valor is more likely

650
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,880
to gain power than Prince Xian.

651
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:53,920
Has Princess Runing decided

652
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,960
to support the Princess of Valor?

653
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,040
Princess Runing

654
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,240
holds the highest status in the Xiao family.

655
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,440
If she takes a stance,

656
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,840
it'll surely change the dynamics in the court.

657
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,800
Moreover, the reconstruction of the Ming Hall

658
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,160
was close to an end,

659
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,000
yet they slowed it down.

660
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,200
You can even say that

661
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,360
they've stopped the work.

662
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:11,880
It happened shortly after we returned

663
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,920
from Gannandao?

664
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
Also,

665
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
Xiang'an has seen

666
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,560
a lot more foreigners
from Nanlang and Xichen recently.

667
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:18,640
Each thing may seem

668
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,960
quite random on its own.

669
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,040
But if you connect them…

670
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,240
Could there be

671
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,680
some connections there?

672
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,760
Liuniang.

673
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,000
I stand by what I said.

674
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,760
So many people in the court

675
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,360
are watching you and your husband.

676
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,160
I bet you know that.

677
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,720
I won't blame you if you decide

678
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,720
not to help me.

679
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,960
Mr. Xu,

680
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,240
we survived multiple attacks

681
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:43,320
on the way back from Yingzhou

682
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:46,320
thanks to the help of the inspectors.

683
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:47,600
If not for this token,

684
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,640
I wouldn't be able to see you today.

685
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:51,720
It's time to return it

686
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,120
to its rightful owner.

687
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,680
Liuniang.

688
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,840
Sun Tan may not come out
of the Imperial Inspectorate

689
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,800
unscathed.

690
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,400
But if he has been wronged

691
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,960
or has something to say,

692
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,080
I will surely help him.

693
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,240
Can you help me

694
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,400
see him?

695
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,760
I will draft an application

696
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,280
to be the presiding judge right now.

697
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,880
Sun Tan may be locked up
in the Imperial Inspectorate,

698
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,440
but the presiding judge

699
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:29,200
should at least be able to question him.

700
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,920
Liuniang.

701
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:37,880
I will join you.

702
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,360
He's… he's bleeding so much.

703
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:57,880
Will he die?

704
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
Do you think anyone

705
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,280
would care about his life and death here?

706
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:05,400
Go back and wait for me if you're scared.

707
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:10,679
I am Yan Xing,

708
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,560
Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice,

709
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,159
who's presiding over Sun Tan's case.

710
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:16,280
I'm here to summon Sun Tan for interrogation.

711
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,520
Sun Tan is under custody here.

712
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,000
I'm afraid you have no right to summon him.

713
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,400
Can I at least interrogate him in the cell?

714
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,712
Only two people are allowed in.

715
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:46,440
Wait for me at the Ministry of Justice.

716
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:49,840
Then I'll wait for you outside.

717
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:55,592
[Imperial Inspectorate]

718
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,368
Marshal Sun.

719
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,120
Marshal Sun.

720
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:33,160
Marshal Sun.

721
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,160
It's me.

00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,872
Yan Xing.

723
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,040
Have you joined that villain?

724
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,000
I am made the presiding judge.

725
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,160
I'm here to do you justice.

726
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,680
The Imperial Inspectorate

727
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,160
accuses you of accepting bribes

728
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:58,560
and colluding with bandits.

729
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,560
Tell me if you're wronged.

730
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,640
I'll report it.

731
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,912
It's pointless.

732
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
It's pointless.

733
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,680

00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,120
Marshal Xu and the other inspectors

735
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,000
will risk their lives to rescue you.

736
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
I will also give it my all

737
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,680
to seek justice for you.

744
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,840
is still waiting for you.

748
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,520
Okay.

749
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,680
Okay, I'll take notes.

750
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,920
Most of the inspectors
came from all walks of life.

751
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:49,440
We were all captivated by Marshal Xu's aura

752
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,280
and joined the group as inspectors.

753
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:53,800
In Gannandao,

754
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,200
I naturally hoped to build wide connections

755
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,720
with the talented as Marshal Xu did.

756
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:00,920
So-called "collusion with bandits".

757
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,240
What about accepting the bribes?

758
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,800
This I can't deny.

759
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,040
I did take money.

760
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,680
Gannandao has many merchants coming and going.

761
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:13,720
We inspectors

762
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,600
protect them from bandits.

763
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,520
They pay us to show their gratitude.

764
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:20,880
I used that money

765
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,880
to treat my buddies.

766
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
You can defend yourself and find the merchants

767
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,960
to testify for you

768
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,240
to get a lighter sentence.

769
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,240
Liuniang.

770
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,760
How come you just don't get it?

771
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:38,200
Lai Luozhi wants to take out the leader
of the inspectors in Gannandao.

772
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,440
Marshal Sun.

773
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:44,120
Do you know the reason?

774
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:46,000
After Mo Qianzhi died,

775
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,720
Lai Luozhi put his people

776
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,840
in Yingzhou as officials.

777
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,920
Gannandao is on a key location at the border

778
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,680
leading directly to Xichen.

779
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,000
People can even take a detour

780
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:57,760
via Gannandao all the way from Nanlang.

781
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:00,240
Without the inspectors there,

782
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,560
the border…

783
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,160
Xiang'an has seen

784
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,000
a lot more foreigners from Nanlang and Xichen.

785
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,840
It seems Lai Luozhi

786
00:39:09,840 --> 00:39:12,200
intends to dominate Gannandao.

787
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,440
But what he's aiming for

788
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,000
is far beyond that area.

789
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,920
He's probably plotting with foreign powers

790
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:19,160
to commit treason.

791
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,360
Marshal Xu.

792
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:29,040
You'll need evidence even if

793
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,520
you want to frame me.

794
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,160
Mrs. Shen.

795
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,760
You came to visit my workplace,

796
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,480
yet you kept slandering me.

797
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,000
It really put me in a difficult position.

798
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,080
As the presiding judge of this case,

799
00:39:50,080 --> 00:39:53,000
I tried the main suspect Sun Tan

800
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,240
and recorded his testimony
based on the procedure.

801
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,400
The inspector accompanied me for assistance.

802
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:59,080
There was nothing inappropriate.

803
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,600
Is that so?

804
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,360
Mrs. Shen seems to have
become more sharp-tongued.

805
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,680
That was the preliminary trial.

806
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,280
Once I organize the case files
and hand in the report,

807
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,440
I will be back for the second trial.

808
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
Vice Minister Lai, you are obliged to ensure

809
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:15,720
the safety of the suspect.

810
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,800
It depends on his fate.

811
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,560
No one can be guaranteed

812
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:29,000
to stay alive in our jail here.

813
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,848
How dare you!

814
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,040
Marshal Xu.

815
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,120
Director Yan.

816
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,280
Go back.

817
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,720
I don't intend to keep you

818
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,800
and Mrs. Shen here today.

819
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,360
Don't be so nervous.

820
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,720
However, I do have a word of advice.

821
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:20,160
The criminals arrested

822
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:23,480
by the Imperial Inspectorate
won't be freed so easily.

823
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,640
You'd better think twice

824
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,840
about what to note down,

825
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:30,080
what to report,

826
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,840
and what to keep to yourselves.

827
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:55,138
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

828
00:41:55,138 --> 00:41:58,815
