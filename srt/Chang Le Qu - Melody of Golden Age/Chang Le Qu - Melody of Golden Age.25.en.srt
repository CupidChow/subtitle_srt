This

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,240
is probably a threat too.

19
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,480
If we continue to investigate

20
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,920
and stop them from causing trouble,

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,160
then you and your loved ones

22
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:58,680
might encounter an unforeseen disaster.

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,480
How can you tell Madam this?

24
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,120
Do you want her to worry?

25
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,680
With her intelligence,

26
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:23,080
it's only a matter of time
before she figures this out.

Don't push yourself too hard.

I really don't have the energy

50
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:17,560
to argue with you.

51
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,560
Alright.

00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,120

Shen Du.

55
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,520
I enjoy investigating cases.

56
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,600
I can lose myself in pursuit of the truth,

57
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,160
but I don't want to involve my family.

58
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,880
The Huo'e Sect

59
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,280
wrote the words on the body
to send me messages.

60
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,800
They had everything planned out,

61
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,280
deliberately putting on a show to us.

62
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,760
They are warning us.

63
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,000
This is a warning.

64
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Are you afraid that further investigation

65
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,560
might involve your family?

66
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,160
In Xiang'an,

67
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,560
if we hadn't arrived in time,

68
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,720
Caiwei and the others would have died.

69
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,104
If…

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,200
If when I was in Yingzhou,

71
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:21,240
they really wanted to harm my family,

72
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,320
what should I do then?

73
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,680
We are so far away.

74
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,600
How can I keep them safe?

75
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,480
I've been thinking for two hours,

76
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,800
and I don't come up with any solution.

77
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,400
If you want to,

78
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,960
I can arrange for a carriage
to take you back to Xiang'an.

79
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,520
About the matter in Yingzhou,

80
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,160
you should stay out of it.

81
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,840
What about you? What will you do?

82
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,960
Me?

83
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,320
Do you want me

84
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,520
to escort you back to your home?

85
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,320
We cannot go back.

86
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,840
You are the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards,

87
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
and I am a Chief Clerk
of the Ministry of Justice.

88
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,320
We're here

89
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,440
on a task.

90
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,200
I knew

91
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,640
you would definitely not leave.

92
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,640
A moment of emotion

93
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,640
will not affect your passion
for the case investigation.

94
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
Don't act like you know me well.

95
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,440
Now you are back.

96
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,680
This is the Yan Xing I know,

97
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,360
being eloquent and mean.

98
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,480
You are stubborn

99
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,520
and don't fear those in power.

100
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,400
I…

101
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
I know you're worried about your family.

102
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,600
I assure you

103
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
that what you are worried about

104
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:38,720
will definitely not happen.

105
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,160
Before coming to Gannandao,

106
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,680
I made some arrangements in advance.

107
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,080
So far,

108
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,600
everything is under control.

109
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,840
Do you remember the letter from Xiang'an?

110
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:52,080
An urgent letter from Xiang'an.

111
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,880
Who sent it?

112
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,360
Madam Xu.

113
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,760
Of course I remember.

114
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,720
Every year during the Winter Clothing Festival,

115
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,920
the Empress Dowager

116
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:08,520
will go to the Li Mountain Hot Spring Resort
to have a holiday,

117
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,960
and reward some officials' family members

118
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,600
to accompany her.

119
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,240
Madam Xu's letter informed me

120
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
that she's already

121
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,920
put the Yan family on the list.

122
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,080
Within the sight of the Empress Dowager,

123
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,040
I don't think anyone

124
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,120
dare to create trouble.

125
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,000
Well well, Shen Du.

126
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,240
But then again,

127
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,400
there is indeed something

128
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,120
that is not that important

129
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,679
yet anyway,

130
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:40,192
related to you.

131
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:41,559
What's the matter?

132
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:43,240
Ji Dafu, brother-in-law
of the headless body suspect,

133
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,640
is here.

134
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,880
This Ji Dafu is very special,

135
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,400
because both the victim and the suspect
are his wife's brother.

136
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
Please

137
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,840
[Ji Dafu]
spare me.

138
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,400
When will

139
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,280
my brother-in-law's case be settled?

140
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,360
You can't find the head.

141
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
Alright.

142
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,280
Let's just bury the body
and let the dead rest in peace.

143
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Ji Dafu.

144
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,520
Be patient.

145
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,400
The case is still under investigation.

146
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,080
Governor Mo, were you looking for me?

147
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
I've heard that you have

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,840
some ideas for this case.

149
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,400
There's something unusual about this case.

150
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I am still investigating.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,640
I suggest

152
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,520
investigating this case

153
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,840
with the bride case.

154
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:25,440
If we do so,

155
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,760
the investigation will take more time.

156
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,960
- Then I fear…
- Mr. Pan.

157
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,280
What do you mean?

158
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,400
I don't think you deserve

159
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,080
to be the top detective.

160
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
And you've set a rule
of never meeting with the employer.

161
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,080
I think you just don't want

162
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,240
to be embarrassed.

163
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,440
Today, in front of Mr. Mo,

164
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,040
tell me

165
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,840
whether you can solve the case
and catch the murderer

166
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:46,960
within five days.

167
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,760
If you can't, refund the money to me,

168
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,080
so I can find someone else.

169
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,360
If I can't solve the case,
I will refund the money.

170
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,720
But I'm close to finding out
who the murderer is.

171
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,880
Who is the murderer?

172
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,600
The murderer is

173
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,320
Half-faced Demon.

174
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:04,800
In order not to refund the money,

175
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,000
that friend of yours

176
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,240
said something about demonology,

177
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,080
and it really worked.

178
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,440
After hearing it, Ji Dafu

179
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,840
was terrified and then left.

180
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:18,280
But as for Governor Mo,

181
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,160
he wasn't so easy to bluff.

182
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,200
Mr. Pan.

183
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,320
I have already reported the bride case
to the Ministry of Justice

184
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,400
to get it closed.

185
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,360
Governor Mo.

186
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,824
I have provided a new statement.

187
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,360
I have read it.

188
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,680
Then why did you close the case so hastily?

189
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,720
Xu Jize has a new testimony,

190
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,680
which might get a lighter sentence.

191
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,520
The eyeless body case is clearly complicated,

192
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,120
and it's connected to the headless body case.

193
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,600
Mr. Pan

194
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
This is not Xiang'an.

195
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,280
This is not Xiang'an.

196
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:06,600
This is Yingzhou, which had been
caught in military disaster for decades.

197
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,360
The situation in Yingzhou is unstable.

198
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Although a prefecture is established,

199
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,880
still, Xichen is covetously eyeing us.

200
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:13,000
In the history,

201
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,800
Yingzhou has been invaded
by Xichen multiple times.

202
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
To pacify the turmoil in the Western Regions

203
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,160
and prevent the war from arising,

204
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,120
we have to unite the people.

205
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,560
However, do you know

206
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,920
what matters to unite the people?

207
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,800
Please tell me.

208
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,080
What matters

209
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,920
is the lasting peace and stability.

210
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,560
It's about eradicating crimes with strict laws,

211
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,680
solving every case,

212
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,080
and catching every criminal.

213
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,720
We need to convince people

214
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,920
that as long as the officials of Dacang

215
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,160
are here for one day,

216
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,600
Yingzhou is a city where people

217
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,400
can live with peace of mind.

218
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,520
So,

219
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,240
troubled times call for harsh laws.

220
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,040
Xu Jize's head

221
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,760
is destined to be hung on the gate tower

222
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,280
and becomes the one that deters others, right?

223
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,280
Er Laipi is extremely vicious,

224
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,480
deserving to die.

225
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,520
No further investigation needed.

226
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:11,920
Xu Jize

227
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,080
raped a married woman,

228
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,760
is doubly guilty.

229
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,120
And he broke the frontier law.

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,120
Death penalty is inevitable.

231
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
However, I can promise you

232
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,800
to let him die peacefully

233
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,120
and I won't let his head

234
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,000
be hung on the gate tower.

235
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
You told me this matter

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,760
in such detail.

237
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,840
You're not just to tell me

238
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:38,440
how embarrassed Pan Chi was, right?

239
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,040
You want to tell me

240
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,240
to be more understanding of Governor Mo

241
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,800
intervening in the case

242
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,200
and being eager to close the case.

243
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:52,840
His view

244
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,920
is destined not to be the same as us,

245
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,680
who are solely pursuing the truth of the case.

246
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,600
You want to tell me

247
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,120
to pay more attention

248
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,520
to the situation of Governor Mo.

249
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,560
Must not doubt

250
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,160
that he has a heart for the people.

251
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,400
I want to tell you

252
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,720
that people are complicated.

253
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,800
Don't jump to conclusions that quickly.

00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,520
How much do you

257
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,640
trust Mo Qianzhi?

258
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,240
He was the person I trusted the most.

259
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,920
And now?

260
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,152
Now…

261
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,752
Now…

262
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,840
he's the one I wanted to trust the most.

263
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,680
Anyone who wants to find out the truth

264
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,200
is bound to go through

265
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,960
what you are going through now.

266
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,880
No matter how small the details are,

267
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:12,200
or how close the people are,

268
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,840
first of all, don't be afraid to doubt.

269
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:17,360
You have to verify them.

270
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,480
Trust

271
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
may also

272
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,920
be a power for investigation.

273
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:30,400
The Huo'e Sect has deeply rooted in Yingzhou.

274
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:33,080

I…

293
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,680
am here to walk a pigeon.

294
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,720
Walk a pigeon?

Do you know the specialty of this shop

297
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,000
is roast baby pigeon?

298
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:27,240
But then again,

299
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:31,280
don't you think you're being cruel

300
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,280
to the pigeon?

301
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,880

00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,800
Are you

306
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,320
drowning your sorrows in liquor here
because Ji Dafu said you're incapable

but bad news spreads far and wide.

310
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,200
I don't care about Ji Dafu at all,

311
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:19,440
so I don't take his words seriously.

312
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:21,119
Then because

313
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,280
the case is closed?

314
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:24,720
I heard you got a new statement
on the bride case.

315
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,839
Anything new?

316
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,200
New?

317
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,960
Nothing new.

00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,960
Just some useless statements.

However, to collect the evidence,

320
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,520
I went to the cell to see Xu Jize.

Mr. Pan.

you're not serving as an official
in the Ministry of Justice,

375
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,240
Because

376
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,080
he's a merchant.

377
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,480
So Li Zimo was the same as me.

378
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,240
Later, Li Hongfa spent a lot of money

379
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
to whitewash himself

380
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,080
as the one from a noble class.

381
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,080
Then, Li Zimo could apply for the examination.

382
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,160
So you decided

383
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,360
to stop committing crimes,

384
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,160
and then started arguing with Er Laipi.

385
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
Yes.

386
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,080
We had a pretty fierce argument.

387
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,920
Later on, we stopped
because we might be followed.

388
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,920
But from beginning to end,

389
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:37,760
I've been meaning to send Miss Du back.

390
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,960
But a murder had happened.

391
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,360
I really did not kill Er Laipi.

392
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:45,280
I almost returned Du Xiaowan unscathed.

393
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,600
I will report exactly what you said today,

394
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,520
as a reference for sentencing.

395
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,400
According to the law,

396
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,680
it does get you a little lighter sentence.

397
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,640
But in my heart,

398
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,640
you are a true coward.

399
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,200
When the brave are angry,

400
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,120
they would go against the strong.

401
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,560
When the cowards are angry,

402
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,280
they would go against the weak.

403
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:08,320
You dared not touch those
who are powerful and truly oppress you,

404
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:09,400
yet you laid a hand

405
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:12,720
on those weak women.

406
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,560
This is not revenge.

407
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:18,440
You're nothing but a coward
who's afraid of the strong.

408
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,480
My sentence has settled.

409
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,320
I will surely die.

410
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,080
You've just arrived in Yingzhou.

411
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,120
You don't understand Governor Mo.

412
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,000
From the day that I got caught,

413
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:38,200
I had no intention
of getting out of here alive.

414
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,360
You're right.

415
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,720
I deserve it.

416
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,920
I brought this upon myself.

417
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,480
No.

418
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:46,840
I should never have been born.

419
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,320
In my next life,

420
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,120
I'd rather be

421
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:59,320
an illiterate farmer,

422
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,640
than be

423
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,320
a knowledgeable

424
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,240
scholar.

425
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,160
Stop drinking.

426
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,600
Owner, don't serve him any more wine.

427
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,800
Get him a bowl of mutton soup noodles.

428
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:39,944
Alright.

429
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,160
Here, enjoy.

430
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,720
The mutton from the Gannandao

431
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
is really delicious.

432
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,360
Trust me.

433
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,120
Instead of drowning your sorrows in liquor,

434
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
better to soothe them
with a bowl of noodle soup.

435
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,768
Give it a try.

436
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:23,040
How is it?

437
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,200
It tastes really good.

438
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,720
See? I didn't lie to you.

439
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,560
Laughing heartily under the open sky.

440
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,840
Striding high across the divine land.

441
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,280
Though the noble prize themselves,

442
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,680
I regard them as mere dust.

443
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:46,640
Though the lowly demean themselves,

444
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:49,000
who says they aren't important.

445
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,840
Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains.

446
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,560
Washing my feet in the long river.

447
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,440
Liuniang.

448
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,280
Why are you suddenly saying this?

449
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,920
I just think

450
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:05,040
that this poem is grand,

451
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,400
revealing with just a few words

452
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,160
the reality of oppression against
those from humble backgrounds.

453
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,480
It's so exhilarating.

454
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,600
Once this poem was released,

455
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,880
it spread through the teahouses
and taverns of the Imperial City.

456
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,600
And even at that time,

457
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,200
when those young noble classes of Xiang'an City

458
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,560
went out to eat,

459
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,160
didn't dare to show off,

460
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:23,080
fearing to stir up the anger
from the commoners.

461
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,720
You've said so much.

462
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,720
You don't just want
to praise my literary talent, right?

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,920
Of course not.

464
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:32,920
More than this.

465
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:35,280
I admire your courage.

466
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,000
As long as one always

467
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
has the courage
to confront the rotten authority,

468
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,680
sometimes a single phrase,

469
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:41,960
or even a poem,

470
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,720
can hold great power.

471
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:47,600
I know.

472
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,720
You are disappointed by the situation

473
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,400
those from humble backgrounds
are facing in Dacang.

474
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,360
But as long as none of us gives up,

475
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,440
I believe

476
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,520
there will always be one day that those talents

477
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,720
who are from humble background will be valued.

478
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,520
I wonder

479
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,960
if this bowl of noodles is delicious,

480
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,400
or if it's your words,

481
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:15,400
has motivated me.

482
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,920
I feel refreshed right now,

483
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,920
and can investigate ten more cases.

484
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,080
No, no.

485
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
We can't get more cases

486
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,280
in Gannandao.

487
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:25,800
I have no time to rest now.

488
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:29,280
I can't hold on with more cases.

489
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,240
There's something

490
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,480
I want to tell you.

491
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:40,320
If you are abused,

492
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
don't tolerate it.

493
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,480
People say no one can escape from White Ghost.

494
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,480
In my opinion, Shen Du is just a paper tiger.

495
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,720
If you want to,

496
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:52,360
I will definitely do everything

497
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:53,920
to help you escape.

498
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,760
Have you misunderstood something?

499
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,360
No one has abused me.

500
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,880
No one has abused you?

501
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,600
How did you get the wound on your forehead?

502
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,680
Whenever I see you,

503
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,960
you'll have a new wound and an old one.

504
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:09,480
Didn't you get that wound at the Shen Mansion?

505
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:15,480
Indeed, I got this wound at the Shen Mansion.

506
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:26,600
How should I put it?

507
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,840
Anyway,

508
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,520
Shen Du really hasn't abused me.

509
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,440
I married into the Shen Mansion
as a substitute bride,

510
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,600
it's somewhat absurd,

511
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,080
and not what he wanted,

512
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,440
but overall,

513
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,320
Shen Du is a decent husband.

514
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,440
He takes good care of me and my family.

515
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,080
Moreover,

516
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,960
I will leave him sooner or later.

517
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,200
Whether it's Shen Du,

518
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,160
or me,

519
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,800
both are well aware

520
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,440
that this day will soon arrive.

521
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,888
Why?

522
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,400
Because he has someone in his heart,

523
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,560
and that is not me.

524
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,280
This position

525
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:29,920
was never meant to be mine.

526
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,240
Madam, Governor Mo knows
you are busy at official duties,

527
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,200
and has specially invited you to come
to the most famous hot springs in Yingzhou,

528
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,560
Yixi Hot Spring, for rest and relaxation.

529
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,680
Madam.

530
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:52,160
The Yixi Hot Spring is no less than
the royal Li Mountain Hot Spring.

531
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,440
It is the water of a thousand years

532
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,640
from Xiling Mountain,

533
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,400
accompanied by natural geothermal heat.

534
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,760
Dozens of spices

535
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,320
are added to the hot spring.

536
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,920
It's perfect

537
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,520
for both men and women.

538
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,480
The efficacy is well known.

539
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:07,640
Around the Gannandao,

540
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,160
couples wishing for children

541
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,120
will come to this hot spring to soak.

542
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,040
Thank you for the introduction.

543
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,040
You have worked hard guiding me all the way.

544
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,240
Please go rest.

545
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,320
No, no.

546
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,560
I haven't assisted you with the gauze clothes.

547
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,928
Who is it?

548
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,384
It's me.

549
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,280
Why are you here?

550
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,992
Well,

551
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,360
to take a soak.

552
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,880
This is for women.

553
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,480
You should soak somewhere else.

554
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,320
There's only one Yixi Hot Spring.

555
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,360
It's for both men and women.

556
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:09,360
Besides, Yingzhou Prefecture arranged

557
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,040
us to soak together.

558
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,440
If we were separate,

559
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,200
it would be strange.

560
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,160
What would those outside think?

561
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,320
Those outside?

562
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,360
Outside, there are a few maids and servants.

563
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,840
Even if it's just for show,

564
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:25,160
I have to soak with you.

565
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,760
I'm coming down.

566
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,200
Wait, wait.

567
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,680
Don't come down yet.

568
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,280
Turn your back,

569
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,480
and close your eyes.

570
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,840
Are you too shy

571
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,360
to soak with me?

572
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,440
No way.

573
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,560
I was afraid you'd be coy

574
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,920
and make me feel awkward.

575
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:30,360
Alright, you can open your eyes now.

576
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,808
Come down now.

577
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Now I can't see anything.

578
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,080
Where should I come down from?

579
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,240
Oh no. He can't see things in dark.

580
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,320
I should have left one light for him

581
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,160
until he comes down.

582
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,720
Just wait.

583
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,760
Let me help you.

584
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,760
You said there's always someone in my heart.

585
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,280
Who is that person?

586
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
Mo Xiuxiu.

587
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,840
No way.

588
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,120
That would expose me to eavesdropping

589
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,840
on him and Mo Qianzhi.

590
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:33,160
Shen Du.

591
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,960
Why would you eavesdrop on me?

592
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,320
Can't you ask openly?

593
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,840
I am asking now.

594
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,760
Do you answer?

595
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
Of course, I do.

596
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
I've heard

597
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
you don't get close to women.

598
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,240
I deeply agree with this.

599
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,400
In the Shen Mansion,

600
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,560
not to mention the concubines,

601
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,880
even maids are few.

602
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,720
And,

603
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,080
you always scorn on me.

604
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,600
Doesn't that explain it?

605
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,080
I don't get close to women

606
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,520
because I already have a girl I like

607
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,800
in my heart.

608
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,560
Then I've misunderstood.

609
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,160
I met her

610
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,200
when we were little.

611
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,640
I have kept

612
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,840
her wicker piglet till now.

613
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:03,320
Because of her,

614
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,840
I could survive

615
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,040
in the detention center.

616
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,400
It's her.

617
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,400
Thanks to Mo Xiuxiu's brother pled for him,

618
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,000
so he was spared the death penalty

619
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,200
and sent to the detention center.

620
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:17,960
Every night,

621
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,240
she would sneak into the back garden

622
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,920
and bring me comfort and food.

623
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:39,200
In those dark days,

624
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,880
that's the light I waited for every night.

625
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,120
I don't even know her name,

626
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:52,280
nor have I ever clearly seen her face.

627
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,720
And the only gift I gave her

628
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,480
was a brass whistle.

629
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,320
This whistle was given to me by my father.

630
00:34:34,199 --> 00:34:36,480
I remember she told me,

631
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,719
one day,

632
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,159
she'll take me out with honor and integrity.

633
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:42,400
One day,

634
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,239
I will overturn the case for the Shen family

635
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:47,239
and take you out with honor and integrity.

636
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,120
I didn't see her again

637
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,800
for years.

638
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:01,440
It's like she just disappeared.

639
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,480
Until one day,

640
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,440
just as if it were fated,

641
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,280
she became my wife.

642
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:29,640
♫ Endless long night, the moonlight reflects
on the western window ♫

643
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:31,640
But the funny thing

644
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,080
is I that had no idea

645
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,520
she was the girl in my heart.

646
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,840
Later on, I found it out.

647
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,680
I hope it's not too late.

648
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,600
I want to tell her.

649
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,320
In my heart,

650
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:02,000
from beginning to end,

651
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:06,680
it's always been her.

♫ I can't forget every memory ♫

653
00:36:23,653 --> 00:36:27,942
♫ From desolation to a poem ♫

654
00:36:27,942 --> 00:36:33,779
♫ Watching the past, through the misty rain,
until the clear skies ♫

♫ Love is shining in each other's eyes ♫

00:36:45,011 --> 00:36:49,376
♫ Words can't express how much I love you ♫

658

♫ Day by day, we probe and test ♫

- I…
- You…

673
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,984
- You…
- I…

674
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,656
You go first.

675
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,760
How did you know

676
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,960
that I made that wicker piglet?

677
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:38,920
You've hesitated for so long on the way,

678
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,960
just want to ask this?

679
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,240
I've known from the start

680
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:58,480
that it wasn't made by Xiuxiu.

681
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,760
You're amazing.

682
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:20,320
I want to make one
for Du as a birthday gift too.

683
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,360
But no matter how,

684
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,600
I made it so ugly.

685
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:27,880
Can you switch with me?

686
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,120
Okay, take it.

687
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:34,160
Thank you, you are so kind.

688
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,680
[Shen Mansion]
On the day of my birthday,

689
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,000
I got the wicker piglet.

690
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,960
I wanted to thank you,

691
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:43,760
but then I learned
you had been taken away by your family.

692
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:49,400
I was so happy

693
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,800
that my dad didn't abandon me.

694
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:56,080
He arrived a little late on business trip.

695
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:59,000
I didn't notice anything else.

696
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:02,080
Unexpectedly,

697
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:06,640
you've kept the wicker piglet all along.

698
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,960
Later on,

699
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:13,360
the Shen family got confiscated.

700
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,040
This wicker piglet

701
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,080
became one of the few things

702
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:18,360
that I can keep.

703
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:22,040
So I've kept it all along.

704
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:26,160
It also reminds me

705
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,440
of those good old days

706
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:29,560
when my father taught me how to make it.

707
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,040
I only realized that this Liuniang

708
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,680
was Yan Liuniang recently.

709
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:52,712
Detention center.

710
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:56,560
You said you would come for me.

711
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,560
Why didn't you come later?

712
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,560
Because…

713
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,320
I crawled in through the dog hole

714
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,280
in the back garden.

715
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,360
Later, they discovered

716
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,360
this hole

717
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:20,320
and blocked it.

718
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,680
And later…

719
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,920
You didn't need me to come for you.

720
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:34,312
Thank you.

721
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:43,320
You still came to take me home.

♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

744
00:43:44,407 --> 00:43:47,440

00:43:50,666 --> 00:43:54,406
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

747
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:59,423
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

748
00:43:59,423 --> 00:44:02,303
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

749
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:06,591
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

750
00:44:06,591 --> 00:44:10,367
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

751
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,937
♫ Your palm lines ♫

752
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:14,687
♫ Your gaze ♫

753
00:44:14,687 --> 00:44:17,599
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

754
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:21,599

♫ Your palm lines ♫

757
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:30,007
♫ Your gaze ♫

758
00:44:30,007 --> 00:44:32,780
