16
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,540
You can't provide me with a worry-free household.

17
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,820
Nor do you prioritize me.

18
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,240
You're always trying to win and show off.

19
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:56,300
You're not a good partner for me.

20
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,760
What did you say?

21
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:25,040
So this is how you think of me?

22
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:39,340
Do you truly believe you are a good wife?

23
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,060
You never stop thinking about cases.

24
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:55,200
Have you ever considered what kind of wife a man would want?

25
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,680
You took your sister's place

26
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:01,300
and married me as a spy, to begin with.

27
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,080
Don't forget what we've agreed on.

28
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:12,600
It's been three months.

00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,484
I, Shen Du,

30
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,600
am determined to divorce you.

31
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:58,160
In that case,

32
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,680
let's divorce.

33
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,240
From now on,

34
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,640
I will go separate ways from you.

35
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:19,380
I will not have anything to do with you.

36
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,800
Nor will I have anything to do with the honor or disgrace of your family.

00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,560
What's wrong? You look so pale.

68
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,600
What happened?

00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,280

Shen Du.

75
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
Liuniang, you woke up.

76
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,520
You had a high fever.

77
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,039
I was so worried.

78
00:08:36,192 --> 00:08:37,840
Where are you going?

79
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
I'm going to find Shen Du.

80
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,440
You're not allowed.

81
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,280
Why would you go to that man?

82
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,760
You braved the snow to cry injustice for him.

83
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,120
What about him? He was finally released

84
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:50,680
but he didn't care about you.

85
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:53,064
He even…

86
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,080
Even what?

87
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,920
What happened to your throat?

88
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:59,560
Even what?

89
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,640
He even brought the divorce paper.

90
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
Mother.

91
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,360
Where is the divorce paper?

92
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,800
Where is the divorce paper, Mother?

93
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
Where is the divorce paper?

94
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,600
Where is the divorce paper, Mother?

95
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,640
Where is the divorce paper?

96
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,240
Where is the divorce paper?

97
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,640
Where is the divorce paper?

98
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:53,960
Mother.

99
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,600
I still don't believe it.

100
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,960
Great Chief Shen seems

101
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:17,200
so upright and unyielding.

102
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,800
How could he

103
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,280
submit to the Black Fiend?

104
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,600
Shen Du has led the Imperial Guards

105
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,960
to arrest many officials

106
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,920
who didn't join Lai Luozhi.

107
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
The Imperial Guards have been

108
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,400
reduced to the hunting dogs

109
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,800
of the Imperial Inspectorate.

110
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,760
He made such a choice.

111
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,280
- Then our Yan family…
- Mojie.

112
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,480
Since Shen Du has

113
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,440
even sent us the divorce paper,

114
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,000
then whatever he does from now on

115
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,240
has nothing to do with

116
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,920
our Yan family.

117
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,080
Under the current situation,

118
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,280
divorce may protect you

119
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,840
from the power struggle.

120
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,880
But Liuniang is probably
going to be heartbroken.

<i>[Changmo Pavilion]</i>

122
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,680
That's not the only heartbreaking news.

123
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:09,760
She's been friends with

124
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,960
the Marshal of Inspectors

00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,520
and Miss Yun Que.

126
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,080
They were executed for "committing treason"

127
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,480
by the Imperial Inspectorate

128
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:19,240
on the night they pleaded for her
in the palace.

129
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,440
Liuniang.

130
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,520
Mr. Xu and Yun Que

131
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:32,072
are dead?

132
00:11:38,176 --> 00:11:39,440
Liuniang.

133
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
You just got over the fever.

134
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,240
Are you out of your mind?

138
00:11:57,400 --> 00:12:00,360
I got you killed.

139
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,040
I owe you an apology.

140
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,320
Even if it hadn't been for you,

141
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,360
they would have died.

142
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,400
Shen Du.

143
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,480
Do not blame

144
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,880
their deaths on yourself.

145
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,000
You're not that important.

146
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,600
Xu Xiangren wanted

147
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,560
to find evidence
of Vice Minister Lai's treason.

148
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,000
So he had to die.

149
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:00,200
Did you really join Lai Luozhi?

150
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,360
You were released on the night when Mr. Xu

151
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
and Yun Que were killed.

152
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,384
Did you really…

153
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,640
Shen Du.

154
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,840
What happened to you?

155
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:27,120
Have you forgotten your aspirations?

156
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,680
Have you forgotten your family's case

157
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
and the dozens of your relatives

158
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,480
who had died from injustice?

159
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,928
I came today to advise you

160
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:50,040
not to cause unnecessary trouble.

161
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Think of the Yan family.

162
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,560
Sign the divorce paper.

163
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,200
Divorce me

164
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,800
with your blood.

165
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,520
For Mr. Xu and Yun Que.

166
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,480
For all those who died from injustice.

167
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,240
Shen Du.

168
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,520
From now on, you and I

169
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,800
will be strangers.

170
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,088

171
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,359
Liuniang.

172
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:20,440
What happened?

173
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,880
We went to the Yan Mansion.

174
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,360
Lady Jin said you weren't home.

175
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,320
So Jiang Langxing and I came to look for you.

176
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,120
You went to the graveyard?

177
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:40,600
Mr. Xu and Yun Que

178
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,840
died because of me.

179
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,560
Liuniang.

180
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,200
Don't say that.

181
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,120
Lai Luozhi hated Marshal Xu

182
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,160
because he had saved me.

183
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,480
Yet I left.

184
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,960
Marshal Xu and Yun Que

185
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,360
passed away in peace.

186
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:04,712
I think

187
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,920
they must be happy in heaven.

188
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,272
You're hurt.

189
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,280
Shen Du has made up his mind

190
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,640
to join forces with Lai Luozhi.

191
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,880
The White Ghost has teamed up with Lai Luozhi?

192
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:50,760
He is no longer the Shen Du I knew.

193
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,840
From now on,

194
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,480
I have nothing to do with him.

195
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,840
Liuniang.

196
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,568
Liuniang.

197
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:21,040
<i>[Shen Mansion]</i>

198
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,080
Since you are worried about Liuniang,

199
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,960
why don't you talk to her?

200
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,840
A mother knows her daughter.

201
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,600
Liuniang has been independent
since she was young.

202
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,520
It's a serious matter.

203
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,720
If we rush there to comfort her,

204
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,320
she will definitely put on a brave face

205
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,640
and hide her emotions

206
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,120
to prevent us from worrying.

207
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,040
Indeed.

208
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,960
Liuniang never lets us worry about her.

209
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,600
Women should never

210
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,040
keep all the bitterness, anger,

211
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,720
and sorrow to themselves.

212
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,000
We may end up ill.

213
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,400
Then let's leave her alone.

214
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Make do over there

215
00:22:21,560 --> 00:22:23,600
for the night.

216
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:29,600
If you want to stay,

217
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,160
there's still half a bed inside.

218
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,800
You can sleep on the inside.

219
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:41,549
<i>♫ Rushed encounters in time,
with shallow fates ♫</i>

220
00:22:41,549 --> 00:22:47,073
<i>♫ The winter in warm memories ♫</i>

221
00:22:47,584 --> 00:22:51,708
<i>♫ Never mind the destined solitary fate ♫</i>

222
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:56,482
<i>♫ Blazing a lifetime of splendor ♫</i>

223
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,560
<i>She became my wife</i>

224
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,800
<i>as if it was destined.</i>

225
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,960
<i>I want to tell her</i>

226
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:08,040
<i>that I've always</i>

227
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,840
<i>loved no one but her</i>

228
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,151
<i>from the beginning.</i>

<i>♫ He said he loves her ♫</i>

230
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,240
You can't provide me

231
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,080
with a worry-free household.

232
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,440
Nor do you prioritize me.

233
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,000
You're always trying to win

234
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,440
and show off.

235
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:30,040
You're not a good partner for me.

236
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:32,680
It's been three months.

237
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,120
I, Shen Du,

238
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:36,960
am determined to divorce you.

239
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,315
<i>♫ Love is pure and flawless in essence ♫</i>

240
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:43,132

00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:48,392
<i>♫ Let's be together ♫</i>

242
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,320
Haven't she eaten anything?

243
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,440
Not a single bite.

244
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:07,560
She wouldn't take the medicine,

245
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,080
bandage the wound on the hand,

246
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,640
or even open the door.

247
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,000
What should we do?

248
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,680
I've just gotten divorced myself.

249
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,040
I've been doing so well.

250
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:18,960
Life is much better than before.

251
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,280
Maybe I can talk to Liuniang.

252
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,360
Very good.

253
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,720
Father.

254
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:25,920
Father, something's wrong.

255
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,760
I went to buy candied fruits for Liuniang

256
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,360
and saw Imperial Inspectorate officers

257
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:32,000
all around our mansion.

258
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:37,760
Are you sure they're from
the Imperial Inspectorate?

259
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,440
I've been working for the Imperial Guards.

260
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,600
I can recognize

261
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,600
the scouts and spies.

262
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,040
The Imperial Inspectorate

263
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,920
is watching us.

264
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,920
It's a man-made disaster.

265
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,960
A man-made disaster.

266
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,520
I've served the court for years,

267
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,840
but I've never seen anything like this.

268
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,200
Things are unpredictable in the court.

269
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:02,840
Lai Luozhi is solely in charge.

270
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,000
Shen Du has just divorced Liuniang,

271
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,960
and he's sided with Lai Luozhi.

272
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,000
What does that mean?

273
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,360
What does it mean?

274
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
It means that

275
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:15,480
we are in trouble.

276
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,960
Your Majesty,

277
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,280
the Start of Spring is upon us.

278
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:20,200
We should start preparing for this year's

279
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,120
grand assembly of all the officials.

280
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,520
Here's the charter drafted
by the Ministry of Personnel

281
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,960
and the Ministry of Rites

282
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,360
based on the precedents.

283
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,240
Officials and military commanders

284
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:31,080
will return to Xiang'an

285
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,520
to pay tribute and report on their duties.

286
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
However, since Your Majesty's ascension,

287
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,760
the annual grand assembly

288
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,880
has always been scheduled
for the second day of the second month.

289
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,880
But this year,

290
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,480
the Empress Dowager is unwell.

291
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
Should we reschedule the ceremony
for a different date?

292
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,720
The grand assembly

293
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,480
is the annual event to settle
the court affairs, which involves officials

294
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,120
from outside the capital,

295
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,360
and commanders guarding the border.

296
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,200
It should not be easily rescheduled.

297
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,760
We shall proceed as usual.

298
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:08,360
If the Empress Dowager

299
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:10,240
has not recovered by then,

300
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,920
then I shall

301
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:13,160
accompany His Majesty

302
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,680
to preside over the grand assembly.

303
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,160
Vice Minister Lai.

304
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,920
Do you really intend to

305
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,400
stand in for the Empress Dowager

306
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,160
to preside over the grand assembly?

307
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,840
Why not?

308
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,160
Vice Minister Lai.

309
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:32,640
The grand assembly
is the annual gathering of all officials,

310
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
which showcases the emperor's authority

311
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,360
and the royal family's dignity.

312
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,520
The Empress Dowager
is regent behind the curtain

313
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:41,840
to complete the duties
on behalf of His Majesty.

314
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,320
On what grounds will you
preside over the assembly?

315
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,600
The Empress Dowager trusts me.

316
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,920
She has entrusted me to oversee

317
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,920
the works of all officials.

318
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,320
I must therefore shoulder

319
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:56,800
the responsibility of settling court affairs.

320
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,320
I think

321
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:04,400
Your Majesty would certainly welcome my company

322
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,960
to preside over the grand assembly

323
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,520
and receive officials
and generals from all regions.

324
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,480
His Majesty is inviting Vice Minister Lai.

325
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:22,960
During the grand assembly,

326
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,120
His Majesty clearly
wishes for Vice Minister Lai

327
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,600
to stand by his side.

328
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,720
That's right. The Empress Dowager
allows Vice Minister Lai

329
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,440
to oversee all officials.

330
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,480
It is to be expected for him

331
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,680
to preside over the grand assembly.

332
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:39,120
Naturally, it is to be expected
for Vice Minister Lai

333
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:41,360
to preside over the grand assembly.

334
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,040
You despicable beings!

335
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,280
You're shameless enough to tell blatant lies.

336
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,400
And you.

337
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,720
Lai Luozhi.

338
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,800
You aspire to overstep your bounds.

339
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Your intentions to steal the throne

340
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:53,840
are blatant!

341
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:56,080
Great Chief Shen.

342
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,800
You haven't said a word today.

343
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,080
Why don't you tell me

344
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,520
how the Imperial Guards
should deal with someone

345
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,520
who insults a high official in court

346
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,760
based on your regulations?

347
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,840
Those who insult high officials

348
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,800
shall be put in our prison

349
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:15,000
for the water torture.

350
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,480
Alright, let's proceed with that.

351
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,360
Shen Du, you…

352
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,720
Great Chief Shen.

353
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,720
Since when did you

354
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,320
submit yourself to Lai Luozhi?

355
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,120
Prime Minister Zhang.

356
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:31,680
Princess of Valor.
You seem to have something against me.

357
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Are you scared that

358
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,720
I would expose

359
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,520
your despicable dealings?

360
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,200
What are you talking about?

361
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,280
Princess of Valor and Prime Minister Zhang

362
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,480
colluded with the rebels of Gannandao

363
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,000
to plot treason.

364
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
Lai Luozhi.

365
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,960
Do not slender us.

366
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,000
Lai Luozhi.

367
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,960
Vice Minister Lai.

368
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:56,240
You have always
suppressed officials who oppose you.

369
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:00,520
It's finally my turn today.

370
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,520
But evidence matters the most.

371
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,960
Do you think you can

372
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:06,080
invert right and wrong in broad daylight?

373
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,720
Evidence? Of course, there is evidence.

374
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,440
I've obtained the brochure

375
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,560
handed in by the convict Mo Qianzhi

376
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:14,080
from the Imperial Guards.

377
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,640
It keeps a clear record of everything,

378
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,360
allowing no room for your rebuttal.

379
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:20,520
You…

380
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,880
Am I right, Great Chief Shen?

381
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,520
Based on Mo Qianzhi's testimony,

382
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,800
the Princess of Valor colluded with
the stationed troops of Gannandao.

383
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,480
Prime Minister Zhang let his subordinates

384
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,120
embezzle the funds of Gannandao.

385
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:34,480
They should be put under house arrest

386
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,880
for a thorough investigation.

387
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,840
I am a royalty.

388
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,280
How dare you confine me?

389
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,800
Where are the Imperial Personal Guards?

390
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:56,400
Imperial Personal Guards!

391
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,920
Princess of Valor.

392
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:04,480
Can't you tell?

393
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,480
Half of the people in the court of Dacang

394
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,840
have pledged loyalty to Lai Luozhi.

395
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:20,040
Given your status,

396
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,360
you two should walk out

397
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600
to keep some dignity.

398
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,240
Do I have to call the Imperial Guards

399
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,040
and the Imperial Inspectorate Officers

400
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,080
to arrest you two?

401
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,640
Shen Du, you traitor!

402
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:34,320
You actually colluded with the Black Fiend.

403
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,360
All of you

404
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,600
treacherous scoundrels

405
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,880
who invert right and wrong.

406
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,240
You shall perish.

407
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,200
You shall perish.

408
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,200
Who would have thought?

409
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,720
I wear my heart on my sleeve

410
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:57,160
to repay the kindness of His Majesty
and the Empress Dowager.

411
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,720
Yet I'm slandered by these

412
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,520
ignorant people.

413
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,360
Now that I shoulder

414
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,120
heavy responsibilities, I can only

415
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,920
do my utmost to fulfill the task

416
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,760
regardless of what others say about me.

417
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,080
Am I right?

418
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:15,120
Great Chief Shen?

419
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,960
Well.

420
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,000
Shall we proceed with

421
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,600
the grand assembly as discussed?

422
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,320
What are you doing?

423
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:46,560
How dare you come here

424
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:48,840
as a mere nobody from a humble background?

425
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,280
You've tarnished the reputation
of our Hongwen School.

426
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,680
We must make things right.

427
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,760
I earned

428
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:58,400
my place here through the examination.

429
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,360
Knowledge does not distinguish
between noble and humble.

430
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,680
Why would you bully someone like me?

431
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,360
You're just a dog we let in

432
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,840
by opening the door.

433
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,920
Do you really believe

434
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,120
you are equal with the noble classes?

435
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,240
Remember.

436
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,160
A dog is a dog even if

437
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,040
it enters a house.

438
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,280
Vice Minister Lai

439
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,080
isn't from the noble classes.

440
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,960
But you people from the noble classes

441
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,320
flatter and fawn him.

442
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,200
It looks like you're thrilled to be his dogs.

443
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:31,600
How dare you? Beat him up!

444
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:41,480
Stop!

445
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,520
Mr. Jing.

446
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:50,000
Those students from noble classes

447
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,040
are bullying the ones from humble backgrounds.

448
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:53,160
Hongwen School

449
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:55,320
is the top academic institution in Dacang,

450
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,840
where His Majesty gets educated.

451
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,880
You don't focus on your studies

452
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:01,120
and pick up fights instead.

453
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,160
What a disgrace.

454
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,720
I…

455
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,920
It's them.

456
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,720
Yeah, it's him.

457
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,160
He's the one stirring up trouble

458
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,920
and distracting us from our studies.

459
00:33:09,920 --> 00:33:11,560
Yeah, it's him.

460
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,000
It's him causing trouble.

461
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,240
Mr. Jing, that's not it,

462
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,016
It's them.

463
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,560
Since you've been

464
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,480
bothering your schoolmates,

465
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,080
reflect on yourself

466
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,160
in our prison.

467
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,560
How did you Imperial Guards end up like this?

468
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:37,160
Are you really siding with the treacherous?

469
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:38,480
Great Chief Shen

470
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,240
escorted us here for the exam,

471
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,360
saying that Hongwen School wouldn't
discriminate against poor scholars.

472
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,880
Now,

473
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,800
are you telling me that

474
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:49,840
we're wrong to seek education

475
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,760
as students

476
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:54,960
from humble backgrounds?

477
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:02,640
You can't judge the situation

478
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,200
and act accordingly.

479
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,080
Yes, you're wrong.

480
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,600
Take him away.

481
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,960
How dare he stand against us?

482
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,600
- Totally.
- He deserves it.

483
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,440
Step aside.

484
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,272
Step aside.

485
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:30,320
People call you the White Ghost

486
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,440
and me the Black Fiend.

487
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,679
Now we're strolling

488
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:37,120
on the street side by side.

489
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:40,840
It feels quite special.

490
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,600
The street is so spacious.

491
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:43,800
Can't you people

492
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,400
walk properly?

493
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,199
Do you have to dash about

494
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,480
and bully the people?

495
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,159
How did you inspectors let someone

496
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,840
block the Vice Minister's way?

497
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,080
Our duty as inspectors

498
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,280
is to guard the capital

499
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,000
and the safety of the people,

500
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
not to clear the streets as someone's slaves.

501
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,800
What an eyesore.

502
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,280
Great Chief Shen.

503
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,800
The Imperial Guards
are in charge of city defense.

504
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:15,280
We don't need

505
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,480
these petty thieves

506
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,200
to be an eyesore in the city, do we?

507
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:22,120
You're right.

508
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:23,680
Shen Du.

509
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,720
You uphold no morality

510
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,160
and assist a tyrant in his oppression.

511
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,360
Can you justify yourself
to Marshal Xu and Yun Que?

512
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,640
Can you justify yourself to Yan Xing?

513
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,360
How dare you minor inspector

514
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,840
challenge the Great Chief
of the Imperial Guards?

515
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,640
It seems you've never had a taste

516
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,400
of the Imperial Inspectorate's urn punishment.

517
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,520
- Guards.
- Wait.

518
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,960
Since he insulted me,

519
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,040
then I shall

520
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,760
handle this by myself.

521
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,360
I spared your life today

522
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:21,400
so you may go back

523
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:23,960
and discipline your buddies.

524
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,600
Tell your friends that

525
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,360
those memories

526
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,960
in the past no longer hold any value to me.

527
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,240
If you dare to speak disrespectfully again,

528
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,400
I will make sure that you pray to die

529
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,560
to stop suffering.

530
00:36:45,628 --> 00:36:46,760
<i>[Ministry of Justice]</i>

531
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:47,920
Chuichui.

532
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,880
Jiang Langxing was humiliated

533
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,480
by the White Ghost on the street.

534
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,080
What?

535
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,880
Shen Du humiliated
Jiang Langxing on the street?

536
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:00,000
Yeah, this is what I've heard.

537
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
It was because he and the inspectors

538
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,480
offended Vice Minister Lai.

539
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,680
Shen Du

540
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:09,240
sided with Lai Luozhi?

541
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,760
The Black Fiend joined hands

542
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,680
with the White Ghost.

543
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,240
Alright, Shen Du.

544
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,480
I'd like to see

545
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,640
if he's lost his conscience.

546
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,680
Where is the Director
of the Ministry of Justice?

547
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,480
- Let me go.
- Hurry up.

548
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:33,864
Behave.

549
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,360
Vice Minister Lai, what brought you

550
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,360
to the Ministry of Justice?

551
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,920
Vice Minister Lai.

552
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:48,264
Stiffy.

553
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm fine.

554
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,800
I received a report that

555
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,440
the case records are incomplete

556
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,280
and full of loopholes.

557
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,880
I wonder who is responsible for this.

558
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,920
Well…

559
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,880
So Miss Lu is responsible for that.

560
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,320
Isn't this a huge misunderstanding?

561
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:19,080
Who dared to denounce the Ministry of Justice?

562
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,360
Don't they know that

563
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,920
Miss Lu is mine?

564
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:30,880
- Drag him out.
- Understood.

565
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,040
If anyone dares to bother Miss Lu again,

566
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,200
I'll take it personally.

567
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:42,880
Don't worry, Chuichui.

568
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,520
No matter where you go,

569
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,760
you are always mine.

570
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:49,416
In your dreams.

571
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,744
Really?

572
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,760
Lai Luozhi.

573
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,880
You disciple man!

574
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,120
Let me go.

575
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:16,360
I dare you to fight me to the death.

576
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:18,560
I can crush you like an ant.

577
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:21,240
Who are you to negotiate terms with me?

578
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,520
What do you want, Lai Luozhi?

579
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,600
What's wrong?

580
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,600
You feel for him?

581
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,400
You're shedding tears for an ant.

582
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,920
It's so not worth it.

583
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,000
Actually,

584
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,840
I can't bear to make things hard for you.

585
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,360
But last night, I had trouble sleeping

586
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,440
and recalled

587
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,440
the folksong you once sang.

588
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,360
How about you sing it for me again?

589
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,640
If my mood gets better,

590
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,280
maybe I'm willing

591
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,760
to show some mercy.

592
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,640
Chuichui, don't listen to him.

593
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:14,000
Don't sing.

594
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,120
- Shut up.
- Don't sing.

As I said,

you can get

607
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:32,000
whatever you want as long as

608
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,080
you don't leave me.

609
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,800
As for those people you care about,

610
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,680
I won't give them

611
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,400
too much of a hard time for your sake.
