[Episode 26]

15
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,400
Great Chief, I'm afraid there won't be
a welcoming banquet today.

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,960
Mr. Pan found an important figure
in the case of the headless corpse.

17
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
- Who is it?
- His name is Liu Zongyuan.

18
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,280
He rents next door

19
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,600
to the victim Li Kaixiang.

20
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,920
After what happened,

21
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,320
quite a bit of Li's fields

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,760
ended up in his hands.

23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,560
So, I went to his house to investigate

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,080
only to find that he had just moved out.

25
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,640
Governor Mo,

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,360
can you dispatch some people

27
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,000
to look for him?

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,600
Bring him back if possible.

29
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,128
No problem.

30
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,880
Great Chief, my apologies.

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,800
This is an unexpected situation.

32
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,520
Please forgive me.

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,560
The case matters more.

34
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,320
Governor Mo, don't blame yourself.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,920
Since he was just gone

36
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,720
and the city gate was not so close,

37
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,320
why not close the city?

38
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,280
I will have my guards search for him too.

39
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,080
Maybe we can catch this person.

40
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,920
You're right, Great Chief.

41
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,400
I will ask Bi Qiu to draft a decree

42
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,920
to put the city under lockdown.

43
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,360
I hope we arrest the real culprit soon.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,000
If we can also dispel the rumors

45
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,880
about the Half-faced Demons eating people

46
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:45,880
in their sleep,

47
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,200
that would be even better.

48
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,960
I may be late tonight.

49
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,712
Don't wait up.

50
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,960
Let's go.

51
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:08,680
I have to go.

52
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,440
It's still early.

53
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,520
How about we visit Li Kairui in the jail?

54
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,600
We searched every corner

55
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,040
of Yingzhou, but Liu Zongyuan

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,240
was nowhere to be seen.

57
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,040
He either escaped the city

58
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,600
or he is hiding out

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,640
in some mansion.

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,120
We've closed the city gates

61
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,880
and set up checkpoints.

62
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:38,080
The chances of Liu Zongyuan escaping the city

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,320
are slim.

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,440
Governor Mo.

65
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,680
I suggest we search

66
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,880
the mansions where the suspect might be hiding

67
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,960
one more time.

68
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,560
Better not.

69
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,600
The people in the city

70
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,480
are already on edge because of

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
the recent murder cases.

72
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,280
If they see us searching

73
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,840
mansions in the middle of the night,

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm afraid they'll be unsettled.

75
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,800
As you can see,

76
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,280
we've set up checkpoints.

77
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,520
My people will inspect
whoever wants to enter and leave.

78
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,760
He can't get away.

79
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,920
Get in.

80
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,512
Next.

81
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,200
Write here.

82
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,040
What's in the bag?

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,600
The troops of Yingzhou

84
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,400
are truly disciplined.

85
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,320
The commander must have
spent a lot of effort and money on them.

86
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,560
They have top-quality breastplates

87
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,280
and shoulder guards,

88
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:31,040
unlike the usual border soldiers.

89
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,120
You are from the Imperial City.

90
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,160
You must have seen
a lot of fine military equipment.

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,400
The armor they have

92
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,440
is nothing to speak of.

93
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,760
Yingzhou

94
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:43,360
is located at the western border.

95
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
Defense is of utmost importance.

96
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,480
We save on expenses everywhere.

97
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,720
All the money I saved,

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,520
I spent on military supplies.

99
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,920
There's no other way.

100
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,600
Great Chief, we found him.

101
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,320
This is

102
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,720
Senior Clerk Yan from the Ministry of Justice.

103
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,880
She has some questions for you

104
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,200
[Li Kairui]
Senior Clerk.

105
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,480
I'm innocent, Senior Clerk.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,120
Don't rush to plead your innocence.

107
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,560
Just answer my questions.

108
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,240
As long as you can clear my name,

109
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,800
I will do whatever it takes.

110
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,480
Do you know Liu Zongyuan?

111
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,880
Yes, he's on good terms with my older brother.

112
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,000
I invited him

113
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,080
and my older brother

114
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:40,360
for a drink that day

115
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,360
but something came up and he had to go.

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
Therefore,

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,640
no one can prove my innocence.

118
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,840
Do you know where he's from?

119
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,720
I only know that he is a businessman,

120
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,880
who's offered my brother advice in business.

121
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,400
Does Liu Zongyuan know martial arts?

122
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,520
No.

123
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:00,920
He is just a businessman.

124
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,640
Are you sure?

125
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,040
I remember once

126
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,920
a snake got into his house,

127
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,400
my brother caught it for him.

128
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,920
Senior Clerk Yan,

129
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,960
what are you noting down?

130
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,160
The case details.

131
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,960
There's also a portrait of the Half-faced Demon

132
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
I drew with my imagination.

133
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,560
I didn't expect you to have such a talent.

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,960
Why don't you let me see

135
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,720
what the Half-faced Demon

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,560
looks like in your imagination?

137
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,400
You can see it when we go back.

138
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,640
If you look at it now,

139
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:44,040
it can be very spooky.

140
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,480
If we attract the Half-faced Demon here,

141
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,680
none of us would survive.

142
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,456
That's true.

143
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
Right after your brother died,

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,200
there was nothing at the incision.

145
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,440
But one day,

146
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,560
some of the crimes

147
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,200
he had committed just surfaced at the incision.

148
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:08,280
Do you know about this?

149
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,320
No, I don't know anything.

150
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:14,920
In that case,

151
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,520
you'd better come with us

152
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,240
to check on the body.

153
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,280
We have no idea

154
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,720
about those accusations.

155
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,160
You can explain to us

156
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,960
if you come with us.

157
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,200
- Guards.
- Here.

158
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,440
No, no.

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,080
I'd rather not see it.

160
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,280
That's too horrifying.

161
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,080
I really can't stand it.

162
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,440
Besides, he was my elder brother.

163
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,040
That's one more reason

164
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,800
for you to see his body.

165
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,320
You've been pleading your innocence.

166
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:49,840
It's just some accusation.

167
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,920
Don't be so nervous.

168
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,320
Then…

169
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,000
Please.

170
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,080
I'm begging you.

171
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,240
I-I confess.

172
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:01,200
I confess.

173
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:02,760
My brother had done

174
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,760
some foolish things,

175
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,720
but nothing to be decapitated for.

176
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,600
My brother was a gambler

177
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,400
when he was young,

178
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
and our family went broke.

179
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,120
He reflected on himself, quit gambling,

180
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,720
and started a small business.

181
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,800
He made quite some money.

182
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,120
But he started borrowing money again

183
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,200
and even mortgaged the fields.

184
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,280
We suspected that

185
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,880
he had started gambling again.

186
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,760
But it turned out that

187
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,760
he had been tricked by the charlatan

188
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:39,120
introduced by a neighbor
to waste his money on elixirs.

189
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,200
Because of that,

190
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,840
we had a huge fight.

191
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,840
Shortly after,

192
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,039
Liu Zongyuan, the neighbor

193
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,120
who introduced him to the charlatan

194
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,120
came straight to Dafu's teahouse.

195
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:56,000
Liu Zongyuan!

196
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,840
Gentlemen.

197
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,280
Please calm down.

198
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,400
I didn't come here

199
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,960
to anger you.

200
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,600
I'm here to talk business with you.

201
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,480
We have nothing to say to you.

202
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
If you hadn't

203
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,000
introduced that charlatan to my brother,

204
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,920
would he have ended up like this?

205
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,520
How dare you even come here?

206
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,120
What have you done to his brother?

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,880
He even sold all the fields.

208
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,000
How can you do this?

209
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,200
Do you have no conscience?

210
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,400
I only mentioned

211
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,160
that charlatan in a chit-chat

212
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,000
as an interesting anecdote.

213
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,160
I had no idea that

214
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
Mr. Li would be so obsessed

215
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,640
that he sold his properties.

216
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:29,440
I truly regretted it.

217
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,680
All I can do now

218
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:31,680
is to help him

219
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
minimize the losses.

220
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,120
I've been managing his business these days.

221
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,560
And I've bought those properties

222
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,520
that he sold off

223
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,520
in his name.

224
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:43,800
If you don't believe me,

225
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,680
here's the receipt.

226
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,600
Dafu, this…

227
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:59,320
It turned out that Liu Zongyuan was a good guy.

228
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:01,320
The three of us agreed to get my brother out

229
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,680
for a drink in two days

230
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,400
to persuade him to mend his ways.

231
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,360
Well, Mr. Ji.

232
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,640
I just remembered

233
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,040
some issues I encountered

234
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,080
in the business.

235
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,640
I'd like to ask you for advice.

236
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,400
[Li Kaixiang]
Can we talk in private?

237
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,440
Alright.

238
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,920
Go ahead and enjoy the drinks.

239
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,240
We will talk outside

240
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,680
and join you later.

241
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,880
Go ahead, gentlemen.

242
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I know

243
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,280
they were trying to

244
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,720
leave us alone

245
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,040
for me to talk to him.

246
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,440
Come on, Kaixiang.

247
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,360
Kaixiang.

248
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:35,640
Look at you.

249
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:37,960
What's going on with you?

250
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,480
You lost so much weight in just a few days.

251
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,520
From now on,

252
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,960
stop believing in

253
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,720
those charlatans.

254
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,200
Living your life well

255
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,440
is better than anything.

256
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,440
Kairui, you don't understand.

257
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,840
Master Yuan truly has magical powers.

258
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,680
He can summon immortals.

259
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,400
I have seen it with my own eyes.

260
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,680
Kairui, in my opinion,

261
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,280
you should forget about
those trivial matters at hand

262
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,800
and cultivate with me

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,000
to become immortals.

264
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,800
Enough with your "immortals"!

265
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:08,240
Those are just frauds!

266
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,240
Kaixiang.

267
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,520
We've worked so hard

268
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,880
all these years, so how…

269
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,120
How can you fall

270
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,440
for those so easily?

271
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,760
And you're obsessed?

272
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,160
Can you justify it to our parents in heaven?

273
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
What about all our hard work?

274
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,600
Enough, you are the fool here!

275
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,600
You don't even believe in your brother.

276
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,040
Would I mean you harm?

277
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,840
Since we can't communicate,

278
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,640
what's the point of trying?

279
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,520
Kaixiang, you…

280
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:02,569
[Dafu Teahouse]

281
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,320
And I have been jailed ever since.

282
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
I woke up only to see that.

283
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,160
I really can't figure out

284
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,360
what exactly happened that day.

285
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,040
Senior Clerk Yan,

286
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,520
I think it's about time.

287
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:31,760
We should get going.

288
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,960
It's time? For what?

289
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:39,440
However, you'll need to get changed.

290
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:50,480
Why did you bring me to such a place?

291
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,120
Because I've found a clue, of course.

292
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,160
It's not easy to book the top courtesan.

293
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,920
Hurry up.

294
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,960
Mr. Pan, you're finally here.

295
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,080
Please come to the room on the third floor.

296
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,160
Come on, this way.

297
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,312
This way.

298
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,520
Alright, I'm having fun.

299
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Drink with me.

300
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,240
Please.

301
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,040
Mr. Pan, rest well here.

302
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:25,920
Xiuxiu will be here soon.

303
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,680
Like a dream, like a fairy,
suddenly all is scattered.

304
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,600
Where has the sunset glow gone,
leaving the green screen void?

305
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,040
You are really impressive.

306
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,040
You have acquaintances everywhere you go.

307
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,040
It seems that

308
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,920
you are a regular here, huh?

309
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,920
I come here only to solve cases, nothing else.

310
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,360
Since Xiuxiu is the top courtesan,

311
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,120
she must be very pretty.

312
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,760
I'd also like to see

313
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:14,560
how the beauty of Gannandao

314
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,280
differs from that of Xiang'an.

315
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,160
The rose is no match for the beauty's cheeks.

316
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,560
The breeze by the water
carries the scent of a beauty.

317
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,680
[Xiuxiu]
In your poem,

318
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,000
the autumn wind wafts

319
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,880
and the roses bloom.

320
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,960
Even the dew-laden lotus flowers

321
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,440
can't compare with the beauty.

322
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,920
The fragrance borne by the wind

323
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,880
is even sweeter than that of the lotus.

324
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:47,880
I only wonder to whom you dedicate

325
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:50,400
such a verse.

326
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,080
The beauty dances like a blooming lotus.

327
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,440
A sight that the world should have yet to see.

328
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,480
It doesn't matter to whom it's dedicated.

329
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:04,800
What matters is that

330
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,640
the beauty is right here

331
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:08,760
yet she doesn't know my heart.

332
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,240
Miss Xiuxiu.

333
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,880
I asked you to look into

334
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,280
Liu Zongyuan.

335
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,960
What about the verses I asked for?

336
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,360
I have it in mind, naturally.

337
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,440
I also remember

338
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,000
what you've asked me to do.

339
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,040
When Liu Zongyuan first came here,

340
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,120
he could barely afford

341
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,520
to have tea in the main hall.

342
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,880
But only Heaven knows when

343
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,920
he became so generous

344
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,600
and often asked for me.

345
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,680
Let me tell you.

346
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,200
That family

347
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,920
is all fools.

348
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,280
I tricked them with nothing

349
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:59,960
but some hand-written receipts.

350
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,920
His brother and brother-in-law really need

351
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,080
some of the medicine.

352
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:07,440
Maybe we should get them to buy some elixir.

353
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,240
You're the worst.

354
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,800
Liu Zongyuan

355
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,680
must have colluded with the swindlers

356
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,400
to seize the victim's property.

357
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,400
In that case,

358
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,680
Liu Zongyuan benefited the most

359
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,120
from Li Kaixiang's death.

360
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,280
Step by step,

361
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,280
he seized the Li family's properties

362
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:42,240
until he drained their assets dry

363
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,920
and fled.

364
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,240
Maybe he chopped off the head

365
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,520
of the victim

366
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,840
to link everything

367
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,440
to the Half-faced Demon

368
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,160
to terrify the people

369
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,440
and mislead us.

370
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,120
Xiuxiu and Pan Chi

371
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,240
haven't known each other for long.

372
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,680
Why would she confide in him so much

373
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,960
and tell him everything?

374
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,280
While you were watering the flowers,

375
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,240
I wrote a new verse.

376
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,400
Washed by the rain, a few flowers bloom gently.

377
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,400
On a cool summer day,
she shows her delicate grace.

378
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,040
Like the lotuses unstained by mud.

379
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,119
Tired of watching.

380
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,920
A butterfly brings a good mood over the wall.

381
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,119
The green leaves ripple with the gentle breeze.

382
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,760
Gently hold.

383
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,400
A fragrance wafts from the beauty's sleeves.

384
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,760
The pretty young lady has her hair coiled up.

385
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,040
Secretly snips.

386
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,920
A touch of bright red
solidifies on the fingertips.

387
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,160
You two,

388
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,480
keep this gentleman company.

389
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,880
Greetings, my lord.

390
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,256
What…

391
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:49,760
I guess the boss lady is experienced.

392
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,280
Dressing as a man

393
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
can't fool her.

394
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,720
My lord, here's a toast to you.

395
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,600
You've been working hard on cases.

396
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,960
It's a rare chance to chill out.

397
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,280
Drink up.

398
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,720
I…

399
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,400
Great Chief, why are you here?

400
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,520
I can explain.

401
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:25,520
I swear we went to

402
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,960
the Xiuxiang Pavilion for work.

403
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,520
I didn't summon those male escorts.

404
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,200
I didn't touch them at all.

405
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,240
I believe you.

406
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,640
I'm not angry about that.

407
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,200
It's just that you should let me know

408
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,080
if you're going out to work at night.

409
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:42,800
I couldn't find you at home and I got worried.

410
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,080
It was a rushed decision.

411
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:48,080
I will definitely let you know
in advance next time.

412
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,520
Right, have you found Liu Zongyuan?

413
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,440
He tricked Li Kaixiang and got his properties.

414
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,400
And he's very likely the murderer.

415
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,120
We did find him.

416
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,560
Let's interrogate him now.

417
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,720
He's turned into a corpse,

418
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,000
unable to speak now.

419
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,400
Liu Zongyuan lost his liver,

420
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:20,280
and it was carved out from here.

421
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
People laugh at the moths flying into the flame

422
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,320
yet they don't know that mayflies

423
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,880
are born at dawn, dead by dusk,
not entering the cycle of rebirth,

424
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,840
while moths survive the fire

425
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,680
and await reincarnation.

426
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:55,000
An animal disguised as a human.

427
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,080
Punishment awaits.

428
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:59,160
Disrespect of the Huo'e.

429
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,200
Disaster comes from the sky.

430
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,320
Half-faced Demon and Huo'e Sect again.

431
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,040
Liu Zongyuan

432
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,200
was a martial artist.

433
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,960
Look at the calluses on his hands.

434
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,080
So,

435
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,320
Liu Zongyuan

436
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,480
pretended to be unskilled in martial arts

437
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,600
as a businessman

438
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,000
and killed people in secret.

439
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,160
But later, someone took him out.

440
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,000
Perhaps we have overcomplicated it.

441
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,600
There is an easier way

442
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,480
to find the real murderer.

443
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,760
Liu Zongyuan swindled

444
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,800
the Li's properties

445
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,840
and forced Li Kaixiang to loan money.

446
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,000
Who suffered the most?

447
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,240
Li Kaixiang is dead.

448
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,320
Li Kairui is in prison.

449
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,400
And that leaves us with…

450
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,440
Ji Dafu.

451
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,760
That's right.

452
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:03,120
Actually, I have been wondering.

453
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,760
Liu Zongyuan claimed that he had bought

454
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,880
the properties back

455
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,520
in the name of Li Kaixiang

456
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,960
with nothing but some forged deeds.

457
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,600
How did Ji Dafu get scammed

458
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,680
and believe that Liu was a good person?

459
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,680
No matter what,

460
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,800
Ji Dafu runs a teahouse.

461
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,680
Wouldn't he have doubts

462
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:23,160
about such a selfless act?

463
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,360
Either Ji Dafu is naive enough

464
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,080
to trust others easily,

465
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,720
- or…
- Or

466
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,160
he never

467
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,160
believed in

468
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:34,640
Liu Zongyuan's story.

469
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,040
From beginning to end,

470
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,760
he's been meaning
to take revenge on Liu Zongyuan.

471
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,800
Since Ji Dafu is a suspect,

472
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,880
we might as well look into him.

473
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,120
- Watch your mouth.
- What are you doing?

474
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,800
Don't push me.

475
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,480
- Get lost.
- My lord.

476
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:08,800
Please do me justice.

477
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,040
These people are unreasonable

478
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,320
and they're bullying me.

479
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,400
We have work to do.

480
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,560
Let me go.

481
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,200
You must help me settle this.

482
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,520
You should

483
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,920
report to the officials.

484
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,640
The Governor will do you justice.

485
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:24,920
Right, I should go to the officials.

486
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Why should I ask you for help?

487
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,960
Who are you people?

488
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,040
We're coming home to visit relatives

489
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:44,480
and we have things to do.

490
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,160
So we won't bother you further.

491
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:49,200
I take my leave.

492
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,560
Let's go.

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,120
We inspectors pay respect

494
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:28,280
to Senior Clerk Yan

495
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,280
and Great Chief Shen.

496
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,640
What happened

497
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,760
back there?

498
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,040
[Inspector Sun Tan]
I'm the leader

499
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,920
of the inspectors in Gannandao.

500
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:45,440
We were merely trying to stall you for a second

501
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,160
to not cross paths with Ji Dafu.

502
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,280
We've been investigating

503
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,440
a case of usury

504
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,240
and the clues led us to Ji Dafu.

505
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,520
This person is elusive.

506
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,360
To avoid alarming the suspect,

507
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,520
we resorted to this strategy.

508
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,080
Please don't mind us.

509
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,240
It's alright.

510
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,720
It's just that you were conspicuous.

511
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,880
If someone observant noticed you,

512
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:06,080
wouldn't you be exposed?

513
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,680
You're right, Senior Clerk Yan.

514
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,800
We were reckless back there.

515
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:12,280
We will be careful.

516
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:13,800
If it weren't for the token,

517
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,440
it wouldn't have crossed my mind

518
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,720
that you were inspectors.

519
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,440
Token of our marshal.

520
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Please don't. I don't deserve this.

521
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,640
Seeing the token

522
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:26,160
is as good as seeing our marshal.

523
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,320
Mrs. Shen, rest assured.

524
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,880
Whenever you need us for anything,

525
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,600
we will certainly go all out

526
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
to support you.

527
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,520
You just said that

528
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,280
Ji Dafu was elusive.

529
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,960
Was it because you found something?

530
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,080
Ji Dafu appears to be a teahouse owner.

531
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,200
But he also runs an underground casino

532
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,800
that is involved in usury.

533
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:53,160
A lot of money goes through his casino accounts

534
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,760
and gets circulated

535
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:56,440
in suspicious ways.

536
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:57,720
Are you saying

537
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,040
that Ji Dafu is very likely

538
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:01,440
gathering wealth for a mastermind

539
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,760
and laundering money

540
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,440
through the casino?

541
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,800
This case is complicated.

542
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:07,040
We followed the leads

543
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,720
and found that many officials

544
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
in Gannandao were involved.

545
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
So we had to count on ourselves.

546
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,160
If you wish to visit the underground casino,

547
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,920
you'd better disguise yourselves.

548
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,920
Do you remember it?

549
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,680
You're Sun Daniu.

550
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,200
- You're…
- Liu Qingming.

551
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,760
I'm Wan Erge.

552
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,760
We are businessmen who came

553
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,520
to do business in Gannandao.

554
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,640
I think you overlooked

555
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,600
the key issue.

556
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,920
What is it?

557
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,680
We are going to a casino.

558
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:57,840
Which one of you is adept at gambling?

559
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,440
Naturally, that would be me.

560
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,560
I assure you

561
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,760
I'll end up winning their deeds.

[Dafu Teahouse]

563
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:25,080
This way, please.

564
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,528
This way.

565
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,960
Wan Erge.

566
00:26:43,040 --> 00:26:44,360
After you sit down,

567
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,040
wait for the waiter to serve the tea

568
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,440
and give him a signal.

569
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,440
This way, please.

570
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,080
Someone will take you to the casino.

571
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:10,480
I'll be downstairs as a guard

572
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,120
to assistant you when it's needed.

573
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,240
Place your bets.

574
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,400
Place your bets.

575
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,960
Stop, gentlemen.

576
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,240
You look new here.

577
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,520
Big.

578
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,720
Hurry. Don't waste my time.

579
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:30,360
These gentlemen are looking for some fun.

580
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,480
Just take them in.

581
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,640
Alright.

582
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,840
Understood.

583
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,256
Follow me.

584
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,400
Again.

585
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,520
Come on.

586
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,320
Go on, come on.

587
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,160
Big or small?

588
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,520
- Big.
- Excuse me.

589
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,800
Big!

590
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:53,920
Place the bets

591
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,520
and have no regrets.

592
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,240
I won. It's all mine!

593
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,584
I won.

594
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,440
Big!

595
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:10,440
- Big!
- Small!

596
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:12,520
Help out, will you?

597
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,280
Congratulations, everyone.

598
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,560
Again.

599
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
I'm betting on big.

600
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,440
- Big.
- Place the bets.

601
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,480
How much are we betting today?

602
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,800
It's up to Wan Erge.

603
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,520
You'll play today.

604
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,520
What you win is yours.

605
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:37,760
If you lose, it's on me.

606
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,800
Alright.

607
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,080
For the first round,

608
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,080
fifty taels.

609
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,280
- Alright.
- Big.

610
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,920
Ladies and gentlemen, place the bets.

611
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,880
Big or small? Place the bets.

612
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,920
Look closely.

613
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,800
Fifty taels, look closely.

614
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,160
Big.

615
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,840
Place the bets and have no regrets.

616
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,480
- Big.
- Small.

617
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,920
Something's fishy, indeed.

618
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:13,160
One, two, two, five points, small.

619
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,320
Congratulations.

620
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,120
You're in bad luck today.

621
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:24,240
Let Sun Daniu play.

622
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,640
I, Liu Qingming, am in bad luck today.

623
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,480
Daniu, it's your turn.

624
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,760
My belly… My belly hurts so much.

625
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,720
What's wrong with him?

626
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,200
Oh no.

627
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,640
I need to go to the bathroom.

628
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:55,520
But still, I'll watch you play

629
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,920
before I leave.

630
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,480
Wan Erge

631
00:29:59,480 --> 00:30:01,600
never plays small.

632
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,880
He always plays big.

633
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:05,240
That's right.

634
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,440
I wonder how much

635
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,720
would you like to bet?

636
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,760
A thousand taels.

637
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,400
One round to determine the winner.

638
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,704
A thousand?

639
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,920
What? A thousand taels?

640
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,520
Okay.

641
00:30:22,920 --> 00:30:24,920
Such a large bet.

642
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:26,640
Shall we change the odds?

643
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,000
What about one-to-two?

644
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,560
No problem.

645
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,600
Have no regrets.

646
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:59,360
A thousand taels. I'm betting on big.

647
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,800
Open it.

648
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,360
What are you waiting for?

649
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,800
Open it.

650
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,520
Yeah.

651
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:15,040
Open it.

652
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:17,920
Yeah, what are you waiting for?

653
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:21,960
When I was losing money,

654
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,440
you opened it instantly.

655
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,480
What now?

656
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,520
It's such a large bet.

657
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,360
Shouldn't you hurry up?

658
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:28,440
Exactly.

659
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,920
Open it.

660
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,880
Open it.

661
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,600
What are you waiting for? Open it.

662
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah, open it.

663
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:41,760
Open it.

664
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,200
What's going on?

665
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,760
We've been waiting.

666
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,840
I won!

667
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,000
- I won!
- Impressive.

668
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,880
[Master of All Games]
I won!

669
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,960
Gentlemen.

670
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,640
You're so lucky today.

671
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,440
Why not take another bet

672
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,760
when you're in luck?

673
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,160
Our boss wants to

674
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,920
meet you in person.

675
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:08,120
No thanks. Tell your boss.

676
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,160
We've won enough for today.

677
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,840
Okay, I heard some distinguished guests
have arrived today.

678
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,280
I, Ji Dafu,

679
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:23,680
am the owner of this casino.

680
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,640
The bet doesn't matter that much.

681
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:28,160
What matters is to make friends.

682
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,280
I have prepared fine tea in the private room.

683
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,720
Please come upstairs

684
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:36,280
to have some tea with me.

685
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,440
Alright, let's hurry then.

686
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,456
Liuniang.

687
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,520
Gentlemen.

688
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,520
Pleased to meet you.

689
00:33:06,520 --> 00:33:10,200
Come on in.

690
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,680
After you.

691
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,080
What are you doing?

692
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,440
So reckless.

693
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,760
Don't scare my guests.

694
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:19,800
Sir, he's basically useless now.

695
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,960
What do we do with him?

696
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,280
Why would we keep
someone useless? Throw him out.

697
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,640
Understood.

698
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,200
He dares to win so much money in my casino.

699
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,640
Does he think he can walk away with the money?

700
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,400
It seems that the rumor of

701
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,280
the Half-faced Demon eating people's limbs

702
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:39,080
originates from the casino.

703
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,400
The victims who had their limbs chopped off

704
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:42,840
dared not speak openly

705
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,200
and claimed to have amnesia.

706
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,000
Please don't mind us.

707
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,960
My subordinates are clumsy

708
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,480
and lack discernment.

709
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,600
I hope they didn't scare you.

710
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:00,880
You scared me.

711
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,560
What happened to that guy's arm?

712
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,080
It was nothing.

713
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:16,120
His arm was too fragile.

714
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:18,960
It broke with just a touch.

715
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,120
As far as I see,

716
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:26,960
you've won so much money

717
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:29,040
at our casino.

718
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,400
That's improper, isn't it?

719
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,560
We won the money.

720
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,800
It's not like we stole it. How is it improper?

721
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,880
In that case,

722
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:44,440
I won't waste my time with you.

723
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,159
You have two options.

724
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,280
You either

725
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,960
bet one round against me,

726
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,120
and return the money you won,

727
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,159
or keep the money you won

728
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,360
and leave one part of your body.

729
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,639
Your choice.

730
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:57,960
I won't choose from

731
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,200
either option.

732
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,000
I want the money and my limbs.

733
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,800
So, there's nothing to talk about.

734
00:35:09,600 --> 00:35:11,840
Sir, someone wants to see you.

735
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,560
I'm busy. Send them away.

736
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,960
Governor Mo is one of

737
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,608
the visitors.

738
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,120
Keep a close eye on them.

739
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,896
Step back.

740
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:00,192
Great Chief.

741
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:01,280
Take them away.

742
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,280
- Understood.
- Understood. Let's go.

743
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,440
Behave.

744
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,944
Hurry up.

745
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,120
Outrageous.

746
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,440
How dare they set up a casino under my nose

747
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,040
and spread rumors?

748
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,080
I reviewed the case files and found out

749
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,680
that Ji Dafu's wife Li Xiulian

750
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,600
was the victim of a vicious case
done by a gang years ago.

751
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,920
It happened because
her older brother Li Kaixiang

752
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,440
was unable to pay the debt.

753
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,840
So most likely, Ji Dafu used the rumor
of the Half-faced Demon

754
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,920
to kill Li Kaixiang

755
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,080
to avenge his wife.

756
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,720
This is outrageous.

757
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,040
Does Ji Dafu have any respect for the law?

758
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,040
I can't believe

759
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,280
such a villain got away.

760
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:44,600
Guards.

761
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,560
Things have gone too smoothly.

762
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,640
Pass down the order.

763
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,120
Apprehend Ji Dafu throughout the city.

764
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,744
Understood.

765
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Great Chief, Senior Clerk Yan.

766
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,440
Thank you for venturing into the casino today.

767
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,960
The case is solved because of you.

768
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,800
Rest well tonight.

769
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,880
Leave the rest to me. Trust me.

770
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,760
I will certainly bring Ji Dafu

771
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,760
to justice soon.

772
00:37:26,342 --> 00:37:30,075
[Carrying the sunshine and auspicious energy]

773
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,352
Half-faced Demon.

774
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,360
He managed to get away.

775
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,352
Shen Du.

776
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,480
Kill me.

777
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,880
All the meridians in his limbs were severed.

778
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,200
And his face was skinned.

779
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,560
Only a repeated offender

780
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,280
could do this in such a short time.

781
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,640
What's wrong? What happened?

782
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,280
Bi Qiu is bleeding out.

783
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,000
I'm afraid he…

784
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:31,120
Bi Qiu.

785
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,160
What happened?

786
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,280
Half-faced Demon.

787
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,480
Is it the Half-faced Demon?

788
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,120
I swear I'll make you pay!

789
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:41,680
Why did you do this to my subordinate?

790
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,360
Come at me!

791
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,840
Governor Mo.

792
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,960
Calm down first.

793
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,440
Did you see the murderer's face?

794
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:57,840
- Bi Qiu.
- Please.

795
00:39:57,840 --> 00:40:00,264
What do you want to say?

796
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,280
Please.

797
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,480
End my suffering.

798
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,400
Shen Du.

799
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:38,440
End my suffering.

800
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,960
Thank you.

801
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:04,240
Bi Qiu, rest assured.

802
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,360
I will treat your family

803
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,560
as my own.

804
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,920
Don't blame yourself.

805
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,200
You can never take out

806
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,560
all the villains in the world.

807
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,600
That I know.

808
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,344
It's just that…

809
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,400
You can't bear to watch it

810
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,600
with your own eyes.

811
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,696
So look away.

812
00:42:15,738 --> 00:42:19,556
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

813
00:42:19,556 --> 00:42:23,233
