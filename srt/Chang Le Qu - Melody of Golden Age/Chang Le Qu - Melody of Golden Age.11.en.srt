[Episode 11]

15
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,080
Liuniang.

16
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,640
Well, you!

17
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,000
Your words just now

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:48,360
indicate your loyalty

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,920
to the Ministry of Justice.

20
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
It's so touching.

21
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,080
But in front of Vice Minister Lai,

22
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:56,760
you can't say so.

23
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,400
He is the Black Fiend.

24
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,600
My lord.

25
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,680
Yes. Liuniang,

26
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,760
I am still frightening.

27
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,960
Do you really think

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,480
you are a tigress?

29
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,639
T-That's the Black Fiend.

30
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:11,480
Even you are the tigress,

31
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,680
he could still kill you alive.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,160
So, why would you provoke him?

33
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:19,760
Princess of Valor is here.

34
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,080
Greetings, Princess of Valor.

35
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,440
Greetings, Princess of Valor.

36
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,360
Mrs. Shen, you are wise and smart.

37
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,000
You are capable of investigating cases

38
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,720
and managing household affairs well.

39
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,920
What

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,880
a rare female talent!

41
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,200
Our dynasty encourages women
to become officials.

42
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,520
Women can also be generals or prime ministers.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,920
Mrs. Shen.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,840
You are really a role model.

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:07,520
Thank you, Princess of Valor.

46
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,560
May I know

47
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,600
why you come here?

48
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,720
Last night, Chen Huo'e came back to life.

49
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:18,920
This morning,

50
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:21,480
Vice Minister Lai immediately
went to the Empress Dowager

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:24,440
to request the authority
to investigate the case.

52
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:27,760
This case is complicated.

53
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,240
I think the Ministry of Justice

54
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:32,520
doesn't want to get involved either.

55
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,760
This case

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
was handled by the Imperial Guards,

57
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,040
and now it is being re-investigated
by Vice Minister Lai.

58
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,760
The Ministry of Justice
naturally has no right to investigate

59
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,720
or inquire.

60
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,760
Yan Xing

61
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,920
is a clerk of the Ministry of Justice,

62
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
but also the wife of the Great Chief.

63
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,720
I hear that you

64
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,560
are quite skilled at managing your husband.

65
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,400
If you

66
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,400
can persuade your husband

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,560
to not get involved in this case,

68
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,600
and you can restrain your own curiosity

69
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,160
to remain as a mere observer,

70
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,880
I am very willing

71
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:18,399
to facilitate a good match

72
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,519
and personally ask the Empress Dowager

73
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:22,520
to bestow a marriage

74
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,040
for your third sister

75
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
and Han Shiyuan.

76
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,600
I am quite busy.

77
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:56,160
I hope you could reply soon, alright?

78
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,600
Liuniang. Yan Liuniang.

79
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
You had nothing to do

80
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
with that case.

81
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,040
All you have to do is

82
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,440
to persuade the Great Chief.

83
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,680
Then your Yan family

84
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,080
can obtain two marriages

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,120
bestowed by the Empress Dowager.

86
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,960
What an honor

87
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,520
to your family!

88
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,600
What are you hesitating for?

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,600
Why didn't you just say yes at once?

90
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,440
Princess Yong'an and Vice Minister Lai

91
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,560
obviously do not want

92
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
the Imperial Guards and the Ministry of Justice
to be involved in this case.

93
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,800
But the more they do this,

94
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,880
the more guilty they appear, don't they?

95
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:47,200
And, logically speaking,

96
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,440
Princess Yong'an

97
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,800
has just been cleared her name

98
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,280
of the Buddha case.

99
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
Why would she be in such a hurry

100
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,240
to get involved in this case?

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,880
Liuniang.

102
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
This is clearly a big trap.

103
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
We should avoid it.

104
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,720
Are you even thinking of jumping in?

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,080
- Chuichui.
- Yan Liuniang.

106
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:09,760
You are the wife of the Great Chief.

107
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:12,400
I don't care what you want to do.

108
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,120
But don't ever

109
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,600
involve the Ministry of Justice

110
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,800
in this case.

111
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,200
The Ministry of Justice

112
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,520
will not join you.

113
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
Director.

114
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,600
Zhang Baohuan,

115
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,200
who serves close to the Empress Dowager,

116
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:34,880
is outside the Ministry of Justice

117
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:40,560
and asking Clerk Yan for a chat.

118
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,920
Oh my!

119
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Don't cause any trouble.

120
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,400
You aim high.

121
00:06:55,400 --> 00:07:00,840
My Ministry of Justice aims low.

122
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,808
Ms. Yan.

123
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,720
Ms. Yan, I know you are busy.

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,720
Today, I come to visit you.

125
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,360
Sorry for bothering you.

126
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
Not at all.

127
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,120
I'm here today,

128
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:42,240
actually have nothing important to say.

129
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,560
I just wonder

130
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,440
how Han Shiyuan

131
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
has been recently.

132
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,760
Last night, Mr. Han

133
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:52,000
went back to the Yan Mansion with Caiwei,

134
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,280
and the Imperial Guards
did not make things difficult for him.

135
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,280
But I went to the Yan Mansion today

136
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,680
and was told he was not there.

137
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,040
I guess he doesn't want to see me.

138
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
I wonder what the story is

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
between you and Mr. Han.

140
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,920
Nothing special.

141
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,760
We are just old acquaintances.

142
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,120
Since Han Shiyuan

143
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,400
won the favor of Yan Sanniang,

144
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,000
it's good for him then.

145
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
In the future,

146
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,360
if you have the chance,

147
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,800
please take good care of him.

148
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:35,039
Of course.

149
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,039
Then I will not disturb any further.

150
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,240
I take my leave.

151
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,920
Han Shiyuan keeps his stories

152
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,360
with Zhang Baohuan

153
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,960
and Princess Yong'an a secret.

154
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,480
Regarding Chen Huo'e came back to life,

155
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,040
it seems many forces are involved in behind.

156
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,720
Even involving the marriage of Caiwei.

157
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,560
Even Lai Luozhi wants
to intervene in this matter.

158
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,720
Now,

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,920
everyone seems to want me

160
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:13,120
to stay out of it.

161
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,280
What should I do?

162
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:18,801
[Yan Mansion]

163
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,920
Liuniang, you are here.

164
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,120
Caiwei, Mr. Han.

165
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,640
I should thank you and the Great Chief
for saving us last night.

166
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
Why also sent gifts to me today?

167
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,680
I think Mrs. Shen

168
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,320
is here for interrogating me.

169
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,360
About what happened last night,

170
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,200
Mr. Han and I really don't know anything.

171
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,480
Caiwei, don't worry.

172
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:58,760
We're going to get to the bottom
of what happened last night.

173
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,360
I just want to know

174
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,320
your relationships with Mr. Zhang

175
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,360
and Princess Yong'an.

176
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,520
I can't tell you.

177
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:11,440
You still don't tell me at this point?

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
If it wasn't for you, how could Caiwei

179
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,600
have suffered so much?

180
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,920
Stop pressuring him.

181
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,808
I trust him.

182
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,160
- Liuniang, you are back.
- Mother.

183
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,680
Don't you have to work today?

184
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,680
You must be worried about those gifts,

185
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:37,880
wanting to see them for yourself
at Caiwei's place, right?

186
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,320
Let me tell you.

187
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,480
This time, your husband

188
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,480
has done it quite properly.

189
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
I

190
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,240
am so proud.

191
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:48,240
Gifts? Just now, Caiwei also mentioned gifts.

192
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:50,000
What are you talking about?

193
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,480
Don't you know?

194
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,720
This morning, the Shen Mansion
sent someone to express condolences,

195
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,400
saying that you're worried about Caiwei

196
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,640
being frightened last night,

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,240
so specially sent a lot of tonic gifts.

198
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,200
Those are valuable gifts.

199
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
I knew it had to be my son-in-law who paid.

200
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,720
Right, the kitchen has stewed some tonics.

201
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
Come on. I'll get you one.

202
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,120
Shen Du did this behind my back?

203
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,200
Why is he suddenly so warm to our family?

204
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
No need to ask.

205
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,000
It's because of you, of course.

206
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,080
Otherwise, why would Great Chief

207
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,440
care about us, modest Yan Mansion?

208
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,160
Would that man

209
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,520
still want to win

210
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:33,080
Caiwei's heart?

211
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,040
Caiwei

212
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,400
is really talented.

213
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,080
Indeed, she seems more

214
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:42,840
remarkable than you.

215
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,960
No, no way.

216
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,680
I have to kill his hope.

217
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,280
I'll go urge your father tonight

218
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,600
to have him

219
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,080
arrange the marriage
between Sanniang and Han Shiyuan.

220
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,320
I have to let them marry

221
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,440
as soon as possible.

222
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,440
Mother.

223
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,480
What are you thinking about?

224
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,760
Has White Ghost

225
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,080
hit you recently?

226
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:08,120
Have you two been arguing lately?

227
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,120
Let me tell you.

228
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,120
You must not take it lightly.

229
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,520
You must keep an eye on him.

230
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,720
Never let your guard down.

231
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,440
Okay, I got it.

232
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,000
I feel a bit hungry.

233
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,320
Why don't you get me a bowl of soup?

234
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,280
I almost forgot. Just wait.

235
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,120
What a fine zither.

236
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,440
What a beautiful tune.

237
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,600
What delightful charm.

238
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:09,720
The piece played by Jinzang today

239
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:13,160
seems different from the past,

240
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,320
with a bit more of a Zen feel.

241
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,280
It makes me feel refreshed.

242
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,080
This is

243
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,240
an ancient and elegant music from Madam Xu.

244
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:32,640
A few days ago,
when I went to the temple to worship Buddha,

245
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,560
an eminent monk bestowed upon me
a scroll of sheet music.

246
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,160
It's said to have the effect
of clearing the mind and spirit.

247
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,480
So I requested Mr. Jin

248
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,000
to perform it.

249
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,080
Indeed, it was wonderful.

250
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,440
I remember,

251
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
back then,

252
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,400
you dug up the lingzhi on the mountain

253
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,120
and gave it to me,

254
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,720
pleading me to deal leniently with

255
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,520
the case of the Shen family

256
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:05,080
and release the young Shen Du
from the detention center.

257
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,440
So today,

258
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:11,400
what is your request?

259
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,760
I dare not.

260
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,040
Let him in.

261
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,920
Minister Shen.

262
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,000
I know why you are here.

263
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,560
Vice Minister Lai

264
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,920
personally requested the re-investigation
of the Chen Huo'e case.

265
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,280
Although this case has recently
been investigated by you,

266
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,000
after all, five years ago,

267
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,880
he's the one who handled it.

268
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,160
He confessed his negligence,

269
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,120
wanting to make amends.

270
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,960
I can understand it.

271
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,280
Your Majesty.

272
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
In my humble opinion,

273
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,120
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

274
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,360
The Chen Huo'e back then

275
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:57,200
may not be the current Chen Huo'e.

276
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,920
Minister Shen.

277
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,360
Since you're injured,

278
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,480
there's no need to force yourself.

279
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,920
It's a minor injury.

280
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,496
It's no big deal.

281
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,880
Okay.

282
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,680
Since Madam Xu is vouching for you.

283
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,480
Then the case of Chen Huo'e

284
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,480
shall be handed over to the Imperial Guards.

285
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,280
Yes.

286
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,400
If that's the case,

287
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,840
let Prime Minister Zhang handle

288
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,240
the Hongwen School examination.

289
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,440
After all, he is a civil official.

290
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,280
It's easier for him to communicate

291
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,520
with the scholars.

292
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,920
Minister Shen.

293
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:49,160
You shall be responsible for the security
of the Imperial City, how about that?

294
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,560
Your Majesty.

295
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,840
The security of the Imperial City
is a matter of great importance.

296
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
No room for any mistakes.

297
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,360
The Imperial Guards has limited manpower.

298
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm afraid it's difficult
to take care of everything.

299
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,480
You!

300
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,520
Usually, you only complain
about not having enough power.

301
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,760
But today,

302
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,920
you're making excuses.

303
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,160
I know

304
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,880
what you're thinking about.

305
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,600
- I dare not.
- Dare not?

306
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:18,240
I see you are daring

307
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,240
to set me up.

308
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,200
- Empress Dowager, please calm down.
- Please calm down.

309
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,120
Alright.

310
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,640
Since I entrust you
the security of the Imperial City,

311
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:32,040
naturally, you'll be given the authority
to mobilize resources from all departments.

312
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,360
During the Hongwen School examination,

313
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,320
where security is involved,

314
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,440
personnel from all departments

315
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,920
will be at your disposal.

316
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,520
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

317
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,040
Your Highness, Prime Minister Zhang
has already taken over the Hongwen School.

318
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,840
That old man!

319
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,160
He has taken the lead again.

320
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,760
Interesting.

321
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,280
Your Highness.

322
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,240
Sir, perfect timing.

323
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,200
Let's see if these Imperial Yellow Peony

324
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,440
are blooming beautifully.

325
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,000
So beautiful.

326
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:28,240
Prince Xian.

327
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,320
This time, the Empress Dowager

328
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,160
has entrusted me to handle

329
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,960
the Hongwen School examination.

330
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,160
The scholars of the Hongwen School

331
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,840
are the foremost among scholars in the country.

332
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,680
With the merits of this examination,

333
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,040
Prince Xian, you would get a further advantage

334
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:42,160
on acquiring the position of Prince Regent.

335
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,840
Sir.

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,960
Whether it is me

337
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,800
or Princess of Valor
who becomes the Prince Regent,

338
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,560
we are all serving
the Empress Dowager and His Majesty.

339
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,640
Prince Xian, no way.

340
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,640
His Majesty is slow of speech,

341
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,240
and the Empress Dowager is getting old.

342
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,200
Prince Regent is very important to Dacang.

343
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,560
On this matter,

344
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:03,040
Prince Xian, you must not take it lightly.

345
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,480
Sir, thank you.

346
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,160
You must correct everyone's misunderstanding

347
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:09,000
and make the scholars from humble backgrounds

348
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,440
feel valued by you and me.

349
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,600
Yes, that is of course.

350
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,480
But Shen Du has obtained the authority
of the security of the Imperial City,

351
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,400
adding more powers and responsibilities.

352
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,560
Minister Shen is certainly capable.

353
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:29,680
No matter

354
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:31,400
what kind of situation this guy is in,

355
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,480
what kind of mess he's in,

356
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,960
he always has a way to deal with it.

357
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,880
What do you think?

358
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,200
Prince Xian, you are right.

359
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,680
Well, Shen Du

360
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,560
has obtained the authority
of the security of the Imperial City,

361
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,600
I wonder if the situation in Xiang'an

362
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,920
should be the more chaotic, the better?

363
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:51,960
Prince Xian.

364
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,720
Maybe we should give him a hand.

365
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:00,720
What did you just say?

366
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,760
Go do your work.

367
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,840
Great Chief.

368
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,040
The Hongwen School examination

369
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,520
was handed over
to Prime Minister Zhang ultimately.

370
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,680
Empress Dowager entrusted the Imperial Guards
the security of the Imperial City.

371
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,000
Is it to comfort us?

372
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,040
This is what I wanted.

373
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:43,640
You don't seem to be disappointed.

374
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,040
The wind is going to pick up.

375
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:48,080
During the Hongwen School examination,

376
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,120
Princess of Valor, Prince Xian,

377
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,280
Prime Minister Zhang and Lai Luozhi

378
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,960
will surely take some actions.

379
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:52,960
Be alert.

380
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
Yes.

381
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,880
The security near the Hongwen School

382
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,960
should not be underestimated.

383
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,400
You can get more guards
and inspectors for assistance.

384
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,880
And don't take the security
of the Three Departments

385
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,000
and Six Ministries lightly.

386
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,080
My Imperial Guards
will personally keep a tight watch.

387
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,240
Especially, Lintai.

388
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,824
Yes.

389
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Who is it?

390
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,200
Great Chief Shen.

391
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,800
Thank you for the gifts
you sent to Caiwei and the others.

392
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,960
They all liked them.

393
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,704
It's no big deal.

394
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:09,600
At today's court,

395
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,760
anything interesting?

396
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,240
Nothing much.

397
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,960
Lai Luozhi requested the investigation
to the Chen Huo'e case.

398
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,560
Did the Empress Dowager grant it to him?

399
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,000
She granted it to me.

400
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,696
You?

401
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,320
You mean, the Chen Huo'e case

402
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,920
will be still handled by the Imperial Guards?

403
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,560
That's great!

404
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,480
I'll go grind some ink for you.

405
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,360
No matter how you tidy up a puppy's den,

406
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,640
it's still a puppy's den.

407
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,760
Your hand…

408
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,240
Is it getting better?

409
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,880
Bitten by a puppy,

410
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,120
it won't heal that fast.

411
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,000
Great Chief Shen.

412
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:56,200
You keep reading the case files

413
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,360
and take a rest.

414
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll go cook for you, okay?

415
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,240
Can you cook?

416
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:02,520
Don't underestimate me.

417
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:05,800
I am Yan Liuniang, after all.

418
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,400
Yes.

419
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,680
You are widely praised

420
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,600
for your talents in art,
literacy, and handicrafts,

421
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,600
with knowledge of the past and present,

422
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,920
your reputation as a virtuous lady

423
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,640
is known throughout the Xiang'an.

424
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,360
Go.

425
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:49,000
Come on.

426
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,544
Please sit down.

427
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:09,200
Great Chief, these are dishes I cooked myself.

428
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,008
Have a taste.

429
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Try this chicken.

430
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,800
How is it?

431
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,352
Surprisingly,

432
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:50,024
it tastes nice.

433
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:53,600
See, see.

434
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,920
I knew it.

435
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,400
Cooking and autopsies

436
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,120
are pretty much the same.

437
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,520
Using the methods of preserving
and dissecting a corpse

438
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,640
to prepare this chicken,

439
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:05,520
the texture will be just like
that of a freshly killed one.

440
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,856
Right.

441
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,400
Try this soup.

442
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,760
The inspiration for this spice

443
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:46,520
comes from the spices used
by Mrs. Tang to marinate corpses.

444
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,640
Smell it. Does it smell good?

445
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Right?

446
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:52,168
It smells good, right?

447
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,440
What do you want?

448
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,752
Just tell me.

449
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,280
It works so fast.

450
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,720
Well, I wonder

451
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,480
if I could participate in

452
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:41,640
the Chen Huo'e case.

453
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,296
No.

454
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,440
Can't you see how complicated this case is?

455
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,320
Both the Ministry of Justice
and the Dali Supreme Court avoid it,

456
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,280
yet you want to get involved in it.

457
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
I know.

458
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,560
Lai Luozhi and Princess Yong'an

459
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,200
have both come to me today.

460
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:58,280
Through their words,

461
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,920
they just don't want me involved in this case.

462
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,880
But I'm just a lowly clerk.

463
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,960
Could they possibly be wary of me?

464
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,320
What they are wary of

465
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,280
is just the name Mrs. Shen.

466
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,560
Since you know it…

467
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:16,960
You have already taken on this case.

468
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,280
Now,

469
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,440
I can't escape anyway.

470
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,760
How can I

471
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,000
stay out it?

472
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,600
If you encounter danger,

473
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,240
can I not get involved?

474
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,120
Sorry.

475
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,400
There's nothing to be sorry about.

476
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,440
Finding out the truth
and clearing the innocent one's name

477
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,000
are what I desire as well.

478
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,480
All I want is that you grant me
the authority to investigate the case.

479
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,080
Rest assured.
I will definitely not hold you back,

480
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,720
or be a burden to you either.

481
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,960
But you have to promise me.

482
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,200
Consult with me everything first

483
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,320
before taking actions.

484
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,480
Don't act rashly on your own.

485
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,600
Of course.

486
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,920
You are the Great Chief,

487
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,120
my superior.

488
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Of course, I'm at your disposal.

489
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:34,360
From now on,

490
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,080
I shall only follow your orders.

491
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,408
Okay?

492

[Imperial Guards]

493
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,576
Boring.

[Imperial Guards]

495
00:30:02,174 --> 00:30:05,608
[Chen Mansion]

496
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,000
Case handling by the Imperial Guards.

497
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
Is Mr. Chen Shoujie here?

498
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,200
I am Yan Xing,
a clerk from the Ministry of Justice.

499
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:00,880
I have some questions to ask him.

500
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,080
That night, Madam was in good mood

501
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,080
and made personally

502
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,040
basin mutton, smoked chicken,

503
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,800
baked flatbread and cake.

504
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,800
She even gave me a bowl of wine.

505
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:13,960
When I slept until midnight,

506
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:15,880
I suddenly heard the master's shouting.

507
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,120
Madam!

508
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,400
In the end, Madam…

509
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:38,420
[Chen Shoujie]

510
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,560
Madam.

511
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,640
Be careful.

513
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:24,400
- Master, Master.
- There's a fire!

00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,040
- There's a fire!

- Master.

- It's on fire!
- Master.

- It's on fire!
- Master.

519
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,080
Moth!

520
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,800
Is he talking about Chen Huo'e?

521
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:38,734
[Ministry of Justice]

522
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,440
Don't get close to us.

523
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:12,280
You'll sit

524
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:15,560
over there.

525
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,440
Since you handle the case
for the Imperial Guards,

526
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,520
then you are no longer related to

527
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,920
the Ministry of Justice.

528
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:42,040
No matter the great trouble you cause,

529
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,280
it has nothing to do
with the Ministry of Justice.

530
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,360
The Ministry of Justice

531
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,840
won't get involved in it.

532
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,320
No.

534
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,360
Let me tell you,

535
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:09,440
no matter what,

536
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:13,159
be sure to protect yourself.

537
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:14,239
If you die,

538
00:34:14,239 --> 00:34:15,360
I will certainly…

539
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,400
I will certainly
perform a grand opera for three days

540
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,000
at the Furong Garden

541
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,040
to ensure you can't rest in peace
even in the underworld.

542
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
Rest assured.

543
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,639
I will surely not let you succeed.

544
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,239
The third year of the Shengli Era,

545
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,280
Jinxiu Workshop was charged

546
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,600
with the crime of insubordination
for delaying presenting Princess Runing

547
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:45,480
with summer clothes.

548
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:48,080
Since the summer clothes
were ordered by the Prince Consort,

549
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,600
[Princess Runing]
so he committed suicide in court to apologize.

550
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,320
Since then, Princess Runing

551
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,080
has been at odds
with the current Empress Dowager.

552
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,720
And Jinxiu Workshop was accused
of using the inappropriate pattern,

553
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:01,520
violating a major imperial taboo,
so got closed down.

554
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,080
The whole family
of the Jinxiu Workshop's owner was executed.

555
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,320
[Jinxiu Workshop]
That was the Jinxiu Workshop case.

556
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,760
Go, let go of me.

557
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,040

558
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,920
Rumor had it that four years ago,

559
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,400
it was the Prince Consort
who wanted to please the Empress,

560
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,400
but unexpectedly, he caused Princess Runing

561
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,080
to wear the same

562
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,640
purple chrysanthemum pattern clothes
as the former Empress,

563
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,120
which made the current Empress Dowager mad.

564
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,880
But this case file is only
vaguely written as "Inappropriate".

565
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,120
The case file is not that trustable.

566
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,400
Come take a look, baked cake.

567
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,440
Come on.

568
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,320
- Mr. Pan.
- Mr. Pan.

569
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,040
I didn't expect you to stay here.

570
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,320
We've been looking for you.

571
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:49,000
Who are you two?

572
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
The day before yesterday at the Hongwen School,

573
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,720
I witnessed your quick wit.

574
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,040
I heard you are also joining
the Hongwen School examination.

575
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,120
In the future, we shall be companions.

576
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,840
- Let's go.
- I'm flattered.

577
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,280
We must have a drink.

578
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,400
- Let's go.
- Come on.

579
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,008
Alright.

580
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,440
- Come on.
- This way.

581
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,640
After you, Mr. Pan.

582
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,760
Bravo!

00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,200
Prince Xian and Prime Minister Zhang
cherish talents,

584
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:13,400
so they specially told us

585
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,080
to communicate with the scholars
from humble backgrounds

586
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:16,520
in this examination.

587
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,680
So that in the future, we can better

588
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,120
serve the court.

589
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:22,040
Please sit.

590
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,880
Please sit, don't be shy.

His Majesty is benevolent and virtuous.

592
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,520
This Hongwen School examination

593
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,920
does not consider social status,

594
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,520
family background,

595
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,080
or recommendations.

596
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:36,520
Only judges by virtue and talent.

597
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,760
It can be said to set a precedent
for our dynasty,

598
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,840
truly a fortune for scholars.

599
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,840
Indeed.

600
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,400
Prime Minister Zhang told me

601
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
to prepare some wine for you.

602
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,120
Everyone,

603
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,960
please communicate with

604
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,320

605
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,440
Here.

606
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,600
Please, please.

607
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,080
Come on. I toast to you all.

608
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,840
What does it mean?

609
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,000
Prince Xian

610
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,960
has always valued scholars,

611
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,000
fearing that you

612
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,400
might find it inconvenient

613
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,400
while living in Xiang'an.

614
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,480
So he specially sent this modest gift.

615
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,920
Well, Prince Xian

616
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,240
is kind-hearted and benevolent.

617
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,520
Everyone,

618
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,960
please accept it.

619
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,000
Is this the kind gesture from noble classes?

620
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:50,520
Mr. Pan.

621
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,760
How dare he
to reject Prime Minister Zhang's gifts!

622
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,840
Such a nobody.

623
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,840
Noble classes look down on us.

624
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,760
How dare he to use such despicable means

625
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:03,280
to bribe and corrupt our hearts!

626
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,480
Poor lad.

627
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,680
Pay more respect.

628
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,640
Are you Prime Minister Zhang's men?

629
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,360
Committing violence when the bribery fails.

630
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,040
Violence? I commit violence?

631
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,080
Violence, right?

632
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:00,640
In the Xiang'an City,

633
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,040
we are under the emperor's sovereign.

634
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:03,160
Don't be that stubborn,

635
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,000
so you'll suffer less.

636
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,200
Be smart.

637
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,120
Who are you?

638
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,640
Prime Minister Zhang is soft,

639
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,120
but Prince Xian is wise and brilliant.

640
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,720
To you scholars from humble backgrounds,

641
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,560
threats and bribes are useless.

642
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,680
Might as well kill you all.

643
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
We just don't want to

644
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,720
favor Prime Minister Zhang and Prince Xian.

645
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,200
So we have to die for it?

646
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,560
Kill!

647
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,280
Prince Xian will not let you off.

648
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,600
Go!

649
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,080
It's you!
