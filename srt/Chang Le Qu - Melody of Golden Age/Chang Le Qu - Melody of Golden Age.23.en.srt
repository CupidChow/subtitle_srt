[Episode 23]

15
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,200
Pan?

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,320
How come you're here?

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,720
Senior Clerk Yan, long time no see.

18
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,880
This is a key area for investigation.

19
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,760
How can you let unrelated people enter at will?

20
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,560
You have misunderstood, Great Chief.

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,680
This person is the number one detective
among the people.

22
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,400
Mr. Pan Chi.

23
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,840
He has come to assist me

24
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,400
in the investigation.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,360
He is not an unrelated person.

26
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,800
Great Chief Shen.

27
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:09,960
Sure enough,

28
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,600
the rumors are true.

29
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:13,640
Pan is Pan Chi.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,560
You can always think of Pan

31
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,200
as that Pan.

32
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,920
I happened to come across this matter.

33
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,280
I am entrusted by the suspect's brother-in-law

34
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,480
to come here for the investigation.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,240
When this suspect was just arrested,

36
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,880
he was clean as a whistle

37
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
and had no murder weapon.

38
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:30,720
I suspect he is very likely
to have been wronged.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,440
It is written in the dossier

40
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,320
the victim's brother was not a martial artist.

41
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,080
The likelihood of the brother
committing the crime is very low.

42
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,480
Based on the situation at the victim's home,

43
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:41,360
it's highly likely a vendetta killing.

44
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,640
The elder brother had a bad temper.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,000
Because of land disputes,

46
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,640
he often quarreled with neighbors.

47
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
He was once involved in a fight

48
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,640
and the matter was taken to the local official.

49
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,000
In business, he often didn't get along
with others

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,600
and offended quite a few people.

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,280
The murderer might take
this opportunity to kill him

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,360
and then frame the victim's brother.

53
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,240
If it's a vendetta,

54
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,800
the murderer and the victim

55
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,040
must have had a deep hatred.

56
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
Just killing would be one thing,

57
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,200
but they took the victim's head.

58
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,840
Why is that?

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,880
Setting aside the motive for the crime,

60
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,400
can you deduce

61
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,080
what kind of weapon was used?

62
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,320
Governor Mo, there's no need to rush.

63
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,960
Let us examine it carefully.

64
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,120
Let's leave it at that for today.

65
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,656
I'm hungry.

66
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,984
Governor Mo.

67
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:43,560
I take my leave.

[Mortuary]

69
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,200
Didn't you say to investigate the case first?

70
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,520
How come you're suddenly hungry?

71
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,640
Besides,

72
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,200
we're not in Xiang'an right now. How come you…?

73
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,800
Anyway, I'm hungry right now.

74
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:09,160
Didn't you say you were going
to make me a medicinal meal?

75
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,920
Where is it?

76
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,960
Make a medicinal meal?

77
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,240
Are you sure you want me to use these hands?

78
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,480
What's wrong?

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,600
These are hands
that have just examined a corpse.

80
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,120
A medicinal meal made with these hands,

81
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,000
are you sure you can stomach it?

82
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,640
I can.

83
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,080
Just wait.

84
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,960
That's more like it.

85
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,520
Look at him, not even preparing
a welcome feast today.

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,080
I was worried

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,800
the stingy Governor Mo

88
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,240
would also give us poor guest rooms to stay.

89
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,000
Jing Lin, mind your words.

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,640
Governor Mo is diligent and loves the people.

91
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,320
He is a rare good official
in the eyes of the people.

92
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,240
It's just a welcome feast.

93
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,160
The most important thing is to truly do things

94
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,200
for the people.

95
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,680
I went to see it.

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
Their kitchen here is not bad.

97
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,880
Mrs. Shen went to stew a medicinal meal
for you as soon as she got back.

98
00:05:24,896 --> 00:05:26,600
Help me hold this.

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Kid.

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,320
Why is it you?

101
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,008
Your master…

102
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,280
Where is your sister?

103
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,520
As soon as my sister came back,

104
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,160
I pestered her to teach me skills.

105
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,320
She readily agreed.

106
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,760
But then she led me to the kitchen

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,200
and taught me how to cook a medicinal meal.

108
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,440
Then she left in a hurry

109
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,080
to meet with her close friend,

110
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,840
leaving me to watch the pot for four hours.

111
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,240
Close friend?

112
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,920
The young man from Yingzhou
is tired of the wilds.

113
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:06,200
Fur-clad, he hunts below the city.

114
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,520
The code is correct.

115
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,960
But why is it a male voice?

116
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,880
No, this voice sounds very familiar.

117
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,880
How is it you?

118
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,640
The young man from Yingzhou
is tired of the wilds.

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,160
Fur-clad, he hunts below the city.

120
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,600
A thousand cups of barbarian wine
do not intoxicate.

121
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:37,600
Hu children can ride horses at the age of ten.

122
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,400
I am Chi.

123
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,800
Pleased to meet you, Liuniang.

124
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:53,480
Chi?

125
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:56,120
Chi.

126
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,600
You are a gentleman.

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,680
Why did you lie to me saying you were

128
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:03,120
a young lady from Jiangnan?

129
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,280
Actually, I did not intend to deceive you.

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
It's just that when you replied
for the first time,

131
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,080
you called me a young lady.

132
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,040
I…

133
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,200
Who let you use

134
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,360
a woman's floral letter paper

135
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,120
which was fragrant

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:20,200
and contained flower petals?

137
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,280
Sir,

138
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,160
you said you would write lyrics
for my new tune.

139
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,600
It has been over a month.

140
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,200
When will you write them for me?

141
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,480
I'll write them.

142
00:07:43,444 --> 00:07:46,080
[Chi]

143
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,880
Help me send this letter
to the Ministry of Justice.

144
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:51,624
Thank you very much.

145
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:57,576
Director Wu,

146
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
these are letter

147
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,560
received after we advertised
for clues to difficult cases.

148
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,480
I have organized them according to region.

149
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,520
This one on top is…

150
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,520
Throw them away.

151
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:12,800
Do you not understand my words?

152
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,280
Throw them away.

153
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,720
If you really have nothing to do,

154
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,760
go scrub the floor.

155
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,960
My observations on the Ministry of Justice's
doubtful cases.

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:46,320
I thought you were a young lady
from a Jiangnan family

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,440
who likes to investigate
and analyze cases, just like me.

158
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,120
That's why there was a first reply.

159
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,000
Chi

160
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,240
is actually a name I came up with casually.

161
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,200
The flower

162
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,320
was lent to me by someone else.

163
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,680
I called you by the wrong gender.

164
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:03,800
Why didn't you correct me

165
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,600
in your later replies?

166
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,160
Actually, this is what I was thinking.

167
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,400
Since we are pen pals,

168
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,120
whether I am a young gentleman

169
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,640
or a young lady,

170
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,360
it doesn't affect our friendship
through writing,

171
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
talking about everything under the sun,

172
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,040
and exchanging case details. Right?

173
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,440
That's true.

174
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,520
Now that you mention it,

175
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,600
it does feel more carefree.

176
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,080
By the way,

177
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,240
I don't know what you like.

178
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,160
So I specially looked for a copy

179
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,040
of the rare book Records
of the Western Regions' Unique Skills.

180
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,040
In this book,

181
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
it records the Western Regions'

182
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,880
exclusive tools and techniques.

183
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,760
Take a look, see if you like it.

184
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,600
Thank you, I like it very much.

185
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,880
Wait a minute.

00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:54,040
It's this page.

187
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,040
Take a close look

188
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,800
at the scimitar on this page.

189
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,200
After you left today,

190
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,080
I took another look

191
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,760
at the headless corpse's wound.

192
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,760
From the angle of the wound

193
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,120
and the smoothness of it,

194
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:05,920
it must not have been caused
by a straight blade

195
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,120
but by a curved one.

196
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:08,720
So according to my judgment,

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,080
this murder weapon

198
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,440
should be a specially made sharp scimitar.

199
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,520
I've seen such scimitars

200
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,360
at the border of Xichen.

201
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,440
The scimitar depicted on this page

202
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,760
has only minor differences at the blade edge

203
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,320
compared to the one found at the victim's neck.

204
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,960
The structure is nearly identical.

205
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,720
So whether it is this particular one

206
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
needs further investigation.

207
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,920
The Western Regions scimitar?

208
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,440
No wonder I pondered hard today

209
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,080
and couldn't figure out what weapon was used.

210
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:39,880
Turns out it was a weapon
I had never seen before.

211
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,560
I really should read this book carefully

212
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,320
and get to know more Western Regions weapons.

213
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,360
Perhaps I could find clues within it.

214
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,520
This time I came to Gannandao.

215
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,080
Besides investigating the case,

216
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,480
there's something even more important.

217
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,600
Great Chief, Governor Mo is weary today.

218
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:20,400
He has retired early
and is not available for meeting.

219
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,240
You should return early to rest.

220
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,680
Please convey my message to Governor Mo.

221
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,400
I shall visit another day
for a lengthy conversation.

222
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,480
Understood.

223
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,168
Great Chief, please.

224
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:47,040
Like a dream, like a fairy,
suddenly all is scattered.

225
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,280
Where has the sunset glow gone,
leaving the green screen void.

226
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,920
Thus, long before the incident
at Xiang'an City,

227
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:04,640
in the hands of the human traffickers
at Gannandao,

228
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,880
there was already the Moth Jade.

229
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,080
That's right.

230
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,200
The Huo'e Sect in Gannandao

231
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,520
has penetrated far and deep,

232
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,400
far beyond our imagination.

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,840
I've been investigating covertly
all along the way

234
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,400
and found quite a number of the local populace

235
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,840
secretly adhering to the Huo'e Sect.

236
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,720
From Xiang'an to Yingzhou.

237
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,360
I always feel that

238
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,680
behind the Huo'e Sect,

239
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,360
there is an invisible pair of hands

240
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,680
weaving a grand scheme.

241
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,280
The person behind this scheme

242
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:30,160
must be someone with overwhelming power.

243
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,720
Before we knew it, we had talked for so long.

244
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,400
It's late at night, I should head back.

245
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:39,600
Let's talk more next time.

246
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
Where's my gift?

247
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,480
You didn't forget to prepare one, did you?

248
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,600
I did prepare one.

249
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,160
But

250
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,600
it might not suit you.

251
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,680
You surely wouldn't like it.

252
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,000
Next time, I'll buy you a newer one.

253
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,600
You didn't even let me take a look.

254
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,120
How would you know if I like it or not?

255
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,440
It's you who insisted on seeing it.

256
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,520
Alright, you've seen it.

257
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:22,280
Give up on it.

258
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,840
Who ever heard of taking back a gift

259
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,280
that's given?

260
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,240
Besides, I like it very much.

261
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:32,080
I just happen to need a hairpin.

262
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,944
Well,

263
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,040
please put it on for me with your own hands.

264
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,560
How does it look?

265
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:00,424
Is it pretty?

266
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,800
Why did the candle suddenly go out?

267
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,480
Could it be…?

268
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,960
Pretty good-looking indeed.

269
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,760
It's getting late. I really should go.

270
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,288
I'll take my leave then.

271
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,720
It's so late.

272
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,320
Are you planning to stay up for me?

273
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,400
What are you dawdling for?

274
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,520
Come over and rest now.

275
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,560
Forget it.

276
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,200
We've slept in the same bed before.

277
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,400
If I catch a cold,

278
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,840
that's truly asking for trouble.

279
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,400
Does that Pan Chi

280
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,680
really suit your taste?

281
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:39,080
What do you mean suit my taste?

282
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,560
Are you talking about solving cases?

283
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,600
I do have a good rapport with him.

284
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,432
You…

285
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:49,880
What are you doing?

286
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:50,920
If you keep this up,

287
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,000
I won't be polite anymore.

288
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,040
Not polite?

289
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,160
I'd like to see

290
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,920
how you'll be impolite.

291
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,839
Shen Du,

292
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,240
you're not sleeping in the middle of the night.

293
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,359
What madness is this?

294
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,800
Someone is beating the drum
to appeal for justice.

295
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,440
Who is beating the drum below the hall?

296
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,160
What is the grievance?

297
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,720
My Lord,

298
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,920
I am named Du Fusheng.

299
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:44,760
I am a medicinal herb trader.

300
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:47,880
Today is the day my daughter Du Xiaowan

301
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,760
is to wed the son of Li Hongfa,

302
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,360
Li Zimo.

303
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,960
But unexpectedly, a strange event occurred.

304
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,520
My daughter was still there
when she was being welcomed in.

305
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:00,120
But when the wedding banquet ended
and it was time for the bridal chamber rites,

306
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:02,120
we discovered that my daughter had disappeared.

307
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,520
The incident happened suddenly

308
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,080
and she was nowhere to be found
despite a search.

309
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,840
That's why we came to report to the officials.

310
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,680
On the wedding day, there were many guests.

311
00:18:10,680 --> 00:18:11,800
This won't be easy to investigate.

312
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,680
Do you have a guest list?

313
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,920
Yes.

314
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,880
Here it is.

315
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,528
Present it.

316
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,600
Is the marriage between your two families

317
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,400
out of mutual affection?

318
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:28,080
Of course.

319
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,000
Xiaowan and I are well-matched in social status
and have mutual affection.

320
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,640
But who would have known
such a thing would happen?

321
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,200
I implore you, Governor Mo,

322
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,400
you must find Xiaowan.

323
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
Guards!

324
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,520
Take men to inspect both households,

325
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,760
especially the Li family.

326
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,160
Conduct a careful investigation.

327
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,320
See if there are any traces left behind.

328
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,440
Take a closer look

329
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,920
at the entries and exits
of the gates everywhere.

330
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:53,608
Yes.

331
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,040
Governor Mo, the guest list has been verified.

332
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,240
Most of the people are still there.

333
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,120
Only a few are not present.

334
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,240
Find them.

335
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,080
Bring them all back after finding them.

336
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,712
Yes.

337
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,440
- What's the matter?
- My Lord,

338
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,920
if we all go out to look for people,

339
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,160
I'm afraid there won't be enough people here
to investigate the case.

340
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,840
Governor Mo,

341
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,880
if there are not enough hands,

342
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:22,160
my guards can help.

343
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,760
Then I will trouble you, Great Chief Shen.

344
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:38,520
Jing Lin.

345
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,160
Yes.

346
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,320
Go on.

347
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,160
Yes.

348
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,440
You guys, follow me.

349
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,736
You guys, follow me as well.

350
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:27,040
Li Hongfa's family is wealthy.

351
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,400
The bridal chamber
must have been meticulously arranged.

352
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,400
There are no signs of a struggle
inside the room.

353
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,440
It seems something had happened
in the bridal chamber.

354
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,640
In a fit of anger,

355
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:44,920
someone clawed at this place.

356
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:49,080
It was meant to be a wedding,

357
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,960
yet there's something odd everywhere here.

358
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,080
Moreover,

359
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:55,320
this door frame has clearly been refurbished,

360
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:58,000
but there are traces of peeling paint.

361
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,680
There must be a problem with this.

362
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:01,600
I think so too.

363
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,960
By the way, have you found anything over there?

364
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,640
I passed through the living room

365
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:08,840
and also passed by the corner pavilion
and rockery.

366
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,480
But along this way,

367
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:13,160
nothing was found.

368
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,200
That's right.

369
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:19,400
The bride did not leave of her own accord

370
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,960
but was kidnapped by someone familiar

371
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,240
and taken away through the back window.

372
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,720
Given the urgency of the case at hand,

373
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,560
you two still have the mood to chat here.

374
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,360
Senior Clerk Yan and I were analyzing the case.

375
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,040
What counts as idle chat?

376
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,600
Moreover,

377
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,280
we have already reached a conclusion.

378
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:54,320
The bride

379
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,480
was kidnapped through this back window.

380
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,560
Alright.

381
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,640
Now it's time for certain people to get busy.

382
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,680
Hurry and order a search for the bride.

383
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,400
Very well.

384
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,480
Mr. Pan, please lead the way.

385
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,080
Together with my imperial guards,

386
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,160
apprehend the suspect.

387
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,680
Why did you leave halfway through?

388
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,160
A servant from my home came to report

389
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,440
that the child was sick.

390
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,600
My spouse

391
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,160
doesn't know how to take care of the child.

392
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,120
By that time, it was already so late.

393
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,960
Could it last until dawn?

394
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,000
My Lord,

395
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:37,000
about this matter,

396
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:39,680
please don't tell my wife.

397
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:43,160
I came to check on my concubine.

398
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,760
At the wedding,

399
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,520
did anything strange

400
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,600
happen?

401
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,040
No.

402
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:51,600
Except for that

403
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,720
Xu Jize performed exceptionally well,

404
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,880
I didn't notice anything

405
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,440
else different.

406
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,560
As for Xu Jize,

407
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,200
it was really hard on him.

408
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:02,440
The profession of a wedding conductor

409
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,840
is not an easy one to begin with.

410
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
Few people are in this line of work
in Yingzhou.

411
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,480
But I heard

412
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,000
that he had no one to recommend him

413
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,240
and no access to recruitment examinations.

414
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:13,960
That's why he became a wedding conductor.

415
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,200
Please, everyone.

416
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:21,480
Where is Xu Yize?

417
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,040
Why isn't he here?

418
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,760
My Lord, we did not find him.

419
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,000
Not found?

420
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,600
It seems that way,

421
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,640
Xu Jize was the only one who left early

422
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,680
and someone who could be
in close contact with the bride.

423
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,000
Senior Clerk Yan,

424
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,280
do you think

425
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,440
the murderer is Xu Jize?

426
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,600
I cannot answer that question at the moment.

427
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,240
Before the case is solved,

428
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:46,840
every person present

429
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:48,880
is under suspicion.

430
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,640
His absence from the scene now

431
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:51,720
only indicates

432
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,800
that his suspicion is deepened.

433
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,320
Ultimately, physical and testimonial evidence
are required.

434
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,160
Indeed, you are the wife of Great Chief Shen.

435
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:06,360
Although young,

436
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,280
you speak and act without fault.

437
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,760
You have your own set of rules.

438
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,400
Your words

439
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,720
show deep understanding of the Great Chief.

440
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,520
Take them all back to the Governor's Mansion.

441
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,160
Yes.

442
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:24,008
Let's go.

443
00:24:35,021 --> 00:24:37,240
[Xu Jize]

444
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,960
Please don't kill me.

445
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,680
Don't kill me.

446
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:58,040
Who are you?

447
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:00,720
Why are you panicking and running away
in the middle of the night?

448
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,320
My name is Xu Jize.

449
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,640
Don't kill me, please.

450
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,800
Over there.

451
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,000
Someone has died over there.

452
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,680
Xu Jize?

453
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,480
You're the wedding conductor?

454
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,160
Hand the person over to Governor Mo.

455
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:26,760
Well done, Shen Du.

456
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:28,800
Throwing a commoner out to block the road.

457
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,600
Is this the style of the Imperial Guards?

458
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
The style of the Imperial Guards

459
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,760
is that of a killing machine

460
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:38,160
or perhaps a plague god who silences
crying babies at night.

461
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,280
Which do you want,

462
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,360
Mr. Pan?

463
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,240
You are wise to be self-aware.

464
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:55,280
I truly admire this.

465
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,560
But since we've come this far
in our discussion,

466
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,200
let's just lay it all out.

467
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:00,800
You've been targeting me everywhere,

468
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:01,960
finding fault with me at every turn.

469
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,040
If that's the case,

470
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,800
why do you insist on dragging me along
to chase the killer?

471
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,760
You're also self-aware.

472
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:09,480
Knowing that you're a thorn in my side,

473
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,920
why do you keep showing up?

474
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:15,360
That's a requirement for solving the case.
I had no other choice.

475
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,880
A requirement for solving the case?

476
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:21,360
Pushing your luck when seeing I'm present.

477
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,720
Is it also out of necessity?

478
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,280
Save me, please.

479
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,560
Why has it gone quiet?

480
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:18,800
You, go down and have a look.

481
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,800
Why should I go down?

482
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,680
You, the Great Chief, are here.

483
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,160
Who knows what's happening below?

484
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,280
Besides, if I were to go down,

485
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,560
what if someone else kills me?

486
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,120
If you were to die,

487
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,840
I would collect your corpse

488
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,240
and build a grave for you.

489
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,280
I won't let your soul

490
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,320
wander about

491
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,360
so as not to scare others.

492
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,360
Why is your tongue so venomous?

493
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
Can't outtalk me, huh? Go down.

494
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,720
I'll go take a look at the situation first.

495
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,680
You are…

496
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:02,320
Don't be afraid. I'll rescue you
and bring you up.

497
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,720
Great Chief.

498
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,600
You're the bride from today?

499
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,440
Yes.

500
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:40,120
I am Du Xiaowan.

501
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:42,640
My Lord, save me.

502
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,960
There's another person below.

503
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,648
Another one.

504
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,520
You still have some conscience.

505
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,080
I climbed up by myself.

506
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,064
My waist.

507
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,600
To think you're the Great Chief.

508
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,280
Do you really understand
the rules of the jianghu?

509
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,240
Framing me time and time again.

510
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:09,240
It's not you.

511
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,080
Another one.

512
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,200
A dead person.

513
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:36,800
You guys go and scout around.

514
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,800
Jing Lin, go check below.

515
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:39,920
See if there are any abnormalities.

516
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,792
Yes.

517
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,880
Great Chief,

518
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,120
there are no abnormalities below.

519
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,920
Great Chief, the surroundings
have all been checked.

520
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,280
There are no abnormalities.

521
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,320
Along the way,

522
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,320
we all saw

523
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,480
that suspicious wedding conductor

524
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,600
with a tense expression.

525
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,280
Why do you need to inspect repeatedly?

526
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:27,440
Are you so certain

527
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,640
that person is not the murderer?

528
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,080
I cannot be sure whether that person
is the murderer or not.

529
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,280
But my intuition tells me

530
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,480
this matter

531
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:39,280
is not as simple as we have seen.

532
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,680
I have truly broadened my horizons.

533
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,800
The prestigious Great Chief solves cases

534
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,000
by relying
on an extraordinary intuitive talent.

535
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,160
Great Chief, will you continue
the investigation?

536
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,904
Let's withdraw.

537
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,040
Where is she, you beast?

538
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,560
Return my daughter!

539
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,840
Where have you hidden her?

540
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,720
- Where is Xiaowan? Speak up!
- Beast!

541
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,640
You may not act recklessly in the court hall.

542
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,760
Xu Jize,

543
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,400
let me ask you,

544
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,080
regarding the case of Miss Du's disappearance,

545
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:24,520
is it related to you?

546
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,120
It's a false accusation, My Lord.

547
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,440
The matter of Miss Du being abducted

548
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,840
has nothing to do with me.

549
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,400
I just wanted to go and rescue.

550
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:31,760
Do you have any witnesses or physical evidence

551
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,200
to prove it?

552
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,280
My Lord,

553
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,920
the incident happened suddenly,

554
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,560
and I was in a hurry to rescue.

555
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,320
No one saw all this.

556
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,840
But every word I say is true.

557
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,600
I ask for your clear judgment, my Lord.

558
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,440
So there are no witnesses or physical evidence.

559
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,360
Madam, the Great Chief has returned.

560
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,520
You've finally returned.

561
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,560
Have you made any discoveries?

562
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,400
The bride has been found

563
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,880
and a body has been brought back.

564
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,080
A dead person?

565
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,360
How about you? Are you injured?

566
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,600
Am I someone

567
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,560
who can be easily injured?

568
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,560
Honey, there's no need for concern.

569
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:29,960
What's happened to you?

570
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,400
Why are your hands all injured?

571
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,600
And there's mud on your body.

572
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:39,120
That's a question for your smart husband.

573
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,360
I've done all the dirty, tiring work
myself on the way.

574
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,280
In the end, he reaps all the credit.

575
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,240
Regardless of anything,

576
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,560
it's a good thing

577
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,920
that you've returned safely.

578
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:52,520
By the way, how did you

579
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,840
bring the bride back?

580
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,080
Quick, tell me the details.

581
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,280
First, on the way,

582
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,440
we encountered the panicking suspect fleeing.

583
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:02,280
Then we found the bride
trapped in the cellar well.

584
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,880
Besides the bride,

585
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:06,360
there was also a corpse in the cellar well.

586
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,040
So we brought them both back together.

587
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:10,680
The suspect you mentioned

588
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,200
is Xu Jize brought back

589
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,360
by the imperial guards?

590
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:17,240
Exactly, the wedding conductor.

591
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,800
After you left,

592
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,040
I questioned the guests
who attended the banquet

593
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:21,600
and conducted an investigation.

594
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,160
This Xu Jize they spoke of

595
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,960
is considered a very good person.

596
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,200
On the surface,

597
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,120
he has no motive to commit the crime.

598
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:30,400
Whether he is the murderer or not

599
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:31,720
remains to be further investigated.

600
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,280
By the way,

601
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,120
when we were at the bottom of the well,

602
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,800
I remember there was a sack.

603
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,080
That sack

604
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,640
was probably used to kidnap the bride.

605
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Such an important piece of evidence.

606
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,360
Why didn't you mention it earlier?

607
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,480
I'm not your subordinate.

608
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:49,560
Why should I report everything to you?

609
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,160
Alright.

610
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,040
You two go change your clothes now.

611
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,520
I'll be waiting for you in the hall.

612
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,720
This is a matter
for the Yingzhou government office.

613
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,640
It should be decided by Governor Mo himself.

614
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,960
I shall not go to the hall.

615
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:27,560
You captured me without any evidence.

616
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,920
I've been wronged.

617
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,480
I risked my life

618
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:31,960
- What stage of the trial are we at?
- to save Miss Du.

619
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,800
Just missed a few things.

620
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,040
I'm also completely clueless now.

621
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,239
And she wasn't hurt, just sprained her ankle.

622
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:38,560
My Lord,

623
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,400
isn't it time to treat me

624
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,719
with a different attitude?

625
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:44,360
This person really knows
how to sing their own praises.

626
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,800
Before the evidence is presented,

627
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,920
he made himself seem absolutely innocent.

628
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,000
He even seeks courteous treatment in court.

629
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,360
It's really my first time seeing

630
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,520
such an arrogant person.

631
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,960
A tree without bark

632
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:56,560
will surely die.

633
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,960
A person without shame

634
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,600
is invincible in the world.

635
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:02,240
You won't cry until you see the coffin.

636
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,320
Governor Mo,

637
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,800
I have new evidence to present.

638
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,160
Xu Jize,

639
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,960
does this object

640
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,920
look familiar to you?

641
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,280
This item has nothing to do with me.

642
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,760
It must belong to the murderer.

643
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:18,000
It was all the deceased's fault,
harming Miss Du.

644
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,080
I came to rescue her.

645
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,680
Don't wrongly accuse the innocent.

646
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,680
Then tell us in detail what you saw.

647
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:28,960
I, I was just using the latrine at that time.

648
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,000
When I came out,

649
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,040
I saw the criminal

650
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,000
kidnapping Miss Du.

651
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,520
It happened so suddenly at the time.

652
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
I didn't have time to notify others

653
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,760
and I was worried about Miss Du's safety.

654
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,640
So I went to rescue her alone.

655
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,760
You have no evidence.

656
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
How can people believe you?

657
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,920
Heaven and earth know,
every word I say is true.

658
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:49,520
Please discern carefully.

659
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,640
Let me say it for you.

660
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,000
You and the deceased were accomplices.

661
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,960
You kidnapped Miss Du together.

662
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:57,640
Then, due to disagreements,

663
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,640
you killed your fellow accomplice.

664
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:01,320
In order to cover up the facts,

665
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,520
you pretend to be a good person

666
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,440
and distanced yourself from all responsibilities,
making yourself seem completely uninvolved.

667
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:08,120
My Lord, I've been wronged.

668
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,680
I really did not kill anyone.

669
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,560
I didn't know the deceased at all.

670
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:14,120
Why would I kill him?

671
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,040
When a person is lying,

672
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,680
they blink continuously

673
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,080
and often wrinkle their nose.

674
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,560
Yet when he just claimed
that he did not kill anyone,

675
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,880
his expression was exceptionally firm,

676
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,880
indicating that he wasn't lying.

677
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,960
Now that you didn't know the deceased,

678
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,520
how did you witness him being killed?

679
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,680
I didn't witness him being killed

680
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,000
with my own eyes.

681
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
When I got there,

682
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,360
the person was already dead.

683
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
According to what you said,

684
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:42,600
you saw someone abducting Miss Du.

685
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:45,600
Did that person have any distinctive features?

686
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:50,480
The lighting wasn't very bright at that time.

687
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,160
I didn't see clearly.

688
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,400
Well,

689
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,480
judging by the deceased's height

690
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,720
and demeanor,

691
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:57,920
he should be the one who abducted Miss Du.

692
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,080
Merely judging from the height and demeanor.

693
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:02,200
Haven't you noticed

694
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,600
any other distinctive features?

695
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,560
The incident happened suddenly.

696
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:08,640
I didn't pay much attention to anything else.

697
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,760
My Lord, Du Xiaowan is here.

698
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,600
Wan, my Wan.

699
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,760
It's okay now, my child.

700
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,560
Alright.

701
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:19,120
Du Xiaowan,

702
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,520
you are the party concerned.

703
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,240
Narrate the events that happened today

704
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,880
one by one.

705
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,480
Xiaowan,

706
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,520
we have paid our respects to heaven and earth.

707
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,360
You are now my wife.

708
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:35,080
I, Li Zimo, hereby swear to heaven,

709
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,600
I will absolutely not hold any grudges

710
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,720
because of today's events.

711
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,160
Miss Du,

712
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,760
I know that women value their reputation,

713
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,640
making it difficult for you to speak up.

714
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,720
But have you considered it?

715
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,040
If the murderer is not brought to justice,

716
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,760
there will be more young women

717
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,520
who cannot escape the evil clutches?

718
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,480
They may not have

719
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,880
the chance of being rescued like you.

720
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,040
Honey,

721
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,640
let's jointly assist the governor

722
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,760
to catch the culprit.

723
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,376
Okay?

724
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,080
After performing the heaven and earth ritual,

725
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,480
I met the wedding conductor
in the bridal chamber.

726
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,760
But then

727
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,200
I suddenly fainted for some reason.

728
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,600
When I came to,

729
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,400
I was already in a sack.

730
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,880
I didn't see who kidnapped me.

731
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:36,440
I was extremely scared at that time

732
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,640
and I couldn't shout for help.

733
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:41,040
I only knew I was trapped in a sack

734
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,040
and was carried on the shoulder
of someone running.

735
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,440
After a very long time,

736
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,760
I was finally put down.

737
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,000
Later, another person came.

738
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Did you hear what they were saying?

739
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,000
I originally thought that person

740
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,160
was there to rescue me.

741
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:56,560
But to my surprise,

742
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,600
the two of them turned out to be accomplices.

743
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,560
They were discussing

744
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,000
how to share me.

745
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,880
Their language was unbearable to hear.

746
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,200
I really cannot repeat it.

747
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,680
Honorable officials,

748
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,760
my wife has suffered such an insult.

749
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:11,960
I plead with you

750
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:13,440
to severely punish the culprit.

751
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,800
Rest assured, Mr. Li.

752
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,040
We will definitely not let the culprit

753
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:18,080
escape the law.

754
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,600
Later, I don't know what happened.

755
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:23,320
The two of them started arguing.

756
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,360
I made a mistake. Let her go.

757
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,520
What are you joking about?

758
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,720
What's done is done. You have to do it
even if you don't want to.

759
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,080
I'll go over there to check.

760
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,320
After a while,

761
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,560
it sounded like someone
was chasing from behind.

762
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,840
They then abandoned me

763
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,320
in a cellar well in the ruins.

764
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,520
Before even covering the cellar well properly,

765
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,480
I heard a scream

766
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,360
followed by a bang

767
00:39:42,360 --> 00:39:44,960
as if someone had fallen beside me.

768
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,120
The sack loosened.

769
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:48,440
I climbed out.

770
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,600
Help!

771
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:54,520
I heard someone coming,

772
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:57,680
but I feared it was the accomplice
who had escaped earlier.

773
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,760
So I stopped crying.

774
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,600
Later, someone jumped down
from the well opening

775
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,640
and rescued me.

776
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,520
Since you've heard the two people talking,

777
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:09,120
could you determine by their voices

778
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:10,320
whether that person

779
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,520
was Xu Jize?

780
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:17,600
The situation was critical.
I was extremely scared.

781
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,000
I was so scared my head was buzzing.

782
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,760
I couldn't make out whose voice it was.

783
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:26,760
Miss Du has made it very clear.

784
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,000
In the last moment before she fainted,

785
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,920
the one she saw was Xu Jize.

786
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,000
Regardless of whether you are
the murderer or not,

787
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,720
you certainly cannot absolve yourself
of involvement in this case.

788
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,360
I…

789
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:39,240
Xu Jize, you scoundrel!

790
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,560
Scoundrel!

791
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,040
Beast!

792
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,920
- Order!
- Beast!

793
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,440
You must not be reckless
in the hall of justice.

794
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,760
Madam, the Great Chief
could not come in person.

795
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,680
He sent me to present the evidence
of this case before the court.

796
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,600
There's evidence?

797
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,120
There's a backup plan?

798
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,200
Why didn't you report it earlier?

799
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,600
I am not your subordinate.

800
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,040
Why should I report everything to you?

801
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:05,880
True to being his subordinate.

802
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,480
Really petty.

803
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,560
Xu Jize,

804
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:09,640
at this point,

805
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,040
what more do you have to say?

806
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:13,320
My Lord, I'm truly wronged.

807
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,400
On the wedding day,

808
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,400
the bride often goes without food
the whole day.

809
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,840
It's common for them to faint from exhaustion.

810
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,720
As soon as I saw the bride was weak,

811
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,960
to avoid suspicion,
I immediately left the room.

812
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,880
Then the criminal kidnapped the bride.

813
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,400
Only then did I chase after him.

814
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:29,920
Still making excuses.

815
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,320
What happened after you chased after him?

816
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:33,080
What did you see? Tell us.

817
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,880
I don't know how far I chased.

818
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,080
Then I saw

819
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,400
a shadow wielding a knife.

820
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,680
The person who kidnapped Miss Du

821
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:41,560
collapsed right beside him.

822
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:42,880
I am a mere scholar

823
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,320
without much strength.

824
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,040
I dared not to confront him directly.

825
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,520
So I turned around and ran

826
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,920
until I met all of you esteemed ones.

827
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:52,360
That's how I managed to save my own life.

828
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,240
My Lord,

829
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,600
what is this for?

830
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,040
Men and women should not touch each other.

831
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:09,480
The embroidery on your clothes

832
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,240
is really exquisite.

833
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,600
I wonder which young lady

834
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:15,640
embroidered this peach blossom pattern

835
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,840
at the neckline for you.

836
00:42:32,184 --> 00:42:36,002
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

837
00:42:36,002 --> 00:42:39,679
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫
