The curtains

190
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,400
you for a few days ago

191
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,520
are ready.

192
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,560
It's a special fabric

193
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,680
made in Xichen

194
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,200
that blocks the light perfectly.

195
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,680
My lord asked for this

196
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,120
specifically--

197
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,520
It's just right

198
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,320
for sword practice.

199
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,768
What a waste.

200
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,600
You'd better contain your temper.

201
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,120
So moody.

202
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,000
Who's going to be willing to serve you?

203
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,600
At the Yan Mansion,

204
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,840
who swore by oath

205
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,640
to serve me well?

206
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:34,320
You keep avoiding me.

207
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,000
How can you serve me well?

208
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,480
Do you really want me to serve you?

209
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,400
We are married, after all.

210
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:07,960
Even if something were to happen,

211
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,920
no one could say anything.

212
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,480
Do I look like I'm afraid of gossip?

213
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,160
It is only right for a wife

214
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,040
to attend to her husband.

215
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:30,720
Alright, fine.

216
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
I'll serve you.

217
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,840
You smell so nice, honey.

218
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,280
Would you like to have a sniff

219
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,360
of me, as well?

220
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,040
Giving me a hard time?

221
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,920
Guards.

222
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,360
Light up the lamps

223
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,200
by Madam's side.

224
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,720
Great Chief, something happened
at the Ximing Temple.

225
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,560
We have enough manpower.

226
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,720
The Great Chief wants you to
go back to the Ministry of Justice.

227
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,080
I… It's not like I want to follow you.

228
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,080
Don't come back

229
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:23,720
begging me for assistance.

230
00:18:39,338 --> 00:18:41,960
[Buddhist Lamp Burns, Sins Completely Absolved]

231
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,680
Neat handwriting.

232
00:18:43,680 --> 00:18:45,160
Outstanding brushwork.

233
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
These bloody words

234
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,960
appeared on the wall out of thin air?

235
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,080
It's not blood.

236
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,840
It's a special kind of ink

237
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,720
made of minerals mixed with cinnabar.

238
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,400
Once applied on the wall,

239
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,960
it doesn't show immediately

240
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,760
and only turns red after the rain.

241
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
The culprit wrote it long ago

242
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:13,480
and waited for last night's rain.

243
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,480
The Buddha statue
in the main hall shed blood tears.

244
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,800
Why did the culprit do this?

245
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,440
He was provoking us.

246
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
The Buddha was enraged

247
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,600
and shed blood tears.

248
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,480
I heard the statues would shed blood tears

249
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,960
to lament the coldness of the world.

250
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,840
This is a warning to the people.

251
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,680
Sorry about that.

252
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,320
I wasn't paying attention.

253
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,960
Yan Liuniang.

254
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,200
Our Ministry of Justice

255
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,040
really can't do without you.

256
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,360
You have no idea.

257
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,200
The floor here

258
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:35,840
stopped being shiny.

259
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,160
My lord.

260
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,200
Good morning, my lord.

261
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,280
Isn't this the wife of the Great Chief?

262
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,800
Why is she cleaning the floor here?

263
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,160
Exactly.

264
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,960
This is inappropriate.

265
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:04,280
Here. It's still a bit dirty.

266
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,520
Wash that rag well

267
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,816
before wiping the floor.

268
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,640
My lord, your belt has fallen.

269
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:26,480
Your belt has fallen.

270
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,480
You two quarreled?

271
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,480
No.

272
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,920
No?

273
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,840
Then why did you suddenly come back?

274
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,800
Just tell me.

275
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,040
What have you done again?

276
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,080
I gained weight again.

277
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,520
I have to exercise more.

278
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,960
I became a spy.

279
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,080
Are you sui--

280
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,720
Are you suicidal?

281
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,920
I heard that

282
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,760
a spy once sneaked into

283
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,280
the Shen Mansion at midnight.

284
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,480
By sunrise,

285
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,120
not only did he disappear,

286
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,640
but his whole family--

287
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:28,560
His whole family disappeared.

288
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:29,880
Moreover,

289
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,000
at midnight,

290
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,520
someone saw that

291
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:34,360
the soul collector dragged them

292
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,200
into the Palace of Death.

293
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,080
You may get your whole family killed.

294
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
You're way too bold.

295
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,520
Well…

296
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,960
It's very complicated.

297
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:49,520
Right.

298
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,760
How did it go

299
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:51,760
with Mr. Xu?

300
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,600
Rest assured. Marshal Xu
has put some inspectors on it.

301
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,560
My lord, excuse me for a second.

302
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,760
It's fine.

303
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,200
Yan Liuniang.

304
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,240
I forgot to tell you something.

305
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,000
Your master returned from his travels.
Someone spotted him.

306
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,160
But the Imperial Guards

307
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,760
arrested him the moment

308
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,040
he entered the city.

309
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:11,336
What?

310
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,280
Get your Great Chief here.

311
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,080
Shen Du.

312
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,464
Shen Du.

313
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,240
Shen Du.

314
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,600
The Great Chief is busy.

315
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,120
I am the wife of your chief.

316
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,520
Who dares to stop me?

317
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,240
Shen Du, come out.

318
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,600
Kick her out.

319
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,000
Shen Du, come after me if you have a problem.

320
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
Why did you arrest my master?

321
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,760
Don't take yourself so seriously.

322
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,040
You're not that important.

323
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,560
Release my master.

324
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:58,640
[Chen Wen]
Shen Du, let my master go.

325
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,960
- Release my master.
- Liuniang.

326
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,096
Master.

327
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,280
Look at you.

328
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,600
You've gotten married

329
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,600
yet you're still reckless.

330
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,080
Master.

331
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,840
Please drink less,

332
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:30,480
especially not what others

333
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,600
offer you.

334
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,960
My disciple often

335
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,240
speaks her mind.

336
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,520
Please don't mind her.

337
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,800
I know.

338
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,160
What do you know?

339
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,536
I…

340
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,480
That's it for the game.

341
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,600
Go ahead.

342
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,480
What do you want to ask me?

343
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,840
I heard that you've developed

344
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,320
a unique cinnabar

345
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,600
which turns visible

346
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,640
only with water.

347
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,720
That's right.

348
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,360
I developed it
to prevent the corpses from decomposing.

349
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,520
I wonder if only you have access

350
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:06,440
to this special cinnabar?

351
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,080
Before I retired,

352
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,280
I had given the formula

353
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:11,400
to the servants of a few old friends

354
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,880
for pest control.

355
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,440
It worked really well.

356
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:17,480
Please tell me their names.

357
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,040
I see.

358
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:21,240
This is why the time of disappearance

359
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,440
differs so much from

360
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,520
the time of death.

361
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:26,160
Delay the decomposition.

362
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,320
Repel the insects.

363
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:31,520
That's right, it's the cinnabar.

364
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,400
There were herbs around the corpses.

365
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,200
We thought it was meant to cover the stench.

366
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:37,600
But in fact, it was mixed with

367
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,280
an anti-decomposition cinnabar.

368
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:42,840
That's why the coroner
got the time of death wrong.

369
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,160
Master.

370
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,920
Master Chen,

371
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,920
could you deduce the actual time of death?

372
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,560
What kind of disciple

373
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:59,760
would exhaust their master?

374
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,040
Master.

375
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,480
We have a case to solve.

376
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,880
Please do us a favor
and show us what you've got.

377
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,320
My master has won this game.

378
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,424
I won?

379
00:26:11,424 --> 00:26:13,640
I won.

380
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:18,360
- Let's go then. Take me to the morgue.
- Let's go.

381
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,600
- To the morgue.
- Master, be careful.

382
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,920
Judging from the level of decomposition,

383
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,440
my master deduced the time of death.

384
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,200
Early spring, fourth year of Shengli Era.

385
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,440
Midsummer, same year.

386
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,800
February or March of the fifth year.

387
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,040
June of the sixth year.

388
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,440
Mid-August of the sixth year.

389
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,640
Can't you narrow it down a bit more?

390
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:51,120
I don't think

391
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,280
it's necessary.

392
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:59,160
These are found
in the stomachs of the male victims.

393
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,080
Judging from the level of decomposition,

394
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,840
we believed that even if
the victims had eaten something,

395
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:05,960
the contents in their stomachs

396
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:09,560
would have decomposed along with the body.

397
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,680
I was too hasty.

398
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:19,320
A forensic shouldn't
hold predetermine conclusions.

399
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:22,120
The more bizarre and shocking the case,

400
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,760
the more we must proceed methodically.

401
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:25,960
The key

402
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,560
often lies in

403
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,720
some inconspicuous details.

404
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,160
Seeds.

405
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,800
That's right.

406
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,680
Seeds can only be

407
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,760
digested and expelled

408
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:50,960
through bowel movement

409
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,960
when a person is alive.

410
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,800
And the whole process takes less than a day.

411
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,320
All these victims had seeds in their stomachs.

412
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,840
It means they were killed

413
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:01,000
shortly after eating these.

414
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,440
What makes sense

415
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,400
may not necessarily be the truth.

416
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,840
Sometimes, what you see with your own eyes

417
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
may not necessarily be the truth.

418
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,120
There is a high chance
that someone has used tricks

419
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:19,680
to make you believe that it's the truth.

420
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:20,800
I am enlightened.

421
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,280
What a coincidence.

422
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,440
All these male victims

423
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,960
had seeds before they died?

424
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,960
When there are too many coincidences,

425
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,080
it's no longer a coincidence.

426
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,280
These seeds

427
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,120
are not from ordinary melons,

428
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,560
but gourds from Xichen.

429
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,120
Tribute gourds from Xichen?

430
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,440
They're from the Imperial Palace.

431
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,920
No.

432
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,520
These noblemen had access

433
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,760
to Xichen gourds

434
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,280
on another occasion.

435
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:53,160
The Mizar Festival.

436
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,120
The Astronomical Bureau

437
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,360
determines the date
of the Mizar Festival every year.

438
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,040
The feast is funded by the government.

439
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:03,000
Empress Dowager gives out
treasures during the feast.

440
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,280
But the date differs every year.

441
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:08,440
So when is the next Mizar Festival?

442
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,728
In three days.

443
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,360
Great Chief.

444
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,880
Empress Dowager is still in a meeting.

445
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:25,160
Please wait a little longer.

446
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,120
The Buddha statue wept blood.

447
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,680
Those rampant rumors

448
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,520
gave the Empress Dowager headaches.

449
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,280
Even the Princess of Valor

450
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,240
has been implicated and grounded.

451
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,320
Empress Dowager has decreed.

452
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,040
It is a critical situation.

453
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,320
If the case

454
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,520
is not solved within five days,

455
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,880
it will be handed over
to the Imperial Inspectorate.

456
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:12,360
I accept Her Majesty's decree.

457
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,680
You don't have to be

458
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:23,840
so courteous

459
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,520
to meet me every time.

460
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,720
I heard something happened at Ximing Temple.

461
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,600
It was plotted.

462
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,600
This nursery rhyme is just the beginning.

463
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,000
This matter is getting serious.

464
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:37,280
Prince Xian is in deep trouble.

465
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,680
Princess of Valor has also been grounded.

466
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:43,040
Empress Dowager meant to
discipline all her children.

467
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,360
Forgive me for asking this.

468
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:45,520
Does it have something

469
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,960
to do with you, my lord?

470
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,544
How dare you?

471
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,720
Forgive me for being abrupt.

472
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,920
I just want to find out

473
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,080
the truth

474
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,200
to share your burden.

475
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:06,240
I have nothing to do with this.

476
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,600
However,

477
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,560
how's it going with the investigation?

478
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,640
I'm still clueless.

479
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:15,120
How dare you make a fool of me?

480
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,800
Aren't you afraid I'll kick your family
out of officialdom?

481
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,080
Please allow me to explain, my lord.

482
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,800
You asked me to check the pigeon coop

483
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,960
to figure out

484
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,240
what Empress Dowager thinks about Prince Xian.

485
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:27,040
According to my investigation,

486
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:29,160
you were being paranoid.

487
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,480
How can you be sure?

488
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
The communication

489
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,960
between the Imperial Guards

490
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:34,960
suddenly increased.

491
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,360
Many of the messengers return midway.

492
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,440
It's a method to conceal

493
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,680
the real routes.

494
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:41,480
Besides, many Imperial Guards

495
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,080
have been mobilized.

496
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:44,200
I believe their job

497
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,040
is to keep Prince Xian safe.

498
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Why would Her Majesty do so

499
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:48,600
if she means to harm him?

500
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,360
Even so,

501
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,360
it's merely your assumption.

502
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,080
Isn't it also a speculation

503
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,960
that Prince Xian is in danger, my lord?

504
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,240
I'll trust you for now.

505
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,600
However,

506
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,840
I want a conclusion soon.

507
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:09,920
Rest assured, my lord.

508
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,320
I will soon apprehend

509
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,120
the mastermind behind this.

510
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,440
Good to know.

511
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,880
The assignment to the frontier

512
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
is about to be issued.

513
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:23,360
There isn't much time left for you and Mr. Yan.

514
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,480
[Zhang Baohuan, Assistant Minister
of the Ministry of Rites]

515
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,520
Empress Dowager.

516
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,160
If you don't play,

517
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,440
I will

518
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,080
win this game.

519
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:53,920
Alright.

520
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,920
In that case,

521
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:58,680
I will ask you for a reward.

522
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,960
Sure, tell me.

523
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:03,280
What would you like?

524
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,000
Thanks to Your Majesty,

525
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,880
the feast of the Mizar Festival

526
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,120
will be held by me.

527
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,440
Will you also allow me

528
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,560
to decide whom to invite?

529
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,040
In the past, we've always invited

530
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:25,320
those who could recite poems,

531
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,600
compose verses, and sing.

532
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,360
This time,

533
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,520
can we invite some

534
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,600
real talents and beauties?

535
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:39,160
Invite whoever you want.

536
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,520
Have you

537
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:43,800
taken a liking to some young ladies?

538
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,600
I really

539
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,240
appreciate it, Empress Dowager.

540
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
Madam Xu,

541
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,920
here's the list you gave me.

542
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:02,080
I'm going to invite

543
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,400
everyone on the list.

544
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,880
Thank you, Minister Zhang.

545
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,000
Don't mention it.

546
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,480
I'll count on you

547
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,080
to look after me.

548
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,000
In that case,

549
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,080
all those who know

550
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,480
the cinnabar formula

551
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,800
are invited to the feast.

552
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:25,000
The murderer is among them.

553
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,600
It's not easy to find the murderer

554
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,600
among these people.

555
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:35,639
It might be better
to have the murderer come to us.

556
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:36,639
We can save ourselves

557
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,960
a lot of trouble.

558
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:39,560
The deceased women

559
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:42,120
had similar ornaments.

560
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,159
And they were courtesans

561
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,480
skilled with pipa.

562
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:49,080
If I disguise myself as one of them

563
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,440
to attract attention,

564
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,199
the murderer will naturally make a move.

565
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:54,280
Then you can catch him on the spot.

566
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:55,480
No way.

567
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,000
This is too risky.

568
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,560
I won't let you do this.

569
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:59,880
I…

570
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:01,440
Get someone from Tongming Hall

571
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:03,520
to dress up like the target.

572
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,840
- Understood.
- No way.

573
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,120
The courtesans of Tongming Hall

574
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
are also civilians.

575
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,720
How can we risk the lives of the civilians?

576
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,480
Besides, that murderer

577
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:14,600
is ruthless.

578
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:15,680
If anything happens,

579
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,080
how can you compensate her?

580
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,680
So you know it's dangerous.

581
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
If anything happens to you,

582
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,640
what should I tell Empress Dowager

583
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,280
Prime Minister Zhang, and Mr. Yan?

584
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,000
I strongly advocated

585
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,240
for a thorough investigation of this case.

586
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,480
If I hadn't intervened,

587
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:49,360
it would have been closed long ago.

588
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:51,200
Now we've reached the final step.

589
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,680
I should put it to an end.

590
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,840
A female official

591
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:58,120
should take the risk to solve cases.

592
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:00,360
You want me to risk the lives of civilians.

593
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:02,280
I can't do that.

594
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,760
Can't you tell if you're

595
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,440
up to the mark to disguise as a target?

596
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,800
They're skilled at playing the pipa.

597
00:36:09,800 --> 00:36:11,840
Are you?

598
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,320
Madam turned out to be so talented.

599
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:11,320
So?

600
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:13,360
Am I skilled or not?

601
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:16,360
You have exquisite skills.

602
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,160
Go on and play another piece.

603
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,680
I'm tired. Let's call it a day.

604
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,520
Are you tired or you can't play?

605
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,080
Are you planning to get by
with these few verses

606
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:45,240
at the Mizar Festival?

607
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:05,600
I wasn't

608
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:06,920
prepared for it.

609
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:07,960
I'll speak whatever

610
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,480
comes to mind that is important.

611
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,320
First of all, when you play…

612
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,040
This is the wrong outfit.

613
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,600
You should wear something

614
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,040
cooler.

615
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,280
This may not be necessary.

616
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,480
The key lies

617
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:27,000
not in the melody or rhythm,

618
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,960
but in the vibe.

619
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:33,240
Watch me carefully.

620
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:36,240
You know the postures. The very basics.

621
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,376
Stretch your leg.

622
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,720
Cross-legged.

623
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:45,800
That's right.

624
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,120
Take it slow.

625
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,880
Spin.

626
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,000
Spinning.

627
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,160
Fluttering. Look how the skirt flies up.

628
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,000
Let the skirt fly.

629
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,320
Mother…

630
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,520
Can you stay seated?

631
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,920
You keep spinning.

632
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,840
I can't even see your fingering.

633
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:09,280
It doesn't matter.

634
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,360
This is what matters.

635
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,720
Watch closely.

636
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,200
Raise your arms above your head.

637
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:22,520
Bring them down from behind your head.

638
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,440
Keep your posture enchanting. Show your face.

639
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,840
Eyes. Look at my eyes.

640
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:32,080
A woman's charm.

641
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,640
Focus. Focus on the eyes.

642
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,800
Look at my eyes.

643
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,640
That's right, pay attention.

644
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:43,800
Spin again.

645
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,840
Give it a shake.

646
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,680
Usually,

647
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,080
this piece should have

648
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,000
fallen to the ground.

649
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:00,560
Mother.

650
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
Dance later. Please sit down first.

651
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:06,600
I just want to learn a piece of music.

652
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:09,320
It's not about the quantity, but the quality.

653
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,600
Back then,

654
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,800
I mastered just one piece.

655
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,040
A true master

656
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,400
doesn't need a second piece at all.

657
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,560
And your father

658
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:19,560
never lasted until

659
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,920
the second piece.

660
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,240
Come on, Mother.

661
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:26,120
What are you talking about?

662
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,160
Once you play the pipa on the back

663
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,720
like I taught you,

664
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,400
men couldn't contain themselves.

665
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Mother.

666
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,840
I just want to learn a pipa piece

667
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,040
to solve a case.

668
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,320
What do you think I'm doing?

669
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:42,760
I thought

670
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,440
you wanted me to teach you

671
00:40:44,440 --> 00:40:45,680
some pipa moves

672
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,920
to please your husband.

673
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,880
You got me wrong.

674
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,040
Uncle.

675
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,200
What is my mother

676
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,880
thinking about?

677
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,280
Just because I got married,

678
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,680
what I think and do

679
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:03,840
must be about

680
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,320
pleasing my husband?

681
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,880
Your mother was sent to the opera troupe

682
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,200
at an early age.

683
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,200
The troupe leader

684
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,960
taught us

685
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,440
to tolerant everything,

686
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,600
give up our self-esteem,

687
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,120
and entertain our customers.

688
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,760
Fortunately, your father took pity on her

689
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,600
and provided her with

690
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:24,160
a place to settle down.

691
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:26,280
Therefore,

692
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:27,440
the best future

693
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,880
she could think for you

694
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,480
was to marry a nice man.

695
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,280
Then, by my mother's standards,

696
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,440
I certainly don't have

697
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,360
a promising future.

698
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:41,160
I'm not married to a nice man.

699
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:43,200
Your mother has told me many times

700
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,840
to keep you safe

701
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,920
in the palace,

702
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,920
lest the White…

703
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,440
your husband…

704
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,960
hurt you.

705
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,160
But now that you are safe,

706
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,520
she is relieved.

707
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,240
But now she's focused on

708
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,640
securing your position as the Madam

709
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,280
of the household.

710
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:08,200
She shouldn't be bothered.

711
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:09,560
Whoever

712
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:12,920
fancies this position can take it.

713
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:16,240
I don't need a man's protection.

714
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:18,280
I just hope that

715
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,280
I can become

716
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,800
powerful enough

717
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:24,080
to protect myself

718
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,480
and my family.

719
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,600
I am fortunate to have been born into

720
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,600
an age where women can be officials.

721
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,600
I don't need to serve my husband.

722
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:34,200
It's just that

723
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,640
I need to learn a pipa piece

724
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:37,840
to captivate

725
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:41,120
the attention of the entire audience.

726
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,760
You said

727
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:48,640
it was for a case.

728
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,000
I need to perform a pipa song

729
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,560
at Liushang Pavilion

730
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,440
to lure the snake out of hiding.

731
00:43:10,454 --> 00:43:14,272
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

732
00:43:14,272 --> 00:43:17,949
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

733
00:43:17,949 --> 00:43:22,646

♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

755
00:44:46,921 --> 00:44:50,661
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

756
00:44:50,661 --> 00:44:55,678
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

757
00:44:55,678 --> 00:44:58,558
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

758
00:44:58,558 --> 00:45:02,846
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

759
00:45:02,846 --> 00:45:06,622
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

760
00:45:06,622 --> 00:45:08,192
♫ Your palm lines ♫

761
00:45:08,192 --> 00:45:10,942
♫ Your gaze ♫

762
00:45:10,942 --> 00:45:13,854
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

763
00:45:13,854 --> 00:45:17,854
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

764
00:45:17,854 --> 00:45:22,007
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

765
00:45:22,007 --> 00:45:23,711
♫ Your palm lines ♫

766
00:45:23,711 --> 00:45:26,262
♫ Your gaze ♫

767
00:45:26,262 --> 00:45:29,035
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

768
00:45:29,035 --> 00:45:33,777
♫ You are the one for me ♫
