the reason you received the reward this time

00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,760
[Bihong Gold Workshop]
is always giving gifts in vain.

380
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:19,240
Can this tenth attempt to woo his wife succeed?

381
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,800
They have bought quite a few gifts,

382
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,080
and they're rather expensive.

383
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,480
- This time it should be okay.
- Great Chief.

384
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:25,080
I've bought the latest ear ornaments

385
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,520
and hairpins.

386
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,880
Take this.

387
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,160
I…

388
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:32,040
I really can't carry any more.

389
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:34,280
Why don't you get more people to carry it?

390
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,080
We are not short of people.

391
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,760
You don't understand.

392
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,880
The less people know about this, the better.

393
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,400
Everyone in the entire Xiang'an City

394
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,240
knows about it.

395
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,440
No one knows about it.

396
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:47,600
We support you, Great Chief.

397
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,960
Get the girl back soon.

398
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:51,960
- No one knows about it.
- We support you.

399
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,280
Great Chief, we support you.

400
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,200
That's good.

401
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,520
All the men of Xiang'an City

402
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,520
must take him as a warning.

403
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,360
They have to know

404
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,280
they must not offend their wives.

405
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,080
Empress Dowager.

406
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,880
Director Yan is here.

407
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,120
Come in.

408
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,160
Yes.

409
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,816
She's here.

410
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,120
Greetings to you, Empress Dowager.

411
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,960
Rise and speak.

412
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,280
Come closer.

413
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,280
Today, I summoned you to the palace.

414
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,320
Firstly,

415
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,200
the festival is coming soon.

416
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,040
Madam Xu and I

417
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:01,160
want to have a casual chat with you.

418
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,120
Secondly,

419
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,840
there is good news for you.

420
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,920
Empress Dowager has already
issued an imperial decree,

421
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,120
ordering to reform the system of taking
official positions through family lineage

422
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,920
to select officials based on their merits.

423
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:19,440
Regardless of background,

424
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
everyone can have an equal opportunity

425
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,400
to pursue honor and distinction

426
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
and serve the country.

427
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,320
All the scholars from humble backgrounds

428
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,960
must be grateful for your cherishing of talent,

429
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:34,560
and study diligently to serve the country.

430
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:47,400
Move on, next one.

431
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,416
Raise your hand.

432
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,360
Move on.

433
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,536
Turn around.

434
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,560
Good.

435
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,920
Pan Chi.

436
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,240
It really is you.

437
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,280
What's wrong?

438
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,600
Can't I take the exam?

439
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,280
Of course, you can.

440
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,480
Here,

441
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,800
we welcome candidates from all over the world.

442
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,520
But I heard that

443
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,720
someone

444
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:19,400
is not interested in becoming an official.

445
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,520
Indeed, one will become

446
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
like the one he always hangs out with.

447
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
You're starting to sound

448
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,040
more and more like Lu Chuichui.

449
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,800
Are you saying Chuichui is bad?

450
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,320
You said that.

451
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,680
- You!
- I'm not interested in being an official.

452
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,800
I just have to prove myself with this exam,

453
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,880
and check

454
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,440
whether your exam

455
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,320
is truly fair or not.

456
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:50,160
Alright, then take the exam

457
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:52,240
and check carefully.

458
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,440
There's something

459
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,040
I have long wished to do.

460
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,880
But

461
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,200
I can't do it.

462
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:04,160
In my heart,

463
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,720
I have never forgotten Chen Baiyi.

464
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:11,720
On behalf of Chen Baiyi

465
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,240
and scholars from humble backgrounds,

466
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:15,680
I extend thanks to you.

467
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,760
Director Yan.

468
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,280
You always think of others.

469
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,320
Maybe

470
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,000
you should think more of your own.

471
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,560
Me?

472
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,440
What do you mean?

473
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:44,640
See. I give the scholars
the chance to take the exam.

474
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,640
What about you?

475
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:51,720
Do you think

476
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,640
you could give a chance

477
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,720
to someone around you?

478
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,000
There is a saying,

479
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,800
cherish the one around you.

480
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,640
Wake up.

481
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,280
I am here.

482
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,560
Mother.

483
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:22,080
Why do you wake me up early in the morning?

484
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,480
Today is my day off.

485
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,440
Get up and get dressed.

486
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,720
Otherwise, we'll be late for the ceremony.

487
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,880
What ceremony?

488
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,680
Come in and put the stuff well.

489
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,960
Be careful.

490
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,320
Yes, yes.

491
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,520
Sanniang, take it easy.

492
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:44,440
Put all the things over there.

493
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,040
Yes.

494
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,040
Be careful.

495
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,880
Be careful, don't bump or knock anything.

496
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:55,760
Be careful, put them down gently.

497
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,320
Mother.

498
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,320
What's the matter?

499
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,960
Well,

500
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,400
I

501
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,920
went to the ancestral hall
to consult our ancestors

502
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,400
and went to the temple to find the priestess.

503
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,840
They all said

504
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,920
that you got married

505
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:17,440
without the proper ceremonies,

506
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,120
and somehow

507
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,320
got divorced.

508
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,600
This is a great disrespect,

509
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,760
and a serious taboo.

510
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:26,720
You've deceived the ancestors

511
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,520
and the Matchmaker God.

512
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:29,600
In the future,

513
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,240
you will encounter tribulations.

514
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,120
Mother, so you mean,

515
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:35,520
even the gods don't allow me to divorce.

516
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,920
No, no.

517
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,040
I have figured it out.

518
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,920
If you want to divorce, then do it.

519
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,520
But the tribulations must be solved.

520
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,360
The only way to solve them

521
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:48,520
is to go through

522
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,040
the entire wedding ceremony properly.

523
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:53,880
After register it to the gods,

524
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:57,960
then you can formally get a divorce.

525
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,920
Yes, Liuniang.

526
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,560
I also asked the priestess.

527
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,200
The tribulations aren't only bad for you,

528
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,280
but also bad for the Yan family.

529
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:13,880
I am also a bit scared.

530
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,800
Yes, Liuniang.

531
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:16,920
Look.

532
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,000
Caiwei is still pregnant.

533
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,040
You'd

534
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:22,600
better to believe it.

535
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,760
Rather than take it lightly.

536
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:54,840
One should always be with the one he loves.

537
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,400
Treating each other with mutual respect

538
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,360
and valuing each other.

539
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:01,120
This is what makes a lifetime happy.

540
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,760
From now on,

541
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:07,280
you won't be alone anymore.

542
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,000
I will definitely try

543
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,440
to help you find out the truth

544
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,840
This virtuous lady

545
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:18,760
is me.

546
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,280
With your ability,

547
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:22,600
want to flirt to me?

548
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,040
Bridal snatch.

549
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,600
Can it really work?

550
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,400
Yes.

551
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,200
What are you doing?

552
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,200
We're about to get married.

553
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,480
Who said to give my bestie

554
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,200
a grand wedding full of sincerity?

555
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,704
Changed your mind?

556
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:08,760
Of course not.

557
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,800
I'm just afraid of

558
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,640
getting scolded by her.

559
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,960
How can you be more rigid than

560
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:16,120
Stiffy Jiang?

561
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
What's there to be afraid of?

562
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,440
You should be afraid of being abandoned.

563
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
Great Chief, to marry a woman,

564
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,120
you should have the courage

565
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,000
to do it and never give up.

566
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,080
Great Chief.

567
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,360
Congratulations, Great Chief.

568
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:38,400
My wife said,

569
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,160
although Liuniang was reluctant,

570
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,880
she still sat down to do her makeup.

571
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:48,040
Great Chief, don't you still understand?

572
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:50,000
Madam is so clever.

573
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,040
Can she not see that today is a trap?

574
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,320
Since she can sit down to do her makeup,

575
00:31:53,320 --> 00:31:56,000
it means she accepts it.

576
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,280
Exactly.

577
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:58,560
You are the Great Chief,

578
00:31:58,560 --> 00:31:59,640
how can you

579
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,640
be that foolish?

580
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,800
Great Chief.

581
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,328
Attack.

582
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,456
Go.

583
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,760
Liuniang.

584
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,400
I have come to take you home.

585
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,120
Alright, take a look.

586
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,560
So pretty.

587
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:43,720
My girl is really pretty.

588
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,080
Beautiful.

589
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,360
What a perfect girl.

590
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,840
I really can't get enough.

591
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,440
You are so much like me.

592
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,400
Mother.

593
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,760
Enough.

594
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:08,280
Guys, have you figured out the answer

595
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,360
to the first riddle of the lantern?

596
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:18,719
A line of white egrets soar into the blue sky.

597
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,080
Congratulations.

598
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:25,320
You got the last riddle correctly.

599
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,840
Luckily, you had me, Lu Chuichui.

600
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,360
Otherwise, relying on you blockheads,

601
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,480
you would never get it right.

602
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:32,600
Yes, yes. Chuichui is right.

603
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,080
Our Yan family is a scholarly clan.

604
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,480
To marry a woman from our Yan family as a wife,

605
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,360
you must have outstanding talent.

606
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:44,480
The next challenge

607
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:45,760
requires composing a good poem

608
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,760
to express your genuine feelings.

609
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:53,040
It seems that Great Chief
has reached the second challenge.

610
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,320
The poem challenge

611
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,679
is not that easy to pass.

612
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,200
Day by day, sick with wine
in front of the flowers.

613
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,080
Not minding you're getting old in the mirror.

614
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,960
Seeing the sky at dawn and the clouds at dusk.

615
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,280
I miss you while walking.

616
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,440
I miss you while sitting.

617
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,840
Standing alone on a bridge,
sleeves filled with wind.

618
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:33,320
After people return under the new moon.

619
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,920
Enjoyments and pleasures, with whom to share.

620
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:37,360
Fortunate to know you,

621
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,480
so we can cross and return.

622
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:43,760
Thank you for arriving in time.

623
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,440
Your ears are all red from the cold.

624
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,240
What are you doing?

625
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,200
I just want others to see

626
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,800
how close we are.

627
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,600
Liuniang.

628
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:18,560
I think you should go out there.

629
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:21,000
I can't stand hearing

630
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:22,280
the poem composed

631
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,320
by Great Chief Shen anymore.

632
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,440
Yes, Liuniang.

633
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,240
Stop him.

634
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:28,880
We are all of this age,

635
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,440
can't stand being tormented.

636
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,760
Good poem, brilliant.

637
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,400
You've passed.

638
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:45,760
Please, Great Chief.

639
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,480
This is the final challenge.

640
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,800
It's a martial contest.

641
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,120
If you want to marry my sister,

642
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,280
you have to beat both of us first.

643
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,840
Otherwise, don't even think
about taking my sister away.

644
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,960
Great Chief, this challenge is in the bag.

645
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,080
Don't move, what are you doing?

646
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
Great Chief, go.

647
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,160
This is completely cheating.

648
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,560
Let Mojie and a child
compete in a martial contest.

649
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:30,680
Does this count as a challenge?

650
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:34,720
Then I'll compete dancing with him?

651
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,440
- You've lost.
- What?

652
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,160
They

653
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,360
can win against Shen Du?

654
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,680
I think he lost on purpose.

655
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,520
Oh no, Liuniang.

656
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,640
Shen Du has lost,

657
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,480
and left despondently.

658
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,640
Shen Du.

659
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,040
You are still here?

660
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,240
You are here.

661
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,520
Where can I go?

662
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,240
Well well, Shen Du.

663
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,960
You put on a show to lie to me.

664
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:01,544
I…

665
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:27,360
I am a dull husband,

666
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,800
can't woo such a smart wife properly.

667
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,760
So I had to make some tricks.

668
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,320
Don't blame me.

669
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,760
Don't let it happen again.

670
00:40:09,846 --> 00:40:14,614
♫ Endless long night, the moonlight reflects
on the western window ♫

671
00:40:14,614 --> 00:40:19,056
♫ Your eyes hide the starlight ♫

672
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:20,896
♫ With one touch ♫

673
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:25,659
♫ I flutter like the shadow of a candle,
swaying and trembling ♫

674
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:30,451
♫ The more one cares,
the deeper it's concealed ♫

675
00:40:30,451 --> 00:40:35,776
♫ Leaves fall and turn yellow,
with a thousand lines of yearning ♫

676
00:40:35,776 --> 00:40:40,800
♫ Years pass like stanzas of poetry,
romantic yet sad ♫

677
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,487
♫ Two hearts ♫

678
00:40:42,487 --> 00:40:46,399
♫ Colliding between dawn and dusk ♫

679
00:40:46,399 --> 00:40:51,536
♫ Embraces come too sudden ♫

680
00:40:52,243 --> 00:40:55,176
♫ Wish to stay with you ♫

681
00:40:55,176 --> 00:40:59,072
♫ Want to keep you by my side ♫

682
00:40:59,072 --> 00:41:03,257
♫ Through the obstacles of gusty winds
and torrential rains ♫

683
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,859
♫ Want to be your moonlight ♫

684
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:09,810
♫ To accompany you till the dawn ♫

685
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:12,483
♫ I wish ♫

686
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:16,483
♫ To just forget the length of time ♫

687
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:18,999
♫ Wish to stay with you ♫

688
00:41:18,999 --> 00:41:23,271
♫ Want to be with you,
never to forget one another ♫

689
00:41:23,271 --> 00:41:27,256
♫ Clouds and sea always meet somewhere ♫

690
00:41:27,256 --> 00:41:30,093
♫ Wish to be with you forever ♫

691
00:41:30,093 --> 00:41:33,728
♫ Waiting from youth till hair turns gray ♫

692
00:41:33,728 --> 00:41:36,288
♫ In this life ♫

693
00:41:36,288 --> 00:41:42,624
♫ Just keep you in my heart ♫

694
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,240
May you have a baby soon.

695
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,240
May you be a happily married couple.

696
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:24,000
Honey, shall we go home?

697
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,384
Let's go home.

698
00:43:03,703 --> 00:43:07,521
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

699
00:43:07,521 --> 00:43:11,198
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

700
00:43:11,198 --> 00:43:15,895
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

701
00:43:15,895 --> 00:43:18,839
♫ We are forever bound ♫

702
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:22,294
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

703
00:43:22,294 --> 00:43:25,841
♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫

704
00:43:25,841 --> 00:43:30,815
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

705
00:43:30,815 --> 00:43:33,759
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

706

♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

707
