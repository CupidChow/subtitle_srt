The criminals arrested

21
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,320
You'd better think twice

22
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,520
about what to note down,

23
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,760
what to report,

You don't trust Sun Tan?

30
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,360
Of course not.

31
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,840
It's just that this truth
that's about to reveal

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,560
is too terrifying

33
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,320
to believe.

34
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,160
But just as Lai Luozhi said,

35
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:20,480
we have no solid evidence for now.

36
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400

00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,880
what will you do about it?

40
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,000
I will report it as it is.

What's wrong?

00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,040
Seems like you're suddenly scared of me again.

Have you recently

00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:18,480
What do you want to do?

53
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,520
Do you want to hurt Yan Xing?

54
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,520
That's unfair.

I thought you said I was your friend too.

56
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Then why are you only
worried about me hurting her,

57
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,840
yet not worried
if she might want to ruin my plan?

58

And you even went to find Madam Xu

from the Imperial Guards watching me?

your head was no longer on your neck.

But Sun Tan suspects

75
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,560
Lai Luozhi is trying to take control

76
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,960

77
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,320
even conspiring
with foreign tribes for ill intentions.

78
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,480
Shouldn't such important information

79
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,760
be reported to the Empress Dowager?

80
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,440
And I thought you wanted to help Sun Tan.

81
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,680
Sun Tan has been very helpful

82
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,160

83
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,480
Of course I'm going to help him.

from investigating the case.

But in the future,

88
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,560
don't be so reckless.

89

Next time something comes up,

don't forget your husband
is the Great Chief of the Imperial Guards.

What I did today

100
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,240
was what truly pisses Lai Luozhi off.

101
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,600
I don't even know

102
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,760
if I am helping Sun Tan,

103
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,960
or harming him.

104
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,400
Be true to your heart
and do not worry about the future.

105
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,480
Since you've told on me to Yan Xing

106
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,200
and Xu Xiangren,

107
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,560

00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,840

00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,200
But you have a way to survive.

111
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,920

113
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,000

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,840
before he became a marshal.

115
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,120
I promise

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,600
you can walk out of
the Imperial Inspectorate alive

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,320
and even take up the position

118
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,000
of the next Marshal of Inspectors.

119
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,240
You want me to frame Marshal Xu?

120

This Xu Xiangren

121
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,560
is really an eyesore.

122
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,160
Do you know how Xu Xiangren

123
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,520
became the Marshal of Inspectors?

124
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,280
Back then,

125
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:09,400
he made an agreement three times
with the present Empress Dowager

126
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
to steal treasures from the imperial palace.

127
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,160
And he managed to

128
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,000
steal the treasures amidst thousands of guards.

129
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,520
The Empress Dowager admired his talent,

130
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:25,280
so allowed him to take over
Marshal Yuan's position.

131
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,800
With your ability,

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,120
how dare you to frame him!

133
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:40,040
What a tough man!

134
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,160
You haven't seen the situation clearly.

135
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,040
Just give me the list.

136
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,440
The Imperial Inspectorate will handle the rest.

137
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,880
It's a simple job for you,

138
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,320
and it's not exactly betrayal, is it?

139
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,920
Don't you want

140
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,000
to be the Marshal of Inspectors

00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,280
who's commanding all inspectors?

142
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,160
I do.

143
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,400
Very much.

144
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,160
I really want to take the token

145
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,400

- You guys go.
- Don't hit him.

Don't hit him. He's a nice person.

Right. He's a nice person.

Stop putting on a show.

166

You don't look rich.

167
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,600
Maybe you haven't stolen as much as I have.

168
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,000
Now I'm not skillful enough.

169
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,240
When I get better at it,

170
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,440
I could steal anything from the palace.

171
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,520
Alright.

172
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,760
Then you guys just wait.

Be gentle.

176
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,080
Were these

177
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,720
things you stole from the palace?

178
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,080
I have already promised the Empress Dowager.

179
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,160
From now on,

180
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:47,240
I am the one who commands all the inspectors,

181
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,520
Marshal of Inspectors.

182
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:50,720
If you want to work for me,

183
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,920
then become inspectors.

184
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,000
I don't want to become an inspector.

185

This…

254
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,040

and Fire Fueling Technique.

256
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,760
It means that the great fire at the granary

257
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,280
that led to the Shen family's conviction

258
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,480
was deliberately triggered
by someone using the Fire Fueling Technique.

given by late Emperor to the Zhou family

263
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:52,680

that fire

267
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,240

269
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,520
was never anyone else,

but her, Zhou Xu, the Zhou family.

271
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:16,080
The Fire Fueling Technique
is the secret technique of the Huo'e Sect.

272
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,120
Why would it be related to the Zhou family?

A secret report from Gannandao.

281
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,520
It's the autopsy results

282
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,200
of those Half-faced Demons in the Gannandao.

283
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,680
Regarding those triangular-shaped needle marks,

284
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:51,360
upon examination, it is the slow-acting poison,

285
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,576
Ten-Day Poison.

286
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,200
As the name implies,
the people who get poisoned

287
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,160
would die of poison ten days later.

288
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:03,720
Liuniang.

289
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:06,040
On the neck of the deceased,

290
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,960
there were triangular-shaped needle marks.

291
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:11,600
Yuanniang. So as Yuanniang.

292
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,160
Shen Du, do you remember it?

293
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:14,400
The day of the Imperial Preceptor's memorial,

294
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,840
I got captured by you.

295
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:16,960
I was on the mountain

296
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,640
investigating the Yuanniang case.

297
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,320
The case was closed as a crime of passion.

298
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,920
But when I was sorting through the dossiers,

299
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,080
I discovered

300
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:24,120
that on Yuanniang's body,

301
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,600
there were also triangular-shaped needle marks,

302
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
indicating that Yuanniang

303
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:32,000
most likely was also poisoned
with the Ten-Day Poison.

304
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,160
Why would the Huo'e Sect target her

305
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,560
and even use a slow-acting poison on her?

306
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,720
An ordinary farmer was targeted

307
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,760
and poisoned with a slow-acting poison.

308
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,840
There's only one possibility.

309
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:48,680
She knew something she shouldn't have,

310
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,160
and had to be killed.

311
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,120
Go check if she had any special identity

312
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,720
or secrets.

313
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,432
Yes.

314
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,720
It seems that the granary back then

315
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:08,280
was indeed empty.

316
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,800
Using the Huo'e Sect's Fire Fueling Technique
to burn the granary

317
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,720
was to cover up

318
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,600
the fact that the granary was empty.

319
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,520
This matter is likely

320
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,960
related to Lai Luozhi.

321
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,560
- And the Zhou family…
- Liuniang.

322
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:26,056
Thank you.

323
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,440
Now it seems

324
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,480
that the ones
causing my family to be wrongfully accused

325
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,840
are complicated and powerful.

326
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:37,120
We can't rush it.

327
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:46,680
Liuniang, no matter what,

328
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,480
I don't want you to be at risk.

329
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,760
Shen Du.

330
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,320
What time is it now?

331
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,080
Don't worry. Take a rest today.

332
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,760

334
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,992
It's very useful.

335
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,400
The secrets behind the Shen family case

336
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,000
are about to reveal.

337
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,656
Thank you, Madam.

338
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,760
Yuanniang, Ten-Day Poison.

339
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,360
Jing Lin went to investigate.

340
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,760
She's not just a farmer nearby,

341
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,080
but also used to be responsible
for cleaning the Ming Hall.

342
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:55,752
Ming Hall?

343
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,840
Before the Imperial Preceptor died,

344
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,520
he'd been living in Ming Hall.

345
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,000
But since the Imperial Preceptor passed away,

346
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,800
all people related to Ming Hall

347
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:06,080
have all disappeared.

348
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,920
Could all this be related
to the Imperial Preceptor's death?

349
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,360
Did the Imperial Preceptor…

350
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,000
After the Imperial Preceptor
divined the last prophecy,

351
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,360
he passed away shortly after.

352
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,840
I have heard a rumor.

353
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,880
The last prophecy of the Imperial Preceptor

354
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
is that "The Phoenix Leads Nine Chicks,
The World Is At Peace."

355
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,760
And there's a latter half unknown.

356
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,800
In that case,

357
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:33,760
the death of the Imperial Preceptor

358
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,320
might also be quite suspicious.

359
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,000
The death of the Imperial Preceptor

360
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,760
and Yuanniang,

361
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,560
and the disappearance
of those related to Ming Hall,

362
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,920
are all related to that prophecy?

363
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,960
Madam.

364
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,840
Someone from the palace
came to deliver an imperial decree,

365
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,080
saying the Empress Dowager

366
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,960
has summoned you
to meet her alone in the palace.

367
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:06,120
I'll go with you.

368
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:11,320
The Empress Dowager asked me to go alone.

369
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,520
Okay, Mr. Zhong, I got it.

370
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,040
Ask the messenger to wait a moment.

371
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,400
I will change my clothes and go.

372
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,784
Yes.

373
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,000
Wait for me.

374
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,720
Mind the propriety.

375
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:56,160
Don't act recklessly.

376
00:25:56,160 --> 00:26:02,360
And don't bring up anything
related to Sun Tan anymore.

377
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,520
Don't mention anything related to Lai Luozhi

378
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,800
or the Shen family.

379
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,920
Alright, I got it.

380
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,240
When did you get so long-winded?

381
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,720
Madam Xu.

382
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,240
This is not the way to the small study.

383
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:44,600
We're not going to the small study today.

384
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:48,000
The Empress Dowager is waiting for you
in the sleeping palace.

385
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,680
The Empress Dowager's sleeping palace?

386
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,352
Empress Dowager.

387
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,840
I pay my respect, Your Majesty.

388
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,960
Please rise.

389
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,440
Jade cake?

390
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,680
This is my

391
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,720
favorite food.

392
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,040
Now I can't make it.

393
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:16,600
Even eating half a piece,

394
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,520
I can't eat anything for half a day.

395
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:21,280
Not like you young people anymore.

396
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:23,280
Have a taste.

397
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,200
This jade cake

398
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,480
is incredibly rare,

399
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,560
made from rouge rice
tributed from the Western Regions.

400
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:36,240
Dry it and then ground it into powder,

401
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,200
then combine it with lotus leaf powder.

402
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:40,160
The filling is even more complex.

403
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,040
The Empress Dowager does not
easily reward people with this.

404
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,240
Have a taste

405
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,520
and see what's different from
what's made outside the palace.

406
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,440
It's salty?

407
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:59,800
So whether it's this pastry or people,

408
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,360
just by looking at the surface,

409
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,880
you can't always tell

410
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,280
or might make mistakes.

411
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,640
You're so talkative.

412
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,072
Empress Dowager.

413
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,640
Empress Dowager.

414
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,320
In a couple of days,
it will be the Start of Winter.

415
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,160
You must not catch a cold.

416
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:27,200
You all

417
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,960
think that I am old.

418
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,720
Empress Dowager,
you are the lucky star of Dacang.

419
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,240
We are all wishing you

420
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,520
to live a long life

421
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,680
and bless on Dacang.

422
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:40,840
Yan Xing.

423
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:43,080
Do you know why I summoned you

424
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,560
this time?

425
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,240
I don't know.

426
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:51,400
There's something

427
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,640
I want to know.

428
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,160
Here is the first thing.

429
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,360
I heard

430
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,320
Mo Qianzhi, former Governor of Yingzhou

431
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,040
claimed before his death

432
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,520
that the Shen family case

433
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:07,280
was led by me.

434
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,360
Shen Du is so loyal

435
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,640
to you.

436
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,760
So am I.

437
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,120
Do not panic.

438
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,280
Rise and tell us in detail.

439
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,880
Mo Qianzhi did say so.

440
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,040
But Shen Du

441
00:29:29,040 --> 00:29:30,920
has served you for many years,

442
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:33,720
how could he be fooled by a few words?

443
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,800
Moreover,

444
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,440
that Mo Qianzhi was also fooled by villains,

445
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,480
only then did he believe these words.

446
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,120
Mo Qianzhi wanted
to repay his master's kindness,

447
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,720
and had an obsession in his heart,

448
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,000
wanting to find out the truth
about the Shen family case.

449
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,240
Thus he was misled by someone

450
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,560
and went astray,

451
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,480
becoming the executioner of the Huo'e Sect.

452
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,800
Thus he made a grave mistake.

453
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,920
Here is the second thing.

454
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:57,720
The Huo'e Sect has lingered in
Yingzhou for many years,

455
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,960
and yet not a trace of rumor leaked out.

456
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,720
Then does this Huo'e Sect

457
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,120
have power elsewhere?

458
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,616
Well…

459
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,280
I'm afraid so.

460
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:13,400
But what

461
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,480
they will appear on the public

462
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,800
is still unknown.

463
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,720
This Yingzhou case is an example.

464
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:21,840
If one Mo Qianzhi falls,

465
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,640
will there be more Mo Qianzhis to emerge?

466
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,000
Empress Dowager,
you are diligent and love the people.

467
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,680
If the people live and work in peace,

468
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,880
there definitely won't be more

469
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:36,680
people like Mo Qianzhi emerging.

470
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,760
Back then,

471
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,720
I was in the imperial court
assisting the Young Emperor,

472
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,000
bearing so many curses.

473
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,400
No one can really understand

474
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,600
how helpless I was.

475
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:49,880
Everyone wants to live comfortably.

476
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:53,680
But since one holds a position,

477
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:54,920
one should

478
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,880
shoulder the responsibilities
that come with it.

479
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,760
As the Empress Dowager,

480
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:03,400
I am well aware of the uncertain future.

481
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:05,880
But I have never given up.

482
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,800
Qi was little,

483
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,760
as a woman, I led the officials,

484
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:14,040
there were a few men in the world
who were convinced.

485
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:17,040
Yet, I was determined to make them convinced.

486
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,120
These years have been smooth,

487
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:27,160
and I'm not letting down the late emperor.

488
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,480
You are

489
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,640
the role model for all women in Dacang.

490
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,520
One more thing.

491
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,840
Regarding the Sun Tan's death,

492
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:50,400
I know that you

493
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:54,440
submitted the petition
to the palace despite pressure.

494
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,120
But Sun Tan still died for no reason.

495
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,200
Do you think

496
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:01,520
that it was me

497
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:05,760
who let Lai Luozhi do whatever he wants?

498
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,080
Empress Dowager

499
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:11,880
needs Vice Minister Lai
to inspect the officials.

500
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,280
Naturally it requires power.

501
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,680
But I know

502
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,920
everyone would make mistakes.

503
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,320
If there's something suspicious in the case,

504
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,120
I am willing to be a candid advisor,

505
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:25,240
offering straightforward advice
and corrections.

506
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,360
Good.

507
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,480
What a candid advisor you are!

508
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,720
Yan Xing, you are frank and straightforward.

509
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,920
I like you.

510
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,360
Do you know

511
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:44,560
Lai Luozhi

512
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:47,120
paid his respects to me last night?

513
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,000
He mentioned many of your accomplishments.

514
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,040
And he even told me

515
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:54,240
to value you.

516
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,880
I'm flattered.

517
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,920
I have no dealings with Mr. Lai.

518
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,880
I don't know

519
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,480
why Mr. Lai complimented me.

520
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:03,760
I…

521
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,080
do not desire any reward.

522
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,680
I only wish to resolve the case

523
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,960
and find out the truth,

524
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,160
to bring justice to the deceased.

525
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,720
Alright, rise.

526
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:16,080
You have always knelt down.

527
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,408
Rise.

528
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,000
Come, come here.

529
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,328
Take this.

530
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,320
Looking at you

531
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,760
reminds me of when I was young.

532
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,200
If you are available,

533
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:48,560
come to the palace more often
to chat with me, alright?

534
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,280
Thank you, Empress Dowager.

535
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,199
Have you ever heard of Ms. Shu?

536
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,520
The concubine

537
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,120
who was with the late emperor from Nanlang?

538
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:19,920
I've heard a little.

539
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,280
This was once the mansion given to Ms. Shu

540
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,679
by the later emperor.

541
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:27,960
Rumor has it

542
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:29,760
Ms. Shu fought for favor,

543
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,239
got killed by the Empress Dowager

544
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,840
at the time.

545
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:38,960
In fact, due to miss the homeland,

546
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,920
Ms. Shu passed away in melancholy.

547
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,040
In this palace,

548
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:43,600
this is another

549
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,040
sad story.

550
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:14,880
Now that you have the token to come
and go in the imperial palace as you please.

551
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,720
You should understand

552
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,520
power comes

553
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,200
with great responsibility.

554
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,240
I feel confused.

555
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,760
Please advise, Madam Xu.

556
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,440
A few days ago, I delivered for you

557
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,080
the testimony of Sun Tan,

558
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,280
and the Empress Dowager gave no comments.

559
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,960
Lai Luozhi deliberately complimented you
in front of the Empress Dowager.

560
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,240
Today, the Empress Dowager

561
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,640
specifically invited you here,

562
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,120
to give you the chance to explain.

563
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,240
You should understand

564
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,520
that in this world
where men are honored above women,

565
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,600
the Empress Dowager
must consider public opinion,

566
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:52,040
also ensure the loyalty of her officials.

567
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:53,600
I thought

568
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,200
that things in the world
were either black or white.

569
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,320
But after experiencing so much,

570
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,920
I have come to understand a little.

571
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:04,520
The Empress Dowager
intentionally shows you favor.

572
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,440
Firstly, because she truly values you.

573
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:09,520
And secondly, of course, for Shen Du.

574
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:10,760
And you were recommended
by Prime Minister Zhang

575
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,920
to marrying into the Shen family.

576
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,160
Now Lai Luozhi admires you.

577
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,280
It's hard not to wonder

578
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:19,880
if you're an informant

579
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,720
between black and white.

580
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,680
I'm Yan Xing,
Chief Director of the Ministry of Justice.

581
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,920
Greetings to Mr. Lai.

582
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:05,960
You've spent much time with Shen Du,

583
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,520
I do not know about the others,

584
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,760
but you've become quite reckless.

585
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,520
I am confused.

586
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,600
Even the case

587
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,000
that Dali Supreme Court avoids,

588
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:18,160
yet you dare

589
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,960
to take on the presiding judge.

590
00:37:19,960 --> 00:37:21,560
I guess it's because

591
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:24,720
you have the Imperial Guards backing you.

592
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,120
And even those roving bandits

593
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,280
want to help you.

594
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,280
But no matter what you did,

595
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,360
the Sun Tan case

596
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,040
has no effect on me.

597
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,400
You should understand the situation clearly.

598
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,440
Thank you for the reminder, Mr. Lai.

599
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,920
I have no great talent or ambitions.

600
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,520
I naturally do things

601
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,120
without sufficient consideration.

602
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,680
Well,

603
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:55,640
I really admire your sister,

604
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:57,080
being adept with both the pen and the sword.

605
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,160
Really amazing.

606
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,240
Right.

607
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,560
That day, when my husband and I

608
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:06,000
were strolling on the streets of Yingzhou,

609
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,320
my husband said he saw your sister.

610
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,280
Mrs. Shen, what are you talking about?

611
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,960
It's been cold recently,

612
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,200
my sister has been resting at home all along.

613
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,320
A few days ago,

614
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,800
she went out together

615
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,960
with several officials' family members.

616
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,400
Why would she have gone to Yingzhou?

617
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,520
Mrs. Shen, if you want to frame someone,

618
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:33,000
you have to get solid evidence.

619
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:35,600
If Shen Du can't teach you well,

620
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,840
maybe come to my Imperial Inspectorate,

621
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
I will certainly

622
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,320
teach you properly.

623
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,856
Is that so?

624
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,000
Well, I wish your sister

625
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,280
good health.

626
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:52,320
I take my leave.

627
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,520
Right.

628
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,240
Prince Xian

629
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,120
invites officials
to the Dongzhi Festival banquet.

630
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,440
I guess

631
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:04,840
you have also received the invitation, right?

632
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,600
Mrs. Shen.

633
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,320
See you at the Prince Xian's mansion.

634
00:39:19,477 --> 00:39:23,050
[Chengtian Gate]

635
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,848
Shen Du.

636
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,000
Someone in the palace has sent me a message,

637
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,560
saying that Lai Luozhi
intercepted you on the way.

638
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,600
So I rushed over immediately.

639
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,840
Did he do anything to you?

640
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,320
Your ears are all red from the cold.

641
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,280
You usually complain that the carriage is slow,

642
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,200
so why did you take the carriage today?

643
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,400
It's cold, and riding a horse is cold.

644
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,800
I never knew

645
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,200
that you were so considerate.

646
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,320
How's today?

647
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,120
It's the Empress Dowager's private token.

648
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:53,520
Madam Xu reminded me of something.

649
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,160
Power comes

650
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,480
great responsibility.

651
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,560
If I'm correct,

652
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,320
while the Empress Dowager
asked the Imperial Guards

653
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:05,560
to monitor the Imperial Inspectorate
and Lai Luozhi,

654
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,240
Lai Luozhi has also received a secret decree

655
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,600
to monitor the Imperial Guards.

656
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:11,680
No wonder today

657
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,040
Lai Luozhi especially
waited for me at the palace gate,

658
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,240
and even deliberately complimented me

659
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,840
in front of the Empress Dowager.

660
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,320
I'm sure he guessed it too.

661
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,720
Then, at the banquet
at the Prince Xian's mansion,

662
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,960
will Lai Luozhi secretly do anything evil?

663
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,920
Don't worry.

664
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,240
I will protect you.

665
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,224
Let's go.

666
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:58,913
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

667
00:41:58,913 --> 00:42:02,590
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫
