[Episode 13]

15
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,160
At Chen Shoujie's mansion,

16
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,800
only a piece of fabric
from Jinxiu Workshop was found.

17
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
As to which year's pattern specifically,

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,560
I need to confirm it.

19
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,640
Not your concern?

20
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,800
Very good.

21
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,520
Jing Lin.

22
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,960
Yes, Great Chief.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,400
I'll take this mad woman

24
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,160
and incarcerate her in the eighteenth level
prison of the Imperial Guards.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,680
Who said to bring her back
to the Imperial Guards?

26
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,080
Take Yun Que

27
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,919
back to Shen Mansion for care.

28
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,480
Miss Yun Que, please.

[Yan Mansion]

30
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,120
Miss, a maid from Shen Mansion
seeks an audience.

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,440
Xiaohe?

32
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,520
Madam, please hurry back to the mansion to see.

33
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,840
As soon as the Great Chief left this morning,

34
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,440
Yun Que changed her attitude.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,800
If you don't take care of it,
there will be trouble.

36
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,680
You, move this porcelain vase over there.

37
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,920
Wipe the lantern in front.

38
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,360
Madam, look at her.

39
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,120
She's been troubling the entire mansion
for quite some time.

40
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,120
She can even mistake the Great Chief.

41
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,280
The Great Chief took pity on her
and kindly took her in.

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,280
But look at her,

43
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,600
she really considers herself
the lady of the mansion.

44
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,560
Better yet to complement
the Great Chief's mansion.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,440
You should go out and look around more.

46
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,840
So when you go out to make cushions,

47
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,080
you'll have an idea.

48
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,640
Has the grass in the backyard been cleared?

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,720
Have you wiped the bookshelf,

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,080
which was assigned by the Great Chief?

51
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,640
Hurry up and go.

52
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,200
I ordered them to arrange the front hall.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,400
It's not considered formal business then?

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,960
Miss Yun Que,

55
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,320
how can you say that?

56
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,480
That's too harsh.

57
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,000
You instruct the servants to do things.

58
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,480
Naturally, they should be done well.

59
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,480
But, we take the silver from the Shen Mansion

60
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,280
and work for the Great Chief.

61
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,080
Firstly, for the matters entrusted
by the Great Chief,

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,560
we must arrange them first.

63
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,800
Am I right?

64
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,760
Let's talk about the arrangements tomorrow.

65
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,720
Mr. Shen, sort out the account books
of the mansion

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,240
and bring them to me.

67
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,400
I'll have a look.

68
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Sorry, Miss.

69
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,840
Only the lady of the mansion

70
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:08,080
can check the account books
of the Shen Mansion.

71
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,920
Madam,

72
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,440
good morning.

73
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,560
Mr. Shen,

74
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,600
why do you…?

75
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:21,959
Madam, I forgot to greet you this morning.

76
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,200
I was wrong.

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:24,800
Please punish me, Madam.

78
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,480
Punish you?

79
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,160
According to the rules of the Shen Mansion,

80
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,480
servants of the mansion

81
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:33,440
must pay respects to Madam morning and evening.

82
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,160
Female family members must

83
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,840
offer salutations and serve tea to Madam.

84
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,200
Since my first day entering the mansion,

85
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:41,920
I've kept it firmly in mind.

86
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,480
The Shen Mansion does not keep those
who lack manners.

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:48,120
Today, I was rude.

88
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,480
Madam, even if you

89
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,840
cast me out,

90
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,400
it would be completely justified.

91
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,120
Alright, that's enough.

92
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,800
Isn't it just that you want me

93
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,400
to offer a respectful cup of tea to Mrs. Shen?

94
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:01,320
I'll offer it then.

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,480
Madam, please drink your tea.

96
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:19,880
Madam,

97
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,680
now that you've had your tea

98
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,720
and almost all formalities
have been established,

99
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,840
let's discuss what is reasonable.

100
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,400
It was the Great Chief who put me
in charge of household affairs.

101
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,640
I naturally have to do my utmost.

102
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:35,840
Could it be that you want to go
against the Great Chief's wishes?

103
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,320
Miss Yun Que, you just mentioned

104
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,640
you wanted to see the account books, right?

105
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,360
Right.

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,800
Since you want to see them,

107
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,040
why not take charge
of the next season's accounts?

108
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,960
Well…

109
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,160
Madam,

110
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,160
are you saying to entrust all accounts
to my management?

111
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,520
I was

112
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:57,880
not very adept at this.

113
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:00,000
If you are willing to share the concerns,

114
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,520
nothing could be better.

115
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,520
- Madam.
- Mr. Shen,

116
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,360
please bring over the account books

117
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,240
and hand them to Miss Yun Que.

118
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,080
I have official duties these days.

119
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,800
All matters, big and small,
in the inner courtyard

120
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,280
are to be decided by Miss Yun Que.

121
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,480
Miss Yun Que,

122
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,760
thank you for your hard work.

123
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,840
Madam,

124
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,680
please think it over.

125
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,200
He was momentarily dazzled.

126
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,760
He must have been bewitched

127
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:26,480
by that outsider vixen.

128
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,760
Using trickery and deception,

129
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,840
she sweet-talked him into bringing her home.

130
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,160
Rest assured,

131
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
in his heart, the first wife

132
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,200
is only you.

133
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,360
Furthermore, all of us

134
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,800
are on your side.

135
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,120
Mr. Shen,

136
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,120
it truly has nothing to do

137
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,600
with Yun Que.

138
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,880
Madam,

139
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:47,200
please don't treat me as a fool.

140
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,320
Had it not been for being angered
by that vixen,

141
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,520
why would you need to move back
to your parents' home to live?

142
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:55,240
Who said I'm moving back to my parents' home?

143
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,200
I have many investigations
to attend to these days.

144
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,760
I'm afraid I will be at the Ministry of Justice
until quite late.

145
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,280
So I will not be returning home for now.

146
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,880
Don't worry about me, I'm leaving.

147
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,800
What should we do now?

148
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,360
Speak up if you have something to say.

149
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Great Chief,

150
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,480
during the days you weren't at the mansion,

151
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,760
Miss Yun Que changed porcelain plates

152
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,240
and the embroidered cloth and so on.

153
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,520
Mr. Zhong argued with her every day.

154
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,360
Today, he even gave me an outright order.

155
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,440
If I don't bring you and Mrs. Shen back,

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,320
I'm not allowed to return to the mansion.

157
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,680
Since when did Mr. Zhong

158
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,760
get along so well with Yan Liuniang?

159
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:54,800
Great Chief,

160
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,080
could you please give me a clear indication?

161
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:59,760
At first, I thought you were

162
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,320
fond of Miss Yun Que.

163
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,800
But ever since you brought her back
to the mansion,

164
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,080
you have never returned.

165
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:11,400
So who should I support?

166
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,520
It seems your duties are quite leisurely.

167
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,680
You even start to worry
about my household affairs.

168
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,192
I'm at fault.

169
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,384
Get up.

170
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,720
How are the security arrangements

171
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
for the coming days?

172
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Great Chief,

173
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,360
all has been arranged.

174
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,880
The security of the Lintai Secretariat

175
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,880
is now completely taken over
by our Imperial Guards.

176
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,880
The original guards

177
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:39,880
have been transferred to assist

178
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:42,520
the inspectors at the Hongwen School.

179
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,520
- Jiang Langxing is there.
- That's just perfect.

180
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,720
Let us finish quickly and head home.

181
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,920
Jiang Langxing.

182
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,120
Candidates shall not talk to each other.

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,240
Marshal Xu asked us to pass a message to you,
listen carefully.

184
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,760
The latest instructions from above
stress the utmost importance.

185
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,200
This recruitment exam
must be guarded rigorously

186
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
so that not even a fly can get out.

187
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,640
Not even a single page can be brought in,
do you understand?

188
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,600
You, you spoke too fast.

189
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,600
I didn't hear it clearly.

190
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,720
Chuichui,

191
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,560
could you speak a bit slower?

192
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,160
Didn't Marshal Xu instruct us

193
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:26,120
to take a closer look

194
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:28,120
to see if there are any oversights in security?

195
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,640
We need to take a closer look?

196
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
Why not follow me inside
to check the several doors?

197
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,360
We've also set up checkpoints
in the inner courtyard.

198
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,680
Chuichui.

199
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,120
Why don't you two go in first?

200
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,320
I'll wait here for Mojie

201
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,960
until he comes.

202
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:48,256
Oh right, Mojie also passed
the preliminary exam.

203
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:49,840
Alright.

204
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,880
- Go on.
- I'm going inside then.

205
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,240
Jiang the stickler, hurry up.

206
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:04,600
Being the matchmaker is not an easy job.

207
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,880
Excuse me,

208
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,400
could you help me find someone?

209
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,416

210
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,760
The person you're looking for

211
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,520
is indeed on the final examination list.

212
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,560
But up till now,

213
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,960

215
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:48,320

216
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,280
Who said I have given up?

217
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,440
Pan,

218
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,760
it's really you, you've come to take the exam.

219
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,840
That day, after I sobered up from the drink,

220
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,760
I thought about what you said to me.

221
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,320
It's rare for the Hongwen School
to recruit everyone.

222
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,200
With all the talent I possess,

223
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,680
I must amaze

224
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,440
those decrepit old masters.

225
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,680

226
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,200
what a peerless good article is.

227
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,320
Congratulations.

228
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,440
I wish you success in one fell swoop.

To be listed on the honor roll.

230
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,640
Since you are also called Pan Chi,

231

sharing the name with the No.1 detective
among the people,

232
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,560
you must be equally excellent.

233
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,800
Today, you look even more radiant.

234
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,080
Of course.

235
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,720
I just spruced up casually.

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,480

Your complexion doesn't look too good.

240
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:40,720
Have you been drinking again these past days?

241
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,920
These few days,

242
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,240
I've been busy investigating cases
and reading case files.

243
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,200
But I'm completely clueless.

244
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,560
The case you mentioned

245
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,600
wouldn't be that one, would it?

246
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,240
The case of the fluttering moth.

247
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,280
You know it?

248
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,360
Of course, I know.

249
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,560
The whole town knows it.

250
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,040
Told in an almost mystical way.

251
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,560
But in my opinion,

252
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,440
you shouldn't just look at the files.

253
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,880
You need to ask around more.

254
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,520
I've asked the people around.

255
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,280
One of the parties is dead.

256
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,400
Another is insane.

00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:13,560
we fear not the corpse.

260
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,840
On the dead body,

261
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,320
there could be many good things.

262
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,560
Besides, what the madman says

263
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,320
isn't necessarily all nonsense.

265
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,120
This penmanship

266
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,880
is the writing
from before my father got injured.

267
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:24,400
When Mr. Shen was young,

268
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,280
his brush strokes were like swords,

269
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,240
vigorous and grand.

270
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560

his strokes

272
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,280
became

273
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,680
simple and mellow.

274
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,440
I have practiced for a long time

275
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:40,040
to make the handwriting exactly alike.

276
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,120
Indeed, it is forged.

277
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,560
If it was really the framing done

278
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
by Mr. Yan who understands
my father's calligraphy,

279
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,920
he would certainly not use
the wrong brush strokes.

After your reminder,

284
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,680
it seems I've thought of another method.

As Mrs. Shen,

00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,400
you should go back and take charge.

we've reviewed the papers for three days

369
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,800
and have decided on the final recruitment list

370
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,640
for Hongwen School.

371
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:55,200
Please review it, Your Majesty.

372
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,920
The examination papers have been arranged
according to their scored ranking.

373
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,280
The first one on top

374
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,760
is the essay by Cheng Bojian,

375
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,240
this time's top scorer.

376
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,240
Pan Chi

377
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,360
is the last one?

378
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
Yes.

379
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,480
Wan,

380
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,440
you read out this last one's

381
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:20,840
to me.

382
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,320
Tall pines planted at the mountain's foot.

383
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,520
Short saplings grow at the peak.

384
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:29,640
With the saplings' diameter just an inch,

385
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,600
they overshadow the hundred-foot pine branches.

386
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,080
I feel

387
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,920
that the literary grace of this last one

388
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,080
is also remarkable.

389
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,000
Pan Chi did not lose in literary grace.

390
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,280
But

391
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,440
it is somewhat off-topic.

392
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,560
I don't quite understand

393
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,160
these things.

394
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,680
Wan,

395
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:56,920
interpret them for me.

396
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,320
This candidate uses the towering pine trees

397
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:03,120
at the foot of Yangui Mountain

398
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,840
to symbolize the talented scholars
from humble backgrounds

399
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,760
and uses the low-lying saplings
on the mountaintop

400
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,280
to symbolize the offspring of noble families.

401
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,840
Because their position at birth
is already high,

402
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,120
the inch-wide saplings

403
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,880
can overshadow the hundred-foot pines.

404
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,360
I think

405
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,000
the scenery at Yangui Mountain

406
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,040
is exquisitely depicted.

407
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,800
Continue reading.

408
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,200
Laughing heartily under the open sky.

409
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,560
Striding high across the divine land.

410
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,400
[Hongwen School]
Though the noble prize themselves,

411
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,800
I regard them as mere dust.

412
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,880
Though the lowly demean themselves,

413
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,320
who says they aren't important.

414
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:41,280
Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains.

415
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:44,840
Washing my feet in the long river.

416
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:46,880
I not only want to take the exam

417
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,160
but also tear off your repulsive masks.

418
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,760
I see your mind

419
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,520
is not on the chessboard at all.

420
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,840
Are you trying to ask me?

421
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,880
It's clearly seen

422
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,840
the selection at the Hongwen School
involves unsavory practices.

423
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,040
Why

424
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,920
was the original list still approved?

425
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,160
Indeed, I wanted to ask.

426
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,560
But I have figured it out just now.

427
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,480
Although Pan Chi is a brilliant writer,

428
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,200
his personality is too impulsive.

429
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:38,560
So he's not suitable for officialdom
from the start.

430
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,600
This examination

431
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,000
was just a trial.

432
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,760
The selection of talented scholars

433
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,520
has been riddled
with longstanding malpractices.

434
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,120
Many officials at court

435
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,240
are involved in it.

436
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:53,760
It's already as solid as a rock.

437
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,200
It's a stalemate on the board.

438
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,880
Even if I want to make a move
in this chess game,

439
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,480
I have to wait

440
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:06,720
for the right opportunity to make the move.

441
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,840
Flapping my gown, I gaze at the mountains.

442
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,440
Washing my feet in the long river.

443
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,920
This piece of writing is grand and powerful.

444
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,400
Using scenery to satirize the present.

445
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,160
Implying that some use the pretext
of not sticking to social hierarchy

446
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,640
and fair selection

447
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,000
to actually oppress the humble
and solidify the power of the nobility.

448
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,080
It's so exhilarating.

449
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,120
Alright.

450
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,120
You've been praising this good friend of yours

451
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,400
for quite a while.

452
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,760
Well, he really did write it very well.

453
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,440
Pan is not just

454
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,640
sharing the same name
as the No.1 detective among the people.

455
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:35,960
He's very likely

456
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,840
to be the detective himself.

457
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,080
Very likely.

458
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,952
Clerk Yan,

459
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:51,880
Marshal Xu asked me to tell you

460
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,960
that you wanted him to help investigate

461
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,200
into Chen Shoujie's background

462
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,200
and there are leads now.

463
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,000
Chen Shoujie indeed

464
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,960
participated in the investigation
of the Chen Huo'e case

465
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:00,720
and even got promoted because of it.

466
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,480
However, not long after his promotion,

467
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,480
he went mad.

468
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,120
It turns out that before Mrs. Chen died,

469
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,640
he had already gone mad.

470
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,320
The Huo'e case must be connected

471
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,880
to him.

472
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,280
It's something we haven't discovered.

473
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,320
No, I have to make another trip
to the Chen Mansion.

474
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,080
Shen Du.

475
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,600
Are you alright?

476
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,896
Be careful!

477
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,360
The style of the hidden weapon
is different from that day,

478
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,520
but the moves it executed

479
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:24,800
are remarkably similar.

480
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,960
You're injured.

481
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,520
It's nothing.

482
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,928
Just a minor injury.

483
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,800
How come you're here alone?

484
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,160
I came to look for someone
but didn't find them.

485
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,320
How can you be alright
with all this blood loss?

486
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:56,320
Are you concerned about me?

487
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,800
I'm not concerned about you.

488
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,720
You got injured while saving me.

489
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:22,000
I should take responsibility for you.

490
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,360
This old man really is muddled.

491
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,440
The shop was clearly closed up properly.

492
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:57,960
Yet he insists I go check
if anything was stolen.

493
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,720
You want to run?

494
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,720
I advise you not to make another mistake
on top of another.

495
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,000
I'm a female official
from the Ministry of Justice.

496
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,920
If you confess voluntarily,

497
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,920
the crime of theft could be punished lightly.

498
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,640
But if you injure me,

499
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,600
that would be a serious crime.

500
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,600
Nosy woman,

501
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,840
go die!

502
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,040
Help!

503
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,200
It's you.

504
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,960
Who's there?

505
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:54,400
Wait a moment.

506
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,600
Just now,

507
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,120
the patrolling ones

508
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,520
were inspectors.

509
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,960
Why do we have to hide?

510
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:10,120
I don't want to deal with the officialdom.

511
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:15,800
You are averse to dealing with the officialdom

512
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,440
and skilled in martial arts.

513
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I know your identity now.

514
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,624
You are

515
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,400
a chivalrous hero
who stands up for justice, right?

516
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,560
Donning a mask at night.

517
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,480
Becoming a righteous enforcer.

518
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,240
Acting valiantly.

519
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,800
Doing good deeds without leaving a name.

520
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,808
Sort of.

521
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,640
Wait a minute.

522
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:52,680
You can't go.

523
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,640
You killed someone.

524
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,400
Well?

525
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,520
You want to arrest me
and report to the authorities?

526
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,840
But I killed the person who tried to kill you.

527
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,240
Is this how you treat your lifesaver?

528
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:04,520
Regarding Dacang's laws,

529
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,160
if someone tries to kill people
for no reason at night

530
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:08,560
and the victim resists
the assailant and kills him,

531
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,320
he can thus be exempt
from criminal responsibility.

532
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,560
But

533
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:14,760
you can't just leave like this.

534
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,160
What are you doing?

535
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,320
I'm releasing water lanterns for you.

536
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
When I was a child,

537
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:38,880
my mother

538
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,680
often brought me to release water lanterns.

539
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,360
My mother said

540
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,080
water lanterns can drift along with the waves.

541
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:49,040
They can ward off disasters and sickness

542
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:51,160
and can also cleanse us

543
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,280
of any ill fortunes from our being.

544
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:00,200
Although you did it to save me,

545
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,480
I will

546
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,760
release a water lantern for you

547
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,480
to dispel some of the karma of killing.

548
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,120
No need.

549
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
I don't believe in these things.

550
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:12,640
Belief makes it real, belief makes it work.

551
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,720
I didn't believe it as a child either.

552
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,080
So I did it very perfunctorily.

553
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:18,560
Later on,

554
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:21,200
my mother's illness got worse and worse

555
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,280
and she left me.

556
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,400
I often think

557
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,000
if at that time

558
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,840
I had taken it seriously

559
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,440
to release each and every water lantern,

560
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,600
whether Heaven

561
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,520
would then fulfill my wish

562
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,760
to let my mother always be with me.

563
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:55,080
Even if a thousand, ten thousand
water lanterns were released,

564
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,600
those who are meant to go would still go.

565
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,920
In this life, this world,

566
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,160
they had already made up their minds

567
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,880
to only accompany us
for this part of our journey.

568
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,680
It can't be changed.

569
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:15,080
Nothing can be changed.

570
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:19,080
Ghost Mask…

571
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:41,920
Great Chief,

572
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:43,360
the bandit hanged himself in the deep alley.

573
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
We're unable to identify him.

574
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,560
Hanged himself?

575
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,960
Since there's a need to silence someone,

576
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,520
they wouldn't want us to find out the identity.

577
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,400
Go ahead.

578
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,064
Yes.

579
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:00,680
Great Chief,

580
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:03,040
do we really not need to call a doctor
to take a look? No need for medicine?

581
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,000
Talkative.

582
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:06,320
No need.

583
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:08,640
Who says there's no need?

584
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,896
Apply the medicine.

585
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,960
Is there something else later?

586
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,560
You seem to be in a hurry.

587
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,960
Surely you're not rushing to rest?

588
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:00,280
Of course not.

589
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,360
I was thinking,

590
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:04,520
if I finish applying the medicine for you

591
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,560
and it's not too late,

592
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
I can go to the Ministry of Justice

593
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,920
to sort out the case details.

594
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,920
The case is so pressing

595
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:18,280
that there's no rest even at midnight?

596
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,520
Wasn't I just thinking

597
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:21,280
about solving the case sooner?

598
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,960
Staying up all night is not a big deal.

599
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,160
But I am injured.

600
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:37,920
Can't you stay tonight to take care of me?

601
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,240
I…

602
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:47,464
Forget it.

603
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,920
I don't need your care.

604
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,720
Go ahead with your business.

605
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:53,840
I'll do it.

606
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,080
Who says I am leaving?

607
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,360
You got hurt because you saved me.

608
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,640
If I leave now,

609
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,640
even the heavens would think I'm heartless.

610
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:04,200
What if a bolt of lightning strikes suddenly?

611
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,520
Wouldn't I be wronged?

My Lord, spare my life.

648
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,240
I have inquired about the matter
regarding the inspectors.

649
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,120
It has been dealt with as a typical case
of thieves fighting each other.

650
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,720
It has not been reported
to the Ministry of Justice yet.

651
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,800
Trash, send someone more efficient
to handle it.

652
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,480
If there's another mistake,

653
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,720
you will be the next one to die.

654
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:58,920
I know my mistake.
Thank you for not taking my life.

655
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,480
That Lu Chuichui from the Ministry of Justice,

656
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,360
no one is allowed to touch her.

657
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,864
Yes.

658
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,760
You may leave.

659
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:20,680
These ignorant fools,

660
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,120
a mere fire moth trick

661
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:25,960
can turn heaven and earth upside down.

662
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:28,320
It won't take long

663
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,640
before Dacang…

664
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,440
Get up.

665
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,640
Go to the front hall and have something to eat.

666
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,920
When one is injured, they must eat more.

667
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,760
You've seen it.

668
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,680
I am currently seriously injured.

669
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
It's inconvenient for me to move.

670
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Going to the front hall is too troublesome.

671
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,840
I just want to lie down.

672
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:20,800
Alright.

673
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,840
Then you should rest well.

674
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:25,200
I'll bring you breakfast in a bit.

675
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,184
Well.

676
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,800
Where is Mrs. Shen?

677
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,040
Someone from the Yan Mansion came.

678
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,560
They have invited Mrs. Shen to a banquet.

679
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:29,480
She instructed that you are severely injured.

680
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,840
There's no need for you to accompany her
to the banquet.

681
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:34,200
- I…
- We should serve you well during your meal.

682
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,760
You may leave.

683
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,664
Yes.

684
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,560
Great Chief, I…

685
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,320
What's the matter?

686
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,520
I have found out

687
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,800
that Han Shiyuan is no simple character.

690
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,280
Mr. Han and I are set
to get married next month.

691
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,320
I use tea in place of wine.

692
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,280
I toast to you and Mr. Han.

693
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,960
I wish you both a harmonious union
for a hundred years.

694
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,240
I was hasty before

695
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,560
and lacked proper courtesy.

696
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,160
Please forgive me for that.

697
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,280
You are good enough.

698
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,240
Alright.

699
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,240
Sit down and talk.

700
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,560
This year in our Yan Mansion,

705
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Liuniang,

706
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,440
why have you been frequently
coming back recently?

707
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,120
Is it because you're not on good terms
with the Great Chief?

708
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,680
No, I'm quite well at the Shen Mansion.

709
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,960
A few days ago,

710
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:22,080
that cook

711
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,760
took a few days off to go home.

712
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,320
The food wasn't quite to my taste.

713
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:27,960
So I came back home to eat.

714
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,640
That's good then,
as long as there's nothing wrong.

715
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,680
The rumors outside

716
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,960
say that as soon as you return
to your parental home,

717
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,600
the Great Chief would come to fetch you.

718

This situation

719
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:35,920
is a bit frightening.

720
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,360
But the last time you came back,

721
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,160
he did not come to fetch you.

722
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:42,520
I actually felt uneasy.

723
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,280
My Lord, Madam,

724
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:52,360

726
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,520
Great Chief, please take a seat.

727
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:19,320
