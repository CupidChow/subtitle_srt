This is Mr. Han.

18
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,000
Stop.

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,000
Your Highness.

20
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,080
He is so shameless.

21
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,120
How dare he to show up
at the Princess of Valor's Mansion!

22
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,720
We must get him a good beating today.

23
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you doing here?

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,800
Your Highness.

25
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Please save Sanniang.

27
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,040
I gave you the chance,

28
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
but you did not cherish it.

00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,720
Now,

30
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,200
why do you come to me?

31

37
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,600
I will never say no.

38
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,920
How dare you!

39
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,504
Enough.

40
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,200
You really are spoony.

41
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:49,000
You'd risk your life for her.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,720
Unfortunately,

43
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,520
I wasn't the one who poisoned Sanniang.

44
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:57,080
I do not know how to save her either.

45
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,120
If you want to die with her,

46
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,200
then die far away.

49
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,880
Throw him back to the Yan Mansion.

50
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,640
Do not let him die here.

51
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,936
Yes.

52
00:03:11,936 --> 00:03:14,200
Your Highness.

53
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,400
Your Highness.

00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,720
Prince Xian.

55
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,560
Yan Kuo is too timid

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,920
to take on important tasks.

57
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,480
But his daughters

58
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,360
can't be underestimated.

59
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,680
This time, Yan Sanniang has been poisoned.

60
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,800
I wonder if it's done by Princess of Valor

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,080
or Chen Huo'e.

62
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,120
If Yan Sanniang really dies from the poison,

63
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
I think Princess of Valor

64
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,120
can't explain her relationship with Chen Huo'e.

65
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,800
In fact, it doesn't matter
whether it's done by Princess of Valor.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,480
Shen Du will surely be on our side

67
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,920
for his sister-in-law.

68
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,640
Even if Shen Du remains foolish

69
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:53,200
and refuses to be on our side,

70
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,320
then Princess of Valor

71
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,360
will also not trust him anymore.

72
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
Sir.

73
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,480
How many things have you done
behind my back over these years?

74
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,360
Your Highness.

75
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,360
I know you are kind-hearted.

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,960
But to achieve great things,

77
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,200
one must be ruthless sometimes.

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,959
You were born in the royal family,

79
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,120
surely cannot escape from

80
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:19,839
the schemes for power.

81
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,760
Even the Empress Dowager

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,120
took steps cautiously

83
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,560
to stay where she is now.

84
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,720
The Crown Prince's death that year
was mysterious and unclear.

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,040
- And the Young Emperor…
- Enough!

86
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,640
I spoke something wrong.

87
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:38,160
But I'm really loyal

88
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,400
to you.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,280
Sir.

90
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,720
Over these years,

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,040
you have been devoted to protecting me.

92
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,560
Every single thing you have done

93
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,360
has been to pave the way for me.

94
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,760
I am well aware of it.

95
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,000
But I truly don't want

96
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
to see in-fighting

97
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,760
and conflict within the family.

98
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,120
If it has to go this way,

99
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,360
then I don't want to be the Prince Regent.

100
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,360
Prince Xian.

101
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,160
You must never have

102
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,240
such thoughts.

103
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,240
You are the Prince Xian.

104
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,480
In the future,

105
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,240
you are destined

106
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:29,320
to be as the Dacang's Prince Regent.

107
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,880
Every single thing that I have done

108
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,720
has been for you.

109
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,160

110
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,800
How foolish!

111
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,800
How foolish!

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,480

113
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,680
Is power

114
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,000
really that obsessive?

[Chief's Office]

116
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,328
Great Chief.

117
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,840
Are you worried about Madam?

118
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,480
Nonsense.

119
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,600
Yes, it's my nonsense.

120
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,720
However,

121
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,120
I might know

122
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,240
why the Madam toiled all night

123
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,880
at the Ministry of Justice yesterday.

124
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,960
Yan Mojie came for me yesterday.

125
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,720
He asked me to help him
look through the family's records.

126
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,680
I heard that the poison
that Sanniang of the Yan family got

127
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,480
is Butterfly out of Cocoons

128
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,120
from Huo'e Sect.

129
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,800
Butterfly out of Cocoons?

130
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,480
Yes, everyone in the Yan Mansion

131
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:12,440
has been thrown into chaos these past two days.

132
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,640
It's indeed because of this.

133
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,480
The Yan Mansion has been thrown into chaos?

134
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:19,480
Why haven't I heard a word about it?

135
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:22,440
Perhaps the Madam doesn't want to trouble you.

136
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:24,000
Even Yan Mojie knows

137
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,360
to get your help when there's trouble.

138
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,080
How could she not know whom to seek help from?

139
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
Then she might have her own connections.

140
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,920
It's said

141
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,240
that the Madam went to the palace
to look for the physician today.

142
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,280
I've heard

143
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,560
she also showed them

144
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,440
a prescription from the antidote
of the Imperial Inspectorate.

145
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,360
It's said to be a confession
from Chen Huo'e's interrogation.

146
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,400
The Imperial Inspectorate?

147
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,440
Chen Huo'e.

148
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,320
I have already inquired with that physician.

149
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:55,280
He said that the antidote might be genuine.

150
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,480
But one material in the antidote

151
00:07:58,480 --> 00:08:00,120
is really hard to find.

152
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,520
What's it?

153
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,600
It's the heart blood

154
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:07,720
from the mirror image person.

00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:39,080
Anyone? No one here in the Lai Mansion?

157

Great Chief.

158
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,960
I think this Lai Luozhi
is doing something weird again.

159
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,440
Since so,

160
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,200
don't be anxious.

161
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,480
Stay here.

162
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,080
I'll take a look at the back.

163
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,600
- Great Chief.
- Don't worry.

Vice Minister Lai.

165
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,520
You set up such a complicated setup,

166
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,880
isn't it just to lure me here?

167
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,720
What? Here I am now,

168
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,680
yet you are hiding.

169
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,720
This is unlike your usual style

170
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,840
in the royal court.

171
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,640
Sorry to disturb you.

172
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,800
I am sorry.

173
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,480
Great Chief,
it's your first visit to my mansion,

174
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:53,960
and yet you chased after
my families in the backyard.

175
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,560
If word gets out,

176
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,080
it would be another joke.

177
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,920
Vice Minister Lai.

178
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,840
Put away these intimidating things.

179
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,960
These little tricks

180
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,200
of course can't impress you.

181
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,520
However, Great Chief,

182
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,240
you've trespassed into my mansion today.

183
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,280
I think you owe me an explanation.

184
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,720
If I didn't come,

185
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,760
would you give me the heart blood
of the mirror image person?

186
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,200
What do you mean?

187
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,360
You intentionally poisoned Yan Sanniang,

188
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,640
and let Yan Xing to obtain the prescription.

189
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,240
Naturally, you have
the heart blood of Chen Huo'e

190
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,440
for an exchange.

191
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,680
What you said

192
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:50,800
is merely your theory.

193
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,840
I don't admit a word.

194
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,960
However,

195
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,400
I happen

196
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,920
to have the heart blood

197
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,760
of the mirror image person.

198
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,280
Great Chief, don't.

199
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,080
What? Do you despise the water in my mansion?

200
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,640
Or are you worried it's poisoned?

201
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,640
I have always

202
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,520
respected you.

203
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,480
Great Chief, you've come

204
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:02,120
with the imperial guards to my mansion.

205
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,000
If you cannot leave today,

206
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,640
or if after leaving,

207
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,520
you're found to be poisoned,

208
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,160
it'd be hard for me

209
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,200
to explain to the Empress Dowager.

210
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,920
Where is the heart blood
of the mirror image person?

211
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,760
Right in this teacup.

212
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,120
Are you kidding me?

213
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:38,040
You've sealed the heart blood
of the mirror image person

214
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,560
in this teacup?

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,240
I specially found

216
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,640
a skilled artisan from Xichen

217
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:50,200
to make

218
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
this teacup of heart blood.

219
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,640
Actually, the thing you're looking for

220
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,680
has always been right in front of you.

221
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:03,760
Yet you are so wary

222
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:04,960
of me,

223
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:07,560
not even daring to drink a sip of tea.

224
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,440
In fact,

225
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,480
I am not

226
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,200
that unworthy of trust.

227
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,256
Right?

228
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,120
In this world,

229
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,280
the heart blood of the mirror image person

230
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,000
is really hard to find.

231
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,800
And this teacup is ingeniously crafted.

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,600
Naturally, it won't be for free.

233
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,000
Vice Minister Lai, you have set up
such a big trap to lure me here.

234
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,480
Just tell me what you want.

235
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:44,960
It's soothing to talk

236
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,120
to a clever person.

237
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,400
In fact,

238
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,480
I don't want anything.

239
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,440
Great Chief, just remember this favor of mine.

240
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,400
In the future,

241
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:58,040
you have to repay it doubly.

242
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,840
Then there's no other way.

243
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,640
Let's see if you

244
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,200
really love your wife so deeply,

245
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,520
even promising on an unknown thing

246
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,160
to save your sister-in-law.

247
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,688
I…

248
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,344
owe you a favor.

249
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,840
Great Chief, see you.

250
00:16:12,512 --> 00:16:13,520
[Lai Luofu]

251
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,240
I don't understand why you

252
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
went through all this trouble.

253
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,600
First poisoning, then providing an antidote,

254
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,160
even asking me to show my face
in front of Shen Du.

255
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
What do you want to do?

256
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,400
You don't need to know.

257
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,320
I don't need to know?

258
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,720
Hasn't my family

259
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,960
done enough

260
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,000
for your big ambitions?

261
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,432
Now,

262
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,320
I don't even have the right

263
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
to know.

264
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,000
I'm sorry, sister.

265
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,319
I was just anxious.

266
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,920
How could I not know your suffering?

267
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,800
Everything I've done

268
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,800
is all about letting all of us

269
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:23,079
get what we deserve.

270
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,839
Poisoning Yan Sanniang

271
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:27,920
can arouse the suspicion
of the Prince Xian, Princess of Valor,

272
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,560
and the Imperial Guards.

273
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:33,120
This goal has already been achieved.

274
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,040
As for Shen Du,

275
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,280
he is the most difficult to deal with.

276
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,960
The Imperial Guards and the Shen Mansion

277
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,840
are both sealed up tight.

278
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,520
The spies I arranged

279
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,480
have all been kicked out.

280
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:48,520
Shen Du is on Prince Xian's side?

281
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,800
No.

282
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,040
Shen Du has always been neutral

283
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,000
in the court.

284
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Neither siding with Prince Xian,

285
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,840
nor favoring Princess of Valor.

286
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,920
And we don't deal with each other either.

287
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,080
The more cautiously he

288
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,080
maintains neutral,

289
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,040
the more the Empress Dowager

290
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,800
trusts him,

291
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,840
and the worse it is

292
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,400
for what we're trying to do.

293
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,440
Then why not simply kill him?

294
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Or make a direct request to him?

295
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,840
The unknown promise is the scariest.

296
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,880
I want to make him feel

297
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,480
uneasy,

298
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,920
fearful,

299
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,800
and hesitant.

300
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,760
Wait for the fear

301
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,760
to take root in him,

302
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,160
one day,

303
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:41,480
I can make him play a role

304
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:45,040
greater than dying.

305
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,040
Liuniang.

306
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,240
Liuniang.

307
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,280
All the medicinal herbs have been prepared.

308
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,440
Only the heart blood
of the mirror image person is missing.

309
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,880
But as for Prime Minister Zhang,

310
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,480
your father failed.

311
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,600
As for Princess Yong'an,

312
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,880
Shiyuan got a beating.

313
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:21,680
I truly have run out of options.

314
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:23,840
Please.

315
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,080
Please do something.

316
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,520
- Madam, what are you doing?
- Mother.

317
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,440
Don't force Liuniang.

318
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,160
She's already doing something

319
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,400
and getting tired like this.

320
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:37,080
What else can she do now?

321
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,512
Well…

322
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,720
Well, Great Chief.

323
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:50,320
Shut up.

324
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,240
Why should I shut up?

325
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,760
White Ghost killed that Chen Huo'e.

326
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:57,440
Now the retribution
has fallen upon my daughter.

327
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,520
Why can't I just beg for White Ghost

328
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,640
and ask him to think of a solution?

329
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
Even if Caiwei was once
in the wrong against him,

330
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:06,280
but anyway,

331
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,520
now she is also his sister-in-law.

332
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:12,840
- Mother.
- Right.

333
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:15,240
Sorry I'm late.

334
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,840
- Great Chief.
- Rise up.

335
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
This is the material.

336
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,520
The heart blood of the mirror image person

337
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,800
is in this teacup.

338
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,840
Thank you so much, Great Chief.

339
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,112
Please rise.

340
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,640
Liuniang is my wife.

341
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,480
The matter of the Yan Mansion
is also my matter.

342
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:53,240
Hurry up to save her.

343
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,920
- Thank you, Great Chief.
- I'll go and use it for the medicine now.

344
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,000
Thank you, Great Chief.

345
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,760
Hurry.

346
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,080
Caiwei can be saved now.

347
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,600
Caiwei can be saved now.

348
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:03,048
Come on.

349
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:12,360
Liuniang.

350
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:16,758
When will I be the first person
you turn to when you need help?

351
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:21,097
♫ I have waited
until time bloomed into flowers ♫

352
00:21:21,097 --> 00:21:26,550
♫ The ice and snow slowly melting ♫

353
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:30,520
♫ I hear those gentle words ♫

354
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,744
Liuniang.

355
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:59,904
♫ The flower in the mirror,
the moon in the water, present in my dreams ♫

356
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:06,400
♫ It's not the vain and false glamour ♫

357
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,840
It's fine now.

358
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,766
♫ Chasing time, riding the white horse ♫

359
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:15,702
♫ Go together ♫

360
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:18,057
♫ Love is pure and flawless in essence ♫

361
00:22:18,057 --> 00:22:20,863
♫ Let the vast universe change ♫

362
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:25,280
♫ Let's be together ♫

363
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,840
Is what Lai Luozhi said

364
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,440
reliable?

365
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,320
Does the heart blood he gave

366
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,760
really work?

367
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:36,880
Don't trust on anyone completely.

368
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:42,720
Shen Du.

369
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,400
I have something to tell you.

370
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,640
If I don't tell you now,

371
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,160
I'm afraid I won't get another chance.

372
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:54,320
Do you know

373
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,680
why Prime Minister Zhang insisted on

374
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:56,720
having the daughter of the Yan family

375
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,760
marry you?

376
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,160
Prime Minister Zhang threatened
my father and the whole family

377
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:06,120
to settle this marriage.

378
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,760
It was supposed to be Sanniang marrying you.

379
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,400
Later on, I married you for her.

380
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,800
But Prime Minister Zhang
still wanted me to find a way

381
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:15,080
to be his and Prince Xian's informant
in the Shen Mansion.

382
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
But I never really helped Prince Xian

383
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,720
do anything to harm you.

384
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:28,200
I know.

385
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,400
I trust you would not harm me.

386
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,248
You know?

387
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,160
Do you really trust me?

388
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,600
Liuniang.

389
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,480
Since you have never done

390
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,960
anything to harm me,

391
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,120
there's no need to feel guilty.

392
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,360
If there's anything
that causes doubts in the future,

393
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,320
come and ask me directly.

394
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,888
Okay?

395
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,040
What are you doing?

396
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,080
Spit it out.

397
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,400
Spit it out.

398
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,160
Spit it out. Hurry.

399
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:20,480
You can test the medicine for Caiwei,

400
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
so I can naturally do it for you.

401
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,120
Who asked you to do so?

402
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,400
You…

403
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,920
I will use internal breath to spread
the medicine throughout my body.

404
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,000
If I'm okay after a while,

405
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,880
then Caiwei can take the medicine.

406
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,280
Why are you so foolish?

407
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,040
I should test the medicine
for Caiwei as her sister.

408
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,680
What's wrong with you?

409
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,120
Do you feel any discomfort?

410
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,200
You've just recovered from your injury.

411
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,240
How could you take such a risk?

412
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,160
Do you feel any discomfort now?

413
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:46,160
Any part of you making you feel unwell?

414
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,440
Do you feel any discomfort?

415
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,960
Tell me.

416
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,120
I'm really okay.

417
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:07,480
Since Lai Luozhi deliberately lured me over,

418
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,920
the thing he gave me should be genuine.

419
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,920
But he just didn't expect I'd try it myself.

420
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,320
Otherwise,

421
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:16,360
he might put something lethal in it.

422
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,920
It hurts.

423
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:29,320
It hurts.

424
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,072
Let me see.

425
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,520
Not killed by the poison,

426
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,880
but I might be beaten to death by you.

427
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
The medicine is okay.

428
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,720
Hurry up and bring it to Caiwei.

429
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,512
Hurry.

430
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,920
Here's the medicine.

431
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,584
Hurry.

432
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,360
Don't worry.

433
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:56,480
She'll wake up soon.

434
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,400
It has already been two hours.

435
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,040
Mother.

436
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,840
Caiwei, are you awake?

437
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:17,880
Mother.

438
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,640
Caiwei, are you awake?

439
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,112
Liuniang.

440
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,872
Father.

441
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,400
Where is Mr. Han?

442
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:33,992
Sanniang.

443
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:39,000
Mr. Han, what happened to you?

444
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,200
Father.

445
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,200
Father.

446
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,760
Princess of Valor has sent a gift box

447
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,840
and an invitation.

448
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Princess of Valor? Read it.

449
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,080
I've heard that Mr. Han and Yan Sanniang

450
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,160
are very much in love

451
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,560
and would never abandon
each other in life or death.

452
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,720
What a touching love

453
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,040
it is!

454
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,320
Your love

455
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:59,800
makes me feel envious.

456
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,880
So I have the intention
to accomplish your wish.

457
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,440
To such profound affection,

458
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,800
I can't break it.

459
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,720
Thus, I specially bestow a precious jade ruyi,

460
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,440
hoping you a good marriage forever.

461
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,480
It seems

462
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
Princess of Valor

463
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,440
won't entangle with Mr. Han anymore

464
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,520
and let you be together.

465
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,400
Liuniang.

466
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:57,440
Do you feel unwell?

467
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,904
No.

468
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,880
Why would Lai Luozhi do so?

469
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,320
To poison and then cure the poison.

470
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,680
He's done so much,

471
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,760
why?

472
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,800
Perhaps his target is not Caiwei,

473
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,760
but me.

474
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,320
He set a trap

475
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,360
to make you owe him a favor?

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
What did he threaten you?

477
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,440
What did you promise him?

478
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:39,240
Don't worry, it's fine.

479
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,440
But Caiwei

480
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,760
has suffered this for nothing.

481
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,560
So the pursuit of justice

482
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,000
and the search for the truth

483
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,680
really bring the surrounding family

484
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,200
unknown risks.

485
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:07,640
But the path we choose

486
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,840
is destined to be a tough road, isn't it?

487
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,240
Since we've decided,

488
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
I won't regret it.

489
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,440
We must follow our hearts

490
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,720
and give it our all

491
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,040
to protect the people around us.

492
00:30:37,334 --> 00:30:41,152
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

493
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:44,829
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

494
00:30:44,829 --> 00:30:49,657
♫ Gaze at the stars,
dreaming about the old times ♫

495
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,352
Liuniang.

496
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,640
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

497
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:58,560
From now on, focus on
doing what you think is right.

498
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:04,760
I will protect you and your family.

499
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,200
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

500
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,512
Shen Du.

501
00:31:11,543 --> 00:31:15,696
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

502
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:17,400
♫ Your palm lines ♫

503
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:19,951
♫ Your gaze ♫

504
00:31:19,951 --> 00:31:22,724
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

505
00:31:22,724 --> 00:31:27,466
♫ You are the one for me ♫

506
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,008
Great Chief.

507
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:40,760
What's the matter?

508
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:43,600
Is it to escort Madam back home
or to go to the Imperial Guards?

509
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,800
- Shen Mansion.
- Yes.

510
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:56,480
Just now, what did you want to ask me?

511
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,440
N-Nothing.

512
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,800
Shen Du, you protect me,

513
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,360
help me, and support me.

514
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:21,720
In your heart,

515
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,960
what do you think of me?

516
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,920
You…

517
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,240
You could rest early.

518
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:35,760
I have to review.

519
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,248
Review?

520
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,240
The examination for the female officials
is approaching.

521
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,320
I've made a bet to the Empress Dowager

522
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,320
and Madam Xu

523
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,400
that I participated in the examination

524
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,600
as a Senior Clerk.

525
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:52,680
If I fail, I couldn't even be a clerk.

526
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:56,960
Now that Caiwei's poison has been cured,

527
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,240
and the Chen Huo'e case has been settled,

528
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,600
it's a good time to review

529
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,360
and study all night now.

530
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,960
So you moved all that stuff

531
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,320
in and out tonight

532
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,600
just to use my light to review?

533
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,000
Yes, you like the light, right?

534
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:12,400
It could save several lamps.

535
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:22,040
Then, I wish you success

536
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:24,080
in the examination.

537
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,159
Thank you.

538
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:52,400
It's rare for you to ask to meet me,

539
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,520
what's wrong?

540
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,040
Well, thank you.

541
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,800
Yan Sanniang's poison has been cured.

542
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:06,520
The prescription you gave me is genuine.

543
00:35:06,520 --> 00:35:11,000
Of course, the prescription
I gave you couldn't be fake.

544
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:16,520
I never lied to you.

545
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,144
You did…

546
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,480
Alright.

547
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,760
I'm the one

548
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,720
who's been calling you Mr. Mask.

549
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:32,080
You didn't really lie to me.

550
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:37,320
Anyway, thank you.

551
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,944
Thank you?

552
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,720
That's it?

553
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,120
I'm afraid it's not enough.

554
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,840
Then what do you want?

555
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,720
You shouldn't ask me that.

556
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,200
You should be the one to think carefully about

557
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,640
how you would thank me.

558
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,280
Lu Chuichui.

559
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,440
I'm here.

560
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,920
