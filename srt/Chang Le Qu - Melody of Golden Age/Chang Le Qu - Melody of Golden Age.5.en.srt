[Episode 5]

15
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,440
Thank you for what you've done today.

16
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,240
I think

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,160
you should thank someone else.

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,840
Indeed, it bears a striking
resemblance to my writing.

19
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
But still, you weren't deceived.

20
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,640
And it's not just me, is it?

21
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,200
The Empress Dowager?

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
The statement has unyielding righteousness.

23
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,920
But between the lines,

24
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,400
a feminine style occasionally emerges.

25
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,760
Yan Xing was strongly recommended
by Prime Minister Zhang back in the day.

26
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,280
But now he seems intent on helping you.

27
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,200
I think

28
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,640
this matter is quite ingenious.

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,880
Why would the Empress Dowager…

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,920
You have married a virtuous wife.

31
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,360
The Empress Dowager

32
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,560
must have taken to heart that nursery rhyme.

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,800
The task she's given you

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,760
is tough.

35
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,120
Be sure to be careful and cautious.

36
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,488
I will.

[Chengtian Gate]

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,120
It seems I have wronged my lady.

39
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,280
In difficult times,
she's compassionate and loyal.

40
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,680
If she didn't write anything,

41
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,000
I would have spoken for myself.

42
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,520
Rescuing me is a pretense.

43
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,560
She wishes to use this opportunity

44
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,880
and overturn the case of Chen Baiyi,

45
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,720
who committed suicide.

46
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,280
How dare she use you?

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,800
She dares to use me.

48
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,160
Despicable.

49
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,800
Never mind. She just wants

50
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,400
to seek justice for Chen Baiyi.

51
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:05,800
How did she know my handwriting?

52
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,320
She entered your study.

53
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,120
No wonder the imitation was so convincing.

54
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,279
I didn't expect her

55
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,079
to have the skill to imitate handwriting.

56
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Great Chief.

57
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,360
She has tampered with your memorial.

58
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,440
Should we…

59
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,480
Keep her.

60
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:33,280
Let's see what other tricks she might pull.

61
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,440
However, there is something

62
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:38,640
that must be handled immediately.

63
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,520
Prince Xian. Prince Xian.

64
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,880
Something's happened. Outside.

65
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,080
Prince Xian, Xiao Zhong, receive the decree.

66
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,280
I, Xiao Zhong, will receive the imperial order.

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,600
Complying with Heaven and the times,

68
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:06,920
here comes the edict.

69
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,600
I order Prince Xian Xiao Zhong

70
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:11,160
to the Fengxiang Prefecture
to inspect and issue decrees.

71
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,320
Prince Xian Xiao Zhong

72
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,720
upholds the virtues of civil and martial grace,

73
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,800
embraces the capacity
for governance and economy,

74
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,920
and cultivates benevolence
and righteousness in his character.

75
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,080
He has the loyalty and courage
to accomplish tasks,

76
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,280
and the virtue and talent

77
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,720
to bring prosperity to a region.

78
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,480
Nowadays, Fengxiang Prefecture
is suffering from a severe drought,

79
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,440
which requires planning, commanding,

80
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,160
and governance under absolute authority.

81
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,360
So I order Prince Xian
to make an inspection tour

82
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,600
to oversee the whole process,

83
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,920
enhance our nation's prestige,

84
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,320
and soothe the hearts of the people.

85
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Let the one in charge enforce it.

86
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,480
I, Xiao Zhong,

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,640
receive the imperial order
and express gratitude.

88
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:52,560
When shall I depart?

89
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,920
Prince Xian.

90
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,080
The Empress Dowager has decreed.

91
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:57,080
This matter is of great importance
and cannot be delayed for a moment.

92
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,240
Prince Xian, on this journey,

93
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,640
you will be escorted by the Imperial Guards.

94
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,920
The Great Chief has already made arrangements.

95
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,040
Prince Xian, please relocate
with peace of mind.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,520
Okay.

97
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,160
While I'm away,

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,720
you must take good care of these flowers.

99
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Now the temperature difference
between morning and evening is significant.

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,400
It is best to water at the hour of Si,

101
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,560
especially my

102
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,120

103
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,960
Yes.

104
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,120
Let's go.

105
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,720
Prince Xian, please.

106
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,800
I wonder if the memorial to the throne
has taken Princess of Valor.

107
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:41,840
Madam, Madam.

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,080
Madam.

109
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,480
News has come from the palace.

110
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,800
The Great Chief has left the palace.

111
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,400
You should be relieved now.

112
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,480
Good night.

113
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,520
Alright, I will wait a bit longer.

114
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,072
Okay.

115
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,520
Madam, this is osmanthus and lotus seed soup.

116
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,600
Please drink it while it's hot.

117
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,920
This maid looks very unfamiliar.

118
00:07:25,179 --> 00:07:28,932
[East Bamboo Forest behind the Back Gate]

119
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,880
Prime Minister.

120
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,320
Yan Liuniang.

121
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,520
Indeed, you are exceptionally intelligent.

122
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
Shen Du was taken to the palace earlier

123
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,200
and has not yet returned.

124
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:54,120
If you are here about the progress of the case,

125
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,720
I'm afraid you will return empty-handed.

126
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,880
I know the whereabouts of Shen Du.

127
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,160
I met with you today

128
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,920
to understand the Yan family's position.

129
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,680
I do not understand.

130
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,760
Please be explicit, Prime Minister.

131
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,080
Empress Dowager was furious

132
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:13,080
after hearing the street rhymes.

133
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
She immediately issued an order

134
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,720
asking Prince Xian

135
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,920
to supervise the disaster relief efforts
in Fengxiang Prefecture.

136
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,720
When he left, he wasn't even allowed
to bring his attendants.

137
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,800
Even the route

138
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,840
of his tour was kept secret.

139
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,600
Prime Minister,

140
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,640
do you think the Empress Dowager suspects

141
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,920
Prince Xian is behind the rhyme incident,

142
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,840
and thus wants to take action against him?

143
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,360
But even a tiger will not eat its cubs.

144
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,400
The mountains are high and the roads are long.

145
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,200
If there really is an issue,

146
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,600
it will be too late.

147
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,799
I ask you.

148
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,600
The Empress Dowager controls the government,

149
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,400
disregarding the legitimacy
of the Dacang dynasty.

150
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,720
What was the previous emperor's surname?

151
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,160
Does the Yan family

152
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
still remember that?

153
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
I am wholeheartedly investigating
cases to redress grievances.

154
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,680
A woman like me truly does not
understand the affairs of the court,

155
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:57,000
let alone take on
a significant responsibility in it.

156
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,440
Naive.

157
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,800
You want to enter the royal court

158
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:01,200
while being involved in a case,

159
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,480
and you hope to remain uninvolved.

160
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,360
Not to mention you, Yan Liuniang,

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,120
even the Yan family

162
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,040
cannot escape involvement.

163
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,240
The Empress Dowager
prioritizes the state above all.

164
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,840
Perhaps you are overthinking it.

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,840
Can a series of linked cases

166
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,960
and a single rhyme

167
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,120
really stir up such a big commotion?

168
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,560
Buddha absorbs the sin.

169
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:21,720
This nursery rhyme is quite malicious,

170
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,280
directly suggesting that the Empress Dowager's
position is illegitimate.

171
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,440
If it spreads,

172
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,040
not just Prince Xian is in danger.

173
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
Prime Minister, what do you want me to do?

174
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,600
My men found out

175
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,040
that the Shen family uses carrier pigeons

176
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:36,240
to issue orders and convey messages.

177
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,560
During this journey of Prince Xian,

178
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,200
they surely use carrier pigeons
to report back as well.

179
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,560
You should hurry

180
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,880
and find the route of Prince Xian.

181
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:44,920
When the time comes,

182
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,520
whether Shen Du

183
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,840
intends to assassinate Prince Xian

184
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,640
or to genuinely protect him,

185
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,080
we can all prepare in advance.

186
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,760
Carrier pigeons?

187
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,000
Honey, you are in your home.

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,360
Why sneak around

189
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,640
behaving like a thief?

190
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,160
Great Chief.

191
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,320
I have been eagerly

192
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,640
waiting for you.

193
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,080
When did you come back?

194
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,200
The Empress Dowager didn't make things
difficult for you, did she?

195
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,160
You had me worried all night.

196
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,720
Yan Liuniang,

197
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,200
why put on an act?

198
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,480
Do you think this will ingratiate you with me?

199
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,240
You don't buy it.

200
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,400
Forget it then.

201
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,880
Are you happy now?

202
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,720
As a clerk in the Ministry of Justice,

203
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,080
you should know what crime it is

204
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,120
to forge a memorial.

205
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,440
Moreover, your mere words

206
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,840
caused so many issues in the court.

207
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,160
I was just

208
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,120
anxious to save my husband.

209
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,040
I've never written a memorial before.

210
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,880
How would I know what should be written

211
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
and what should not?

212
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,880
Save me?

213
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,840
I'm afraid you're using me as a pawn.

214
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,680
The night is deep and the dew is heavy.

215
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,800
Great Chief, let's hurry inside to rest.

216
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,960
The gifted scholar
from a humble family, Chen Baiyi,

217
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,480
lit himself on fire at the Dacang Ming Hall.

218
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,240
The articles written with painstaking
effort over many years

219
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:36,400
were all stolen.

220
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,680
If there are no fair officials in Dacang,

221
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:41,040
when will the decayed investigations cease?

222
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
Guys, we toil in reading poetry and books,

223
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,120
yet we can only serve as study companions
to the noble classes' sons. Why?

224
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,840
We can only be their shadows. Why?

225
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,520
- We will not put up with this.
- No more, no more.

226
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,320
Look at you, a bunch of destitute losers.

227
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,760
Without the noble classes,

228
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:56,000
you wouldn't even be worthy to enter
the doors of the Hongwen School.

229
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Yet you dream of making a name for yourselves.

230
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,040
Let me tell you,

231
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,960
you were born lowly.

232
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,560
What did you say?

233
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,200
You are fools who can only steal articles.

234
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,840
Stop fighting.

235
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,320
Stop.

236
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,400
Stop fighting.

237
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,080
Stop it.

238
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,440
What a disgrace.

239
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,040
What a disgrace indeed.

240
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,440
These are all the same

241
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,000
empty words.

242
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,480
For the Ming Hall self-immolation case,

243
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
have the Imperial Guards

244
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,560
made any progress?

245
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,800
Reporting to the Empress Dowager,

246
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,480
the Imperial Guards have
further verified and clarified the facts.

247
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,120
It is indeed as previously stated,

248
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,160
the student Chen Baiyi

249
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
had his articles stolen
by the eldest son of the Jin family.

250
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,160
He was driven out by the Jin family
when he contested the matter

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,880
and was publicly shamed and beaten.

252
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,920
He harbored resentment in his heart

253
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,000
but he had no recourse to official justice.

254
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,160
Ultimately, he self-immolated
to make his conviction known.

255
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,160
The students of the Hongwen School
caused a disturbance

256
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,560
that has yet to abate.

257
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,400
News has come again from Jiangnan.

258
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,560
Look, take a look.

259
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,600
Exam papers

260
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,360
cannot travel the great path of humanity.
Passing the exams

261
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,240
is hard to be righteous
in the eyes of the world.

262
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:09,040
Is this how the scholars in our nation

263
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,720
view our talent recruitment process?

264
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,360
Empress Dowager, please calm down.

265
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,240
Mother Empress,

266
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,760
selecting talent is an important
affair of the state.

267
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:23,840
The noble classes shouldn't have tried

268
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,400
to maintain their ranks with it

269
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,160
and caused such disputes.

270
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,480
In my humble opinion,

271
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,680
be it a humble background

272
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,040
or a noble class,

273
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:32,520
let them compete together.

274
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,840
And we can select

275
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,480
the wise and capable.

276
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,040
I disagree.

277
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,400
Acquiring office through family prestige
is an ancestral system.

278
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,640
How can it be changed so easily?

279
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:49,840
I'm afraid Princess of Valor

280
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,640
has spent too much time composing poems
and matching verses

281
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:53,240
with those students from humble backgrounds

282
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:57,000
and has lost her judgment for a moment.

283
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,360
The offspring of the humble homes
are also citizens of Dacang.

284
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,120
I only spoke a little in their favor,

285
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,560
and why would Prime Minister Zhang
react so strongly?

286
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,960
Could it be that you were already aware

287
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,880
of that Jin kid deceiving superiors

288
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,920
and deluding subordinates?

289
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,520
Empress Dowager, I beg for your discernment.

290
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:19,800
I have only the welfare of Dacang in mind.

291
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,800
Selecting officials can't be based
only on literary talent.

292
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:25,560
Family heritage should also be considered.

293
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,480
Prime Minister Zhang, your words are amiss.

294
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,360
Stubbornly adhering to the special
privileges of noble classes

295
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,360
has already led to

296
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,280
so much fraud and corruption.

297
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:35,880
It is only right to place
the virtuous in their positions.

298
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,160
Empress Dowager.

299
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,120
The deceased in the Ximing Temple serial case

300
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,320
were all descendants of noble classes.

301
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,040
Perhaps some member

302
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:45,880
of a humble family was enticed

303
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,080
and committed the act.

304
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,200
Enticed?

305
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:53,040
It is appropriate to dredge, not to block.

306
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,640
Suppression will never be the solution.

307
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,120
It's such a simple truth.

308
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,640
Prime Minister Zhang, how could you not know?

309
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,840
Are you trying to make

310
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,880
the Empress Dowager bear a bad name

311
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,080
for being unjust

312
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,800
to all the humble homes?

313
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,280
My loyalty to the Empress Dowager

314
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,880
is as clear as the sun and the moon.

315
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,640
If we open up a gap in the path to officialdom,

316
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,840
it is absolutely impermissible.

317
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:15,120
Empress Dowager.

318
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,480
Okay, Prime Minister Zhang.

319
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,120
Please get up.

320
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,160
This argument of yours

321
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:24,760
is for the sake of Dacang.

322
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:26,200
Minister Shen.

323
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,560
Haven't you found out the truth

324
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,400
about the Ming Hall Self-immolation Case?

325
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,360
What do you think?

326
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:35,200
Among the offspring of humble families,

327
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,560
there are indeed talented individuals.

328
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,320
They indeed need an opportunity.

329
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,560
I believe we can choose

330
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,160
a fair assessment method to seek the worthy

331
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,120
for the Empress Dowager to review.

332
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,720
I think we should take

333
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,960
the Hongwen School as a pilot.

334
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,400
We can select the worthy
from humble families to study there.

335
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,080
The Empress Dowager is wise.

336
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,392
You're here.

337
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:14,240
Miss, please sit over here.

338
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,200
Come, sit.

339
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,280
All thanks to you,

340
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,840
my unfilial grandson

341
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,160
has passed away in peace.

342
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,320
Great Chief.

343
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,440
Do you still want these corpses?

344
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,880
The essay written by Scholar Chen

345
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,240
was highly praised by the students.

346
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,600
I've fetched a copy for you.

347
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,640
What a pity.

348
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,480
I can't read.

349
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:45,640
I'll read it to you.

350
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,400
Xizhou Melody.

351
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,960
I remembered the plum as I descended Xizhou,

352
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,560
and I picked plums to send
to the north of the river.

353
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,320
The garment is in apricot red…

354
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
The Madam

355
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,480
keeps taking on tasks for herself.

356
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:25,280
But the fairness and justice she desires

357
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,480
are not so easy to come by.

358
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,040
I didn't expect you

359
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,520
to have such foresight.

360
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,816
What's wrong?

361
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,480
The Empress Dowager decrees

362
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,520
to take the Hongwen School as a pilot

363
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,160
to select the worthy from humble families
to study there.

364
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:13,480
Really?

365
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,400
I mean

366
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,360
I would never dare take credit for this matter.

367
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,600
This is all thanks
to your mediation, Great Chief.

368
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,360
You are sure to gain a reputation
for acute observation

369
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:33,400
among the students

370
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,360
from humble backgrounds.

371
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,960
How wonderful. I'm so happy for you.

372
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,520
Do I care about these?

373
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,440
Before taking any further action,

374
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,960
let me know in advance.

375
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,960
Otherwise, I will not let it go easily.

376
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,840
Indeed.

377
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,880
You are called White Ghost.

378
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,240
What reputation do you still want?

379
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,320
What are you doing again

380
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,600
in the middle of the night?

381
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,160
I'm going to get some exercise, go for a run.

382
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,240
How can I sleep beside White Ghost
if I don't wear myself out running?

383
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,240
Madam.

384
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,360
Does she go for a run every night?

385
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,400
The Madam says it helps with her sleep.

386
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,280
It is indeed bright.

387
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,480
But the light

388
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,920
is still the same as before.

389
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,400
Do you also think it's bright?

390
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,760
Everyone in the house is used to it.

391
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,800
I recall that in Xichen,
there is a type of fabric

392
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,520
that can block out light

393
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,200
Go make a canopy.

394
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,160
- Yes.
- Also,

395
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:17,440
don't light the lamps over there anymore.

396
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,080
Save where you can.

397
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,816
Yes.

398
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,544
Great Chief.

399
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:06,520
You have already barged in.

400
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:09,128
Come in.

401
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,760
Come down now.

402
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,520
The identities of the twelve
bodies at Ximing Temple

403
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:31,880
have been verified.

404
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,160
Most of these paired corpses

405
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:34,600
knew each other well in life.

406
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,000
They were often seen together.

407
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,240
However, there are two pairs,

408
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:38,960
for whom no entanglements have been
found prior to their deaths.

409
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,440
I thought the Imperial Guard
handled matters efficiently.

410
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:44,280
What's taking so long?

411
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,440
The male corpses are all from noble classes.

412
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,120
Based on their appearance and clothing,

413
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,680
they can be quickly identified.

414
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:52,680
But those female corpses

415
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,760
had their looks destroyed and lacked
household registration records.

416
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,240
It indeed took some time.

417
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,320
And their disappearance time

418
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,720
does not match

419
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,880
with the time of death.

420
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,688
No match?

421
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,840
Even for the male victims?

422
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,000
Yes.

423
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,800
At least a difference of two to three months,

424
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,920
and at most one or two years.

425
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,120
The perpetrator held

426
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,920
the victims captive for such a long time.

427
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,160
Indeed, this would increase the risk.

428
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,200
Do the female victims match
the missing courtesans' list

429
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,560
which the inspector investigated?

430
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,040
Yes, they are the courtesans
who went missing from various places.

431
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,120
You're saying they were all courtesans?

432
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,320
Yes.

433
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,040
- That's not right.
- What's not right?

434
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,520
The jewelry found on these female corpses

435
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
is not right.

436
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,240
Come, take a look at this.

437
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,160
It's really exquisite.

438
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:53,280
The quality is evidently good.

439
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,400
It is quite beautiful

440
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:01,320
I found it strange that day.

441
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,600
These pieces of jewelry,

442
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,800
compared to other ornaments,

443
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,280
seemed too exquisite.

444
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,760
They don't seem to be from a regular goldsmith.

445
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,840
These things

446
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:10,440
should not be easily obtainable

447
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,880
by normal courtesans.

448
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,480
I am not very familiar with these.

449
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,680
But Chuichui has mentioned

450
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,240
that well-known craftsmen

451
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,800
tend to leave a signature mark

452
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,800
on their work.

453
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,160
The goldsmiths of Bijiang Gold Workshop

454
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,320
were once creating jewelry

455
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,320
for nobles in the royal treasury.

456
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,440
After opening for just over ten years,

457
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,400
the workshop has surpassed
many centuries-old workshops,

458
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,480
becoming the best in the city.

459
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,088
Please take care.

460
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:42,800
Esteemed guests have arrived, may I know
what you wish to select?

461
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,640
Hairpins.

462
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,520
Bring us the best ones you have here.

463
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,256
Yes.

464
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:08,840
Madam, do you find anything satisfactory?

465
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,400
This one…

466
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,640
Madam has a good eye indeed.

467
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,760
- This is…
- How much is it?

468
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:18,152
Fifty taels.

469
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
I told you average courtesans
couldn't afford it, right?

470
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,480
Honey.

471
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,320
I want the good-looking ones.

472
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,520
When the shopkeeper comes,

473
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,520
can we have him present
the treasure of the store?

474
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,600
Zisun Tea is the current imperial tribute,

475
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,400
and the Zisun tea from Yangxian

476
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
is considered the finest.

477
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,760
Previously, I was fortunate enough

478
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,120
to be rewarded with some.

479
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,320
I kept it at home, never willing to drink it.

480
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,640
But you are so generous.

481
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,560
This is our master's private collection,

482
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:11,720
offered only when esteemed guests arrive.

483
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,960
Has the manager not arrived yet?

484
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,880
The Great Chief

485
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,400
and his wife are here.

486
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,440
I wonder to what do I

487
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,920
owe the pleasure?

488
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,520
If I'm not mistaken,

489
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:26,520
you are Manager Yang

490
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,880
working for Princess of Valor.

491
00:25:30,115 --> 00:25:31,400
[Manager Yang]

492
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,280
The Great Chief has good eyesight.

493
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,440
You even remember me, a lowly servant.

494
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,120
I am flattered and surprised.

495
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,240
These gold ornaments,

496
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,776
do you recognize them?

497
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,280
Some of them

498
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:59,880
did come from Bijiang Gold Workshop.

499
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,400
Good.

500
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,560
I want the list of people
who bought these gold ornaments.

501
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:09,800
Great Chief.

502
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:12,760
This would really stump your servant.

503
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:15,640
We open the doors to welcome guests.

504
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,560
With so many customers coming and going,

505
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:18,880
the jewelry sold over the years

506
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,520
is countless

507
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,640
How could one remember them all?

508
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,240
A hairpin that costs fifty taels each.

509
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,880
Even if an ordinary person
spends their entire fortune on it,

510
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,280
they couldn't buy it many times, right?

511
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,560
If you can't provide the account book,

512
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,160
you might as well tell me

513
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:38,600
who can.

514
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:43,688
But…

515
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:48,080
The Imperial Guards is working on a case.

516
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,160
If you hide anything,

517
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,720
can you bear

518
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,840
the consequences?

519
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,680
Please wait a moment, Great Chief.

520
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,560
I will go and fetch it right away.

521
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,624
This one is good.

522
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,120
Let's go with this one.

523
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,840
It's simple.

524
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,784
It suits you.

525
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Are you giving it to me?

526
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,760
Don't tell me that I

527
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:54,920
have to pay for it myself.

528
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,640
The gold jewelry worn by the female victims

529
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:21,840
truly was quite expensive.

530
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,240
The courtesans were not on the list

531
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,960
of those who bought these designs.

532
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,720
But there are a few familiar names.

533
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,960
The male victims?

534
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,560
That's right.

535
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,520
They spared no expense

536
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,200
for a smile from a beauty.

537
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,920
This seems like a muddled accountbook.

538
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,840
Many shipments were only
recorded as for banquets

539
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,960
without quantities

540
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,120
nor specific destinations.

541
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,480
The gold workshops often hold banquets

542
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,760
inviting the noblewomen of the town.

543
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,440
They must have been given away.

544
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,680
Such a lavish gesture.

545
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,680
That Manager Yang

546
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,720
is really formidable.

547
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,600
The formidable one

548
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,720
is someone else.

549
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,320
Manager Yang

550
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,320
is close to Princess of Valor,

551
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,120
whose rank and status are beyond
that of an ordinary palace person.

552
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,040
But just now, in front of you,

553
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,680
she repeatedly claimed to be your servant

554
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:29,840
and obediently handed over

555
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,120
this register.

556
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,000
She seems to be afraid

557
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,520
of offending you.

558
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,080
She was playing dumb but actually a tiger.

559
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
So she didn't want you

560
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,400
to continue investigating the gold workshop.

561
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,800
Behind her,

562
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,840
it is very likely to be Princess of Valor.

563
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,160
Could it be that they wish to use the banquets

564
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:52,120
to win over the ladies
of various officials' households

565
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,320
and then through their intimates,

566
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:56,280
to understand the thoughts
and movements of each mansion?

567
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:07,080
No wonder Prime Minister Zhang
is so wary of her.

568
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:09,720
Are you familiar with Princess of Valor?

569
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,640
Princess of Valor

570
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,320
is deeply favored.

571
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,480
On the surface, she appears
to enjoy himself all day,

572
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,320
but in reality, she's very astute
and deep-plotted.

573
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,800
But you needn't worry.

574
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:23,080
I estimate she will come looking for you soon.

575
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,000
What does that mean?

576
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,680
- Great Chief.
- Come in.

577
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,920
Princess of Valor sent an invitation…

578
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
Princess of Valor sent an invitation

579
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,200
to invite Madam to attend the Floral Banquet.

580
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,120
[Princess Yong'an's Mansion]
Isn't this the Grand Chief's wife?

581
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,480
Doesn't she have someone to comb her hair?

582
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,880
I just saw Mrs. Wu, and she did not look well.

583
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:55,040
I heard that her husband
had a courtesan outside.

584
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:57,040
Who made her so thoughtless back then

585
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,160
insisting on marrying that minor official
in the Ministry of Justice.

586
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,440
Men.

587
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,720
Whether they have power or not,

588
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,040
whether they are rich or not,

589
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,840
they are all the same.

590
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,960
Exactly.

591
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:07,120
I also heard that

592
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:08,440
Mrs. Tang

593
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,440
once fancied a poor young man,

594
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,000
and they were so in love.

595
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,720
But in the end, that man
eloped with a courtesan.

596
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:17,400
How come I haven't heard about this?

597
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,840
Do you know why Mrs. Tang

598
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:19,840
is so close

599
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:20,960
with Princess of Valor?

600
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,680
Why?

601
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Because

602
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,480
they both like poor young men, you see.

603
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,520
I know, right?

604
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,680
Exactly.

605
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:32,296
Here they come.

606
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Madam, spare my life.

607
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,520
It's okay. It was my own carelessness.

608
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,560
Thank you, Madam.

609
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:46,920
Look. The wife of the Great Chief

610
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,240
is so magnanimous.

611
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,640
Isn't this the illegitimate
daughter of the Yan family?

612
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,000
She transformed

613
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,680
and looks like a lady of a noble house.

614
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,800
It's Mrs. Shen's first time

615
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:57,920
attending such a banquet.

616
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:59,480
She may not be quite used to it.

617
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,016
Actually, it's not like this on normal days.

618
00:32:02,016 --> 00:32:04,400
[Mrs. Tang, Meng Ceran]

619
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:06,160
It's just that, Mrs. Liu

620
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,760
had her husband taken

621
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:10,480
by the Imperial Guards for questioning.

622
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,800
It's okay.

623
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,320
This is just what they say

624
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,280
about the husband offending people

625
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,040
and the wife apologizing.

626
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,040
Mrs. Shen, you need not take it to heart.

627
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:26,000
They are merely indulging in gossip.

628
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,720
I see your dress

629
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,880
is also wet.

630
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,480
You might as well come with me

631
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,760
and change your clothes.

632
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,232
Let's go.

633
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,280
This place is called the Medicinal Spring Pool.

634
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,640
Soaking here

635
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,240
can maintain health and heal injuries.

636
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:55,000
You were exposed to coldness.

637
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Why not go up and enjoy it?

638
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,360
This is too precious.

639
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,480
I should better…

640
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,560
I am testing a new formula
for the medicinal spring.

641
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,880
You can help me try it out

642
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,600
and see how effective this new formula is.

643
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:14,320
Mrs. Tang, you are skilled in medicine.

644
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,000
I only have a superficial understanding.

645
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:32,640
This is the scent of White Champaca.

646
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
That day outside the Ximing Temple,

647
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,280
she was the one spying.

648
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,000
This is a fire moth.

649
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,720
I've heard a legend

650
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,600
that someone saw a fire moth

651
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,600
and followed it up a mountain.

652
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Afterward, they obtained eternal life.

653
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,600
Mrs. Tang,

654
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,720
given your honest character,

655
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,800
do you also aspire to immortality?

656
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:06,440
Life is but a few decades short.

657
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,720
If

658
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:09,920
there are things you want to do,

659
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,480
do not hesitate.

660
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,320
Once youth has passed,

661
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,360
even if you try to pursue your dreams,

662
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:18,159
I'm afraid by then,

663
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,840
you won't have the power.

664
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,168
That's exactly right.

665
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:29,864
Come.

666
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,560
You're intelligent

667
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,800
and share a deep affection
with the Great Chief.

668
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,800
It's reassuring

669
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,520
that the serial killer case

670
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,920
is within your hands.

671
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,960
Speaking of which,

672
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,639
the Liang family has really had
its share of ups and downs.

673
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:52,159
I often see the first madam

674
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,480
of the Liang family.

675
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,280
It's a pity that such a beauty

676
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,920
can't even get a glance from her husband.

677
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:01,800
And now she has lost her son.

678
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,920
So the couple of the Liang family's
first branch is not harmonious?

679
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,600
Look at me, running my mouth.

680
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:11,080
The private affairs of officials
should not be divulged.

681
00:35:11,080 --> 00:35:14,280
Mrs. Shen, please do not take it to heart.

682
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:17,880
Please tell Mrs. Liang

683
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:20,840
that the murderer will soon be caught.

684
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,480
No matter how deeply they hide.

685
00:35:26,368 --> 00:35:27,800
Mrs. Shen.

686
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:31,560
Princess of Valor invites you
to discuss matters after your bath.

687
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,992
I see.

688
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,680
I have been waiting for two hours now.

689
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,840
How has she not arrived yet?

690
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:20,080
Princess of Valor.

691
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,120
The flowers outside were blooming just right.

692
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,960
I actually forgot about Mrs. Shen

693
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,160
Mrs. Shen, you don't need to be nervous.

694
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,160
I called you here

695
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,400
just for a casual chat.

696
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,280
However,

697
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,720
investigating the case is one thing.

698
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:56,000
For other matters,

699
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,960
you'd better leave them alone.

700
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,880
Mrs. Shen is so astute.

701
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,600
You should understand what I mean.

702
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,400
A good bird chooses a proper tree to perch on.

703
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:19,360
Hasn't your husband taught you that?

704
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,240
Your Highness.

705
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:32,240
The Great Chief has come to escort
Mrs. Shen back to the mansion.

706
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,800
It's only been half a day,

707
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,960
but the Great Chief

708
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,840
is so concerned about Mrs. Shen.

709
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,360
It seems that the rumors in the alley

710
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,680
are not unfounded after all.

711
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,440
The affection between the two of you

712
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,360
truly makes others envious.

713
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,320
Let him in.

714
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,816
Yes.

715
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,600
The Floral Banquet has ended,

716
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,480
but my wife has not returned
for quite some time.

717
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,360
Presumably, the palace is too big,
and she lost her way.

718
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,480
I got anxious,

719
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:30,200
so I came to pick her up.

720
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:31,600
After all, at home,

721
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,760
there are many trivial matters
for her to handle.

722
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,440
Since the Great Chief has come,

723
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,280
if I continue to bother Mrs. Shen,

724
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,200
it would be insensitive.

725
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,960
However, I do have one thing

726
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,960
to tell the Great Chief.

727
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,480
Investigating the murder case
is the most important.

728
00:39:58,520 --> 00:40:01,480
Thank you for the reminder, Your Highness.

729
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,312
Are you injured?

730
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,160
I'm actually bleeding.

731
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,080
Did Princess of Valor pressure you
into taking anything?

732
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,560
Is there a possibility of poisoning?

733
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:53,080
You have worked hard, Great Chief.

734
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,080
Others can't see you

735
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,480
within this carriage.

736
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:06,640
Did you anticipate long ago

737
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,880
that my trip to the palace this time
would be dangerous?

738
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,680
A person who has just learned to walk

739
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,040
won't know how painful it is

740
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,720
without a tumble.

741
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:21,200
Moreover, you have revealed
one of Princess of Valor's cards.

742
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,880
A reprimand is not uncalled for, is it?

743
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,280
It was clearly both of us
who exposed her bottom line.

744
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Yet only I am being reprimanded.

745
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
However,

746
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:34,640
since you came……

747
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:36,440
No need for thanks.

748
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,720
You previously wrote a memorial to save me.

749
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:41,240
I am merely returning the favor.

750
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,760
When the Imperial Guards
conducted the investigation,

751
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,720
did you find out that the Liang family's
first branch couple was at odds?

752
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,320
Why investigate the affairs
of the inner quarters?

753
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,760
The first branch indeed
has been persistently troubling

754
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,480
the second branch's uncles,

755
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,520
crying and wailing all day long.

756
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,960
Fortunately, Liang Jiren does have
a sense of the bigger picture

757
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:06,200
and has never made things
difficult for the second branch.

758
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,160
Liang Chenzhong is an only child.

759
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,440
The first branch's bloodline

760
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:13,440
has been cut off by the murderer.

761
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
There are many who hate him.

762
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,480
Even if not heart-gouged,

763
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:18,080
he wouldn't have lived much longer.

764
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:21,920
The person who used Dripping Water Guanyin
also harbors a murderous intent.

765
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:25,520
It's just that they're not
as quick as that serial killer.

766
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,008
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

767
00:43:51,008 --> 00:43:54,685
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

768
00:43:54,685 --> 00:43:59,382

770
00:44:02,326 --> 00:44:05,781
♫ Before the candlelight,
do not ask my thoughts ♫

771
00:44:05,781 --> 00:44:09,328
♫ Affection binds us, forever and ever ♫

772
00:44:09,328 --> 00:44:14,302
♫ The evening breeze tells of my deep love ♫

773
00:44:14,302 --> 00:44:17,246
♫ From now on, I have someone to cherish ♫

774
00:44:17,246 --> 00:44:21,758
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

775
00:44:21,758 --> 00:44:25,086
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

776
00:44:25,086 --> 00:44:26,686
♫ Your palm lines ♫

777
00:44:26,686 --> 00:44:29,449
♫ Your gaze ♫

778
00:44:29,449 --> 00:44:32,510
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

779
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:36,766
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

780
00:44:36,766 --> 00:44:40,798
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

781
00:44:40,798 --> 00:44:42,238
♫ Your palm lines ♫

782
00:44:42,238 --> 00:44:44,798
♫ Your gaze ♫

783
00:44:44,798 --> 00:44:47,678
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

784
00:44:47,678 --> 00:44:52,472
♫ You are the one for me ♫

785
00:45:05,192 --> 00:45:09,069
♫ Embracing each other,
how serious we are about our love ♫

786
00:45:09,069 --> 00:45:12,739
♫ Every moment is treasured ♫

787
00:45:12,739 --> 00:45:17,398
♫ From dawn to dusk ♫

788
00:45:17,398 --> 00:45:20,431
♫ You and I, forever inseparable ♫

789
00:45:20,431 --> 00:45:23,657
♫ You've stormed into my world ♫

790
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:27,397
♫ Growing immersed,
I become reckless for love ♫

791
00:45:27,397 --> 00:45:32,414
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

792
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:35,294
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

793
00:45:35,294 --> 00:45:39,582
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

794
00:45:39,582 --> 00:45:43,358
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

795
00:45:43,358 --> 00:45:44,928
♫ Your palm lines ♫

796
00:45:44,928 --> 00:45:47,678
♫ Your gaze ♫

797
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:50,590
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

798
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:54,590
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

799
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:58,743

and spring breeze only with you ♫

800
00:45:58,743 --> 00:46:00,447
