[Episode 18]

15
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,520
The Great Chief successfully
vindicated the Jinxiu Workshop.

16
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Finding the real culprit is truly
satisfying to the people's hearts.

17
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
So good the wrongful grievances
have been cleared.

18
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,000
I will be the Lady
of the Shen Mansion from now on.

19
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,560
What are you still doing here?

20
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,440
This is bad. The Great Chief insisted
on a re-investigation of the old cases,

21
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,440
which provoked the Empress Dowager.

22
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,760
The entire Shen Mansion
is to be executed today.

23
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,520
But Shen Du did not defy the Empress Dowager.

24
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,160
Liuniang.

25
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,560
Aren't you desperately
trying to find out the truth?

26
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,320
Why are you feeling compassion for Shen Du?

27
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,520
I'm not. This is unfair.

28
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:08,440
Nothing's fair.

29
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,720
I tried so hard to learn,

30
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,840
but I was unable to get an official title
due to my humble backgrounds.

31
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,480
Do you want the truth or Shen Du's safety?

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,680
You can only choose one.

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,400
I won't choose. I can't choose.

34
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,920
Hurry up and move out.

35
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,160
Madam, please save the Great Chief.
Think of a way.

36
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,320
- Liuniang.
- Hurry and choose one.

37
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,960
From now on, this place is all mine.

38
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,120
Madam, we are all to be executed today, Madam.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,560
Don't you want to know the truth?
What are you waiting for?

40
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,280
I won't need to compete
with you anymore in the future.

A bull.

46
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,440
What do you mean by that?

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,400
Madam, you've finally woken up.

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
The Great Chief has something
to discuss with you.

49
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,200
He has been waiting
in the study for a long time.

The sun is about to set.

54
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,920
Could it be that something
is really going to happen?

55
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,320
I'm here.

56
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,680

Yes.

59

Did something happen?

60
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,680
These are the case files
of the Jinxiu Workshop case.

61
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,800
I have organized them

62
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,600
so it will be more convenient
to go through them later.

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,600
What do you mean?

64
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,120
The Empress Dowager has agreed

65
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,600
to re-investigate this case.

66
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,280
Really?

67
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,240
Do I look like I'm joking?

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,280
You've had me worried for nothing

69
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,840
for so long.

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,360
I thought there would be…

71
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,840
Are you worried that I would act
only in my own interest

72
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,080
and hastily close the case?

73
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:54,160
Or are you worried that
my reporting this matter

74
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,320
would make the Empress Dowager unhappy?

75
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,080
Is there a difference between the two?

76
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
Yes.

Why do I still have to choose?

80
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,272
I won't choose.

81
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:17,040
So?

82
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,200
What did you think?

83
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
What can I think?

84
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,400
I think you are a man of integrity.

85
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,840
This is what one ought to do

86
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,200
in a key position.

87
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,720
Besides that,

88
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,440
is there nothing else you want to say?

89
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,952
What should I say?

90
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,800
Did I say something wrong again?

91
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,152
No.

92
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,000
Weird.

93
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:45,200
I heard that the Great Chief

94
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
argued with so many in the court

95
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,880
without any fear.

96
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,240
He delivered a passionate

97
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,520
and fiery speech

98
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,200
that made the Empress Dowager

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:56,080
agree to re-investigate
the Jinxiu Workshop case.

100
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,160
I suppose

101
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,160
you certainly

102
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:59,760
had a hand behind the scenes

103
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:02,120
and made no small contribution.

104
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,240
What contribution could I possibly have made?

105
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,160
Instead, I fell for Pan Chi's drugging

106
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,240
and knocked myself out.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,360
When I woke up, I heard this news.

108
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:15,680
Did you become foolish

109
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,400
from working on the cases?

110
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,200
It's such a shame

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,440
that I only heard about it

112
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,760
instead of witnessing
the Great Chief's impressive demeanor.

113
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,880
He has no shortage of

114
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
swaggering about all day long.

115
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,080
You don't know how fortunate you are.

116
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,880
The Great Chief holds an important position

117
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,440
and has a prestigious reputation.

118
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:44,080
Most importantly, he's also good-looking.

119
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,200
He always has a cold expression.

120
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,120
It's terribly unsightly

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,520
Miss Yun Que, I have something to tell you.

126
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:43,080
I advise you it's best not

127
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,720
to provoke the Great Chief.

128
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,040
Mind your own business.

129
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:49,080
Have you ever wondered
why the Great Chief is called

130
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,400
White Ghost?

131
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,280
I'm not the same as outsiders.

132
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,480
The Great Chief had a bad look.

133
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,000
If you remain persistent,

134
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,280
what if, in a fit of anger,
he twists your head off?

135
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,080
It's not impossible.

136
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,400
Who are you trying to scare?

137
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,600
If you don't believe me,

138
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,600
go ahead and try.

139
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,280
I'm just curious
about the Jinxiu Workshop case.

140
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,280
Mr. Jing Lin.

141
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,680
You often work on cases with the Great Chief.

142
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,800
Ji Fangming has been interrogated.

143
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,800

instigator of the matter

145
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,280
of the Jinxiu Workshop?

146
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,840
You must have some insider information, right?

147
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,416
I…

148
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,240
don't know.

149
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,240
You definitely know.

150
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,720
Tell me about it.

151
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,880
Then let me ask you.

152
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,960
How does your family know

153
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,520
Kong Xianrong of Jinxiu Workshop?

154
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:42,240
What makes you so devoted
to reversing the case for him?

155
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,800
Even if I told you, you wouldn't understand.

156
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,520
How can others understand
if you don't explain it clearly?

157
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,880
What do you mean?

158
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:51,040
Your family had many dealings
with the Jinxiu Workshop in the past

159
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,640
yet were never affected.

160
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,200
Why is that?

161
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,960
Are you interrogating me now?

162
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,040
Are you suspecting my family members?

Have you heard?

166
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,520
Hundreds of moths just swarmed
into the Princess of Valor's Mansion.

167
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:19,800
It was so frightening.

168
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,280
I heard they flew over
from the Jinxiu Workshop.

169
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,400
They say it's the grievous wails
of wronged souls

170
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,600
seeking retribution.

171
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,840
Could it be that Princess of Valor

172
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,800
is the mastermind
behind the Jinxiu Workshop massacre?

173
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,840
Back then, she had

174
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:30,840
a hostile relationship

175
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,000
with Princess Runing.

Mother Empress has agreed to re-investigate it.

The injustice you've endured for many years

180
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,760
can finally be redressed.

181
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,280
The old case can be overturned.

182
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,480
But the ones who died in vain

183
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,320
can never be brought back.

00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,160
I opened the door and saw you today,

186
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,120
which means I have let go

187
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,320
of the past.

188
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,240
The departed have passed on.

189
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,920
And the living

190
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,600
must carry on.

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,400
Now, outside, it's being said

192
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,360
that the wrongful case
of Jinxiu Workshop back then

193
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,800
was a setup by me.

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,640
That I was the one who caused
the death of your husband.

195
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,640
Don't you have anything

196
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,760
you want to ask me?

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,200
So?

198
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,840
It wasn't me.

199
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,720
If that's the case,

200
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,280
why is your heart in turmoil again?

201
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,240
That invisible force

202
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,720
has appeared again.

203
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,200
It's targeting the royal family,

204
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:01,360
intending to throw us into utter chaos.

205
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,560
I'm not the first one,

206
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,920
and you won't be the last.

207
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:17,040
Knowing there is no way to change it,

208
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,520
you might as well accept it as fate.

209
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:23,760
I refuse to resign to fate.

210
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,600
Be it the wrongful case of Jinxiu Workshop

211
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
or the unsolved case of Chen Huo'e,

212
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,280
the Imperial Guards, the Imperial Inspectorate,

213
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:30,640
the Dali Supreme Court,
and the Ministry of Justice

214
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:33,680
are all trying to solve the case.

215
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,440
We must make the truth

216
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
come to light once more.

217
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,840
The mortal world is full of turmoil.

218
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,960
Seek clarity and peace within one's heart.

219
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,640
Aunt, do you wish

220
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:48,040
to stay at this Mingsheng Temple

221
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,080
for the rest of your life?

222
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,800
Affairs of this world

223
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,400
are all trivial matters.

224
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,560
At least, one can find peace here.

225
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,120
Fine.

226
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,960
It seems I've made a fool of myself.

227
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:11,080
It's still the same as before.

228
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,040
I can't stand this pretentiousness,

229
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,000
and you despise my frivolity.

230
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,760
I heard that when Prince Xian came,

231
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,160
you once told his fortune.

232
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,400
Today,

233
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,320
can you divine a fortune for me too?

234
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,240
I have only been cultivating myself here

235
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,600
for a few years.

236
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,200
My practice is not enough.

237
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,600
I'm not very proficient

238
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,880
in fortune-telling.

239
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:38,240
If there's nothing else,

240
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,840
you should go back.

241
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:42,400
You're asking me to leave, huh?

242
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,416
I know when I'm not wanted.

243
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,680
An encounter is already a good omen.

244
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,480
Why worry and foster unnecessary thoughts?

245
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,760
Your Highness.

246
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,880
Shen Du.

247
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,640
You've paid a night visit to Mingsheng Temple.

248
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:07,720
Are you worried

249
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,720
about the matter of Jinxiu Workshop
or Chen Huo'e?

250
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:11,360
What?

251
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
Are you suspecting me as well?

252
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,040
Do you want to question me?

253
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,040
Your Highness, you misunderstood me.

254
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,320
I have a plan

255
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,800
that can free you

256
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,240
from undeserved blame.

257
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,840
Come on, bring it in, bring it in.

258
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,880
Alright, alright, put it here.

259
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,904
Mister. Mister.

260
00:14:47,904 --> 00:14:49,080
- Father.
- Que.

261
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,160
- Mother, what are you doing here?
- Que.

262
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,560
It is this…

263
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,720
young hero

264
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,800
who kidnapped…

265
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,720
escorted us all the way here.

266
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,184
Escorted?

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,120
How did you do it?

268
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,240
Anyway, I have brought them to you.

269
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,000
He also said

270
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,880
that Que is to be wed

271
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,880
to Shen Du, the Great Chief.

272
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:22,360
Great Chief.

273
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,800
If you had this intention,
you should have told me first.

274
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,760
Why go for this surprise?

275
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,680
Yan Xing.

276
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,520
Handle this matter.

277
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,320
You have traveled through
dust and wind to arrive at Xiang'an.

278
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:44,720
You must not have had a good rest on the road.

279
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,200
Let's take a rest first

280
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,520
and talk about this matter later.

281
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,640
Please,

282
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:52,240
rest in the hall.

283
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,600
Is this how you invite people?

284
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,600
You didn't mention how to bring them here.

285
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,720
Moreover, they do not cooperate.

286
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,080
Besides,

287
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,520
this is the safest way.

288
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,400
That's right.

289
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,080
I also found out something

290
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:16,280
that you would be interested in.

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,480
Great Chief, please.

292
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,560
Since Yun Que is not here,

293
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,040
let's get straight to the point.

294
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,200
Mr. and Mrs. Yun.

295
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,920
We invited you two to Xiang'an

296
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,880
not for Yun Que's marriage.

297
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,560
Great Chief is letting Yun Que stay here,

298
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,640
but he never had the intention of marrying her.

299
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,280
As to the matter of the Jinxiu Workshop,

300
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,880
we hope that this time,

301
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,480
you two can tell the truth.

302
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:11,640
What do you mean, Mrs. Shen?

303
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,920
We do not understand.

304
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,160
Your journey to Xiang'an

305
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,319
was not peaceful.

306
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,400
I need not mention those assassins.

307
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,960
You should have heard about them.

308
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,240
At this point,

309
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,119
if you continue to conceal things,

310
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,720
I fear even the Great Chief

311
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:28,520
won't be able to protect you all the time.

312
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,080
That's true.

313
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,320
Indeed, I don't need

314
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:41,000
to shelter those who are unimportant.

315
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,240
Honey, since they do not wish to say more,

316
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,600
we need not waste any more time.

317
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,400
I've heard that nearby Jinxiu Workshop,

318
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,040
there have been wronged spirits
lurking recently.

319
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,320
I am timid

320
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,320
and do not wish to stir up more trouble.

321
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,080
Perhaps we should pack their luggage

322
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:05,320
and send them
out of the Shen residence tonight.

323
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,680
Whether they live or die

324
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,960
is up to them.

325
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,280
That would be for the best.

326
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,224
- Wait
- Master.

327
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,400
Que is innocent.

328
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,280
Mr. Yun.

329
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,360
We also do not wish

330
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,080
to see you in danger,

331
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:31,280
but now someone is stirring up trouble
with the old case

332
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,560
of Jinxiu Workshop.

333
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,800
Even if you conceal what you know,

334
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,360
would the instigator

335
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,920
truly protect you?

336
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,840
We have wronged Jinxiu Workshop.

337
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,520
We have wronged Mr. Kong.

338
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,640
However,

339
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,360
we had no other choice.

340
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
If we were to meddle further,

341
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,480
our Yun family

342
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,920
would not be able to survive.

343
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,680
Back then when inspecting the evidence,

344
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:56,400
we did find something abnormal

345
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,600
and wanted to contact Mr. Kong.

346
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,960
But that very night,

347
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,160
we were threatened

348
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,360
to keep our mouths shut.

349
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,640
Otherwise,

350
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,920
Yun Que would lose her life.

351
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,080
So we

352
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,440
had no choice but to abide by the agreement

353
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,280
and not speak up for the Jinxiu Workshop.

354
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,160
And after so many years,

355
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,560
the person threatening us

356
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,040
has never ceased surveillance.

357
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,840
If that's the case,

358
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,440
why did the evidence end up
in Yun Que's hands in the end?

359
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,120
Moreover, she came alone

360
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,840
safely to Xiang'an to seek justice.

361
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:27,040
That person asked us to do that.

362
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,640
We didn't understand

363
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:31,120
why there was such a sudden request,

364
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,600
but we had to comply.

365
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,280
We could only put on an act

366
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,160
letting Que find out bits and pieces.

367
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,720
Given her character,

368
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,680
she would definitely take those documents

369
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,680
to file a lawsuit.

370
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:49,200
Who exactly is the person threatening you?

371
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,000
- It's…
- It's…

372
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,840
It is Chen Huo'e.

373
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,760
- Que.
- Que.

374
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,760
So you've known all along

375
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,040
that Uncle Kong's family was wronged.

376
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,160
But in order to protect yourselves,

377
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,320
you knew there were hidden circumstances

378
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,640
and disregarded the wrongs done
to so many people of Jinxiu Workshop.

379
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,840
Que.

380
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,320
We had no choice.

381
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,920
Your mother and I

382
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,440
can't and dare not gamble with your life

383
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,240
or the fate of the entire Yun family.

384
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,200
Father.

385
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:27,600
Mother.

386
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
Then how are we, the Yun family,

387
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,960
different from the accomplices?

388
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,280
Your father and I were cowards.

389
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,920
If there's any retribution to be had,

390
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:38,720
let it fall on us.

391
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,120
Que.

392
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:41,960
The Great Chief and Mrs. Shen

393
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,560
know that you are not involved in this affair.

394
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,560
Only by staying in the Shen Mansion,

395
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,400
will you be out of danger.

396
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,960
We implore you for mercy, Great Chief.

397
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,680
Father.

398
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,920
Mother.

399
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,560
No matter what happens in the future,

400
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:01,840
I will face it with you.

401
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,232
Que.

402
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,200
So, is the truth more important

403
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,760
or is the safety of those
close to you more important?

404
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:43,840
I didn't expect it to be Chen Huo'e again.

405
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:47,080
So she didn't just come back to life recently.

406
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:49,480
She has always been alive.

407
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,120
For over five years,

408
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,960
whatever Chen Huo'e has been planning,

409
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:59,280
she must have felt the time was ripe.

410
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,360
That's why she appeared using all the evidence

411
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,720
that could prove her resurrection.

412
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,760
What exactly is her purpose?

413
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:10,800
A miraculous resurrection,

414
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:15,240
even the re-investigation
of the Jinxiu Workshop case.

415
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,240
In the Jinxiu Workshop case,

416
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,600
Princess Runing's family was involved.

417
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,880
In this re-investigation,

418
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,000
she used moths to guide the people

419
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:27,640
into thinking the Princess of Valor
was the instigator back then.

420
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,720
So she wants

421
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,160
to make the most favored
Princess of Valor subject to suspicion

422
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:39,240
or even incrimination.

423
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,600
If we want to investigate clearly

424
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:44,280
the old case of the Jinxiu Workshop,

425
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:47,040
it will inevitably involve Princess Runing,

426
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:50,360
Princess of Valor Prince Xian,

427
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:51,720
even Prime Minister Zhang, Lai Luozhi,

428
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,440
and the interactions
between these high-ranking officials.

429
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,920
From the perspective of the beneficiary,

430
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:59,360
it is indeed difficult not to suspect
the person behind the scenes

431
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,000
is related to Princess of Valor.

432
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,080
Chen Huo'e's act of deifying

433
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,920
is leading the innocent people

434
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,280
to be convinced

435
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,760
that Princess of Valor is the one
who needs to be punished.

436
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,248
What's wrong?

437
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,400
I've just fully understood

438
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,120
how much risk and pressure

439
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,280
proposing a re-investigation

440
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,880
of an old case brings.

441
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:29,720
If Princess of Valor gets implicated,

442
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,120
it will again draw out

443
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,800
many forces in the court.

444
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,440
By the way, Pan Chi mentioned
something upon his return.

445
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,616
- He said…
- Great Chief,

446
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,480
Princess of Valor is hosting
a family banquet in her mansion

447
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,680
and invited you to attend.

448
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,880
Unexpectedly, even at such a time,

449
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,960
Princess of Valor

450
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,400
is still in the mood to hold a family banquet.

451
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,800
I didn't expect it to come so quickly.

452
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,920
Since you are curious,
accompany me to go there.

453
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:10,152
[Wind and Bamboos Forming Melody]

454
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,400
I don't see

455
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,840
other wives accompanying.

456
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,440
We can take this opportunity

457
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:20,720
to dispel the rumors of our marital discord.

458
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:24,320
I agree.

459
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,080
Let's go all the way

460
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,720
and let them all see clearly.

461
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,856
Great Chief.

462
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:17,000
Why would Princess of Valor

463
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,040
take your advice

464
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,720
and hold this family banquet?

465
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,040
Given her character,

466
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:25,000
she wouldn't ignore the rumors.

467
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,480
She would make a preemptive move

468
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,920
trying to catch turtles in a jar.

469
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,280
Are you so certain

470
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:34,400
that Chen Huo'e will take action?

471
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,800
If Chen Huo'e wants to attract more followers,

472
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:39,080
she must keep creating miracles.

473
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,080
And to punish those

474
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,040
who were truly responsible
for the Jinxiu Workshop case

475
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,760
is her chance to prove herself

476
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,640
and the best opportunity
to capture people's hearts.

477
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:49,520
You have always stayed away
from factional disputes.

478
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,800
Attending the banquet today,

479
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:52,240
aren't you afraid that others will think

480
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,920
that you are siding with Princess of Valor?

481
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,120
Do you think the 'White Ghost' people speak of

482
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,600
cares about these matters?

483
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,200
Honey, you are intelligent and resourceful.

484
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,960
If Chen Huo'e shows up later,

485
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,368
what's your plan?

486
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I'll play it by ear.

487
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,480
Princess Jia'an has arrived.

488
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,240
Greetings to Princess Jia'an.

489
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,440
Greetings to Princess Jia'an.

490
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,480
Greetings, Mother.

491
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
I hope you are well.

492
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,216
Come here.

493
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,640
Today is a family banquet.

494
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,280
There's no need for excessive formalities.

495
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,560
Just make yourselves comfortable.

496
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,520
Please take a seat quickly.

497
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,960
Princess Jia'an is so outstanding

498
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,480
with an extraordinary presence.

499
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,320
Just as the legends describe,

500
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,800
she has impeccable manners.

501
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,840
Princess Jia'an truly is fitting
to be the daughter of Princess of Valor.

502
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:57,920
It is an honor

503
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,480
to see her today.

504
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,160
Jia'an has been frail since childhood,

505
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:03,800
so she grew up in the gardens
on the outskirts of the capital.

506
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,960
As her mother,

507
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,640
we have had few meetings and many partings.

508
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,840
Not long ago, she just reached
the age of maturity

509
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,200
and was summoned back to the capital
by Mother Empress.

510
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,080
Today's banquet

511
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,960
is to welcome her

512
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,240
and help her get settled.

513
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,520
I've heard that the Empress Dowager

514
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
is personally arranging

515
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,600
a marriage for Princess Jia'an.

516
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:25,000
Surely, Your Highness
will have an excellent son-in-law.

517
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,840
On the other hand, I hope that she

518
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,280
can stay by my side

519
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,000
for a longer time.

520
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
Did you notice anything?

521
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:43,760
Her smile outshines the stars.

522
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,640
She's truly young and beautiful.

523
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,000
Take a look.

524
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,800
With the singing and dancing,

525
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,480
it really is a delightful sight.

526
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,080
Be careful lest extreme joy begets sorrow.

527
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,720
I hope no trouble occurs.

528
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,840
There are moths.

529
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:43,880
I see them.

530
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,088
Look.

531
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:48,904
Your Highness.

532
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,200
Guards, capture her alive.

533
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,496
Yes.

534
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,520
You've prepared this show with great effort.

535
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:26,960
Why leave without taking a look?

536
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,480
You actually noticed.

537
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:35,360
A petty trick

538
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,480
can't deceive anyone.

539
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,840
Since you can control the moths,

540
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,960
they will naturally lead me

541
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,680
to find you, their master.

542
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,080
You're clever.

543
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,240
But you alone

544
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,000
can't block my path.

545
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,400
I'm enough.

546
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,600
An ignorant fool.

547
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,280
Today,

548
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,880
you will have

549
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,440
a one-way journey.

550
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,480
If you do not ally with me,

551
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,320
you will be walking into a fire,

552
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,440
a one-way journey.

553
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:07,520
Is the wrongful case
of the Shen Mansion back then

554
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,680
related to you?

555
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,400
Your father

556
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,960
was but an ant.

557
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,160
No one cares about his death.

558
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:20,400
You can choose to believe in me

559
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:22,800
and beg me to resurrect him.

560
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,680
Sweet words,

561
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,080
but utter nonsense.

562
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,160
The person who framed your father

563
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:28,720
is right by your side.

564
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:30,000
Yet you regard the murderer as your father,

565
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,680
assisting a tyrant in his oppression.

566
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,880
Shen Du, oh Shen Du.

567
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,320
Your father died with eyes unclosed.

568
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:39,320
You are seeking death.

569
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,440
Does the person who was resurrected from death

570
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:49,200
also bleed?

571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,200
I never believed that there are people

572
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,960
who can come back to life after death.

573
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,120
Kill me.

574
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,720
And there will be one less person who knows

575
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,400
about the wrongful case
of the Shen Mansion years ago.

576
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,680
Liuniang, be careful.

577
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,752
Liuniang.

578
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,040
Shen Du.

579
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,120
Are you alright?

580
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:26,680
I have figured out the key
to Chen Huo'e's resurrection.

581
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,920
Let's go.

582
00:32:31,494 --> 00:32:35,710
[Wind and Bamboos Forming Melody]

583
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,680
Your Highness.

584
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,320
The princess was a bit frightened.

585
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:42,280
She has taken a Tranquilizer Pill
and is resting now.

586
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:44,840
Good.

587
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,200
Your Highness.

588
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,640
the assailant has been captured.

589
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,800
Your Great Chief

590
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,600
truly is a man of his word.

591
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,840
Who sent you here?

592
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,120
No one.

593
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:13,520
Drag her out

594
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:14,720
and beat her until she talks.

595
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,096
Yes.

596
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,240
As you all have seen today.

597
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:24,720
The Huo'e Sect

598
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,840
and these so-called limitless miracles

599
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,920
are nothing but a group of charlatans

600
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,680
deluding the public.

601
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,960
From now on,

602
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,360
if anyone else uses the name of Chen Huo'e

603
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,440
to spread rumors,

604
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,440
this will be their fate.

605
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,792
Yes.

606
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:02,920
How can you be so careless?

607
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:11,800
It's… it's Shen Du.

608
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:13,560
And Yan Xing.

609
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:16,440
They ruined my plans.

610
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,600
After today,

611
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:22,000
it will be hard to get another opportunity

612
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:25,199
to get close to Princess of Valor's mansion.

613
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,440
I would not hesitate to eradicate

614
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,600
the opposition for you, Master.

615
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,719
Forget it.

616
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,239
Overthrowing Princess of Valor

617
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:38,080
is not something that can
be achieved overnight.

618
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,400
You fell for Shen Du's trick.

619
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,400
She wanted you to take action.

620
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,960
As long as you are unable to punish

621
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
Princess of Valor as prophesied,

622
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,639
it will be used by them to make you

623
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,800
lose the trust of your disciples
and the public.

624
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,440
No.

625
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,560
I won't let Shen Du succeed.

626
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,000
Those who offend Huo'e

627
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,199
must all die.

628
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,440
Very good.

629
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,040
Go on and demonstrate again

630
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:08,040
the miracle of your rebirth.

631
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,544
Don't move.

632
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,600
Next time we encounter Chen Huo'e,

633
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,240
I will definitely not let her escape again.

634
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,720
You want there to be a next time?

635
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,000
She no longer has

636
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,120
any secrets to immortality.

637
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,720
With your skills, capturing her

638
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,800
should be very easy.

639
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,200
So,

640
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:04,040
it's news from Pan Chi.

641
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:06,600
He says among those
whom the Huo'e Sect once killed,

642
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,600
there was an old famous physician

643
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,040
who mentioned he had treated someone

644
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:12,240
with their internal organs
in the wrong position.

645
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,120
Based solely on this statement,

646
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,600
you deduced

647
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,840
that Chen Huo'e's heart is different
from that of an ordinary person.

648
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,680
It's not on the left side.

649
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,600
I wasn't quite sure before.

650
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,240
Until during the entanglement,

651
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,640
I confirmed.

652
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,000
Her heartbeat is on the right side.

653
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,200
Great Chief.

654
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,600
Come in.

655
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,440
The guard watching
the Huo'e Sect disciples reports

656
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:12,480
- that there's an anomaly.
- What's up?

657
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,680
This morning, Chen Huo'e appeared separately
in the eastern, western, southern,

658
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
and northern parts of the city,

659
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,200
proclaiming the wide-reaching
divine powers of the Huo'e Sect.

660
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
Not only can they bring people back to life,

661
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,360
but they can also create many avatars.

662
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,440
And suddenly, citizens of Xiang'an City

663
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,280
are enshrining all kinds of fire moths.

664
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,640
It seems the ambition of the Huo'e Sect

665
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:30,000
does not stop within the sect.

666
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:43,960
Notify everyone

667
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,160
to conduct a citywide manhunt for Chen Huo'e.

668
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,904
Yes.

669
00:37:58,160 --> 00:37:59,680
Keep a close watch on the lady.

670
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,720
Don't let her wander around anymore.

671
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:04,520
Yes.

672
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,040
Let go of me, let go of me.

673
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,720
Lock them all up in the dungeon.

674
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,032
Yes.

675
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,680
Great Chief, it's not good.

676
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,680
Great Chief.

677
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,320
The lady is missing.

678
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,280
Missing?

679
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,360
Outside Shen Mansion,

680
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,080
these thugs from the Huo'e Sect

681
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,720
are hurting people and causing trouble.

682
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,440
It's important to save people. Open the gate.

683
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:44,480
Great Chief gave orders before he left

684
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,040
that before he returned,

685
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:48,320
the doors of Shen Mansion must remain shut.

686
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,800
If today, there are commoners

687
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,960
having any accidents

688
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,080
outside the Great Chief's mansion gate,

689
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,080
it would be framing the Great Chief

690
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,120
as being unkind and unjust.

691
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:57,640
Later on, this mansion's gate
might truly never open again.

692
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,360
Open the gate, and save people.

693
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:13,720
The lady and I went to save people,

694
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:15,480
but we fell into their ambush.

695
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,640
In the blink of an eye,

696
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,040
she has vanished.

697
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,000
Go search for her.

698
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,272
Let's go.

699
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,440
The moths flying to the flame.

700
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:32,560
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

701
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,640
The moths flying to the flame.

702
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,960
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

703
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,880
The moths flying to the flame.

704
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,320
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

705
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,560
The moths flying to the flame.

706
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,520
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

707
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,680
- The moths have revived.
- The moths have divine powers.

708
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,320
The moths have divine powers.

709
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,720
The moths have divine powers.

710
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,200
The moths have divine powers.

711
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,840
The moths flying to the flame.

712
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,000
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

713
00:39:58,000 --> 00:39:59,960
Not entering the cycle of death.

714
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,720
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

715
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:03,760
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

716
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,760
Not entering the cycle of death.

717
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:07,840
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

718
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,920
Not entering the cycle of death.

719
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,480
The immortal cycle of rebirth.

720
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:28,200
The moths flying to the flame.

721
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,160
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

722
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,160
The moths flying to the flame.

723
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,240
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

724
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
The moths flying to the flame.

725
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,120
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

726
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,800
The moths flying to the flame.

727
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,880
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

728
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,680
The moths flying to the flame.

729
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,840
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

730
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,640
The moths flying to the flame.

731
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,880
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

732
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,840
The moths flying to the flame.

733
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:54,520
Born in the morning, dead by evening.

734
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,120
Shen Du.

735
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:25,600
You can't kill me.

736
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,600
Give up.

737
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:27,600
You're merely a mirror human.

738
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,960
Yet you dare to claim immortality.

739
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,200
Truly a Joke.

740
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,744
Shen Du.

741
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,040
