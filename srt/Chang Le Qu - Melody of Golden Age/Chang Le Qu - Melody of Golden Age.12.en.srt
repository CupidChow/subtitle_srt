[Cangming Hall]
Princess of Valor is here.

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,336
Mother Empress.

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,600
Mother Empress.

18
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm here to sue Prime Minister Zhang

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,720
for courting scholars from humble backgrounds

20
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,080
while supervising the exam

21
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,360
and attempting to murder
those who refuse to comply.

22
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Many scholars from humble backgrounds
went missing today.

23
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:05,200
Empress Dowager, I have been wronged.

24
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,240
I was simply concerned

25
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,880
about those scholars

26
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,600
who were exhausted from the journey.

27
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,080
Therefore, I told my juniors

28
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,360
to look after them.

29
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,640
How could the princess

30
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,400
frame me like that?

31
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,720
Then tell me.

32
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,520
Where are those scholars

33
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,960
who left the banquet early?

34
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Empress Dowager.

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Prime Minister Zhang

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,720
has always valued the talented

37
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,280
as the head of the civil officials.

38
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,040
He may have tried to court them,

39
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,800
but I'm afraid he couldn't have

40
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,080
"silenced" anyone

41
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,800
without any assistance.

42
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,120
Vice Minister Lai, what are you implying?

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:47,000
Do not talk nonsense.

You can't speak recklessly.

47
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,840
Do you have evidence?

48
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,440
- I--
- I do.

49
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,040
Several scholars were attacked last night

50
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,480
and were saved by the Imperial Guards.

51
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,000
The confiscated weapons

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,240
resemble those…

53
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:25,560
of Prince Xian's guards.

54
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:29,440
Mother Empress.

55
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,320
I have absolutely nothing to do with this.

56
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:32,560
I beg you to look into it.

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,440
The assassins confessed before they died

58
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:37,240
that they were instigated by Prince Xian.

59
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,920
Great Chief Shen…

00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,680
You can't just slander someone.

61
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:46,680
When did you

62
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,600
join hands with the Princess of Valor?

63
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,400
Stop diverting the subject.

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,200
With solid evidence here,

65
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,280
how can you and Prince Xian

66
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,640
continue to oversee
the Hongwen School examination?

67
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,840
You'd better confess now.

68
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,800
The culprits shall be arrested,

69
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,600
not Prime Minister Zhang or Prince Xian.

70
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,320
Minister Shen.

71
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,960
You saved the scholars.

72
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,840
And you brought the evidence.

73
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,040
So why are you now saying

74
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,320
that there is someone else behind this?

75
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,399
There are three groups of assailants.

76
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:19,760
The first group only intended to kidnap

77
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:22,840
and intimidate the scholars
to establish authority.

78
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,840
These people work for Prime Minister Zhang.

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:28,560
I…

80
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,320
The second group was ruthless

81
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,760
yet they used the weapons
of Prince Xian's guards.

82
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:34,160
And they kept mentioning

83
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,280
Prince Xian

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,040
to make sure the victims knew.

85
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
And who are you?

86
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,480
Prince Xian is wise.

87
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,920
You insignificant scholars

88
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,400
can't be courted.

89
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,400
You shall perish!

90
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,960
The third group lying in ambush

91
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:49,000
was determined to kill the scholars.

92
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,840
They used the hidden weapons
of Prince Xian's guards on purpose.

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,400
How's that possible?

94
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,920
If Prince Xian were behind all this,

95
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,720
why would he make it so obvious?

96
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
Empress Dowager.

97
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,560
Isn't it self-contradictory?

98
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,040
It seems that

99
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,080
many groups of people

100
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,400
are eager to put me away, Mother Empress.

101
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,120
Please look into it, Mother Empress.

102
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:28,960
Since the evidence is questionable,

103
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,920
I'll entrust the Imperial Guards
to carry on with the investigation.

104
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:49,320
Fortunately, these scholars

106
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,960
from humble backgrounds received protection

107
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,560
from Minister Shen.

108
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,920
I want no more problems

109
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,280
from now on.

110
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,280
Prince Xian.

111
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,600
Prime Minister Zhang.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,160
You'll be in charge of

113
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,080
those scholar's safety.

114
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:05,560
If anything happens from now on,

115
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,160
you'll be held accountable.

116
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,520
Yes, Your Majesty.

117
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,440
Empress Dowager, please rest assured.

118
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
I swear I will keep those scholars safe

119
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,360
even at the cost of my life.

120
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:28,296
Great Chief.

121
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,120
Great Chief.

122
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:35,240
Thank you for your help today.

123
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:36,560
I was merely doing my job

124
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
without any bias.

125
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,240
You don't have to thank me.

126
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,856
Prime Minister Zhang.

127
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,880
Why bother thanking him?

128
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,680
He was simply trying

129
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
to impress

130
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,400
the Empress Dowager.

131
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,040
You're much better at

132
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:58,520
keeping a low profile.

133
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,400
But those who keep lurking in the dark

134
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,240
may get themselves into trouble.

135
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,640
Cheers!

136
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,160
Liuniang must pay for this meal.

137
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,520
You know, you didn't see it.

138
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,360
Earlier today, when Director Wu

139
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,320
heard that Liuniang obtained the right

140
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,600
to investigate the case of Chen Huo'e,

141
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,320
his face

142
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,760
turned redder than a pig's liver.

143
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,200
And you know what?

144
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,560
He told us to sever our ties

145
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
with Liuniang.

146
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,120
He may be my superior,

147
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,200
but can he dictate who I drink with?

148
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,280
Liuniang.

149
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:56,560
If you need any inspectors on this case,

150
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,640
come to me anytime. Come on.

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,840
I toast to you.

152
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,720
And me.

153
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,520
And me.

154
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Come on, cheers.

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,168
Cheers.

156
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,200
Right, Liuniang, I want to ask something.

157
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,800
Do you know how to

158
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,840
remove birthmarks?

159
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,680
Birthmarks?

160
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,280
Since when do you have a birthmark?

161
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:30,760
I-I have a friend

162
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,200
who asked me about

163
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,799
how to remove a birthmark.

164
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,080
I read many medical books

165
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,280
but found nothing.

166
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,919
That's why I'm asking you.

167
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,520
People are born with birthmarks.

168
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,960
It's not a disease.

169
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:47,160
So it's hard to remove them with herbs.

170
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,560
I did hear from some friends

171
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,800
about a method to remove birthmarks.

172
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:53,880
What is it, Marshal Xu?

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,400
It sounds a bit bizarre.

174
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,200
Rub the birthmark repeatedly

175
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,960
with a ring made of pure gold.

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, that's simple.

177
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,800
I have plenty of gold.

178
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,480
- Thank you, Marshal Xu.
- No problem.

179
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:12,600
Waiter.

180
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,200
No one's around. I'll go.

181
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
Waiter, a pot of wine, please.

182
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,600
Has Chuichui made any friends

183
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,040
with birthmarks these days?

184
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,560
Liuniang.

185
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,800
Liuniang, listen.

186
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,040
There are some drunkards over there.

187
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,120
One of them doesn't look too bad

188
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,520
and he's looked for you
at the Ministry of Justice.

189
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,040
Me?

190
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,560
That's him.

191
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,280
That one.

192
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,120
The one in the middle.

193
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:47,840
Pan.

194
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:50,120
Pan.

195
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,200
Mr. Pan.

196
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,080
The examination is coming soon.

197
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,080
Didn't you want to

198
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
win glory for scholars like you?

199
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,440
Why aren't you preparing for the exam

200
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,240
and drowning yourself in sorrow here?

201
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,560
Family backgrounds don't matter?

202
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:08,880
Clearly, it matters more
than anything in the world.

203
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,440
Weapons of Prince Xian's guards.

204
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,400
Prince Xian sent three groups of people

205
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,520
to deal with us humble scholars.

206
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,680
This is just the beginning.

207
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
This examination

208
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,360
isn't as simple as you think.

209
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,960
A word of advice to you guys.

210
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,640
Don't cling on to someone for easy success.

211
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,680
Xiang'an is a dangerous pond

212
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,280
of muddy water.

213
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:38,200
Xiang'an ended up like a muddy pond

214
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:40,160
because of you people who seek power

215
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,000
by sinister means.

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,600
What's wrong with seeking power?

217
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,960
There's nothing wrong with power,

218
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,520
but the way it's used.

219
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,480
With power,

220
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,200
people can protect those they wish to protect

221
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,720
and do what they believe is right.

222
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:08,960
Those who are nothing

223
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:11,280
but self-righteous

224
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:14,520
can't achieve anything apart from

225
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:17,040
winning a few quarrels.

226
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,920
Save your energy

227
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,120
for something meaningful.

228
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Better to drink.

229
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,520
Better to drink.

230
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:02,440
Take them to the Ghost Market.

231
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,520
Thank you.

232
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,880
Clerk Yan.

233
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,160
Enjoy life to the fullest.

234
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,320
Keep drinking.

235
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,680
Keep drinking.

236
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:11,528
Be careful.

237
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,120
The exam is coming up soon.

238
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:21,360
Why is he drowning himself in sorrow?

239
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,960
Don't you know?

240
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,200
Three gangs of villains

241
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,040
attempted to kill those scholars.

242
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,200
For real?

243
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,280
Yeah.

244
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,880
What happened in the end?

245
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,480
Didn't Great Chief Shen tell you?

246
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,960
He turned the tide alone

247
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,000
and saved them all.

248
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,760
Otherwise, it'd have been a disaster.

249
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,000
Shen Du saved them?

250
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:55,120
[Chi]

251
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,720
Send this letter
to the Ministry of Justice. Thanks.

252
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:08,840
[Chang'an City]

253
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,200
Madam Official.

254
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,240
I am looking for

255
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,240
Clerk Yan of the Ministry of Justice.

256
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,240
She's not in. She must be
working on a case with the White Ghost.

257
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,480
White Ghost?

258
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,480
Great Chief Shen Du of the Imperial Guards?

259
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:26,560
He is Liuniang's husband.

260
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,040
Husband?

261
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,480
I heard that Mrs. Shen

262
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,800
got beaten again today.

263
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,960
She came out limping.

264
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,760
Yeah, her forehead

265
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,960
was so swollen.

266
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,120
Look at her husband.

267
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:39,280
What do you expect?

268
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,440
Liuniang.

269
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
[Shen Mansion]
We have been pen pals for ages.

270
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,680
You got married,

271
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,240
so I shouldn't disrupt you.

272
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,120
But how can I sit back and do nothing

273
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,360
while you're married
to that notorious White Ghost?

274
00:14:12,128 --> 00:14:13,200
Madam.

275
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,320
- Mr. Shen.
- Madam.

276
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,360
What happened?

277
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:17,920
Great Chief has been

278
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,800
practicing fists since he came home

279
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:22,800
and hasn't had dinner.

280
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,040
Madam, you're finally home.

281
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,040
Please go to the backyard.

282
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,960
The Great Chief has been waiting

283
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,360
to have snacks with you every day.

284
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,840
But you were either working

285
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:35,280
or drinking with a bunch of random people.

286
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,400
He has waited for you

287
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,280
for hours again today, so…

288
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:46,680
He's waiting for me?

289
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:50,080
I thought he'd be busy with work.

290
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,384
Serve the dishes.

291
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,832
Impressive.

292
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,760
Someone's finally home.

293
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:24,360
Me?

294
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,840
I went to work with the Imperial Guards,

295
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,640
inspected Chen Shoujie's mansion,

296
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,800
drank with Chuichui

297
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,680
and Mr. Xu,

298
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,240
and ran into the merchant Pan.

299
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:40,680
That's why I'm home late.

300
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:45,480
Do you need something from me?

301
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,800
I'm hungry.

302
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,240
Why didn't you eat?

303
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,200
Right, I've come back to tell you that

304
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,520
I promised my mother to visit her tonight.

305
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:02,320
Enjoy your dinner. See you around.

306
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
You…

307
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:07,480
Dinner is ready.

308
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,720
What for?

309
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,320
I've done so much for this family.

310
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:14,760
Mr. Zhong, do your things.

311
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,120
I'll take the Great Chief there.

312
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,680
Great Chief.

313
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,120
Madam is not some illiterate peasant.

314
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,720
She works for the Ministry of Justice

315
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,880
as a clerk.

316
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,560
She solves cases all day long.

317
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,280
She can have a drink with her colleagues.

318
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:31,040
You're somewhat making a fuss about it.

319
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm just trying to say that

320
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,680
you should take this opportunity…

321
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,640
Mother, I really can't drink anymore.

322
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,359
This is the best tonic

323
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,560
I picked for you

324
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:17,839
and just for you.

325
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,000
What a pity that my son-in-law didn't come.

326
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,119
Otherwise, he can have some, too.

327
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,920
Then you'll have children soon.

328
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,839
Mother, what are you talking about?

329
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,680
It doesn't have something weird, right?

330
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
No, no.

331
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
I wish there was something.

332
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,680
Too bad I don't have the magic

333
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,960
Chen Huo'e possesses.

334
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,360
Otherwise, I would get you

335
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,240
some magic pills that bring people

336
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,040
back to life.

337
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,960
Mother, what did you say?

338
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:44,200
How do you know about Chen Huo'e?

339
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,760
Are you kidding?

340
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,040
Throughout Xiang'an,

341
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,760
can you find someone who doesn't know her?

342
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,240
Five years ago,

343
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,400
she killed herself in the street.

344
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,920
But now, she has

345
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,560
come back to life.

346
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,080
She fought her way back,

347
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,160
passing all the monsters and demons,

348
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
from the underworld.

349
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,920
She has

350
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:05,960
extraordinary power.

351
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,880
Mother, where did you hear

352
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,400
all that nonsense?

353
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,800
I heard it from

354
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,040
Madam.

355
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,240
Even if you don't believe me,

356
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,480
don't you believe Madam?

357
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,160
All the nobles of Xiang'an are saying

358
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,280
that this woman

359
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,160
has the power
to brave the gates of the underworld.

360
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,280
Even the soul collectors

361
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,000
can't do anything to her.

362
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,160
Mother, you smell so good.

363
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,720
What rouge did you use today?

364
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,600
Want to know?

365
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Want some?

366
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:48,400
Drink some more.

367
00:18:58,040 --> 00:18:59,080
Liuniang.

368
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:00,800
Thanks to you,

369
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,960
Caiwei managed to return safely.

370
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,280
You rarely come home.

371
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,640
Master asked the kitchen

372
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:09,200
to prepare snacks for you.

373
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,760
Dig in.

374
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Dig in.

375
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:13,880
Liuniang.

376
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,800
There are rumors about you

377
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,600
and the Great Chief.

378
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,280
If you ever feel mistreated,

379
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,840
you must tell us.

380
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,880
That's right.

381
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,360
The Great Chief has arrived.

382
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,320
Who is he arresting again?

383
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,040
This way, please.

384
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,360
Hurry.

385
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,720
Hide in the back room.

386
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,040
Hurry.

387
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,880
Stop acting like he's a demon.

388
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,760
The Great Chief doesn't bite.

389
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:38,840
Mojie.

390
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:41,240
After you were arrested by the White Ghost,

391
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,960
you came home totally changed.

392
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,480
And you're even defending him?

393
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,480
Of course.

394
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,040
I am…

395
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:52,360
I am… It's a secret.

396
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,736
Great Chief.

397
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,440
I've come at the right moment,

398
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,080
just in time to enjoy

399
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,480
some late-night snacks

400
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,840
with my wife and in-laws.

401
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:34,480
That's right.

402
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,000
Why did you come today?

403
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,600
Great Chief, please take a seat.

404
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,680
While you're away,

405
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:56,120
food tastes bland to me.

406
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,160
- Here.
- Thank you, Great Chief.

407
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,240
Thank you, Great Chief.

408
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,968
Honey.

409
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:40,424
Here.

410
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,040
Thank you.

411
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,240
That's enough.

412
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,256
Here.

413
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,680
Enjoy, honey.

414
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,440
These are not as good as your cooking.

415
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:49,280
But at least, you grew up to this taste.

416
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,800
What are you waiting for?

417
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,000
Sit down and eat.

418
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:59,752
Okay.

419
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,760
I want to chat with

420
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:07,400
my sister a bit more.

421
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,760
How about

422
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,960
you go home first?

423
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,880
Alright then.

424
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,480
Take your time. I will wait for you.

425
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,232
No rush.

426
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Shen Du, what do you want?

427
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,400
Great Chief.

428
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,520
I've been providing you

429
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,960
with tips in time, right?

430
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:48,280
The moment I noticed

431
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:50,280
how impudent those scholars were,

432
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:54,160
I knew Prime Minister Zhang
would go after them.

433
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:56,720
No wonder you're Liuniang's brother.

434
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,320
You're truly clever.

435
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:03,400
T-Thank you for your recognition.

436
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,480
Once I pass this examination,

437
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,280
I'll count on you to promote me--

438
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:14,160
Great Chief, my son is talking nonsense.

439
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,800
Please don't take offense.

440
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,360
Please don't.

441
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,440
So he did save those scholars.

442
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,680
Great Chief, please come in.

443
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,160
Since you're free,

444
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,000
I'd like to show you

445
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,160
my paintings over the years.

446
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,080
You're known as an expert
in calligraphy and paintings.

447
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,600
What an honor

448
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,880
to admire your work.

449
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,560
I didn't expect that

450
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,680
you'd collect so many artworks.

451
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:09,560
Isn't the original copy

452
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,920
of this calligraphy work in the palace?

453
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:18,360
What discerning eyes you have, Great Chief.

454
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,880
The original of this work

455
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,240
is in the palace, of course.

456
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:24,840
It's merely my imitation work.

457
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:27,040
To be honest,

458
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,160
all the works of masters in this room

459
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:32,680
are but imitations completed by me.

460
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,840
They look so authentic.

461
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,720
I didn't expect that

462
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,520
you could capture the essence

463
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,760
of all the calligraphy styles.

464
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,920
Great Chief, you flatter me.

465
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:50,640
I have no other talent.

466
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:53,200
And I barely come out on top

467
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:56,680
in terms of artwork imitation.

468
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,360
Madam said that you're showing our son-in…

469
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,440
our Great Chief

470
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,840
the artworks of yours.

471
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,680
It reminded me that you have once imitated

472
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,120
Elder Shen's manuscript.

473
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:13,160
So I found them for you.

474
00:26:14,176 --> 00:26:16,232
[Old age is creeping up on us,
yet a good reputation may not be established.]

475
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,416
My father?

476
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,240
Please forgive me.

477
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,400
I bear…

478
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,960
I bear no other intentions.

479
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,960
It's just…

480
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:55,192
[Old age is creeping up on us,
yet a good reputation may not be established.]

481
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,216
It's fine.

482
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:04,240
My father was a convict.

483
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:08,040
No one would wish to associate with him.

484
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:18,390
[Magnolia's dropped dew as morning drink;
Chrysanthemum's fallen petals as evening meal]

485
00:27:21,525 --> 00:27:25,736
[Magnolia's dropped dew as morning drink;
Chrysanthemum's fallen petals as evening meal]

486
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,000
Actually, I have

487
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,880
studied your father's calligraphy

488
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,080
wholeheartedly back then.

489
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,040
When Elder Shen was young,

490
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,600
his handwriting

491
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,360
was as sharp as a sword.

492
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,680
But later on,

493
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,280
his strokes became reserved,

494
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,880
smooth, and round.

495
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,600
It took me a lot of practice

496
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,600
to achieve

497
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,720
identical handwriting.

498
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,603
[The sun and moon hastily rise without delay;
Spring and Autumn pass in sequence]

499
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,368
Could it be…

500
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:25,800
I haven't seen something so similar

501
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,400
to my father's handwriting.

502
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:31,440
I was lost in thought. My apologies.

503
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,560
Not at all.

504
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:38,160
I have work to attend to.
I will take my leave now.

505
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,880
Alright.

506
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,480
You are really busy.

507
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:43,480
Please stay.

508
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,760
Great Chief, take care.

509
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,120
Look at you!

510
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Prime Minister Zhang said

511
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,080
that Shen Du freed himself by confessing

512
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,200
on behalf of his father.

513
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,320
Why did you have to

514
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:04,320
bring it up?

515
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,640
How would I know?

516
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,480
Father, you write so well.

517
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:28,480
May I have this?

518
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,240
Ever since my arm

519
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,640
got injured some years ago,

520
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,040
my strokes have lost strength.

521
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,400
I'll give you a fan

522
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:39,040
I've written before that.

523
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
Smooth and rounded.

524
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,200
Sharp like a sword.

525
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,280
Indeed, the fonts are different.

526
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,080
Could it be Liuniang's father

527
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:11,160
who forged the letter to frame my father?

528
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,680
Why hasn't he come yet?

529
00:30:48,777 --> 00:30:54,580
[Tomb of Beloved Wife Wang Ruohan]

530
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:00,680
Mr. Mask.

531
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,800
Mr. Mask.

532
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,000
You finally came.

533
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,520
You're visiting your mother again?

534
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:08,160
I'm waiting for you.

535
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,632
For me?

536
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,792
It's for you.

537
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,480
This is…

538
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,480
I learned about

539
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,120
a folk remedy that can remove birthmarks.

540
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,280
It is said that

541
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:28,040
you can remove birthmarks

542
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,760
by rubbing them with this.

543
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,616
Give it a try.

544
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,200
You came just to give me this?

545
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,920
What if I didn't come today?

546
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,360
Then I'd come again tomorrow.

547
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,880
Anyway, my mother would be thrilled

548
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,080
to have me here.

549
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,816
Let me show you.

550
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,424
Give me your hand.

551
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,680
Like this.

552
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:16,040
Rub it back and forth on the birthmark.

553
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,400
Not too lightly

554
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,600
or too harshly.

555
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,664
Got it?

556
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:06,840
Here you go. Take it.

557
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,200
Anyway, you must keep doing it.

558
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,240
Or it won't work.

559
00:33:24,040 --> 00:33:26,240
We barely know each other.

560
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,840
Why are you

561
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,960
giving me something so valuable?

562
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,400
It's not valuable.

563
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
I, Lu Chuichui,

564
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,040
can have all the gold I want.

565
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:42,120
As long as you can remove your birthmark

566
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,240
and then

567
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,800
take off the mask

568
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,280
to face the world

569
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,160
with your true look,

570
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:51,240
it's more valuable than gold.

571
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,992
Thank you.

572
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,800
I've been wronged, my lord.

573
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,920
I've been wronged.

574
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,120
Please do me justice.

575
00:34:51,239 --> 00:34:53,960
Someone's asking me to do her justice.

576
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,520
That's the first time.

577
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,800
How were you wronged?

578
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,680
Many people

579
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,440
[Yun Que]
at the Jinxiu Workshop died bearing injustice.

580
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:03,760
I beg you to look into it.

581
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,120
Boring.

582
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:06,200
Get lost.

583
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,840
Great Chief, people call you the White Ghost,

584
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,480
because you catch culprits

585
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,640
and never leave someone wrongly accused.

586
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:15,080
If you don't agree to exonerate the innocent,

587
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,800
I shall take my life here.

588
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,160
Madwoman.

589
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,480
Probably an assassin.

590
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,040
My lord, please vindicate the wrongly accused.

591
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,672
Stop.

592
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,440
Vice Minister Lai.

593
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,880
What did she do to get herself

594
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,320
executed on the street?

595
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,080
This is the Zhuque Street in Xiang'an,

596
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,200
the capital city.

597
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:39,680
The people are watching.

598
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,720
Surely you don't want to kill an innocent.

599
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:44,480
I'm merely executing an assassin.

600
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,240
Do you have to intervene, Great Chief Shen?

601
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,720
Great Chief?

602
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,000
So you are Great Chief Shen, the White Ghost.

603
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,000
I am not an assassin. I was wronged.

604
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,440
Please do me justice and retry

605
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:57,000
the case of the Jinxiu Workshop.

606
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,600
Vice Minister Lai, since this woman
has been asking to see me,

607
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,120
I'll take her with me.

608
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,120
Since you've asked for her,

609
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,760
feel free to take her away.

610
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,920
Great Chief.

611
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:17,960
I've heard so much how righteous

612
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,280
and incorruptible you are.

613
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,440
My family in Jiangnan

614
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,680
provides silk materials
for the Jinxiu Workshop.

615
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:25,960
Here is the order they've placed.

616
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,080
The Eldest Princess's husband
ordered purple chrysanthemums

617
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,480
which was against the regulation.

618
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,760
But the paper used for the order

619
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,080
was thinner than usual.

620
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,280
If we can prove that

621
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:37,360
this order was tampered with,

622
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,320
we can overturn the ruling, can't we?

623
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,640
I'll keep this.

624
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:43,880
Go home first.

625
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,160
The Imperial Guards

626
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,560
will contact your parents if needed.

627
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,480
But the owners of the workshop
were good people.

628
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:49,720
They must have been wronged.

629
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:53,680
Jing Lin, escort her out of the city.

630
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:18,920
Help!

631
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,320
Hurry, go after the villain.

632
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,400
Don't let him get away.

633
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:43,120
He's gone.

634
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,120
Miss, are you alright?

635
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,600
Don't worry about me. Catch that villain.

636
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:49,400
I bet he's related to the case.

637
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,080
Or he wouldn't come to kill me.

638
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:05,760
Mr. Xu.

639
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,904
Liuniang.

640
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,240
Great Chief.

641
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,440
Miss Yun Que was attacked
at the inn last night.

642
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,160
Thankfully, I happened to pass by

643
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,440
on patrol and saved her.

644
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,760
Is this how you watch over your witnesses?

645
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,400
I sent her out of the city yesterday.

646
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Why did she sneak back by herself?

647
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,920
Great Chief, I thought
I wouldn't be able to see you again.

648
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,160
The assassin must have been
trying to silence me.

649
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:36,640
Great Chief.

650
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,440
You took my evidence,

651
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,080
so you must take responsibility.

652
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,400
That order is the key evidence

653
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,560
that could

654
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,640
overturn the ruling.

655
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:45,160
I am a key witness.

656
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:47,880
You can't neglect me.

657
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,880
I told you yesterday

658
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,920
that we can't

659
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,560
overturn the case with an order

660
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,080
from six years ago.

661
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,240
You caused a commotion on the streets,

662
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,400
telling the whole world

663
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,320
that you are involved in this case.

664
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:02,520
Do you find it exciting and fun?

665
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:03,880
Do you not know

666
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,560
that this case is complicated?

667
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,200
An assassin came last night.

668
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,320
Tomorrow, he could

669
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,040
go after your entire family.

670
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:18,520
You're putting your family in danger
just because you're passionate

671
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:21,040
about re-opening the case.

672
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,760
I didn't think that much.

673
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,160
I apologize.

674
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Anyway,

675
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:30,240
we will reinforce the defense to keep you safe.

676
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,560
And I will send someone

677
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,920
to look after your parents.

678
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,840
We will work on the case.

679
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:40,360
Before the truth comes out,

680
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,480
do not act rashly again.

681
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,200
Thank you, Great Chief.
I knew you wouldn't neglect me.

682
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,800
You have the order placed by the workshop.

683
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,840
What do you have to do

684
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:02,880
with the workshop?

685
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,760
Didn't you hear what I just said?

686
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,080
I am just curious.

687
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
Who are you?

688
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,360
The evidence is for the Great Chief.

689
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,960
Why should I tell you?

690
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,560
Show respect to the Great Chief's wife.

691
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:25,680
Great Chief, you… you got married?

692
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,120
Isn't it said that all those

693
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:30,160
who wish to marry you

694
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,560
would die a sudden death?

695
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,920
How did it happen?

696
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,400
I always thought that

697
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,080
fate was leading you to wait for me.

698
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:43,160
So all these years,

699
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,560
I have been studying

700
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:46,360
how to manage household affairs,

701
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:48,200
how to be a proper Madam,

702
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,600
how to cook, keep accounts, and make the bed.

703
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,960
I even have dreams about marrying you.

704
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:07,200
You… you must be crazy.

705
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:09,120
Madam, it has nothing to do with us.

706
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,720
T-This woman

707
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,440
cried injustice on the street.

708
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,160
So the Great Chief had her arrested.

709
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
What is there for me to misunderstand?

710
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,600
Most of the women

711
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,320
in Xiang'an, if not all,
admire the Great Chief.

712
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,520
It's normal.

713
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,520
Besides, we are…

714
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,360
If you take a liking to someone,

715
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,520
it might be good.

716
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,440
So you've made up your mind.

717
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,688
So what

718
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,520
are your plans?

719
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,440
I only found a piece of fabric

720
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,080
from the Jinxiu Workshop
at Chen Shoujie's mansion.

721
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,880
I need to confirm

722
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,840
which year it was from.

723
00:41:58,840 --> 00:41:59,920
Indifferent.

724
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,472
Very good.

725
00:42:16,663 --> 00:42:20,481
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

726
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:24,158
♫ Upon meeting again,
I know you're the one for me ♫

00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:01,887
♫ I break through obstacles
with unmatched resilience ♫

751
00:44:01,887 --> 00:44:04,767
♫ Because you are my responsibility ♫

752
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:09,055
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

753
00:44:09,055 --> 00:44:12,831
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

754
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:14,401
♫ Your palm lines ♫

755
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:17,151
♫ Your gaze ♫

756
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:20,063
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

757
00:44:20,063 --> 00:44:24,063
♫ With deep affection, you are the one for me ♫

758
00:44:24,063 --> 00:44:28,216
♫ I share the autumn moon
and spring breeze only with you ♫

759
00:44:28,216 --> 00:44:29,920
♫ Your palm lines ♫

760
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,471
♫ Your gaze ♫

761
00:44:32,471 --> 00:44:35,244
♫ Our love is deepening ♫

762
00:44:35,244 --> 00:44:39,986
♫ You are the one for me ♫
