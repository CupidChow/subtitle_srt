00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,480
Stop.

16
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,360
Great Chief, Madam has told us

17
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,560
to extinguish all the lanterns when we arrive.

18
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,880
Well…

19
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,160
Extinguish them.

20
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,976
Extinguish them.

21
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,720
Great Chief.

22
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:06,800
Mind the steps.

23
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,160
Great Chief.

24
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,880
Clerk Yan brought a strange man

25
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,280
to my bedroom

26
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,120
and told us to wait here.

27
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,200
Mr. Han.

28
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,280
Where have you been hiding all this time?

29
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:31,120
Why are you leaving so soon?

30
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,384
Han Shiyuan?

31
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Shiyuan has run away.

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,320
Are you sure this man is Han Shiyuan?

33
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,360
It's him. That's how he ran away that day.

34
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,440
He was wearing exactly the same clothes.

35
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,560
Yes.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,560
Exactly the same.

37
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,240
That day, you were startled
by the bright light from Ming Hall,

38
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,440
and it was bright in the east
and dark in the west.

39
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,520
He ran west.

40
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:56,920
That day, you didn't actually

41
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,520
see his face clearly.

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
It's not him.

43
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,760
But it's clearly him just now.

44
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,360
It was him that day too.

45
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,520
That wasn't him in the room.

46
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,160
And it wasn't him that day either,

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,040
but his shadow.

48
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,400
On that day,

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,800
Lan Guizhou forged
Han Shiyuan was still in the house

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,320
through the shadow.

51
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,600
Then he disguised himself as Han Shiyuan

52
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,160
and went west.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:21,680
Just happened the Ming Hall
on the east side catching fire,

54
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
creating a huge blaze of light,

55
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,920
which diverted the attention.

56
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,160
So that made the eyewitness scholar mistakenly

57
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:30,440
thought he was Han Shiyuan.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,800
You're just making assumptions.

59
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,080
On the seventh day of May,
Shiyuan was clearly in the house

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,600
and went west.

61
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,000
The problem is

62
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,200
that neither you

63
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,200
nor this scholar
who witnessed it outside the house

64
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,200
said

65
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,920
that only Han Shiyuan left alone.

66
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,760
You're inside the house,
and there's a light in it.

67
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,280
In a situation
where it's bright inside and dark outside,

68
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
how did you see Han Shiyuan heading west?

69
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,520
Clerk Yan is right.

70
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
The light is on in the house.

71
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,600
Indeed, we can't see the outside.

72
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,920
As for why to forge

73
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,400
Han Shiyuan was still in the Hongwen School

74
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,280
on the night of the seventh night of May.

75
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,400
Then we have to ask

76
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
his good roommate about it.

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,128
Take him away.

78
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
Everyone, dismissed.

79
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,800
Pan, thank you so much for today.

80
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,800
It's no big deal, not worth mentioning.

81
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,280
Who exactly is this Pan?

82
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,320
Madam is all smiles with him.

83
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,680
They seem to be old acquaintances.

84
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,760
Clerk Yan.

85
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,960
I have things to do to today.

86
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,120
So I have to go now.

87
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,600
You're leaving?

88
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,720
I haven't even had the chance

89
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
to properly thank you.

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
Fate will bring us together.

91
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
If you need my help,

92
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,720
come find me at the Ghost Market anytime.

93
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,344
Deal.

94
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,480
- Really?
- Yes.

95
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,840
Madam has never been
so cheerful in the mansion.

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,680
Today, thanks to Pan,

97
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,240
so the case can be solved smoothly.

98
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,040
Aren't you taking me to the Imperial Guards?

99
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,600
What about the interrogation?

100
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,680
Figure it out yourself.

101
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,680
What's wrong with him?

102
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Great Chief, I found

103
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,120
that Pan is named Pan Chi,

104
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,560
who has solved several
doubtful cases in Jiangnan.

105
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,800
Great Chief.

106
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,840
Shall we start the interrogation now?

107
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,080
Interrogate me if you want to ask.

108
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:13,680
Shut up.

109
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,488
Madam.

110
00:06:21,504 --> 00:06:22,920
How's the interrogation going?

111
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,840
Madam, you're finally here.
We've been waiting for you.

112
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,720
You should have been here long ago.

113
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,160
Let's start the interrogation.

114
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,400
You thought that Han Shiyuan

115
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,640
would not appear again after eloping,

116
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:46,120
so you forged his presence

117
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,920
and framed him for murder.

118
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:59,080
Yes.

119
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:01,384
Indeed.

120
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,520
Shiyuan told me

121
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,880
he eloped with his lover
on the night of the sixth day.

122
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,240
I didn't want to frame Shiyuan.

123
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,800
I knew he's going to leave,

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,920
so I just wanted to borrow his name.

125
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,400
But I don't think
that's your motive for murder.

126
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,280
You kept mentioning Han Shiyuan,

127
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,000
yet don't mention a single word
about the scholar you killed.

128
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,760
You still haven't told me

129
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,160
why you killed him.

130
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,240
He…

131
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,880
What is there to mention him?

132
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,440
He has ruined my poetry collection.

133
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,960
Didn't he deserve to die?

134
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,440
He's ruined your poetry collection,

135
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,000
so you killed him?

136
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,680
That poetry collection matters much to me.

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,000
Shiyuan

138
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,400
was my only friend.

[Han Shiyuan]

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,840
Ever since Shiyuan

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,760
dated Yan Sanniang,

142
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,680
I've stayed up for many nights

143
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,160
to copy that poetry collection.

144
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,784
it was a gift I gave to Shiyuan.

145
00:08:10,784 --> 00:08:12,120
My poetry collection!

146
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,880
It's just a copied poetry collection.

147
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:16,000
Do you think you are Pan Yanzhi?

148
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,480
Do you think anyone

149
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,680
would love this poetry collection?

150
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,160
Just some waste paper.

151
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,520
My poetry collection!

152
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,440
How dare he destroyed it

153
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,160
and mocked me!

154
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,080
You killed him

155
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,000
and intentionally framed Han Shiyuan.

156
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,680
Actually,

157
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,680
you were hoping for him

158
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,840
to return upon hearing the news.

159
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,120
After Han Shiyuan returned to Xiang'an,

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,200
he has disappeared.

161
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,560
Have you seen him?

162
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,880
Where have you hidden Han Shiyuan?

163
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,200
An abandoned liquor store

164
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:33,600
in the West Market.

165
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,080
I didn't expect this Lan Guizhou

166
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,120
would kill animals

167
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,280
in here.

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,080
He's so twisted inside.

169
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,920
No wonder he would kill someone

170
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,480
because of a poetry collection.

171
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
Han Shiyuan

172
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,600
got taken away first again.

173
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:09,560
It's the signal from the Imperial Guards,
in the direction of the Furong Garden.

175
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,920
Can't you just let me

176
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,400
sit properly on the horse?

Help me up.

182

You are stubborn.

183

00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,040
It's weird.

190
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,880
Don't act rashly.

191
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,200
You can disregard human lives,

192
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,800
but I can't.

193
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,520
If you don't save them, I will.

194
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,120
Don't go over there.

195
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,352
Be careful.

196
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,096
It's cold flame.

197
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,656
It's coming.

198
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,160
[Chen Huo'e]
Like a moth to a flame.

199
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,200
Live at dawn, die at dusk.

200
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,680
Not entering samsara,

201
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,400
undying.

202
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,840
Fools in the world.

203
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,400
I, Chen Huo'e,

204
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,040
am back.

205
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,040
Chen Huo'e.

206
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,720
The serial killer from five years ago.

207
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,240
Didn't she

208
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,200
commit suicide in public five years ago?

209
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,080
The dead cannot be brought back to life.

210
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:29,440
I'm sure this is just

211
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:32,160
some deceitful trick.

212
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,080
I didn't expect you can
remain so calm and composed

213
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,320
facing my nirvana setup.

214
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,560
White Ghost, you are really amazing.

215
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,040
What a pity.

216
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,200
Even if you are the soul-reaper,

217
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
cannot stop me

218
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,240
from rebirth in the nirvana.

219
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,760
Then I shall capture you

220
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,000
and get you back to hell.

221
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,112
Caiwei.

222
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:19,656
Caiwei.

223
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,680
Mr. Han.

224
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,120
Caiwei.

225
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:25,400
Liuniang,

226
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:26,840
Great Chief.

227
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:29,120
Manager Yang, you are here.

228
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,240
Then it seems tonight,

229
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,360
it's Princess Yong'an who's intervening.

230
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,640
But the Imperial Personal Guards who work

231
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,440
for the Empress Dowager are here too.

232
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,800
It makes me somewhat confused.

233
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,720
Well, Princess of Valor

234
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,400
only asked me to save Mr. Han.

235
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:56,440
I don't know anything else.

236
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,080
Great Chief, Manager Yang.

237
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,760
I was in a hurry to save people.

238
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,880
I hope I didn't bother you.

239
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:12,240
I wonder who can mobilize
the Imperial Personal Guards,

240
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,120
so turns out to be a favorite
by the Empress Dowager.

241
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,704
Mr. Zhang.

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,280
Shiyuan.

243
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,520
You…

244
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,160
What happened?

245
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,720
Are you injured? Are you alright?

246
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:35,840
Alright, as long as you're not injured.

247
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,120
Remember.

248
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,480
Be careful in the future.

249
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:46,280
Do not let yourself fall into such a situation.

250
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,680
Great Chief Shen.

251
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,720
Weird things happened today.

252
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,280
I'm glad you are here.

253
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,720
Please let people of Imperial Guards

254
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,200
take greater care of this matter

255
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,359
and catch the person behind the scenes,

256
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,440
to prevent future troubles.

257
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:15,599
I am indeed in charge of this.

258
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,160
If it were not for you two,

259
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:21,359
the murderer would have already been caught.

260
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,119
I apologize for any offense.

261
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,880
I hope you could forgive me.

262
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,360
The reappearance of Chen Huo'e
is riddled with oddities.

263
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,560
Great Chief.

264
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:36,200
Please catch the murderer.

265
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:51,440
I must return to the palace.

266
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
I take my leave.

267
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,360
Han Shiyuan.

268
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,440
Her Highness asked me
to pass on a message to you.

269
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:03,960
As long as you want it,

270
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,440
Her Highness's mind has not changed.

271
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:19,280
Han Shiyuan.

272
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,840
Do you have anything to say?

273
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,400
I know nothing.

274
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,480
About the homicide case of the Hongwen School,

275
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,800
Liuniang has already cleared your name.

276
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,840
Tonight,

277
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,000
you and Yan Caiwei are the victims.

278
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,440
If you have nothing to say,

279
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,080
then take her

280
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,440
back to the Yan Mansion to rest.

281
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,080
[Furong Garden]

282
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,360
Your third brother-in-law

283
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:57,240
has a deep connection with Princess Yong'an

284
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,400
and Zhang Baohuan.

285
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,040
It's really surprising.

286
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,200
Indeed.

287
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,840
Han Shiyuan obviously knows

288
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,680
Zhang Baohuan long ago

289
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:10,040
and also has quite a story
with Princess Yong'an.

They saved him,

291

yet he is not the slightest bit grateful

292
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,600
and wanted to pretend not to know them.

293
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,160
There must be a reason for this.

294
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,280
But Caiwei

295
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:24,280
seems to know nothing.

296
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,400
I know.

297
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,480
From beginning to end,

298
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,320
I have never thought
to embarrass your third sister.

299
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:51,920
I'm sorry I did rashly just now.

300
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:14,240
I'm going to the Ministry of Justice
to check the case files later.

301
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:19,280
Would you like to go with me?

302
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:24,640
Yes, yes.

303
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
Come on, bros.

304
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,760
Place two here.

305
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:58,960
Then place another two here.

306
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:01,120
At the entrance, place two by the door.

307
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,160
Make sure the lanterns are all aligned

308
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,240
to light the room up.

309
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,744
Retreat.

310
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,160
You're exaggerating it.

311
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,360
So many lanterns.

312
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,880
The candles cost money.

314

315
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:45,720
Five years ago,

316
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,080
the villainous woman Chen Huo'e
committed crimes in many places,

317
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,120
[Chen Huo'e Serial Homicides]
and consecutively killed more than fifty women.

318
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,240
And on the back of the dead women

319
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,680
was found

320
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,720
a giant moth brand

321
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,360
burned by fire.

322
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,360
For a moment, the whole country was in a panic.

Woman shut themselves

324
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,800
in the houses.

325
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,320
Finally, the villainous woman Chen Huo'e

326
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:09,920
was captured by the Imperial Inspectorate.

327
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:13,160
She was an ugly-faced woman,

328
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,200
even claiming

329
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,440
that she knew how to come back to life

330
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,840
and would be back someday.

331
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,440
At the scene of capture,

332
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,360
Chen Huo'e stabbed a sword into her heart
to kill herself.

333
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,800
Before she died,

334
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,840
she said…

335
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,560
Like a moth to a flame.

336
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,160
Live at dawn, die at dusk.

337
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,800

Mrs. Tang.

344
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,520
From the motive and modus operandi,

345
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,080
these two cases

346
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,760
have nothing in common.

347
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:25,160
But merely from the cases themselves,

348
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,840
these two cases

349
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,800
could not have been done by one person alone.

350
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,560
It was a gang committing the crimes.

351
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,400
Whether it's Mrs. Tang
burying bodies after killing

352
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,080
or Chen Huo'e's
serial homicides five years ago,

353
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,120
or,

354
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,920
tonight's

355
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,040
nirvana setup,

356
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,240
none of these could be done
by one person alone.

357
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,000
This is not a simple gang crime.

358
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
Just consider what happened tonight,

359
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,000
the things behind it are intricate and complex.

360
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,720
I'm afraid this Chen Huo'e

361
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,560
is just a scapegoat.

362
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,720
Then is tonight's Chen Huo'e

363
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,600
the same person who was captured

364
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,160
five years ago?

365
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,640
No matter what,

366
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,120
the Chen Huo'e of five years ago

367
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,080
has disappeared after committing the crimes.

368
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,240
That indicates the person behind this

369
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,800
no longer needed her.

370
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,680
Five years later, Chen Huo'e appeared again.

371
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:17,640
That indicates the person behind this

372
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:20,320
needs her again.

373
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,960
Indeed.

374
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:26,320
What exactly does he want?

375
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,040
It's so complicated.

376
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,120
A small mistake

377
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,680
could lead to a disaster.

378
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,400
Mother.

379
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,720
The night-blooming jasmine
in the backyard has bloomed,

380
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,520
so I picked a bunch for you.

381
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,280
Now you are there alone.

382
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:51,640
[Wang Ruohan]

383
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,440
Do you feel lonely?

384
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,040
How about I sing a song for you?

385
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,560
Do you remember when I was young,

386
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,640
you would a nursery rhyme

387
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,680
for me?

388
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:08,800
♪ Mind your words ♪

389
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:12,600

393
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:33,608
Who?

394
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,800
It's the first time

395
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,920
to hear someone singing
a nursery rhyme in the graveyard.

396
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,680
On a dark and windy night,

397
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,560
it's quite interesting.

398
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,240
It's you.

399
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,440
Mr. Mask, I've seen you.

400
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,840
When I come to visit my mother before,

401
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,560
I often see you around here.

402
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:07,000
Do you also have relatives
and friends buried nearby?

403
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,040
Yes.

404
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:10,640
My mother

405
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,960
is buried nearby.

406
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,280
I don't know

407
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:21,480
what other family burials are around here.

408
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:26,160
The treasure land near Xiang'an City

409
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,480
is naturally bought by noble families

410
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,040
and wealthy households

411
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,560
to be used as their ancestral tombs.

412
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,080
Lowly ones

413
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,560
can only curl up
in the corners of the graveyard,

414
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,320
seeking a place to dwell in.

415
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,880
This grave

416
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,160
cost my father

417
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:49,720
a lot of money.

418
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,760
It is indeed large and imposing.

419
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,760
But I know

420
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:54,720
my mother did not want

421
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,160
to be alone here.

422
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:58,680
And she surely hoped to make more friends.

423
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,840
So I think

424
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,120
my mother and your mother

425
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,240
must have already become
good neighbors and friends.

426
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:11,112
Good friends?

427
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,072
You…

428
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,040
are quite different.

429
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,280
Why do you wear a mask?

430
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:42,120
Is it because you're injured on the face?

431
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,760
Ever since I was born,

432
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,920
I've had an ugly birthmark on my face,

433
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,720
with a horrifying shape.

434
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,680
People who have seen my face

435
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:58,600
would be too scared to sleep.

436
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,880
Do you want to see it?

437
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,200
Wait a moment.

438
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,440
I need to prepare myself.

439
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:10,160
Wait for me to count to five, alright?

440
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,760
Five.

441
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,040
Four.

442
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,440
Three.

443
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,840
Two.

444
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,440
One.

445
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,744
Mr. Mask?

446
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,480
Leaving already?

447
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,320
Your hand hasn't applied medicine yet.

448
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:10,400
I had Mr. Shen

449
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:11,680
bring over all kinds of wound medicine

450
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:13,920
from the mansion

451
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,080
to see which one is best for treating

452
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,928
a bite.

453
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,440
Why is it so serious?

454
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,360
It's a puppy bite.

455
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,600
No bother.

456
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,800
Mr. Shen said there is a kind of red medicine,

457
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,160
which was used for treating Yaya before.

458
00:29:58,280 --> 00:29:59,600
The bite from Yaya

459
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,840
is about the same as the bite

460
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,200
from me.

461
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,960
Yes.

462
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:19,000
Previously, Yaya was bitten by a mad dog.

463
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,000
Indeed, it's about the same.

464
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:49,640
This is your way of apologizing?

465
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:54,280
What am I apologizing for?

466
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:58,720
You didn't say it clearly
and caused me to misunderstand.

467
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,720
Besides,

468
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,040
Didn't you even know

469
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:02,280
to let Jing Lin bandage the wound for you?

470
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,600
Do you have to wait for me to do it?

471
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,024
I…

472
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,880
- Let go of me!
- Go.

473
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,280
Let go of me!

474
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,960
- Let go of me!
- Go.

475
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,160
Let go of me!

476
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,000
Du.

477
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,320
Although it's to save someone,

478
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:51,080
you have to be careful too.

479
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,520
If that arrow just now

480
00:32:52,520 --> 00:32:53,800
had been an inch off target,

481
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,320
this person would surely be dead.

482
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:57,440
Father, I won't miss the target.

483
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,560
I need to leave him alive

484
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,680
for interrogation.

485
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:08,360
I am Shen Du, are you okay?

486
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,240
Are you

487
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,520
the same boy

488
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:13,920
who saved me back then?

489
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:15,560
Who?

490
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
Yan Xing.

491
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,840
Why would this happen?

492
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,560
You did this on purpose, right?

493
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,760
Of course not.

494
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,800
Sorry, I grabbed the wrong one.

496
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,040
You!

497
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,400

Come here, Liuniang.

524
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,000
Take a seat, have some tea,
and chat for a while.

525
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,360
Any new rumors about me?

526
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:33,960
No, no.

527
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,080
No rumors. Right?

528
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,520
But…

529
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,680
all of us

530
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,360
agree there's a tigress
in the Ministry of Justice.

531
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,720
And this tigress

532
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,280
is really powerful.

533
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:52,120
She dared to shout at White Ghost.

534
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,000
But later,

535
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,520
she was still

536
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:58,960
put on a horse and paraded through the streets.

537
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
As a woman,

538
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,200
she needs to

539
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,800
be gentle, kind, respectful,

540
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:11,400
and yielding.

541
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,600
Lu Chuichui.

542
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,080
You're late again.

543
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:23,880
And you have that dejected look.

544
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,400
What did you do yesterday?

545
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:27,944
Nothing.

546
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,880
What?

547
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:37,800
Feng Gui.

548
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,400
My lord.

549
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:43,960
Last night, Chen Huo'e came back to life.

550
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,920
Great Chief of the Imperial Guards

551
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,840
sent someone early in the morning
to deliver the case files.

552
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,560
Then this case…

553
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:54,640
When entering,

554
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,160
Ji Fangming who's in charge of
reviewing the case files

555
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,640
- gave this to me.
- Give it to me.

556
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,520
saying it's a case
submitted from Wannian County.

557
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,520
Wannian County's Xuanping Alley

558
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,400
had a murder.

559
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:11,000
The victim was the wife

560
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:12,720
of Chen Shoujie, an official

561
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,440
who had resigned and returned to his hometown.

562
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:17,680
Why the fuss over a dead woman?

563
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:19,120
Director Wu,

564
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,480
do you think it's only the man's life

565
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,640
that matters?

566
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,960
Doesn't

567
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,520
a woman's life matter?

568
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:30,200
What did I say?

569
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,520
After you married into the Shen Mansion,

570
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,080
and you've grown a temper.

571
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,576
Fine.

572
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,240
Forget what I said.

573
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,320
Feng Gui.

574
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,480
Arrange an inspector to investigate the case.

575
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,280
My l-l-lord.

576
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,920
The coroner's report states

577
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,280
that the victim died last night,

578
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
and that a giant moth brand

579
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,160
had appeared on her shoulder.

580
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:59,280
It's identical to the brands on the victims

581
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,200
of the Chen Huo'e murder case five years ago.

582
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,520
It's Chen Huo'e again.

583
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,360
Director Wu.

584
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:07,640
Please allow me to investigate this case.

585
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,000
Since this case is related

586
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,240
to the Chen Huo'e case,

587
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,160
it should be handled
by the Imperial Guards as well.

588
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,280
Exactly.

589
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,000
It's not proper
for the Ministry of Justice to intervene.

590
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,480
Yes. It's inappropriate.

591
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,920
Even though the Great Chief is your husband,

592
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,520
in the Shen Mansion,

593
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,520
you're just a nobody.

594
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,520
White Ghost won't take you along

595
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,800
when solving the case.

596
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,000
He won't.

597
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,520
Vice Minister is here.

598
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,120
Greetings, Vice Minister Lai.

599
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,848
Vice Minister Lai.

600
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,720
If White Ghost won't take her along,

601
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:55,960
Black Fiend

602
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:58,640
would indeed like to invite Clerk Yan

603
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,200
to assist in the case investigation together.

604
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,120
Director Wu.

605
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,240
Five years ago,

606
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,640
it's me who's responsible for investigating

607
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:09,960
the Chen Huo'e case.

608
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,920
I've known how Yan Liuniang

609
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,800
investigates the case.

610
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,640
Since you are interested in
the Chen Huo'e case,

611
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,720
why not join my Imperial Inspectorate

612
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,640
to help me capture the murderer?

613
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:40,000
Thank you very much.

614
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,040
I am a minor clerk in the Ministry of Justice,

615
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,280
hoping only to participate in
the selection of female officials

616
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:46,000
and to attain the position
of an official clerk.

617
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:48,880
I have no intention to transfer my job.

618
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:56,360
Since you refuse,

619
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:59,320
then

620
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:01,800
let's meet again another day.

621
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,920
Vice Minister Lai, take care.

622
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,632
Stop the carriage.

623
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,000
Princess of Valor, greetings.

624
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,960
Mr. Han.

625
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,480
You and I haven't seen each other in a while.

626
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:33,040
We met today,

627
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,840
yet do you still want to avoid me?

628
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:40,680
I dare not.

629
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:45,080
Mr. Han, what are you doing?

630
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,960
Stand up and reply.

631
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,440
Princess of Valor.

632
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,200
I am but a mere commoner,

633
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:58,520
afraid of bothering you.

634
00:42:05,800 --> 00:42:08,040
Mr. Han, what are you talking about?

635
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,040
About the affection,

636
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,160
it's not something we can control.

637
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,400
Now that you have someone in your heart,

638
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,040
I will certainly congratulate you.

639
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,240
Thank you for your kindness.

640
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:30,440
Let's go.

641
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,760
Your Highness.

642
00:43:16,119 --> 00:43:19,937
♫ One glance affirms the fate between us ♫

643
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:23,614
