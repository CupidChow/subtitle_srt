Tell Mom I'll come home next month.

I saw your video,
is that guy your boyfriend?

13
00:03:51,826 --> 00:03:54,497
Idiot. He's not my boyfriend.

14
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,817
We're close friends.

15
00:03:56,962 --> 00:04:00,622
He's my dance partner
whenever I compete.

16
00:04:00,647 --> 00:04:05,989
Besides, I'm supposed to find
someone rich to marry, remember?

<i>By the way, I have exams
next month.</i>

18

- I need to pay for my tuition fee, sis.
- [sighs] Fine, fine.

19
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,208
Okay, I'll send you money next week.

20
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:17,403
Okay, just give my love
to Mom. I miss you all.

- You two sisters are sweet.
- Of course. That's family for you.

How are things with
your dad, by the way?

23
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,426
I'm not going home anytime soon.
Maybe when I’m rich.

24
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:36,200
- Hmm?
- As long as we have gigs, right?

25

I'm <i>G</i> for it.

There's a parcel for you.
The sender said it was paid for.

53
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:57,315
Thanks, Zinia.

54
00:07:58,272 --> 00:08:01,526
- I wonder who sent this?
- Could be from your secret admirer.

55
00:08:02,304 --> 00:08:04,057
Secret admirer?

56
00:08:05,104 --> 00:08:07,815
- ”<i>Lovely Queen</i>”?
- Yeah.

00:08:09,387 --> 00:08:10,472
Wow...

00:08:11,602 --> 00:08:13,548
Who do you think sent it?

00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:17,979
I’m thinking about it.

60
00:08:19,948 --> 00:08:21,564
Could it be Lucas?

61
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:23,830
I don’t know...

62
00:08:36,948 --> 00:08:39,799
“<i>For my Lovely Queen</i>”.

63
00:08:42,365 --> 00:08:44,299
Lovely Queen.

64
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,127
Oh my... wow...

00:08:52,511 --> 00:08:54,619
It’s so beautiful.

00:09:02,532 --> 00:09:03,758
- L...
- Oh!

67
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,932
Zinia said you'd be here.

Hi, Lucas! Thanks for
the surprise gift.

- Huh? Hmm... Because...

These are beautiful.
I like them very much.

71

It's not even my birthday yet.

72

- But thanks anyway.
- Huh?

73
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:29,759
That’s not from me.

74
00:09:30,796 --> 00:09:32,228
This is from you, right?

75
00:09:36,283 --> 00:09:39,151
- Who sent these, then?
- I don’t know.

76
00:09:39,233 --> 00:09:45,047
- I can't afford something like that.
- You're just trying to be mysterious.

77
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,201
- I'm serious.
- Then who sent this?

78
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:51,400
I don’t know.

79
00:09:52,908 --> 00:09:58,033
Well, whoever sent it, I'll find out.

This is the first time I've received
something like this.

81
00:10:02,182 --> 00:10:05,115
- He better be ready for me.
- Um, L...

82
00:10:07,312 --> 00:10:10,049
Maybe he's the answer to my prayers.

83
00:10:10,074 --> 00:10:14,635
He wrote on the card
“<i>For my Lovely Queen</i>”.

84
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,807
He must be my “<i>Crown King</i>”.

85
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:22,260
L, I’d like to tell you something...

86
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:27,065

to take a picture of you holding it.

I'll let him lure me

it’ll just be jealousy and fights.

00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:32,922
<i>But I got busy managing my business,</i>
<i>so I stopped.</i>

178
00:23:33,349 --> 00:23:37,145
<i>Sometimes, I'm asked to be a sponsor.</i>
<i>Like at the contest where I saw you.</i>

179
00:23:37,735 --> 00:23:41,680
<i>But recently,</i>
<i>I wanted to refresh my dancing skills.</i>

180
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:46,008
<i>I'm not used to studios,</i>
<i>so I prefer private lessons.</i>

181
00:23:46,172 --> 00:23:49,907
<i>That's why thank you for agreeing</i>
<i>to teach me privately at my house.</i>

182
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:55,579
<i>I don't refuse work.</i>
<i>Besides, you seem nice.</i>

183
00:23:56,659 --> 00:23:59,922
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>Don’t worry. I'll take care of you.</i>

184
00:24:24,032 --> 00:24:25,618
Wow.

185
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,183
Do you live here with someone?

186
00:24:31,487 --> 00:24:32,655
I live alone.

187
00:24:33,493 --> 00:24:39,993
Really? It's hard to believe
you live alone in a house like this.

188
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,656
Come on.

189
00:24:42,188 --> 00:24:43,898
I have a caretaker

190
00:24:44,163 --> 00:24:49,780
who comes once a week
to clean and do laundry.

191
00:24:52,227 --> 00:24:57,319
And sometimes cook, when I ask.

192
00:24:57,542 --> 00:24:59,544
Most of the time, I'm not here,

193
00:25:00,727 --> 00:25:01,796
because I'm at work.

194
00:25:02,843 --> 00:25:04,062
I see.

195
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,647
Where's your family?

196
00:25:08,218 --> 00:25:09,218
Ah...

197
00:25:10,153 --> 00:25:13,698
Both my parents went abroad.

198
00:25:18,702 --> 00:25:20,162
I’m just an only child.

199
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:31,133
- Here, for you.
- You didn’t have to.

200
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,223
It’s gorgeous.

201
00:25:36,239 --> 00:25:39,378
Wow, it’s really beautiful.

202
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:41,380
Thank you.

203
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:17,051
Where are you?
Take care.

204
00:26:17,238 --> 00:26:18,550
Delete this message?

205
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:20,902
Deleted message

206
00:26:58,502 --> 00:27:00,723
Hi, Luc, where are you at?

207
00:27:07,394 --> 00:27:08,979
You're looking for her, aren't you?

208
00:27:10,166 --> 00:27:11,567
She's not responding.

209
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:17,927
While she's not around,
you can have this for now.

210
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,636
Have a shot.

211
00:31:29,186 --> 00:31:32,481
Just a little, okay?
I don't drink much.

212
00:31:40,377 --> 00:31:41,837
I want to know more about you.

213
00:31:42,813 --> 00:31:44,157
Tell me about yourself.

214
00:31:46,579 --> 00:31:48,385
<i>We're from Mindoro.</i>

215
00:31:49,266 --> 00:31:54,391
<i>My father passed away a long time ago,</i>
<i>he had a heart attack.</i>

216
00:31:55,083 --> 00:31:58,337
<i>My mom is already old.</i>

217
00:31:59,093 --> 00:32:03,597
<i>I studied here in Manila</i>
<i>but didn't finish.</i>

218
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,142
<i>Because I chose to
become a ballroom dancer.</i>

219
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:09,611
I fell in love with ballroom dancing.

220
00:32:09,658 --> 00:32:13,806
<i>Now, I'm a ballroom instructress</i>
<i>to earn money</i>

221
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,626
<i>and support my sibling who's studying.</i>

222
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:21,377
<i>How did you get my studio and home address?</i>

223
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:26,715
<i>When I want something, I find a way.</i>

224
00:36:31,835 --> 00:36:34,922
What's that? Take a break first.

225
00:36:35,267 --> 00:36:38,383
I just want to try it.
I might get a <i>Scatter</i>.

226
00:36:39,228 --> 00:36:43,138
- I feel lucky tonight.
- Let me see…

227
00:36:43,704 --> 00:36:47,017
Ah, <i>PlayTime</i>. It's easy to play there.

228
00:36:47,574 --> 00:36:50,118
My favorite is <i>Super Ace</i>.

229
00:36:50,267 --> 00:36:55,108
Come on, you should play too.
Go to <i>Playtime. ph </i>or in <i>GCash.</i>

230
00:36:56,694 --> 00:37:00,601
I played that before, on <i>Maya</i>.

231
00:37:00,626 --> 00:37:03,296
I cashed out right away
when I got a <i>Scatter</i>.

232
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,364
But tonight,

233
00:37:06,102 --> 00:37:11,817
- I just want to concentrate on you.
- You're all talk, you know!

234
00:37:12,085 --> 00:37:17,397
Look, there it is. Scatter!

235
00:37:17,422 --> 00:37:21,301
I told you I was feeling lucky tonight.

236
00:37:21,326 --> 00:37:23,485
Did you see? That’s a <i>Scatter</i>!

237
00:37:25,198 --> 00:37:27,534
But I'm even luckier tonight.

238
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:30,294
Enough of that.

239
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:45,971
- Zinia...
- Hi, Lucas.

240
00:37:46,201 --> 00:37:50,539
- Has she texted you yet?
- No. She doesn't have a dance class today.

241
00:37:53,112 --> 00:37:54,543
Okay, thanks.

242
00:37:56,122 --> 00:37:57,323
Where is she?

243
00:38:36,001 --> 00:38:39,796
- Hello?
- L, what happened to you?

244
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:42,174
Even at the studio,
they don't know where you are.

245
00:38:42,966 --> 00:38:46,178
- Where are you?
- I’m with my mystery gifter.

246
00:38:46,428 --> 00:38:50,849
I'm at his house for private lessons.

247
00:38:52,642 --> 00:38:57,061
<i>His house is so grand.</i>
<i>He's incredibly rich.</i>

248
00:38:57,230 --> 00:39:00,609
The offer was too good to refuse.

249
00:39:01,026 --> 00:39:03,987
- <i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>
- It was sudden.

250
00:39:04,663 --> 00:39:07,254
I'll tell you when we see each other.

251
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,557
<i>What if he has other intentions?</i>
<i>Where is that?</i>

252
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:17,125
He's nice. He's given me so many gifts.

253
00:39:17,954 --> 00:39:19,956
<i>You’re treating me like a child, Lucs.</i>

254
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:25,810
I don't know where this is.
It's a subdivision.

255
00:39:26,093 --> 00:39:28,011
Subdivision?
There are so many subdivisions.

256
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:31,496
- I'm just worried.
- Wait...

257
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:40,065
Here, I’ll send you the address.

258
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,612
There, you see it?

259
00:39:49,825 --> 00:39:53,912
Just contact me immediately
if you feel something's not right.

260
00:39:53,942 --> 00:39:56,881
- Yeah, yeah, bye.
- Okay.

261
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:02,123
[background chatter]

262
00:40:50,886 --> 00:40:53,847
That's why you and Dad separated...
because of you.

263
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,199
Dad caught you with your partner.

264
00:40:56,224 --> 00:40:59,140
You're already old, and yet
you still got involved with someone else,

265
00:40:59,165 --> 00:41:00,562
someone younger than you.

266
00:41:00,587 --> 00:41:02,820
That's why Dad died,
from the heartache you caused him

267
00:41:03,023 --> 00:41:05,533
Every dancer I've known is the same...

268
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,373
you all just play with us!

269
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,819
You slept so well,
I didn’t want to bother you.

270
00:42:27,607 --> 00:42:30,735
- Let’s eat.
- Who were you talking to earlier?

271
00:42:32,062 --> 00:42:33,105
Uh...

272
00:42:34,932 --> 00:42:36,267
What?

273
00:42:36,579 --> 00:42:39,624
It sounded like you were
arguing with someone.

274
00:42:39,649 --> 00:42:45,014
Ah, it’s nothing.
Just an employee at the office.

275
00:42:45,039 --> 00:42:46,082
Hmm...

276
00:42:56,201 --> 00:43:00,618
Another gift?
I might get used to this.

277
00:43:01,221 --> 00:43:05,204
<i>“For my Lovely Queen”. </i>Wow.

278
00:43:11,066 --> 00:43:14,904
These are gorgeous.
They must be expensive?

279
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:20,796
I want you to wear that later tonight.

280
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:27,805
Thank you.

281
00:43:40,179 --> 00:43:41,722
Aren't you cold?

282
00:43:58,573 --> 00:44:00,241
Aren't you feeling hot?

283
00:44:54,593 --> 00:44:56,218
Oh, shit.

284
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:01,383
- Oh, yes. Yeah.
- You like that, huh?

285
00:46:01,437 --> 00:46:04,648
- You like that, L?
- Yes!

286
00:46:04,824 --> 00:46:06,273
You like this, huh?

287
00:46:07,554 --> 00:46:09,609
There. Keep going.

288
00:46:09,898 --> 00:46:13,101
You like that? Huh? Like that?

289
00:46:13,126 --> 00:46:15,406
You like that?

290
00:46:22,926 --> 00:46:25,470
- You like this? Huh?
- Oh yes!

291
00:46:25,495 --> 00:46:27,817
You like it? Huh?

292
00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,146
Oh, shit!

293
00:46:46,393 --> 00:46:48,299
You like that? Hmm?

294
00:47:02,382 --> 00:47:03,466
Well?

295
00:49:14,635 --> 00:49:16,683
Allan, what are you doing?

296
00:49:18,269 --> 00:49:19,354
Allan...

297
00:49:21,922 --> 00:49:23,839
Your boyfriend called...

298
00:49:25,370 --> 00:49:27,235
Crazy for you.

299
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:34,698
I knew you would just fool me...

300
00:49:36,368 --> 00:49:40,409
Allan, let go of that.
Let go of that.

301
00:49:41,249 --> 00:49:42,458
What are you doing?

302
00:49:43,501 --> 00:49:47,505
Don't worry, I'm a good person.

303
00:49:48,464 --> 00:49:50,299
I won't use this against you.

304
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:56,225
I just want some challenge...

305
00:50:03,134 --> 00:50:06,298
There, dance with me, L.

306
00:50:08,369 --> 00:50:12,634
Dance...
Come on, move your hips more.

307
00:50:13,195 --> 00:50:14,738
Let’s keep dancing...

308
00:50:15,581 --> 00:50:16,581
Here.

309
00:50:16,846 --> 00:50:18,647
Like Mommy used to.

310
00:50:20,662 --> 00:50:22,486
She used to teach me then.

311
00:50:40,266 --> 00:50:43,061
There. See?

312
00:50:44,729 --> 00:50:46,272
You’re just going to play me, right?

313
00:50:46,606 --> 00:50:49,358
- Allan...
- Right? This is your partner, right?

314
00:50:51,068 --> 00:50:52,659
You’re playing him...

315
00:50:53,923 --> 00:50:57,143
and you’re playing me.
You’re all the same!

316
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,457
- L?
- There’s no L here.

317
00:51:05,166 --> 00:51:09,003
There’s only <i>lustful</i> here. Idiot!

318
00:51:11,406 --> 00:51:12,532
L!

319
00:51:25,353 --> 00:51:27,146
Dance...

320
00:51:28,189 --> 00:51:30,399
Let go of me, please.

321
00:51:31,901 --> 00:51:36,864
I’ll go with you anywhere.
I’ll live here with you.

322
00:51:40,660 --> 00:51:43,496
Your boyfriend won’t find you here.

323
00:51:46,958 --> 00:51:48,126
You’re just gonna stay here.

324
00:52:03,357 --> 00:52:04,358
Mommy, look...

325
00:52:06,572 --> 00:52:10,440
She’s L, a dancer just like you.

326
00:52:11,889 --> 00:52:13,236
Just like you,

327
00:52:15,111 --> 00:52:16,737
you who played Dad,

328
00:52:18,281 --> 00:52:19,824
she played with me too!

329
00:52:24,998 --> 00:52:28,251
Allan... Allan...

330
00:52:28,276 --> 00:52:33,135
Allan, not all dancers are like
what you experienced. I'm different.

331
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:36,158
- I love you, Allan.
- You love me?

332
00:52:36,619 --> 00:52:37,619
Really?

333
00:52:39,078 --> 00:52:41,361
Are you messing with me, or what?

334
00:52:51,518 --> 00:52:54,066
- L, I’m here for you.
- Lucas...

335
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:04,327
Whore!

336
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:25,473
<i>I told you, right? I always got you.</i>

337
00:53:26,155 --> 00:53:30,683
<i>Good thing you sensed</i>
<i>that something bad was happening to me.</i>

338
00:53:31,554 --> 00:53:32,847
<i>Just imagine,</i>

339
00:53:33,559 --> 00:53:37,774
<i>Allan has been wanted</i>
<i>for abducting dancers for a long time.</i>

340
00:53:38,242 --> 00:53:41,852
<i>I promise I won't get blinded again.</i>

341
00:57:40,278 --> 00:57:43,465
- I have something to ask you.
- Me too.

342
00:57:44,426 --> 00:57:47,629
- No more dancing in bed...
- With someone else...

343
00:57:48,004 --> 00:57:51,071
- It should be just me.
- It should be just us.

344
00:57:51,837 --> 00:57:54,559
- I love you.
- I love you more.
