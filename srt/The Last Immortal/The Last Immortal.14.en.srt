Yin.

31
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,740
Is the Worry-free Immortal Fruit okay?

32
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,740
It is fine.

33
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:03,150
Xian Zhu will also be fine.

34
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,830
Right now, the most important thing for you
is to rest well.

35
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,150
I will.

36
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,510
Tomorrow,
we will make a contract after all.

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:18,940
Then you better get a good night's sleep.

00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:44,760
Gu Jin and Yin will be together forever.

41
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,680
You loved it so much.

42
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,790
I want to give it to you
as a betrothal gift.

43
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:51,900
I'm thinking instead
of the master-servant contract,

44
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:56,150
we can make a marriage contract
so we can be together forever.

45
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:13,510
Tomorrow, let's have it
in Yantian Hall, shall we?

46
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,540
Yes.

47
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:29,860
(True Joy)

48
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:05,020
(The love thread
is actually so tenacious.)

49
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,220
(You've refused to return home.)

50
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,100
(I thought you had some great ability
and ambition.)

51
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,070
(Turns out, you're mingling with the immortals.)

52
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,150
(Hong Yi,)

53
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,420
(have you forgotten that your parents
were killed by immortals?)

54
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,390
(Even though my aunt's attitude was
strange and unpleasant,)

55
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,950
(I really shouldn't stay
in the Immortal Realm for long.)

56
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,950
Jiu, why did you come?

57
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,270
Yin.

58
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,270
You look so beautiful today.

59
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,310
This dress was a gift from Yun Qing.

60
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:34,020
It's made of Cloud Brocade, which is
unique to Daze Mountain.

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,980
Daze Mountain is truly wonderful,

62
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,980
with abundant spiritual energy
and ample resources.

63
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,710
I...

64
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,540
We have even more great lands
in the Demon Realm.

65
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:48,100
Besides, it's carefree and lacks the rigid rules
of the Immortal Realm.

66
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:50,870
If you come with me, stay for a while,
you'll understand.

67
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:55,830
Yin, do you want to live with me
in the Demon Realm?

68
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,960
Yin,

69
00:07:58,920 --> 00:07:59,760
does it hurt?

70
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,830
I'm fine.

71
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:07,780
Did you hear what I said just now?

72
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,400
You...

73
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:11,270
I...

74
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,410
I'm sorry.

75
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,070
I'm really in a hurry. What did you say?

76
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:19,070
I asked if you want to live with me
in the Demon Realm.

77
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,020
I can stay there for a while,
but not for long,

78
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,390
because Jin is in Daze Mountain.

79
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,510
So what if Gu Jin lives in Daze Mountain?

80
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,780
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

81
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,150
Today, I'm going to make
a marriage contract with Jin.

82
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,590
From then on,
we'll naturally live together.

83
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,020
You... You're going to make
a marriage contract with Gu Jin?

84
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:50,420
Don't worry, I will keep my promise.

85
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,660
Once I find Ningyun Mountain,
I'll still allocate a piece of land for you.

86
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:55,780
You can stay as long as you want.

87
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:57,630
Wait a moment. Help me decide

88
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,040
which one of these two

89
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:00,150
looks better.

90
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,920
Neither.

91
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,750
Neither?

92
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,080
Then...

93
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:10,660
- What's the big deal?
- Then...

94
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:12,020
What if...

95
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,270
Jiu!

96
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:29,390
You didn't forget what you
have to do today, did you?

97
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,390
You're still in bed?

98
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,820
Get up!

99
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:54,390
Did you forget
what we are going to do today?

100
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,420
Get up!

101
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,990
Yin, what are you doing
so early in the morning?

102
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,180
I should ask you what you are doing!

103
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,780
Why did you drink?

104
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,680
I didn't drink.

105
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,750
You didn't drink?

106
00:10:10,030 --> 00:10:11,110
Last night...

107
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,510
Last night...

108
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:15,540
I can't remember anything from last night.

109
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,660
I understand.

110
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:23,230
It must be because
you were nervous about

111
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:26,780
making the contract with me today,
so you drank.

112
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,620
Is that right?

113
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,110
Contract?

114
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:35,380
Perhaps this is your fate
with Daze Mountain.

115
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,780
I have tied you and Gu Jin
in a master-servant contract

116
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,870
due to fate.

117
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,230
It's not only beneficial for Gu Jin,
but also for you.

118
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:48,110
Currently, I cannot lift this contract.

119
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,540
Yin, just now, I failed to sense you

120
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,290
with the master-servant contract.

121
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:54,870
The master-servant contract
seems to be lifted.

122
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,310
Yin, do you really want to form
a contract with me?

123
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:03,420
Won't you regret it?

124
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,820
Why are you asking
such a stupid question?

125
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,420
I won't regret it.

126
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,630
Get ready quickly.

127
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:15,420
I'll be waiting for you at the door.

128
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:18,280
By the way,

129
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:22,900
dress up a bit.
We need to match our outfits.

130
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:30,660
Match our outfits?

131
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,230
Is that necessary?

132
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,710
Be careful.

133
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,320
Come on.

134
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,590
Here you go.

135
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,920
Let's go.

♪It's just like a dream♪

149
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:09,060
Why are you still acting like a child?

150
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,950
When interacting with guys, you should
know your boundaries, understand?

151
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:15,900
What boundaries should I have with you?

152
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,740
You are still a naive little immortal beast.

153
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:24,230
Come on, let's get down to business.

154
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,750
Wait for me.

155
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,750
Let's do it.

156
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,420
We'll just do it like this?

157
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:40,780
Voluntarily forming a contract
isn't difficult,

158
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,380
and after the contract is formed,

159
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,130
your true form as a Water Divine Beast
will be less easily discovered by others.

160
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,080
Moreover, we can break the new
master-servant contract at any time.

161
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,920
Wait a minute.

162
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:50,750
Not a master-servant contract,
but a marriage contract.

163
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,590
Let's do it.

164
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:54,230
What marriage contract?

165
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,540
A marriage contract isn't something
you can just form casually.

166
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,700
Have you been reading
too many novels lately?

167
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,150
I'm perfectly sober. It's you
who hasn't sobered up yet.

168
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,510
We are here to form a marriage contract,
not a master-servant contract.

169
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,900
I didn't drink at all!

170
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,900
What's going on, Yin?

171
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,990
What marriage contract?

172
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:15,350
You said you liked me and brought me here
to form a marriage contract.

173
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,470
What's wrong with you?

174
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,900
I... I do like you,

175
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:26,270
but we are fellow disciples.
It's a familial kind of liking,

176
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,510
it's very different from a romantic one.

177
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:31,660
We did so many things
in the Mortal Realm together,

178
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:35,300
are now you are saying
it's a familial kind of liking?

179
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,660
In the Mortal Realm,

180
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:43,940
we did those things
to help Three-life Stone.

181
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:45,630
Fine,

182
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:50,420
if talking sweetly to me was an act,

183
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,180
what about when you kissed me?

184
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,700
I kissed you?

185
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,560
I...

186
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,840
You...

187
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,310
What are you thinking?

188
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:04,310
No, Yin, I really

189
00:15:04,310 --> 00:15:05,700
can't remember anything,

190
00:15:06,390 --> 00:15:08,660
but if I really did something
inappropriate to you,

191
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:10,060
I apologize.

192
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,990
Yin!

193
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:27,540
What are you doing?

194
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,990
We can't do this.

195
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,270
Calm down, please.

196
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,020
I don't believe this.

197
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,300
Jin,

198
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,180
can we talk?

199
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,440
Jin!

200
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:01,700
The disciples of Daze Mountain
are becoming more and more unruly.

201
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,180
(Leisure and Carefree)

202
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:07,150
You are banging on the door
of a young god like that.

203
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,420
What are you up to?

204
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,750
A young god?

205
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,270
What do you mean?

206
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,020
Gu Jin comes from the God Realm.

207
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,420
His original name is Yuan Qi.

208
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,700
He's the son of the True Goddess Yi He
and True God Di Juan.

209
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,270
Born as a True God,

210
00:16:21,790 --> 00:16:23,940
even when in the Mortal Realm incognito,

211
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,270
he remains the master of Qingchi Palace.

212
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,420
How... How is that possible?

213
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,590
He...

214
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:33,780
This thing was not supposed to be
widely known by the Three Realms.

215
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,350
But you, not knowing your place,
insist on meddling.

216
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:38,700
I might as well let you know the truth

217
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:42,300
to prevent you, a little immortal beast,
from having unnecessary greed.

218
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:46,590
When the young Fire Phoenix descended
to Wutong Island,

219
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,020
why did her immortal spirit disperse?

220
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,840
It was because the blood of His Lordship
also flowed into the Fire Phoenix Jade,

221
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,590
and her immortal spirit couldn't withstand it.

222
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:56,390
His Lordship felt deeply guilty about this,
o he has been searching for

223
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,660
(Leisure and Carefree)
the immortal spirit of the young Fire Phoenix.

224
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,780
He came to the Mortal Realm
also for this purpose.

225
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:03,660
However, being affected
by the Three-life Stone,

226
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,260
his words and actions
should not be taken seriously.

227
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:12,030
Do you really think a True God who looks down
on all beings in the Three Realms

228
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,060
would like a lowly Water Divine Beast
with a lifespan of mere a hundred years?

229
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:19,630
Water Divine Beasts may have short lives,
but we are not lowly.

230
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,740
Whether he is a True God or not,
I don't know.

231
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,870
He never told me.

232
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,500
I just know that he's different from you.

233
00:17:29,790 --> 00:17:30,830
You keep talking tough,

234
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:35,700
but the fact is, True Gods don't fall for
beings in the Three Realms.

235
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,030
His Lordship's experience
in the Mortal Realm

236
00:17:38,030 --> 00:17:40,590
is for growth
and to return to the godhood.

237
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:43,260
With each ascent,

238
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:46,200
the influence of the True God's blood on him
becomes deeper.

239
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,310
His attachment to the Three Realms
will become weaker.

240
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,110
All personal desires and affections
are not worth mentioning to him.

241
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:56,350
Between you and him,
there is an insurmountable gap.

242
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:58,110
Why bother entangling yourself?

243
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,500
Lady Hong Chou!

244
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,340
(Leisure and Carefree)

245
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,740
What are you doing?

246
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,310
Calm down, Your Lordship.

247
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:12,980
I see that this girl doesn't know her place
and is bothering you.

248
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,940
It's also a harm to herself
without any benefit.

249
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,590
So, I made your identity clear, hoping
she can stop bothering you.

250
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,320
So,

251
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,030
you're really a God?

252
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,550
Yin, I didn't deliberately
hide it from you.

253
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,790
I had no other choice.

254
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:34,630
Once everyone knows my identity,
there will inevitably be some reservations.

255
00:18:35,310 --> 00:18:37,510
I've been trying
to find the right time to tell you.

256
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,350
Yin.

257
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,420
Do you really think a True God who looks down
on all beings in the Three Realms

258
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:21,260
would like a lowly Water Divine Beast
with a lifespan of mere a hundred years?

259
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,390
Xian Zhu,

260
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:36,460
you are not fully recovered and shouldn't
stay outside for too long.

261
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:38,180
You should have more rest.

262
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,460
I'm much better and don't want to
stay cooped up in the house.

263
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,940
Thanks for picking
the Worry-free Immortal Fruit for me.

264
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:49,110
Don't take such risks next time.

265
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,900
Perhaps it's difficult to be worry-free.

266
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:55,590
Is this Miss Wan Yue?

267
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:02,390
She taught me how to make a sculpture
with a knife.

268
00:20:03,070 --> 00:20:07,310
Completing it bit by bit
makes it more precious.

269
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:15,590
It's a pity that such days are too short.

270
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:18,900
You knew that Miss Wan Yue
was a mortal,

271
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:25,110
and the laws of heaven and earth
were so cruel.

272
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,790
Why did you have to...

273
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,420
Have to force it?

274
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,790
It's not what I meant.

275
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:49,830
It's just that feelings arose without control,
and I couldn't bear to part with her.

276
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,790
Yes,

277
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:56,980
this is something
that cannot be controlled.

278
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:03,390
I just didn't expect
that he's so far from me,

279
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:08,310
so far that I cannot reach
no matter how hard I try.

280
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,660
It won't change anything
even if I force it.

281
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,800
Yin,

282
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,220
you know Jin's identity now?

283
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,660
So you know it all along.

284
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,150
Only the chief and I know it
in the entire Daze Mountain.

285
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,430
Yin,

286
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,900
since you know it's an extravagant hope,

287
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,460
then cut off this impossible attachment.

288
00:21:36,110 --> 00:21:36,980
Yin,

289
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:41,310
I can't bear to see you fall into
the same situation as Wan Yue.

290
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:47,550
I thought I could face life and death together
with her and resist everything.

291
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,350
But I forgot that the weakest would
bear the worst result.

292
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,260
I suffered the Thunder Punishment,
but I had my immortal body protecting me.

293
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:00,830
But what about Wan Yue?

294
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:08,630
She exhausted everything she had
and still perished without hope.

295
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,070
Our love violates the forbidden rules
of the Immortal Realm.

296
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,870
But why only Wan Yue bears
the bitter consequences?

297
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:23,590
Yin, don't fall into such a situation.

298
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,420
You can't bear the consequences.

299
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:28,460
Miss Wan Yue said she doesn't regret it,

300
00:22:29,030 --> 00:22:30,500
so I won't regret it either.

301
00:22:30,830 --> 00:22:34,110
Yin, don't let yourself get entangled
in such obsession.

302
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,460
I'm sure you have heard
what Yin said just now.

303
00:23:06,030 --> 00:23:08,420
I didn't expect Yin could be this stubborn.

304
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,350
Lady Hong Chou won't let it go.
She'll try to kill her again.

305
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,390
We can only have Jin and Yin
separated as soon as possible.

306
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:22,220
They'll both be safe
when they aren't together.

307
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,080
Xian Shan,

308
00:23:29,750 --> 00:23:30,830
you want to see me?

309
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,080
Jin,

310
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:35,630
you won the Trial Assembly

311
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,810
and you should've filled
in a position in the Heavenly Palace.

312
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:41,630
And now, the Heavenly Palace is in need
of help for the Spiritual Trigram Assembly.

313
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:44,220
You are thus summoned
to head the War God Hall.

314
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,500
So sudden.

315
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,280
Alright.

316
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,980
I've looked everywhere in Daze Mountain
and couldn't find any trace of the parasol tree.

317
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,830
There are a lot of ancient books in
the Heavenly Palace. Maybe I can find a clue.

318
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,460
Then pack your stuff and head off.

319
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,460
Xian Shan, can I take Yin with me?

320
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:10,560
Jin,

321
00:24:11,110 --> 00:24:13,070
Yin is no longer your contract spirit beast.

322
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,030
There's no position for her
in the Palace. You can't break the rules.

323
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:18,590
Jin,

324
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,420
the Heavenly Palace already
went easy on us for Xian Zhu's matter.

325
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,030
Do not do anything out of line
and insult the Heavenly Palace again.

326
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,800
Don't be late.

327
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:28,870
Off you go.

328
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,280
Xian Shan,

329
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:37,790
Yin has been a little down lately.

330
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,310
Help me take care of her if you could.

331
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,110
Don't let her stay inside all the time.

332
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,240
Tell her that after I come back

333
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,550
from the Heavenly Palace,
I'll bring her a lot of gifts.

334
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:51,760
Go ahead.

335
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,180
Yin, here.

336
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,620
Last time you brought back some dirt
from Ningyun Mountain.

337
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:11,100
We took the Spirit Swift Dog to search for it
following the scent of the dirt

338
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,700
and finally found
the location of the mountain.

339
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,520
It's right here.

340
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,790
It sits in the Illusion Forest on the border
between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

341
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,150
Great.

342
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:27,750
We finally found Ningyun Mountain.

343
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,140
Thank you, Xian Shan.

344
00:25:29,510 --> 00:25:31,110
I'll go there right now.

345
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:32,190
Go ahead.

346
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,550
By the way,

347
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,700
I went to look for Jin today,
but I didn't see him.

348
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,310
Do you know where he is?

349
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,700
Jin has left for the Heavenly Palace.

350
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,700
He won't come back soon.

351
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:51,420
Is he avoiding me?

352
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:56,660
Yin, Jin wants you
to take good care of yourself.

353
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,910
I will.

354
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,150
Then I'm leaving.

355
00:26:34,070 --> 00:26:36,310
Xian Shan asked me
and some other fellow brothers

356
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:38,740
to go with you to the mountain
and help you assart the place.

357
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:39,700
Why did you refuse?

358
00:26:40,110 --> 00:26:42,980
You'll be bored going there alone,
and you'll have no one to take care of you.

359
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,220
Who said I'm alone?

360
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:47,940
I have Yu with me.
She'll keep me company.

361
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:53,550
I'm going to Ningyun Mountain
to clear my mind as well.

362
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:56,030
Please thank our fellow brothers for me.

363
00:26:57,310 --> 00:26:58,550
Jiu went back to the Demon Realm,

364
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,340
Jin left for the Heavenly Palace,

365
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:02,310
and you are going to Ningyun Mountain.

366
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,350
Without you guys,
Daze Mountain is quiet and no fun.

367
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,110
Jiu went back to the Demon Realm?

368
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:09,530
The day before yesterday,

369
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:12,100
I saw him walk
out of his room looking sad.

370
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,260
I asked him where he was going,

371
00:27:13,750 --> 00:27:17,700
he said he's a demon, and he can't get used
to staying in the Immortal Realm,

372
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,870
and then he took a leap and flew away.

373
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:24,030
Why did he leave without saying goodbye?

374
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:26,070
After all, this place is not his home.

375
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:29,860
But, Yin, don't forget that Daze Mountain
is always your home.

376
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,900
That's also what Xian Shan
asked me to tell you.

377
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,700
(The Demon Realm)

378
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:07,500
What's the big deal?

379
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:11,420
Beauties are everywhere.

380
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:15,940
It's not like I have one choice only.

381
00:29:02,030 --> 00:29:02,870
Get out.

382
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,110
Get out.

383
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,870
Get out, all of you!

384
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:18,870
But, no one can replace her.

385
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,820
(Ningyun Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

386
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:22,150
Yu, according to the records,

387
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:25,740
the water of the Xuan Lake
can nurture your spiritual power.

388
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,790
You can hatch in no time.

389
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,520
Qing Yi.

390
00:31:56,030 --> 00:31:56,980
Jiu.

391
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:03,790
What brings you back here so quickly?

392
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,500
Lower your voice.

393
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:07,390
Let me ask you.

394
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,630
How is it going with the two?

395
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:13,390
Who?

396
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,460
What are you talking about?

397
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,660
Yin and Gu Jin.

398
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:19,740
Yin and Gu Jin... They...

399
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,790
Do I have to burn the Disciple Roll

400
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,150
to break the marriage contract,
and then win Yin's heart over?

401
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:31,280
Hold on a sec.

402
00:32:31,830 --> 00:32:34,500
What are you talking about?
I'm confused.

403
00:32:34,790 --> 00:32:38,550
Jin and Yin, one is in the Heavenly Palace
right now, and the other is in Ningyun Mountain.

404
00:32:38,830 --> 00:32:40,230
They are so far away from each other.

405
00:32:40,230 --> 00:32:41,790
How could they make a marriage contract?

406
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,460
They didn't?

407
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:49,740
Yin found Ningyun Mountain?

408
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,590
Where is it?

409
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:51,780
(War God Hall, Heavenly Palace)

410
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,700
I wonder what Yin is doing right now.

411
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:28,910
Yin.

412
00:34:31,670 --> 00:34:32,510
- Yin.
- Jiu.

413
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,740
What are you doing here?

414
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,150
So, this is Ningyun Mountain.

415
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:38,050
Beautiful, isn't it?

416
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,840
The mountain is, the lake is.

417
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,740
Everything here is beautiful.

418
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,300
Of course it is.

419
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,380
Ningyun Mountain has remained
undisturbed for tens of thousands of years.

420
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:53,740
Look, the spiritual energy
is abundant in this place.

421
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,700
It makes the mountain
so otherworldly and marvelous.

422
00:34:57,710 --> 00:34:58,550
Look.

423
00:34:58,840 --> 00:34:59,680
Yu.

424
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:01,400
As soon as Yu gets in the Xuan Lake,

425
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,780
the spiritual energy gathers
around her right away.

426
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,260
Once Yu hatches,

427
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,590
I'll have a little sister.

428
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,100
At that time, Ningyun Mountain
will be even more wonderful.

429
00:35:15,670 --> 00:35:16,510
By the way,

430
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,630
I promised you

431
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,990
that if I find Ningyun Mountain,
I'll let you pick a place to stay.

432
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,580
Alright. You bet I will.

433
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:26,990
Let me see. Where should I pick?

434
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,820
Can I ask you something?

435
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:31,740
What is it?

436
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,150
When you and Yan Shuang
went about the task of the Three-life Stone,

437
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:38,860
did you feel something unusual?

438
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:41,700
What do you mean, unusual?

439
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:44,990
Did you develop some
short-time affection for her

440
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:50,950
under the influence of the Stone?

441
00:36:00,190 --> 00:36:01,030
I...

442
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,700
I guess.

443
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:04,160
You did?

444
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:05,990
Of course.

445
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:12,030
So, if... If we kissed or hugged at the time,

446
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,640
it was all fake, like a dream.

447
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,260
Yin, do not take it seriously.

448
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:28,740
So, Jin was only influenced by the Stone.

449
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:37,180
He didn't mean what he said or did.

450
00:36:38,150 --> 00:36:43,380
Did you ask me that because of Gu Jin?

451
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:44,950
Who are you guys?

452
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:50,950
Your Lordship, you are...

453
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,110
I'm the Inspector of the Heavenly Palace.

454
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:54,990
The Inspector?

455
00:36:54,990 --> 00:36:57,540
The Heavenly Palace sensed movements
reappeared in Ningyun Mountain.

456
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:58,910
I was sent here for a check.

457
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:01,590
You two, leave here right now.

458
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,720
It's an unclaimed place.
It belongs to whoever finds it first.

459
00:37:05,110 --> 00:37:07,630
You can't own it before you file
an application to the Heavenly Palace.

460
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,710
If you don't leave,

461
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:13,070
the Palace will send soldiers tomorrow
to make you leave.

462
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:18,820
We… We should've told him

463
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,210
that I'm a Water Divine Beast,

464
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:21,870
and Ningyun Mountain is my home.

465
00:37:21,870 --> 00:37:22,990
That way, he wouldn't let us leave.

466
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,180
No, you can't.

467
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:28,700
Do you know how many cultivators want
the spiritual core of a Water Divine Beast?

468
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:30,340
If you expose your identity,

469
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:32,550
you'll become prey in their eyes,

470
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,380
and your life will be in danger.

471
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:37,300
Then what should we do?

472
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,480
(Blessed Cave)

473
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,590
Our Demon Realm never has
these many absurd rules.

474
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,680
Yin,

475
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:52,580
why don't you join our demon clan?

476
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,070
I'll find you a better place
than Ningyun Mountain,

477
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:59,180
and I'll be with you all the time
to protect and take care of you.

478
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,430
I'm happy as long as I can see you.

479
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:05,990
I like you.

480
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:07,020
Are you out of your mind?

481
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:07,860
I...

482
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,580
You think I just met you?

483
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:11,510
- I...
- You just want to steal my spiritual power.

484
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:13,740
Stop talking nonsense.

485
00:38:14,190 --> 00:38:15,630
Without Ningyun Mountain,

486
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,740
without the nurture of the Xuan Lake,

487
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,910
Yu can never hatch.

488
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,280
You are also here.

489
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,500
Yin, I went to Daze Mountain to find you.

490
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,150
They said you found a new place to stay.

491
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:38,990
So, I brought you some fine wine
and gifts to celebrate.

492
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:41,320
I saw the Xuan Lake
is covered by spiritual energy,

493
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,670
and I figured it must be your new home,

494
00:38:42,670 --> 00:38:44,300
so I came here
following the spiritual energy.

495
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:51,870
What's wrong?

496
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:55,660
So, you are a Water Divine Beast,

497
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:57,950
and you can't tell people you are,

498
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,860
hence, you can't be the owner
of Ningyun Mountain.

499
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:02,550
That's what's bothering you?

500
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,060
Yin told you her real identity
because you are her friend.

501
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,230
You must keep it to yourself.

502
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,950
I don't need you to tell me that,
stupid fox.

503
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,300
Yin, don't worry.

504
00:39:13,550 --> 00:39:15,470
I will keep it a secret for you,

505
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,550
and I won't let anybody hurt you.

506
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,830
But, if you want to be the owner
of Ningyun Mountain,

507
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,550
there's more than one way to do it.

508
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,070
You have an idea?

509
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:32,610
The Heavenly Palace
is recruiting new officials right now.

510
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,390
Look, you are smart and capable.

511
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:38,150
As long as you work hard and strive
to get a promotion as a fifth-rank official,

512
00:39:38,510 --> 00:39:40,550
you'll have the right
to claim your own place.

513
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:44,280
At that time, you can easily apply
to the Heavenly Palace for the ownership

514
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,120
of the mountain.

515
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:48,990
A fifth-rank official?

516
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,660
(Blessed Cave)

517
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,780
That's a good idea.

518
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,180
Gu Jin never mentioned to you
that the Heavenly Palace is recruiting?

519
00:39:58,670 --> 00:40:00,490
How could he leave you
high and dry like this?

520
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:02,780
He's also in the Heavenly Palace.
He can take care of you.

521
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:08,910
You had to rub that in, didn't you?

522
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:17,820
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

523
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:24,070
Lan Feng, I've long wanted
to have a drink with you.

524
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:26,990
Watch your mouth.

525
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,740
Your Majesty, you and my daughter are
a perfect match. I'm happy for you indeed.

526
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,910
But, your marriage matters to the future
of both our families and clans.

527
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:40,950
With all due respect,
I'll be straight with you.

528
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:42,860
Lord Hua, I'm listening.

529
00:40:43,030 --> 00:40:46,340
Although you are
the Acting Heavenly Emperor now,

530
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:50,110
the Heavenly Empress Feng Yuan will
succeed to the throne sooner or later.

531
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:54,150
Aren't you worried
that your position will be challenged?

532
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:59,300
It's my pleasure to gain Her Majesty's trust
and oversee Heaven on her behalf.

533
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,660
I only want to do my job right,
and I have no other thoughts.

534
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,860
I'm well aware
of your loyalty and righteousness.

535
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,780
But, if you have
our Peacock Clan's support,

536
00:41:10,590 --> 00:41:12,430
wouldn't that empower you even more?

537
00:41:16,590 --> 00:41:20,220
I heard that the weapons
in Sibing Hall are hard to manage,

538
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:22,150
so the Head position has been vacant.

539
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,860
- Maybe...
- I invited you here today

540
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,470
to talk about the marriage
between me and Shu.

541
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,780
Let's talk about the court business
some other time.

542
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,340
We'll be family in the future.

543
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,990
Court business and family business
are all the same.

544
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:40,300
That's right. Your Majesty,

545
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:43,660
I've been obsessed
with weapons since I was little,

546
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:46,950
and I've been preparing myself
for the Head position.

547
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:50,830
(Hua Yan, the Peacock Prince)
A position like this should be saved for family.

548
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,680
Right?

549
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,150
Since I'm the Acting Heavenly Emperor,
I must do things by the rules.

550
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,740
The Head position matters
to the fairness of the Immortal Realm.

551
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:02,070
I can't save it for a family member.

552
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:03,990
That's understandable.

553
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,150
I told my father and brother many times
that Lan Feng is a just and upright man.

554
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:12,220
But, I can assure you that Hua Yan
has passed the court exams.

555
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:16,260
He did quite a few good deeds
over the years, and they were all recorded.

556
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:17,630
He won't let you down.

557
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,260
That's good to know.

558
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:22,740
So, are you ready to take the office now?

559
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,030
Sure.

560
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:28,820
However, according to the rules,
you must start from being an Acting Head.

561
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:31,630
An Acting Head?

562
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:36,380
My brother has never served
the Heavenly Palace before.

563
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,550
It's good to have a buffer period.

564
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,590
Then, I really appreciate it, Your Majesty.

565
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:45,990
Here,

566
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,430
I'd like to toast you.

567
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:50,950
Thanks, Lord Hua.

568
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,470
Can't sleep?

569
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:03,300
Would you like to have a drink?

570
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:07,950
I'll go to the Heavenly Palace tomorrow.
I'd better stay sober.

571
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,990
I don't get it either.

572
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:19,030
Gu Jin was so into you and protective of you
when you were in the Mortal Realm.

573
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:22,860
So, you also think
he's serious about me, right?

574
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,660
It's been bothering me for days now.

575
00:43:27,590 --> 00:43:30,260
I can take this chance
and go confront him.

576
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,550
Even though he and I are so different,

577
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,950
I grew up with him,
and we used to be very close.

578
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:39,300
It shouldn't be like this.

579
00:43:39,550 --> 00:43:41,110
Since I can't get over him,

580
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,110
I may as well just go for it,
no matter what his answer is.

581
00:43:48,630 --> 00:43:50,150
Even though he's of high status,

582
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:51,200
I…

583
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:54,300
he'll get married sooner or later.
