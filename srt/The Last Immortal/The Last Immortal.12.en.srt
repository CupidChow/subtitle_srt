00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,520
Yin, it's time to go. Come on.

30
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,880
Yin.

31
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,380
Coming.

32
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,630
- Let's go.
- I heard you need to leave early.

33
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,080
What's the rush?

34
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,630
We were just about to say goodbye to you.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,340
Gu Jin isn't here. You can tell him later.

36
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,460
Yin and I are going to look
for Ningyun Mountain.

37
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:12,550
Ningyun Mountain?

38
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,110
I warn you, don't follow us.

39
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,590
I am heading back to Eagle Island, okay?

40
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:19,860
I don't have the time to follow you!

41
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,550
Let's go.

42
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,670
We can tell you in person now,

43
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,550
- Yin and...
- Come here.

44
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,830
Yin is my junior sister,

45
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,580
and I won't allow anyone
to mistreat or disrespect her.

46
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:39,510
You don't need to say that.
I'll naturally protect her.

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,580
Are you alright, Yin?

48
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,780
We'll meet again.

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,230
And she likes eating mung bean cake,

50
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,270
don't forget to buy it for her.

51
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,270
I got it.

52
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,710
And she likes drinking wine,

53
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,550
sometimes she drinks too much
and needs to be taken care of.

54
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,640
Okay, I know.

55
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,860
And if you find Ningyun Mountain,

56
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,340
let me know immediately.

57
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:11,340
Is there anything else?

58
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:13,800
No.

59
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,510
One last thing.

60
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,800
Three-life Stone!

61
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,240
Hurry up!

62
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,180
(Tofu Pudding)

63
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,090
Here you go.

64
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,940
Thank you.

65
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,140
How did it go?

66
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,110
- Didn't find it.
- Nothing.

67
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,860
Keep searching.

68
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,340
(Three-life Stone)
I'm right here.

69
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,710
Where else are you planning to look?

70
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,990
You're the Three-life Stone?

71
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,120
Yes.

72
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,070
Though I appreciate you saving me
from the water dragon demon,

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,870
I can't return to the Nether Realm now.

74
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:23,150
Why?

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,390
When I left the Nether Realm,
I made a solemn vow.

76
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,100
If I couldn't become the Heavenly
Matchmaker for demigods,

77
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,150
I swore not to return.

78
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,980
Matchmaker for demigods?

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,540
Nowadays, gods are capricious.

80
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,020
Why burden yourself?

81
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,830
Do it for those
from the Mortal and Nether Realms

82
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:42,980
would be a lot easier.

83
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,150
You've got a point.

84
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:48,710
Gods are indeed capricious.

85
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,100
Back then, I pursued him
for ten thousand years,

86
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:59,870
but he never favored me.
Instead, he avoided me like I was a wolf.

87
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,190
Later, I realized

88
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,710
it was better to focus on
improving my skills.

89
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,190
When I become the Matchmaker,

90
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,830
I can link myself and him
with a red thread.

91
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:17,100
So, she wants to use the position
to get herself together with her love.

92
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,310
But to become the Heavenly Matchmaker,

93
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,750
you need to connect ten thousand couples
with special experience.

94
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:25,860
No one has achieved that before.

95
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:29,300
If that's the case, you will never return
to the Nether Realm.

96
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,580
I'm almost there.

97
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:35,020
Through my unremitting efforts,
there are now only two pairs left.

98
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,180
I thought about it last night.

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,860
You two are from different realms.

100
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:43,140
And you are both heirs

101
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,700
with special identities,
meeting my conditions.

102
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,740
And you two

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,980
previously had a master-servant contract,
making it impossible to fall in love.

104
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,380
Now that the contract
has been forcibly removed,

105
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,660
it turns the impossible into the possible.

106
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,340
Because of that, you are also special.

107
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,780
So, as long as you're willing to help me,

108
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,780
I can complete the task within a day.

109
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:06,980
I disagree.

110
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,620
You're just randomly pairing people up.

111
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:11,140
Why can't Yin and I be matched?

112
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:12,700
Stop talking nonsense.

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,740
No,

114
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,420
it must be done according to my plan.
Otherwise, it will fail.

115
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:23,580
But marriage is a significant event in life.
Isn't this too hasty?

116
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,700
Right.

117
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,180
Don't take it seriously.

118
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,380
Just complete the designated procedure.

119
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,060
What procedure?

120
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,420
- You fool!
- Honey!

121
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:34,700
You are staring at other women again!

122
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,660
Honey, I'm sorry.
I won't dare to do it again.

123
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,540
I'll take you to buy the best rouge.
How about it?

124
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,420
Usually, you can't see it,

125
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,900
but every couple with a red thread

126
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,500
will grow a love fruit.

127
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:51,780
The more the couple's feelings deepen,
the larger the fruit becomes.

128
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,980
When the fruit is fully ripe,

129
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,620
it means that the marriage fate has been
successfully cultivated,

130
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:57,900
and my mission is completed.

131
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:03,860
Your red thread is specially
created for the task,

132
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:07,540
so your fruit must ripen within one day.

133
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,940
The method to ripen the fruit is to
simulate the interaction between lovers,

134
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,020
such as being jealous, saying sweet words,

135
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,860
or other intimate behaviors.

136
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,220
You mean we just need
to pretend to be couples

137
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,420
and don't really need to have feelings
for each other?

138
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,140
Alright.

139
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,420
You know what you need to do now?

140
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,260
Then I'll go find a place to rest.

141
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,300
Good luck.

142
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,260
Shall we get started then?

143
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,340
Let's go.

144
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,140
Wait, my Log of Desirables
is missing.

145
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:50,220
Log of Desirables?

146
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,420
What is that?

147
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,660
It's the male immortals that Yin favors...

148
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:55,500
Jiu!

149
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,060
Don't say it.

150
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,780
What?

151
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,780
Only you guys can judge girls

152
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,740
but we girls can't have the right to choose?

153
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:05,980
What did I say?

154
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,940
Yin, I think it's great.

155
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,380
Come on, I'll help you find it.

156
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,900
Maybe you dropped it on the way
when we rushed over.

157
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
Let's retrace our steps and look for it.

158
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,740
No need.

159
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,140
I mean, you don't have to go.

160
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,900
Yan Shuang will help me find it.

161
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,420
You don't need to come.

162
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,100
How can that be?

163
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,820
We can't separate.

164
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,820
Come on.

165
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,340
Let's split up and search.

166
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,700
I remember it was at...

167
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,580
You...

168
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,020
Did you see it?

169
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,540
So, what do you think?

170
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:29,020
I have no right
to interfere with your feelings.

171
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,220
Just don't lose it again.

172
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,380
(Jiu, Advantages: Fox Prince, handsome;
Disadvantages: None)

173
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,860
That stupid fox!

174
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,260
I really don't know
what's good about that stinky fox.

175
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,420
(Jiu, Advantages:
Disadvantages: None)

176
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,700
Wait,

177
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,940
that's not Yin's handwriting.

178
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,420
It was not written by Yin.

179
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,700
Jiu...

180
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,740
Advantages.

181
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
Countless.

182
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,020
Who allowed you to alter it?

183
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,660
None of those in your Log
is as handsome as me.

184
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,580
I thought I'd remind you
not to miss the best option.

185
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,620
You...

186
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,980
Okay, okay,

187
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,100
my bad.

188
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,820
Can you keep my name in it?

189
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:47,660
No.

190
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,380
Do you know that by altering it like this,
others might misunderstand?

191
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,220
Who would misunderstand?

192
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,980
Is it Gu Jin?

193
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,620
Don't forget, you two have a...

194
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,460
No,

195
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,860
the master-servant contract has been lifted.

196
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,940
That restriction has gone.

197
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,220
I can write whoever I want

198
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,380
and you don't need to worry.

199
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,140
(So, the name that originally ranked first
on it is mine.)

200
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,700
(Indeed, I am Yin's first choice.)

201
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,940
Now that we've found the Log,

202
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:29,500
let's each buy a gift and exchange them.

203
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,340
Hurry up.

204
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,700
Okay.

205
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,180
Jin.

206
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:39,020
Jin, actually,
that Log of Desirables...

207
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,860
Yin,

208
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,140
I remember you said that
after reading the storybook,

209
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,780
you really wanted to try human delicacies,
right?

210
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,340
Come with me. I'll take you to eat
something delicious.

211
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,180
Sachets!

212
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,860
Come and take a look at the sachets!

213
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,260
Please, take a look.

214
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,220
Sachet?

215
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,980
There are many different kinds.

216
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,420
Most girls like sachets,

217
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,580
- but I prefer...
- Do you think Yin will like sachets?

218
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,140
What...

219
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
Yin?

220
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,980
Forget it. It's pointless to ask you.

221
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,380
I'll go ask Yin.

222
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,140
Idiot, can you complete the task like this?

223
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:38,260
Am I jealous?

224
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:41,980
Impossible, absolutely impossible.

225
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,340
It must be something wrong
with this fruit.

226
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,300
Yin.

227
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:51,620
These are sugar-coated haws.
They are sweet.

228
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:55,180
I'll hold it for you.

229
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,940
There are so many people,
you might get lost.

230
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,310
Come on.

Look at how bustling this town is.

246
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,820
Since we have to choose a gift,

247
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,020
why don't you accompany me to eat,
drink, and stroll together

248
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,460
to finish the task early?

249
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,540
Who wants to stroll with you?

250
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,220
It's so noisy here.

251
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:29,500
I'll destroy Chang'an

252
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,940
and drink the blood of every kid in the city.

253
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,420
Fox.

254
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,140
What?

255
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:36,420
Has anyone told you that?

256
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,900
Tell me what?

257
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:44,740
That your ears stand up when you lie.

258
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
When did I lie?

259
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,100
Yin said that in Daze Mountain,
you dared not eat rabbits.

260
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,700
You even went to the kitchen
and stole carrots to feed them.

261
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:56,940
Stupid eagle!

262
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,740
I was just fattening them up
before eating.

263
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,820
Pastries!

264
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,260
Come and take a look at the pastries!

265
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,620
Miss, would you like some pastries?

266
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,740
Smells so good.

267
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,060
Yes, feel free to choose.

268
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,700
- It's just Osmanthus cake.
- Come and take a look.

269
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,860
Look at you, curious about everything.

270
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,628
- Take a look.
- I'll buy you something better

271
00:15:18,652 --> 00:15:20,420
- Take a look.
- after we find Yin.

272
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:26,460
Nothing can compare to the Osmanthus cake
my mother made.

273
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:34,060
She fought a Taotie
to protect me when I was little,

274
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,660
and then...

275
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,220
Ever since then, I haven't eaten
Osmanthus cakes again.

276
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,620
I'll have some.

277
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:46,100
Okay.

278
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,540
How much can this bracelet
be exchanged for?

279
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:52,420
Well...

280
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:55,300
These are sandalwood beads from
one hundred thousand years ago.

281
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,340
Anyway, my aunt forced me to take it.

282
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:58,700
I didn't really want it.

283
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:01,420
A gift from the elder
should not be declined.

284
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:03,260
Your aunt wants to protect you,

285
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,900
so don't let it go to waste.

286
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,940
She's just doing some superficial work.

287
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,980
How about this?
Since today we'll exchange gifts,

288
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:15,940
you can give it to me. It's mine now.

289
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,660
Now, I'll give it back to you
as a return gift.

290
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,060
Just treat it as a gift from a friend,

291
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,540
so you won't dislike it so much.

292
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,900
Ma'am, two pieces
of Osmanthus cake, please.

293
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,980
Alright.

294
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:33,420
(Peace and Prosperity)

295
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,140
Why do you insist on
letting me keep this bracelet?

296
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,780
Sandalwood can ward off evil spirits,

297
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:44,540
especially this one-and-only
100-thousand-year-old piece.

298
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,260
The Fox Queen is a demon,

299
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:49,820
it's especially difficult for her
to obtain this in the Immortal Realm.

300
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,980
She gave you this bracelet,

301
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,540
showing how important you are to her.

302
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:04,140
I've heard about the past of your Fox Clan.

303
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:08,620
Your aunt couldn't return to the Second Heaven
in time to help your father during

304
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,540
the Immortal-Demon War due to her emotional
entanglements with Demon Lord Lin Mo.

305
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,860
I know you've always been
troubled by this,

306
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:20,260
but I think your aunt must feel guilty,

307
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,540
especially when facing you.

308
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:26,940
That's why she does so much
to please and care for you

309
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,340
without letting you know.

310
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,500
I'm not trying to meddle,

311
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:38,780
but as your friend,

312
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:41,220
I don't want you to regret it like I do.

313
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,660
I always complained that my mother's
Osmanthus cake wasn't sweet enough,

314
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,020
but look,

315
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:50,780
now

316
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,940
I can't eat it anymore.

317
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,060
(The Demon Realm)

318
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,740
I heard you woke up.

319
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,380
Are you feeling better now?

320
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,780
I'm almost recovered.

321
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:27,380
I lost too much demon spirit
and almost died fighting the devil that day.

322
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,360
I survived thanks to your timely rescue.

323
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:34,620
Seeing you awake
finally set my mind at ease.

324
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,220
I'm grateful to have you.

325
00:18:52,420 --> 00:18:53,700
Can you help me with this?

326
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,220
Sure.

327
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,020
Do you remember?

328
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:28,340
You once put a jade hairpin
on me like this.

329
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:30,460
When was that?

330
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:33,180
Perhaps I dreamed about it.

331
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,220
Ruo, today, you…

332
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,500
It feels like we are back to the way we were.

333
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:45,740
Am I dreaming?

334
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:02,620
That day, you used your heart blood
as the guiding ingredient of my medicine.

335
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,900
I understand how you feel about me.

336
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:10,300
You've really forgiven me?

337
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,300
I've always been in love with you.

338
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,580
But fate played us and made us
go through this trouble.

339
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:21,460
And now, I finally realized
what I want the most.

340
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:26,180
You are always there for me
no matter what happens.

341
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:33,220
How could I not be touched
by what you did for me all these years?

342
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,180
This day finally came.

343
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,020
Ruo.

344
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:53,820
Sorry, Ruo. I got too anxious.

345
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,460
It's not you.

346
00:20:56,420 --> 00:20:59,100
I haven't recovered yet. I don't feel well.

347
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,460
We have plenty of time.

348
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:05,900
I'll wait for you until you
accept me willingly again.

349
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,380
Please go back first.

350
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:09,940
Okay.

351
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:12,620
Take good care.

352
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,420
Bravo!

353
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:02,150
- What's that?
- Today is our anniversary.

354
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,500
This bamboo dragonfly made
with superb craftsmanship is the prize.

355
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,220
- One of a kind.
- Bamboo dragonfly?

356
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,420
Who wants it?

357
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,780
Who wants it?

358
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,340
Me!

359
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:14,900
Come on in, guys. Come on.

360
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:15,740
You want it?

361
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:20,420
Let the competition begin.

362
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:23,420
(Noodles)

363
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,300
Done.

364
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,020
We've got a winner.

365
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,980
Congratulations, gentlemen.
You won the bamboo dragonfly.

366
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,140
My goodness.

367
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,740
We really won.

368
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,100
We won. We won.

369
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,420
- We won. We won.
- We won.

370
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,470
So close.

371
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:36,980
Lord Messenger.

372
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,980
Yes?

373
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,300
We found a secret letter outside the hall.

374
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:52,620
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

375
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,780
Lady Hong Chou.

376
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,820
Lady Hong Chou, what's wrong?

377
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:13,100
You are asking me?

378
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,620
Don't you know Gu Jin is in danger?

379
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:23,940
How could it be?

380
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,100
Jin is protected
by the master-servant contract.

381
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,180
It's impossible for Yin
to become a threat to him.

382
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,140
Could it be that there's
a flaw in the contract?

383
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,780
That old man Donghua
promised me to keep Jin safe.

384
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:38,420
Since he failed, there's no point in keeping
that little beast alive anymore.

385
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,740
When that Water Divine Beast comes back,
I'll kill her myself.

386
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:42,620
- Don't.
- You can't.

387
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:47,380
No matter what, Yin is
a Water Divine Beast of the Three Realms.

388
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,780
She can't be killed for no reason.

389
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:52,100
You all know Gu Jin's identity.

390
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
I can't let anything happen to him.

391
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:59,180
Yin is just an insignificant immortal beast.
Does it even matter if I kill her?

392
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:01,980
You said it yourself that she's just
an insignificant immortal beast.

393
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,980
The complexity of a True God's tribulation
is completely out of her control.

394
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,380
I think there must be more to it.

395
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:12,260
Don't do anything reckless
and hurt someone innocent.

396
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:15,740
Please give us more time to find a solution.

397
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,540
Even Donghua failed to see it clearly,
how could you come up with a solution?

398
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:23,420
Gu Jin's life is in imminent danger.

399
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,860
What are you up to by stalling?

400
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:33,860
Hadn't been for True Goddess Yi He,

401
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:36,020
your Daze Mountain wouldn't have
got to where you are today.

402
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:37,780
The Three Realms is huge,

403
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:40,860
yet she entrusted Daze Mountain
to Gu Jin only.

404
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:44,220
What's more precious
than her kindness is her trust.

405
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,020
But you people don't care
about Gu Jin's safety at all.

406
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:56,900
You've got a great reputation out there,
but this is how you manage things in real.

407
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,110
- You…
- Xian Zhu.

408
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,700
Lady Hong Chou, please calm down.

409
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,660
Our master is very forethoughtful.

410
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:14,900
He did leave us a remedy
before he ascended.

411
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,580
This is the Temple of Romance
in the Mortal Realm.

412
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,900
And this is called Love Lock.

413
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,180
Once the Love Lock
is hung on the red thread,

414
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,380
it means a couple will never be apart.

415
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:30,660
Many couples in love
come here for blessing.

416
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,700
Let's hang it here.

417
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,140
Here.

418
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:44,140
(Gu Jin, Yin)

419
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,100
I'll lock it now.

420
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:48,940
Done.

421
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,860
(Gu Jin, Yin)

422
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,820
Let's hang it there.

423
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,860
Why did you throw the key away?

424
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,580
How are we supposed to unlock it?

425
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,540
We don't.

426
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,580
Gu Jin and Yin.

427
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,270
We are bound together now.

428
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,790
♪The wind ripples the moonlight♪

429
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,590
♪Petals flutter down♪

430
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:17,580
(Gu Jin, Yin)

431
00:27:19,950 --> 00:27:22,670
♪Love under the moon♪

432
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:26,460

♪In your gaze♪

435
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,780
Will that work?

436
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,300
Lady Hong Chou, don't worry.

437
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,300
Our master would never risk
the future of Daze Mountain.

438
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,580
This measure will keep Jin safe for sure.

439
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,300
You'd better think carefully.

440
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:01,420
To protect that beast,
Daze Mountain will sacrifice a lot.

441
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:04,580
Is it worth it?

442
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:09,100
Yin is also one of us.

443
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:12,180
If we don't protect her, who would?

444
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:17,100
Besides, this is the best way
to protect Jin at the moment.

445
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,540
Fine.

446
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:22,780
I'll trust you for this one last time.

447
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,300
Xian Shan,

448
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:32,700
this is only a makeshift.

449
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,620
It can't make
the Heavenly Tribulation go away.

450
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:37,260
Criminal Xian Zhu of Daze Mountain.

451
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,100
According to the decree issued
by the Heavenly Palace, Criminal Xian Zhu

452
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:48,140
must go to the Heavenly Palace
to accept punishment right now.

453
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:55,990
Gu Jin.

454
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,820
Jiu.

455
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,510
- Come here.
- Yan Shuang.

456
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,980
The one-day deadline is up.
Let me see your outcome.

457
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,020
Jiu, we'll talk about our matter later.

458
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,300
Come on.

459
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,180
You did a good job.

460
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:15,620
What about yours?

461
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,100
I'm sure nothing happened.

462
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,980
It's grown much bigger.

463
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,900
But the color is a little light.

464
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,140
When did it grow this big?

465
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,500
I had no idea.

466
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
Tell me about it.

467
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,860
When did it grow this big?

468
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,820
We didn't do anything.

469
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,140
It's alright.

470
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
It doesn't matter

471
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,180
if the color is light.

472
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,260
Love is not always evenly-matched.

473
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,740
But, the fruit is too small.

474
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,780
And we don't have much time left.

475
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:57,980
To accelerate the ripening,
I'll have to show my trump card.

476
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,580
It takes 100 years for two to meet,

477
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,220
and 1,000 years for two to marry.

478
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,500
Once a couple gets married,

479
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,700
it means their relationship is consummated.

480
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:13,420
So, getting married is the best way
to ripen the love fruit.

481
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,220
Is it okay to fake a marriage?

482
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:18,700
Don't worry.

483
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,020
All you need to do is put on the outfit
and complete a ceremony.

484
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:26,700
Besides, without the required
betrothal gifts, the marriage doesn't count.

485
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,540
There's nothing out here in the wild
except the two huts I conjured.

486
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,580
No one else would know.

487
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:35,300
Just make sure
don't give it away yourselves.

488
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:36,220
I'll never talk about it.

489
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,940
Whoever tells will get struck by thunder.

490
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:39,540
Alright.

491
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,540
No more waiting. Let's get it started.

492
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,580
Hold on.

493
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,940
Yin, wait here for me. I'll be back soon.

494
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,020
Please hold it for me.

495
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,740
(Happiness)

496
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,700
Yin.

497
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:15,260
You are finally back.

498
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,380
You look good in it.

499
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:21,620
This

500
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:22,940
is for you.

501
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,100
You bought it?

502
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,940
Do you like it?

503
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,620
Where did you get so much money?

504
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,100
I…

505
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,740
How did you get hurt?

506
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,620
I helped the store load their carriages,

507
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,020
and I made some money to buy it.

508
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:43,700
It was a piece of cake for me.

509
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,540
No big deal.

510
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,060
You loaded the carriages yourself?

511
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,060
Yes.

512
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,980
Actually, you didn't have
to do that for a bamboo dragonfly.

513
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:51,820
Of course I do.

514
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,020
You loved it so much.

515
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,100
I want to give it to you as a betrothal gift.

516
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:02,980
Based on the Reincarnation Stone,
our marriage is not real. So,

517
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,180
- you don't have to…
- Yin,

518
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:09,980
although our marriage is fake,
my feelings for you are real.

519
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,500
You are only acting, aren't you?

520
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,660
Yin,

521
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,620
you wrote my name first
on the Log of Desirables, right?

522
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,540
Actually, I've been wrong about something,

523
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,860
very wrong.

524
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:39,340
I misunderstood the feeling of love.

525
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:42,260
Until that day when I was
on Bainiao Island, I realized

526
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:46,060
that the one whom I wanted to see
wear the Sparkling Crown was you.

527
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,540
Yin, I like you.

528
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:53,140
I'm thinking instead
of the master-servant contract,

529
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,300
we can make a marriage contract
so we can be together forever.

530
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,260
Do you want to?

531
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,980
You said, you like me?

532
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,620
You didn't hear it?

533
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,980
- Let me say again…
- I heard you.

534
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:16,420
Then, will you take my betrothal gift?

535
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:48,220
(Happiness)

536
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:01,020
(Happiness)

537
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,020
Hurry up.

538
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:05,860
Let's complete the ceremony
and leave this place.

539
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,100
Stop rushing me, you stupid fox.

540
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,860
You think I don't want to leave here?

541
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,580
Now, hurry.

542
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,020
The job is done.

543
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:43,260
Why did you peck me?

544
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,060
I didn't do it on purpose.

545
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,700
I got tripped over my dress.

546
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:50,100
Your Highness,

547
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:53,380
why are you blushing?

548
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,380
I…

549
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:57,620
Am I?

550
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:02,380
No way.

551
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,820
Don't tell me it was your first kiss.

552
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,140
I…

553
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,540
See?

554
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,900
The first kiss is indeed helpful.

555
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:24,140
Yin is finished, right? I'll go check on her.

556
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,980
Don't tell Yin about it.

Great.

573
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,500
I'll finally get a chance
to become the Heavenly Matchmaker.

574
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:12,740
You were so close just now.

575
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,860
Did you do something to Yin?

576
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,460
None of your business.

577
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:24,300
It's weird. What's going on?

578
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,180
(Wan Yue, Xian Zhu)

579
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,460
Their red thread is broken.

580
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:35,340
(Wan Yue, Xian Zhu)

581
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,780
Xian Zhu?

582
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:38,740
My senior brother Xian Zhu?

583
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,300
It's impossible.

584
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,740
I've never heard he's in a relationship.

585
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:47,180
And that Wan Yue, there's no
such a person in the Immortal Realm.

586
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,180
It's a relationship
between an immortal and a mortal.

587
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,020
Wan Yue is a mortal girl,

588
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,300
and Xian Zhu is a disciple
of Daze Mountain.

589
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:55,340
Could it be…

590
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:58,380
Why are their names flashing in red?

591
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,540
(Wan Yue, Xian Zhu)

592
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:03,860
Oh, no. They are about
to receive Heavenly Punishment.

593
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,180
Heavenly Punishment?

594
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,540
(Qinglong Platform, Heavenly Palace)

595
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:33,100
Your Majesty,

596
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,700
Xian Zhu was just confused.

597
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:37,400
Please show mercy on the account

598
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,780
- that he's a first offender.
- Xian Zhu.

599
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,740
Xian Zhu.

600
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,540
Xian Zhu is injured already.

601
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:43,700
If you flog him
with the Lighting Snake Whip 30 times,

602
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,820
I'm afraid he'll die
of damaged immortal spirit.

603
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:52,620
Your Majesty, please show mercy.

604
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:59,900
Heavenly Empress Feng Yuan entrusted me
with the management of the Immortal Realm.

605
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,340
I have to go by the Heavenly rules.

606
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:07,020
If I bend the rules for no reason, how am I
worthy of governing the Heavenly Palace?

607
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:12,140
Your Majesty, with all due respect,
I'd like to ask what rule says

608
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,620
immortals can't fall in love with mortals?
What do you base that on?

609
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,820
How ignorant.

610
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:20,740
The rules of the Immortal Realm
were made by all the former Heavenly rulers.

611
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,940
The Immortal Realm is superior
to the Mortal Realm.

612
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:24,940
The rules of hierarchy can't be violated.

613
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:27,700
They ignored the rules
and had a relationship in secret,

614
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,420
which caused serious trouble
to the both realms.

615
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:34,220
The mortals have no immortal power.

616
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:35,960
How could they cause trouble
to the Immortal Realm?

617
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,500
If the immortals go down to the Mortal Realm,

618
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,931
they don't possess any immortal power unless

619
00:39:38,955 --> 00:39:40,620
they get a spiritual tablet
from the God of Soil.

620
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,360
So, how could they cause trouble
to the Mortal Realm?

621
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:45,060
We are all beings created
by the Ancestral God Qing Tian.

622
00:39:45,380 --> 00:39:48,220
How could there be a hierarchy between us?

623
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,700
You are sharp-tongued indeed.

624
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,660
I must teach you a lesson
on behalf of Daze Mountain

625
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,820
to protect the dignity of the Heavenly Palace.

626
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,220
Stop.

627
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,620
Your Majesty.

628
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:09,620
She disrespects the Heavenly Palace
and insulted me.

629
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,060
Why don't you let me teach her a lesson?

630
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:14,100
Yin offended you because
she's concerned about her senior brother.

631
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:16,900
Your Majesty,

632
00:40:17,460 --> 00:40:19,740
rules are rigid, but people are not.

633
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,860
Please give Xian Zhu a chance
to correct his mistake.

634
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:28,060
Yin, the Ancestral God Qing Tian

635
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:33,300
divided the world into the realms of gods,
immortals, demons, devils, and humans,

636
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:35,420
and set up boundary markers
between the realms for a reason.

637
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,680
All the beings in the world
are destined to be who they are.

638
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:40,500
Any mistake would affect
the predetermined fate.

639
00:40:41,020 --> 00:40:44,180
Wan Yue is not destined
to be an immortal, and that's her fate.

640
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:48,340
Xian Zhu protected her from a misfortune,
and that's against the will of Heaven.

641
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,620
So, he must be punished by Heaven.

642
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:51,980
No one can escape from that.

643
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,980
Your Majesty, Xian Zhu
violated the Heavenly rules

644
00:40:57,990 --> 00:40:59,940
because I failed to discipline him.

645
00:41:00,380 --> 00:41:03,700
Please allow me
to share half of the punishment.

646
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:04,780
Xian Shan.

647
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,100
According to our teachings,

648
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,540
fellow disciples should
treat each other like brothers.

649
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:18,460
Your Majesty, if you must punish him,

650
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:21,260
I'd like to share the punishment too.

651
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,780
So do I.

652
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,260
We'd like to share
the punishment for Xian Zhu.

653
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,660
Your Majesty,

654
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:36,820
the brotherhood of the disciples
of Daze Mountain is truly touching.

655
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,300
Although it's never been done before,

656
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:42,540
the rules are made as how they fit.

657
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:47,220
If you are willing to share the punishment
for Xian Zhu, I can't say no to that.

658
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,660
Given the power of the Lighting Snake Whip,

659
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:53,940
only those who've reached
the level of junior immortal

660
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:57,980
can share the punishment for Xian Zhu.

661
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,100
Xian Shan.

662
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,140
Xian Zhu!

663
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,380
I failed the teachings of our master,

664
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,220
and I disappointed all of you.

665
00:42:57,540 --> 00:42:59,340
Please don't suffer for me anymore.

666
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:04,340
I will always remember your kindness.

667
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,900
Let me take the rest of the floggings alone.

668
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,980
- Xian Zhu.
- Xian Zhu.

669
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,820
Your Majesty,

670
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:37,020
Criminal Xian Zhu…

671
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,860
Xian Zhu.
