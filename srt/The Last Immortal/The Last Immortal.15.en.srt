=Episode 15=

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,300
It's been bothering me for days now.

30
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:45,350
I can take this chance
and go confront him.

31
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,830
Even though he and I are so different,

32
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:52,190
I grew up with him,
and we used to be very close.

33
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,500
It shouldn't be like this.

34
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,910
Since I can't get over him,
I may as well just go for it,

35
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:06,190
no matter what his answer is.
Even though he's of high status, I...

36
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:09,670
He'll get married sooner or later.

37
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:14,230
Oh, Xian Zhu said I might get hurt.

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:16,460
But I'm not scared.

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,110
Thank you, Yan Shuang.

40
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:21,730
I feel much better now.

41
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,180
Thanks for enlightening me.

42
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:26,580
Otherwise, I wouldn't know
how to make it through tonight.

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,830
Tomorrow, I'll go to the Heavenly Palace
and get a good job.

44
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,740
I want Ningyun Mountain. I want Jin, too.

45
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:39,430
The beautiful tomorrow
is in my own hands.

46
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,900
Good night, Yu.

47
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:00,060
(Jiu?)

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:05,020
(After making Yin happy,
now I have to comfort Jiu.)

49
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,510
I know you like Yin.

50
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,900
But I don't want to see her
keep feeling sad for Gu Jin.

51
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,780
That's what she really wants, anyway.

52
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:26,150
I didn't think it was that hard
to steal her heart.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,780
But if her heart has no space for me,
why would I forcibly steal it?

54
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,830
I'd rather always keep her company,
as long as she can be happy.

55
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,510
I'll go tell Yin I'm going
to the Heavenly Palace, too.

56
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,180
What? You're going, too?

57
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,180
You're a demon.

58
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,270
If you're exposed,
there will be a lot of trouble.

59
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,230
Don't you remember?
Now I'm a spirit fox.

60
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,390
The camouflage of Daze Mountain
works very well indeed.

61
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,780
Besides, my father's Nirvana Wheel
was confiscated by the Heavenly Palace.

62
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,460
I've been trying to get it back.

63
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
All right.

64
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,060
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly
will be held soon.

65
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:08,270
As the Eagle Princess, I was supposed
to work in the Heavenly Palace.

66
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,450
I just thought it was too boring.

67
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,820
But it is different now.

68
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:14,180
Since both of you are going, I'll go, too.

69
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:15,950
We can take care of each other there.

70
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,700
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

71
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,340
I don't think we have
a suitable job for you.

72
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,190
You may leave.

73
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:30,790
Wait.

74
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,540
I have weak spiritual power.
But I'm a glutton for hard work.

75
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,390
Other candidates here
are more powerful than me.

76
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,150
If you ask them to do hard work,
they must be overqualified.

77
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,750
Why don't you have me do that?
I'll do a good job.

78
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,350
Are you really a glutton for hard work

79
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,870
(Yu Feng, one of the five lords)
and can you do trivial details?

80
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,660
(of the Immortal Realm)
and can you do trivial details?

81
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,580
Sibing Hall is short of men.
Someone has to clean the weapons.

82
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,220
Do you want to work there?

83
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,400
Yes.

84
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,830
Before I came, my mother told me
to stay away from Sibing Hall.

85
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:22,420
Or I would be doomed.

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,020
What are you waiting for?

87
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:25,350
Just go.

88
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,000
Yin.

89
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:29,390
Wait for me. I'll catch up.

90
00:05:31,070 --> 00:05:32,510
Sibing Hall.

91
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,390
Next...

92
00:05:35,630 --> 00:05:36,470
My turn.

93
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:41,220
Sibing Hall. Sibing Hall.

94
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:43,900
Junior immortal.

95
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,390
Young man, you look quite clever.

96
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,390
Why don't you work for me in Sifeng Hall?

97
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,630
Sifeng Hall?

98
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:56,390
Who wants that? I'm going to Sibing Hall.

99
00:05:57,870 --> 00:06:00,660
Let me go. I'm not going to Sifeng Hall.
I'm going to Sibing Hall.

100
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,150
What? You look down on my hall?

101
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,710
Old man, how could you tie me up?

102
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:09,950
Old man?

103
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:12,950
I like this title.

104
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,660
I want to go to Sibing Hall!

105
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,660
(Sibing Hall, Heavenly Palace)

106
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,620
(Sibing Hall)

107
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:37,310
I'm Yin and I'm new.
I'm here to report for duty.

108
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,980
Why is it even so hard to get in?

109
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,630
Lord Yu Feng?

110
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,630
Where's he?

111
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,520
Let me go!

112
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,630
Or I would pull down your place!

113
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,780
Pull down my place?

114
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:29,710
Then I should keep a closer eye on you.

115
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:30,780
Jiu?

116
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,750
Greetings, Your Lordship.

117
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,100
Your Lordship, this spirit fox
is a good friend of mine.

118
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,870
I wonder how he offended you.

119
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,270
Yin and I agreed to go to Sibing Hall.

120
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,460
- But this old man got me here.
- Jiu!

121
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,340
Naughty fox, if you keep
acting so wildly, I'll cage you.

122
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:54,660
Your Lordship, he just talks tough.
Please don't blame him.

123
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,310
This young man is kind of proud.

124
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,310
Let him temper himself in Sifeng Hall.

125
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,540
I won't set you free until you defeat me.

126
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,710
Don't be kidding.

127
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,830
How can I fight you when I'm tied up?

128
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:12,750
When did I tie you up?

129
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,780
Is it...

130
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:46,940
Smart kid. You have the potential.

131
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:01,800
Jiu!

132
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,560
It doesn't feel right.

133
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:13,780
Just now, a strong
immortal power attacked me.

134
00:09:16,550 --> 00:09:17,470
Let me try again.

135
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:20,780
Yan Shuang, out of the way.

136
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,350
Be careful.

137
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:37,350
Jiu,

138
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:38,590
are you all right?

139
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,230
How come?

140
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:55,470
You have good potential,
but you're too quick-tempered.

141
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,040
I...

142
00:10:01,030 --> 00:10:01,870
You're hurt?

143
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:02,870
It hurts.

144
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,740
(Sibing Hall)

145
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,750
Anybody in?

146
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,470
I'm Yin. I'm here to report for duty.

147
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,390
Anybody here?

148
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,660
(Courageous and Fearless)

149
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,940
(Fuchen Sword, Deputy Head of Sibing Hall)

150
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,110
So, it's you.

151
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:24,990
You kept stopping me
from coming in. Why?

152
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,300
You're not my enemy.
Why would I stop you?

153
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,540
Anyway, the jelly beans taste good.
Do you have more?

154
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,180
I made the jelly beans.
I have as many as you want.

155
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,470
Give me a few more.

156
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,370
Why?

157
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:41,790
You stopped me
from coming in the whole afternoon.

158
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,150
Why would I give you more?

159
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,900
Because I'm Fu Chen,
Deputy Head of Sibing Hall.

160
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,820
You're here to report for duty, huh?

161
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:57,990
If I sabotage it,
you can never get promoted.

162
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,870
Fu Chen?

163
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,060
You immortals are really insolent.

164
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,270
I'm just like being grounded.

165
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:11,390
You...

166
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:15,250
How careless! Be gentle, will you?

167
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,180
Stop nagging when I'm helping.

168
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,820
You used to be aggressive, didn't you?
So, you're also afraid of pain.

169
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,860
In this case, be sensible.

170
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:27,020
Stop fighting against Lord Yu Feng.

171
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,100
When I figure out
what spells Yu Feng uses

172
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,260
and gets the Nirvana Wheel,

173
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,740
I'll see who can hurt me again.

174
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,180
Jiu,

175
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,740
Lord Yu Feng is
a senior immortal at the peak level.

176
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,540
Don't be impatient.

177
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:44,340
Or you would be flurried and lose.

178
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,860
We need a more careful plan
for the Nirvana Wheel.

179
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:51,020
Among so many immortals,
only you're not that bad.

180
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,380
Is this the way you say thank you?

181
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,540
What did you do? It hurts.

182
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:57,340
Sorry. Sorry. I didn't mean that.

183
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,900
Sorry. I'm sorry.

184
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,020
I didn't mean that.

185
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,740
Put the ointment away.
I'll apply it for you tomorrow.

186
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,260
What a girl!

187
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,020
Fine. I can keep you here.

188
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:40,900
But you have to promise
you'll make more jelly beans for me.

189
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:48,020
Now you can tell me
why you blew and stopped me, huh?

190
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:51,780
I didn't mean to blow. I just...

191
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:56,780
- What's wrong?
- It hurts.

192
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:57,940
What's wrong with you?

193
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,860
It hurts. It hurts so much.

194
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:00,740
Where does it hurt?

195
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:08,660
It hurts!

196
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,890
It hurts!

197
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:30,980
So, you have a toothache.

198
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:37,340
It no longer hurts.

199
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:40,660
Girl,

200
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,060
I didn't expect you
to have such a cultivation base.

201
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:50,020
But why do you have
such weak spiritual power?

202
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,620
Never mind.

203
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:55,100
You're here to clean the weapons, huh?

204
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:04,380
Tonight, go to bed early
and have some good rest.

205
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,020
Tomorrow, you'll have a big fight.

206
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,620
Good luck to you.

207
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:17,700
(War God Hall)

208
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,020
(War God Hall)

209
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,420
Mung bean cake?

210
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,580
Yin, is that you?

211
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:57,380
Yin...

212
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:08,060
When did you come here?
Why didn't you tell me?

213
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:11,180
You even brought me mung bean cakes.

214
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,660
Why did you come here? For fun?

215
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,420
I'm not here for fun.

216
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,940
You may not know this.
I've found Ningyun Mountain.

217
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,260
You have?

218
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,100
But I can't claim that place yet.

219
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,580
I can't apply for that
unless I'm a fifth-rank immortal official.

220
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:31,580
So, I came here.

221
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,340
Then why didn't you send me a message
and tell me about it?

222
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:35,660
I can help you. At least...

223
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,540
Never mind. I can do it myself.
I don't want to bother you.

224
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:41,700
Today, I started to work in Sibing Hall.

225
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,580
Now, I'm an eighth-rank official.
Not far from a fifth-rank one, I think.

226
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,180
Quite far from that.

227
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,820
Yin,

228
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,420
are you still blaming me
for keeping my identity?

229
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:01,460
You found Ningyun Mountain
and you came to the Heavenly Palace.

230
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,860
But you didn't tell me anything.

231
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:07,300
I thought about it. Like you said,

232
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,620
if you had told me, I would stay away
and be scared of you.

233
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:15,820
I wouldn't feel as free as I do now.

234
00:18:18,020 --> 00:18:19,740
And I've thought it through.

235
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,260
Whoever you are, a god or an immortal,

236
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:28,020
you're the same man I know.

237
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:31,180
Everything that happened is true.

238
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,260
Yin, I'm glad to hear that.

239
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,780
So, the love between us is true, too.

240
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,740
When I opened my eyes,
you were the first person I saw.

241
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:46,500
I trusted you most, too.

242
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,540
In the Forbidden Valley,
we stayed with each other.

243
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:54,500
We traveled in the Demon Realm
and experienced the Mortal Realm.

244
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:00,220
We've never been apart
for such a long time.

245
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,100
I really miss you.

246
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:05,860
Yin,

247
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,980
- I also miss...
- I know.

248
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,700
I know Water Divine Beasts like me
don't live very long.

249
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,460
So, I have no time for wayward thoughts.

250
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,460
Today, I came here to tell you.
I've made up my mind.

251
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,620
I'll make you fall in love with me again.

252
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,620
Yin, don't talk nonsense.

253
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:30,260
I'm not talking nonsense.

254
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,540
According to Lady Hong Chou,

255
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,660
when a True God wakes up,
he'll have fewer desires or feelings.

256
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:41,860
But I know. You wouldn't be like that.

257
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:47,540
Because as far as I know,
you're loyal and righteous.

258
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,300
You wouldn't abandon the world or me
just because you're a True God.

259
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:54,140
Right?

260
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,140
And in the Mortal Realm,

261
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:57,900
- do you remember we...
- Yin,

262
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,180
we were in love
because of the Three-life Stone.

263
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,140
Are you sure?

264
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:06,660
Is it really because of that?

265
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,340
Yin.

266
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,220
You've grown up.

267
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,380
Don't get so close to me.

268
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,260
Or no one would dare to marry you, right?

269
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,780
It doesn't matter.

270
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,540
But I have an instinct.

271
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,420
You still like me.

272
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,580
Just like the god power.

273
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,420
It gradually awakens, too.

274
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:48,340
What if someday
you get back all your god power

275
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:51,860
and your feelings for me awaken, too?

276
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:55,820
Yin...

277
00:20:57,110 --> 00:21:00,280
♪Diluted in the moment of looking back♪

278
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,180
Eat it.

279
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:05,060
Go to bed early. I should go.

280
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,440
♪Drinking all the time♪

281
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,340
Yin!

282
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:12,020
♪Keeping a steady relationship♪

283
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,060
(Red beans contain deep love.)

284
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,700
(Do you know how much I love you?)

285
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,780
(When the autumn wind embraces the rain,)

286
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,620
(all the love scenes on earth fade.)

287
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:26,540
(It feels great to get together,
but it feels terrible to part.)

288
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:29,700
(So hard for deep lovers.)

289
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,700
(A road always ends,)

290
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,820
(but love never stops.)

291
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,500
I failed many times.

292
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,140
Because your spiritual body helped you.

293
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,420
Good.

294
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:23,740
You've learned to calm down
and that's big progress.

295
00:22:24,380 --> 00:22:25,220
All right.

296
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,300
I'll make you
a sixth-rank guard of Sifeng Hall.

297
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,260
You have free access
and you set your own hours

298
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:34,660
so that you can meet your friend.

299
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,940
In case of emergency,
come back when you're summoned.

300
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,780
Thank you, Your Lordship.

301
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,340
You're welcome.

302
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,420
Well, you and I were meant to meet.

303
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:50,740
Your fighting skills reminded me
of a fox demon I once fought.

304
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,140
Did you also fight him
with your spiritual body?

305
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,180
Exactly.

306
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,060
He had very strong power.

307
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,540
When he used his Nirvana Wheel,
no immortal could defeat him.

308
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,660
Because he didn't know
about my spiritual body,

309
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:16,700
I captured his weapon by luck.

310
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,300
I am ashamed to say this.

311
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:24,740
Later, due to heavy evil energy,
his weapon has been permanently sealed

312
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,300
in the Secret Storeroom.

313
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,220
Your Lordship.

314
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,100
Your Lordship,

315
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,620
Fox Demon Hong Mei was murdered.

316
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,660
What?

317
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,020
Have you found the murderer?

318
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:42,100
Not yet.

319
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,340
Of the Fox Clan,
Hong Mei was one of the Four Guardians.

320
00:23:44,780 --> 00:23:47,260
Someone managed to kill her secretly.

321
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,220
He must have great power
and it's hard to find him.

322
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,340
Who on earth

323
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,140
hates the Fox Clan that much?

324
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:59,740
Rather a disaster for them.

325
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,180
(The Demon Realm)

326
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,140
Who on earth killed her?

327
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,700
No clue has been found yet.

328
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,940
Not even a little spiritual power
was found near Hong Mei.

329
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,820
Any kind of power.

330
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,740
Either the murderer was at least a demigod

331
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:56,820
or he caught Elder Hong Mei off guard

332
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:59,460
so that she didn't have time to resist.

333
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:16,220
Her wound must have been masked.

334
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:21,260
Who? Who set this against us?

335
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,460
We've been guarding the border
for the Demon King.

336
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,100
Our soldiers and the immortal soldiers
have had frequent fights.

337
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:32,340
The immortals must be detesting us.

338
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:34,260
- Right. It must be the immortals.
- It must be them.

339
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:35,380
Let's not panic first.

340
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,620
The ceasefire between us
has lasted 200 years.

341
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,860
The immortals have no reason
to start a war now.

342
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,980
I've never been aggressive
against the immortals

343
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,340
and I've tried hard to be respectful.

344
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,420
But they push us again and again.

345
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,980
Now, they've even murdered our elder!

346
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,340
Something feels wrong.

347
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,500
The shape of the wound looks familiar.
I think I saw it somewhere before.

348
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:04,620
It looks like a demon's weapon
instead of an immortal's weapon.

349
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,140
- No way.
- How's that possible?

350
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:08,060
How can it be a demon's weapon?

351
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:08,900
Demon?

352
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:11,980
Why are you
still defending the immortals?

353
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,420
You haven't been back for a long time.

354
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:18,540
Will you really betray us
and join the immortals?

355
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:23,420
I'm just experiencing the outer world.

356
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:25,580
Rest assured, Aunt.

357
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:28,580
I'll look into Elder Hong Mei's murder case.

358
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,340
I won't let her die an unclear death.

359
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:35,820
I have to figure out
who actually killed her.

360
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:41,100
But before that,
don't do anything hasty, Aunt.

361
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:45,900
Hong Yi, don't you remember?
You're one of us.

362
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:48,540
You should act in concert with us.

363
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:52,700
I have good immortal friends, too.
They often protect me.

364
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,540
Friends?

365
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,940
You're too young
to know what real friends are.

366
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,460
I'm going to investigate the weapon.

367
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,220
Stop right there!

368
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:08,860
Ruo!

369
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,420
Ruo, calm down.

370
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:15,060
Hong Yi made a good point.

371
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,620
There's always a lot of tension
between immortals and demons.

372
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:21,100
We're not sure about the murderer yet.
We need to investigate it carefully.

373
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,620
Recently, there has been a lot of trouble.

374
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:27,500
First, a fox elder was killed by a devil.
Then, Hong Mei was murdered.

375
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,860
I vaguely feel this isn't small trouble.

376
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:34,540
The Three Realms
will go wrong again, I guess.

377
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:38,580
Ruo.

378
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,020
I worry about you.

379
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,220
You need to be careful.

380
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:51,460
I'm not scared when I stand with you.

381
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,900
Elder Hong Mei,

382
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:33,060
why did you try to leave
even without saying goodbye?

383
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Who are you?

384
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,220
I'm Hong Ruo.

385
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:37,060
Nonsense!

386
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,940
The Fox Queen would never do this!

387
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
Where is she?

388
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:44,100
What did you do to her?

389
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
You want to know?

390
00:28:56,420 --> 00:29:01,340
We must tell Demon King Lin Sen
to guard against the immortals.

391
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,860
We should make a move first
when we have to.

392
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,940
(Sibing Hall)

393
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:38,940
(Courageous and Fearless)

394
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,020
As you can see,

395
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,820
it's really hard to clean
these immortal weapons.

396
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:54,780
I thought you were
the toughest to deal with.

397
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,820
But it turned out to be them.

398
00:29:57,300 --> 00:30:01,020
Some of the immortal weapons
have gained consciousness.

399
00:30:01,340 --> 00:30:02,660
They're naughty.

400
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,780
I can't restrain them.

401
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,340
But...

402
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,460
Uncle Fu Chen,

403
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,180
(Magic Gourd, Slash Crossbow, Void Blade)
why did you bring a stranger in?

404
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:15,380
Isn't that obvious? To forcibly clean us.

405
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:19,460
Void, what do we do?

406
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:20,940
We won't be cleaned.

407
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:22,260
We won't.

408
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,820
We just won't.

409
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,300
This chubby one is Magic Gourd.

410
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,300
Hi, Magic Gourd.

411
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,700
This girl is Slash Crossbow.

412
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,060
Hi, Slash.

413
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:40,780
And that... He's Void Blade.

414
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,460
He isn't void at all.

415
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:46,540
They three are the toughest to deal with.

416
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,060
I'm Yin.

417
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,460
I'm here to help...

418
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,940
If you want to clean them,

419
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:07,300
you have to do it... the dumbest way.

420
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,420
The dumbest way?

421
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,020
I'll fight it out.

422
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:50,180
Let me clean you, will you?

423
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,540
Good boy.

424
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:53,140
Come...

425
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:15,540
It's fun.

426
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,580
So fun.

427
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,460
So much fun.

428
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Yan Shuang.

429
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,540
Watch out.

430
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,260
Yin, are you all right?

431
00:32:58,940 --> 00:33:01,340
Yan Shuang, what are you doing here?

432
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,900
I'm the Head of Sibing Hall.
I have to be here.

433
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,500
Head?

434
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,020
You?

435
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,740
(Sibing)

436
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,140
Me, indeed.

437
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:16,580
(Sibing)

438
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:22,060
Greetings.

439
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:25,820
From now on, you must
get cleaned obediently.

440
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,740
Otherwise, as the Head,

441
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,900
I have the right to melt you into lamps.

442
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,100
Don't try to scare us.

443
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,460
We're immortal weapons.
Who dares to melt us?

444
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,620
Try me, then.

445
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,700
Yan Shuang.

446
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:45,660
May I ask why you
don't like to be cleaned?

447
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,140
Because...

448
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,380
Because it hurts.

449
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:51,060
- It hurts?
- It hurts?

450
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,860
Then you have my word.
You won't feel hurt when I clean you.

451
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,300
You'll even feel great.

452
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,460
How do you feel, Magic Gourd?

453
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,500
It doesn't hurt, huh?

454
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,660
It doesn't. It feels great.

455
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:22,220
Void and Slash,
would you like to have a try?

456
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,780
I'm not lying. It really feels great.

457
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,140
How about you have a try?

458
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:41,100
Oh my, will wonders never cease?

459
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:45,660
Gold magma for gold polishing
was used to clean you.

460
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,620
You certainly felt the pain.

461
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,340
Now I use my spiritual power.
So, it won't hurt.

462
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,260
It can clean you,
relax you, and maintain you.

463
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,060
It feels great, huh?

464
00:34:59,140 --> 00:34:59,980
Fu Chen.

465
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,860
It feels so great. Would you like a try?

466
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:05,860
I'd like to try, then.

467
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,020
Are you ready?

468
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:35,140
Yin, you're really helpful.

469
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,060
I'm glad you arrived in time.

470
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:39,660
They were putting me through a lot.

471
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:44,340
Oh, you haven't told me
how you became the Head of Sibing Hall.

472
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,860
Didn't we agree
to take care of each other?

473
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,980
Knowing you came here, I had some fights

474
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,420
and won this job.

475
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,860
It's so nice of you.

476
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,660
How was it? Felt great, huh?

477
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:56,620
It felt so great.

478
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,420
Will you always stay here?

479
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:01,380
If you do, I'll get cleaned obediently.

480
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:03,060
Whether I stay in Sibing Hall,

481
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,620
I will help when you need to be cleaned.

482
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,100
Because we're friends.

483
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,660
Friends? You...

484
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,460
You don't take us
as killing weapons only?

485
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,660
Killing weapons?

486
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,780
You have consciousness.
And you have emotions just like me.

487
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,340
So, we can be friends.

488
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,340
Good point, Yin.

489
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,620
Your Majesty?
To what honor do we owe this?

490
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,740
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly
is so important.

491
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,940
The cleaning of weapons
must be seriously done.

492
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:39,860
I'm here to check
if everything goes smoothly.

493
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:43,180
Surprisingly, everything's under control.

494
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,820
Rest assured, Your Majesty.

495
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,300
I've realized
that Yin is a very good immortal.

496
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:54,140
She's clever and kind.
She gets along very well with others.

497
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,380
With her around, we will
move in the right direction.

498
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,060
If you don't mind, we'll take our leave.

499
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:06,020
Let's go.

500
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,820
Go.

501
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,900
The last time we met on Bainiao Island,

502
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:17,660
I just thought Yin was clever
and Yan Shuang was straightforward.

503
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,660
Unexpectedly, you work very well, too.

504
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,780
I can really count on you
to manage Sibing Hall.

505
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:31,580
Your Majesty, last time I saw you,
I thought you were imposing and commanding.

506
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,340
Unexpectedly, you have to bother
about everything. It's really hard.

507
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,280
It's certainly hard
to manage the Heavenly Palace.

508
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,260
However,

509
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:41,940
Yin, why do you insist on working here?

510
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,900
She wants to be a fifth-rank official
and gets the right to claim a place.

511
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:49,540
Daze Mountain is a great place
with abundant energy.

512
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:51,820
Why do you want to claim a place?

513
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,980
I want to have my own home.

514
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,380
You're right, Yin.

515
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:02,340
You work so hard.
Getting promoted won't take long.

516
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:07,300
Don't forget to invite us
to your place for housewarming.

517
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,420
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

518
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,620
Shu, what are you doing here?

519
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,940
I'm confused about something
and I'm here to ask you, Your Majesty.

520
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:25,500
Something about Hua Yan, right?

521
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:28,900
You promised to make Hua Yan
the Head of Sibing Hall.

522
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:31,220
Why did you promote Yan Shuang instead?

523
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:33,900
I said Hua Yan could be
the Head of Sibing Hall

524
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:38,420
because you told me he'd done
everything in his Record of Contributions.

525
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,500
He has done that, indeed.

526
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,660
Check this out.
It's his Record of Contributions.

527
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:54,400
(Helped to get back the Dragon Princess.)
At first glance, he has done everything.

528
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,400
(The Dragon Princess ran away from home...)
But I took his record

529
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,840
(Helped to get back...)
and verified his deeds,

530
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,000
only to find that he falsely claimed
most of the contributions.

531
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:00,220
Shu,

532
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,460
what Hua Yan did
is against the Heavenly laws.

533
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,180
So, I had to cancel his application

534
00:39:07,340 --> 00:39:10,500
in case he was punished
instead of getting promoted.

535
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,660
Hua Yan did the wrong thing.

536
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:19,700
But you verified everything personally?

537
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:20,940
Yes.

538
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:23,380
If Hua Yan wasn't my brother,

539
00:39:23,380 --> 00:39:25,780
you wouldn't be so strict, would you?

540
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,580
Shu, don't get me wrong.

541
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:33,420
It's not personal.

542
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:37,100
But you recommended Hua Yan
and now you take care of Silu Hall.

543
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:39,540
I have to think more for your reputation.

544
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,820
But if you hadn't verified that,

545
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,980
no one would know it.

546
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:43,820
Shu,

547
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:46,820
we do everything with a clear conscience
instead of showing off to anyone.

548
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,420
What about Yan Shuang?

549
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:51,740
She came yesterday
and today she's the Head of Sibing Hall.

550
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,820
Is there no problem
with her Record of Contributions?

551
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:59,180
Before, Yan Shuang made
a lot of contributions in the North Sea.

552
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,900
When she came here yesterday,

553
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:05,180
she did a dozen things without stopping
and filled her Record of Contributions.

554
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:06,980
Now, she's the Head of Sibing Hall.

555
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:10,220
Under her and Yin's management,
everything goes smoothly there.

556
00:40:10,780 --> 00:40:14,260
How can I not hire
such a hardworking and sincere lady?

557
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,340
So in your eyes, my clan
isn't as good as hers, huh?

558
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:21,140
I won't bother you then, Your Majesty.

559
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,540
Shu.

560
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,980
What?

561
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,740
Elder Hong Mei was killed
by a ring-shaped weapon?

562
00:40:34,940 --> 00:40:35,780
Exactly.

563
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:37,580
Such a powerful ring-shaped weapon,

564
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,540
I can only think of the Nirvana Wheel.

565
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,140
I didn't say this in the Demon Realm
because I didn't want Aunt to overthink.

566
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,700
The Nirvana Wheel is locked
in the Secret Storeroom.

567
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,740
Either someone has a similar weapon

568
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,420
or someone stole it and killed Hong Mei.

569
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:55,540
Fu Chen.

570
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,500
We're talking seriously.

571
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:04,020
You've seen a lot of weapons here.
What do you think it is?

572
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,420
Ring-shaped weapon?

573
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:09,940
Ring-shaped weapon...

574
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,380
Ring-shaped...

575
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:16,380
I don't know too much.

576
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,340
Ring-shaped weapons are rare.
I seldom see one.

577
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,300
I don't think I can help.

578
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:27,100
But if you suspect it's the Nirvana Wheel,

579
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,820
try to check on it and you'll know.

580
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,580
It's in the Secret Storeroom.

581
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,900
The barrier is extremely powerful.
Who could even break in?

582
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,940
You're right.

583
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:39,260
Whoever it is,
I have to catch the murderer.

584
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:42,580
No one can invade my clan
just as he wishes.

585
00:41:42,740 --> 00:41:45,500
(War God Hall)

586
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,980
(In Sibing Hall, there is
an ancient parasol tree.)

587
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:02,900
