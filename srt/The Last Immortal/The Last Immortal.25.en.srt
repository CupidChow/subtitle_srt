=Episode 25=

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,100
Yin privately released Hong Yi,
that's a serious crime.

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:52,830
From today, Yin will be confined
to the Hall of Arms,

31
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,226
and half a month later,
she will receive punishment

32
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,660
and be stripped of her immortal status,

33
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,910
confined to Qingchi Palace and forbidden from
entering the Immortal and Demon Realms

34
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,740
until Daze Mountain sees a day of rebirth.

35
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,070
(Fine.)

36
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,300
(As long as Jiu won't die in vain,)

37
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,110
(and the devils won't succeed
in covering up the truth,)

38
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,990
(even if I am imprisoned for a lifetime,
I am willing.)

39
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,550
(Fortunately, Yu can grow up peacefully
in Ningyun Mountain.)

40
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,830
(This is the last thing I can do for her.)

41
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,820
(Hall of Arms, Heavenly Palace)

42
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,780
Take the guilty immortal Yin
to Qinglong Platform for execution.

43
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,300
This is the Heavenly Palace,
not Bainiao Island.

44
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,580
Even if I am guilty,
it's not your place to judge.

45
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:58,180
The punishment is bestowed by
His Godship Yuan Qi,

46
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,000
I am just the executioner.

47
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:03,390
By His Godship's order,
I'll execute you in advance.

48
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:08,300
Today, I will strip your immortal bones
and revoke your immortal status.

49
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,950
You are the executioner?

50
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,020
Who appointed you?

51
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:15,900
His Godship Yuan Qi of course.

52
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,270
I don't believe it.

53
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,580
I have his jade seal.

54
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,830
You, a low-level immortal beast,
think His Godship cares about you?

55
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:41,740
Even if you committed a terrible crime,

56
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:45,740
you're just an insignificant
Water Divine Beast.

57
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,830
I will carry out the execution.

58
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,270
He told you this?

59
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:54,830
What do you think?

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,430
Immediately take her
to Qinglong Platform.

61
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,520
- Yes!
- Yes!

62
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,860
(Xuanjing Palace, Third Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

63
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,780
You are from the Peacock Clan
of Bainiao Island.

64
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,780
Why did you infiltrate Xuanjing Palace?

65
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,390
Hong Yi, you killed
Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng,

66
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,310
causing Princess Hua Shu
to lose her husband on the wedding day.

67
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,900
I am here to kill you.

68
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,150
A stupid bird like you

69
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,310
wants to kill me?

70
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,510
It doesn't matter if I can't kill you.

71
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,100
That traitor Yin who released you
will die with you anyway.

72
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,710
It's worth it.

73
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,630
Tell me, what did you do to Yin?

74
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,950
His Godship Yuan Qi imposed
the bone-stripping punishment.

75
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,750
Princess Hua Shu
will personally execute it today.

76
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:08,390
This is your retribution.

77
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,270
He destroyed his own internal core.

78
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:20,630
Yuan Qi actually
handed Yin over to Hua Shu.

79
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:23,420
That means Yin has no way out.

80
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,660
Uncle Lin Mo.

81
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,150
Soldiers, follow my order!

82
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:54,900
(Qinglong Platform, Heavenly Palace)
I, on behalf of His Godship Yuan Qi,

83
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,510
am executing the bone-stripping punishment
on the guilty immortal Yin.

84
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:00,340
Kneel down and receive your punishment.

85
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,880
Disciples of Daze Mountain only kneel
to the heaven, earth, and gods.

86
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:10,000
Why should I kneel to you?

87
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,420
Hong Yi!

88
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:00,410
In the past, Chief Xian Shan
spared no effort to protect you,

89
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:02,410
yet you repaid kindness with resentment.

90
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:06,440
Not only did you destroy Daze Mountain,
but you dared to invade the Immortal Realm,

91
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:09,320
committing such an infuriating act.

92
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,530
I don't have time for you.

93
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:13,680
I want to see Yuan Qi.

94
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,290
The matters between our realms
can be resolved by us here.

95
00:07:18,850 --> 00:07:20,880
There's no need for His Godship
to handle everything.

96
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,240
You killed our Demon King.

97
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,680
What position do you have
to discuss things with me here?

98
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,650
A few days ago, my sword was stolen.

99
00:07:39,330 --> 00:07:41,380
The assassination of the Demon King
has nothing to do with me.

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,120
That's nonsense.

101
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,440
Get lost. Let me take Yin with me.

102
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:48,270
And you'll come with me
to the Demon Realm to apologize.

103
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:51,020
Wind Lord, no need to explain to him.

104
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:55,100
The demons just want to provoke war
with the Demon King's death.

105
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:58,390
You will regret this.

106
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:02,340
Fellow immortals, form up!

107
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,710
It seems I have to
cleanse this place with blood.

108
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:28,020
You can't take it already?

109
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,420
The execution has not started yet.

110
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,110
Heavenly Punishment Officer.

111
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,420
Since His Godship wants to strip her bones,

112
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:57,270
Wanyi Sacred Fire punishment
is the most appropriate.

113
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,000
The Wanyi Sacred Fire is usually
used on demigods.

114
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,060
This little immortal beast
is just a junior immortal,

115
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,590
and she has serious injuries,
she won't survive this.

116
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,660
She committed an enormous crime
and deserves to die.

117
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,870
If you feel compassionate, I'll do it.

118
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,230
Your Highness.

119
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,140
(Barrier entrance, Abyssal Prison)

120
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:36,700
Fire Phoenix Jade?

121
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,590
Why is the Fire Phoenix Jade here?

122
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,630
Could it be that Jin is in trouble?

123
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,540
(The Fire Phoenix Jade is demonized.)

124
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,230
(They want to absorb my god spirit.)

125
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,230
(They want to open
the Abyssal Prison barrier.)

126
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,440
Dragon!

127
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,680
Dragon!

128
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:55,750
This is a trap.

129
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,420
What trap?

130
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,110
They lured us in
with the Fire Phoenix Jade.

131
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,720
They want to open
the Abyssal Prison barrier.

132
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,560
Let's go.

133
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,180
You are indeed clever.

134
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,060
Hand over your god spirit.

135
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,150
So what if it's a god tool?

136
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,820
Since it's already connected
to the Abyssal Prison,

137
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,470
it also works for us devils.

138
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:48,420
Since you won't hand over the god spirit,
I'll take it myself.

139
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:29,270
You want to fight a True God's spirit
with a shattered internal core.

140
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,020
What a useless effort.

141
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,150
What are you doing?

142
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,750
Expending my demigod power

143
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:56,140
to destroy the little
True God spirit within me.

144
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:58,020
Without the True God spirit,

145
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,510
you can forget about opening
the Abyssal Prison barrier.

146
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,180
It's not going to happen!

147
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,300
Dragon!

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,300
You failed at last.

149
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:24,300
So useless.

150
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,160
Dragon.

151
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,470
(I didn't expect Three-headed Fire Dragon
to actually self-destruct his god spirit.)

152
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:45,510
(I can only use your god spirit now,
Yuan Qi.)

153
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,820
Qing Lin took away the Fire Phoenix Jade
and trapped me here.

154
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,060
There must be a motive.

155
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,700
I need to escape quickly.

156
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,660
Master, your god spirit is unstable.

157
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,180
You must not use
your god power again.

158
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:22,110
Only my heart blood
can counteract this barrier.

159
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,110
If you don't cooperate with me,
my heart blood will be wasted.

160
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:00,700
With my current power,
Yuan Qi may not even be my match.

161
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:05,130
I advise you all not to resist.

162
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,350
Hand over Yin!

163
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:08,870
Hong Yi, don't be arrogant.

164
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,230
You dare not do that!

165
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,750
What do I not dare?

166
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:19,510
When the immortals invaded our Demon Realm
and forced my parents to die in the battle,

167
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,420
you didn't show the slightest mercy.

168
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,660
Hong Yi, I will perish with you today.

169
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,270
Hong Yi,

170
00:16:49,630 --> 00:16:52,150
even if I die here today,

171
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,540
I will absolutely not retreat.

172
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:02,150
Immortals, guard the defense line.

173
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:03,420
Yes!

174
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:09,150
Wind Lord.

175
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:10,030
Wind Lord.

176
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,310
Wind Lord, stop the self-sacrifice.

177
00:17:27,310 --> 00:17:28,350
Everyone, stop!

178
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,740
You finally came.

179
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,310
Hong Yi, I apologize to you.

180
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,430
I now know the truth about Daze Mountain.

181
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,950
Before, I was single-minded in wanting
to clear Daze Mountain's name.

182
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:46,790
The harmony between immortals
and demons is hard-won.

183
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,500
Don't start another war.

184
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,550
The immortals assassinated our king,
and now you say you don't want a war?

185
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:58,700
We demons were never ungrateful.

186
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,150
Yin is trapped in the Heavenly Palace
for saving me.

187
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:06,630
Yuan Qi, just protect the peace
of your Three Realms.

188
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:09,180
I only want her to be safe.

189
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,480
No one in the world should harm her.

190
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:14,350
Hong Yi.

191
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,740
There must be something suspicious about
the Demon King's death.

192
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,820
Ask your army to withdraw, and we can
discuss it in the long run.

193
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,030
Long run?

194
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,900
That's why you picked Hua Shu
as the executioner for Yin?

195
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,900
What are you talking about?

196
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,520
Hong Yi!

197
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:40,350
I didn't waste my efforts bringing
Hong Yi into the battlefield.

198
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:49,520
Hong Yi, stop it.

199
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:50,790
Listen to me first.

200
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,790
I don't want to stand on either side
in the immortal-demon war.

201
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:54,220
I just want to find out the truth.

202
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,550
Before coming to the Ghost Land,
I met Qing Lin.

203
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,700
She ambushed me and took away
my Fire Phoenix Jade.

204
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,390
She admitted that she controlled you
and exterminated Daze Mountain,

205
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:05,310
just to provoke the immortal-demon war.

206
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,080
Are you sure?

207
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:11,190
I'm sure.

208
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:15,150
The deaths of Lan Feng and the Demon King
are related to the devils.

209
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,390
For now, let both sides retreat.

210
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,500
Uncover the trickery of the devils
is the top priority.

211
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,310
Unfortunately, you don't have time.

212
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,420
I have the devil formation.

213
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:04,070
(My god spirit is uncontrollably
leaking from my body.)

214
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:05,390
This is a devil formation!

215
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,700
You audacious demon,

216
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:12,790
you colluded with the devils
to plot against His Godship.

217
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:15,080
How dare you collude with the devils!

218
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,150
We immortals will never let you off!

219
00:20:18,070 --> 00:20:19,940
Immortals, set up the formation.

220
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:31,780
(The Fire Phoenix Jade is demonized.)

221
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,740
(Yuan Qi, I will use your god spirit
to open the Abyssal Prison.)

222
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,420
There is a Spirit-nourishing Elixir inside her,

223
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,790
continuously providing her
with immortal power,

224
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,640
supporting her immortal bones.

225
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,550
If it weren't for
refining this elixir to save you,

226
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:50,980
Lan Feng wouldn't have unjustly died.

227
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:39,110
Yin!

228
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,480
Hua Shu!

229
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,660
How dare you
privately execute punishment?

230
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:49,630
Yin released the demon fox, causing
a massive war between immortals and demons.

231
00:21:50,070 --> 00:21:51,030
Today, you're helping her.

232
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:54,110
Are you planning to ally with the demons?

233
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,900
Hong Yi went to the Ghost Land.
Hurry and stop him.

234
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,980
The Fire Phoenix Jade just shook up,
I sensed it.

235
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,460
And Jin, I'm worried about him.

236
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,630
Yin, leave this to me.

237
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:12,150
You go.

238
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,030
We can't fall for the devils' plot again.

239
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,630
Immortals, save His Godship!

240
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,310
How could she enter the devil formation?

241
00:23:28,350 --> 00:23:30,010
She is controlling the devil energy.

242
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:33,790
Isn't that the Fire Phoenix Jade
which was stolen by the devils?

243
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:37,900
It must be her who released devil energy
to harm His Godship.

244
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:41,110
Master once said if Fire Phoenix Jade
absorbs god spirit,

245
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,030
then it can open the barrier
of the Abyssal Prison.

246
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,700
Stop it now!

247
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:28,900
Are you okay?

248
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:33,500
Are you alright?

249
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,940
Why are you here?

250
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,590
- I...
- Your Godship, be careful!

251
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,980
Yin used devil energy and the
Fire Phoenix Jade to absorb your god spirit.

252
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,870
Shut up!

253
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,590
Everyone clearly saw it just now.

254
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:58,110
Are you demons really
colluding with the devils?

255
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,660
Yin is definitely not a devil.

256
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:00,950
Your Godship!

257
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,820
She attempted to open
the Abyssal Prison barrier.

258
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,020
Luckily, we discovered it in time.

259
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:08,740
She must be colluding with the devils
and trying to provoke war.

260
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,900
Your Godship, you cannot condone this.

261
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,220
It's not like that.

262
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,940
I felt the Fire Phoenix Jade shake
and found this place.

263
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:23,460
Then I saw His Godship's god spirit
being absorbed by the devil energy.

264
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,260
But I don't know why I could enter
the devil formation.

265
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,350
Every word I said is true.

266
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:37,790
The Fire Phoenix Jade is here. Take it.

267
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,590
The matter is unclear.
Don't accuse her without reason.

268
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,240
Be cautious in your words.

269
00:25:57,720 --> 00:26:00,700
The Fire Phoenix Jade is related to
Her Ladyship Feng Yin of our Phoenix Clan

270
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:03,910
and only she can sense it.

271
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:07,240
How dare you, a mere immortal beast
speak nonsense.

272
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,870
Yin can indeed sense it.

273
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,660
I can vouch for her.

274
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,110
Now that the Fire Phoenix Jade
has been returned,

275
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,630
it won't hinder Feng Yin's return.

276
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,460
Your Godship, you just said that
the Fire Phoenix Jade was stolen by Qing Lin.

277
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:25,150
Why did it appear in Yin's hands?

278
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:28,460
Moreover, the Fire Phoenix Jade
is a god tool.

279
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,900
Why was it absorbing your god spirit?

280
00:26:31,790 --> 00:26:35,550
The only explanation is that
it's controlled by devil energy.

281
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,700
A moment ago, Yin controlled the devil energy
and absorbed your god spirit. Everyone saw it.

282
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:43,110
How would everyone believe that
she doesn't cultivate devil skills?

283
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:45,790
Yin can indeed purify devil energy.

284
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:50,740
As for the reason, I can't disclose it.

285
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,980
Your Godship, you insist on defending Yin,

286
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,030
aren't you afraid she's colluding with devils,
and causing chaos in the Three Realms?

287
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:58,900
If you protect her for personal reasons,

288
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:01,180
how can Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng
rest in peace?

289
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,500
And as a God, how can you gain the trust
of the Three Realms?

290
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:14,220
I'm a Water Divine Beast,
so I can purify devil energy.

291
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,480
Yin!

292
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:21,740
If you don't believe me, you can check.

293
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,460
There is still a Water Divine Beast alive
in this world.

294
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,940
Since you're a Water Divine Beast,
why did you hide your true form?

295
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,900
It was me.

296
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,660
I deliberately concealed it,

297
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,180
fearing that those with ill intentions
might harm her.

298
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,460
With me protecting her,
who dares to touch her?

299
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:09,180
I will kill anyone who tries.

300
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:12,110
Hong Yi, stop causing trouble.

301
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,940
When I released you, I told you

302
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,180
to find the truth and prove your innocence.

303
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,350
I never wanted to see the situation today.

304
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,630
But why did it still happen?

305
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:27,800
I had no choice.

306
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:31,470
Should I watch you face punishment
in the Heavenly Palace?

307
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:32,870
That's what I deserve.

308
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,980
The destruction of Daze Mountain

309
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,740
and all the karma I planted, I must bear.

310
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:43,550
I have no regrets about releasing you
from the Heavenly Palace,

311
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,590
but in today's battle,

312
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:54,070
many lives fell because of my actions.
I have to bear consequences.

313
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,550
I beg you,

314
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,110
don't intervene in the affairs
of the immortals anymore.

315
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,590
Hong Yi,

316
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,070
if you still remember what happened
in the Abyssal Prison,

317
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,900
I plead with you to sign a peace pact

318
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,740
with the Immortal Realm and immediately
withdraw your army.

319
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,870
Alright, I agree.

320
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:45,870
For the sake of Yin,
I can sign a peace agreement.

321
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,630
Which one of you will
make the pact with me?

322
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,390
But... Who will...

323
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,870
You are a demigod,

324
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:01,550
who else can make it with you?

325
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:06,590
I will represent the Immortal Realm
and form the pact with you.

326
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,110
The peace agreement is set.

327
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:35,980
From today, immortals and demons
must not provoke wars at will.

328
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,630
Anyone who violates this oath
will face divine punishment.

329
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:43,220
Both sides, withdraw.

330
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:44,390
Hold on.

331
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,590
The Water Divine Beast's internal core
can not only purify devil energy

332
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,980
but also conceal them.

333
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,900
If there's still
hidden devil energy in her body,

334
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,920
it's too dangerous for the Immortal Realm.

335
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,740
Yin is a disciple of Daze Mountain,

336
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,500
our master ordered me to take care of her.

337
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:19,460
If you don't want to take her back
to the Immortal Realm,

338
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,500
I'll take her to Qingchi Palace.

339
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:25,260
Your Godship,
you and Yin are fellow disciples.

340
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,180
In the urgency of the moment,
protecting her is understandable.

341
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,870
However, I request Your Godship
to consider the reputation

342
00:31:31,870 --> 00:31:33,350
of the Three Realms and your sect.

343
00:31:33,830 --> 00:31:35,700
The calamity of Daze Mountain
started with her.

344
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,740
If you protect her today,

345
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,350
won't it tarnish the reputation
of Daze Mountain?

346
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:46,660
Please make a fair decision, Your Godship.

347
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,620
Please make a fair decision.

348
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:10,180
Bring down Heavenly Thunder to protect
the peace of our Immortal Realm.

349
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,940
With Yin's current immortal power,

350
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,830
whether or not she harbors devil energy,

351
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,390
she will dissipate
under Heavenly Thunder.

352
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:19,830
What do you want to do?

353
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,180
Do you have to kill her?

354
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,030
Please, Your Godship, make a fair decision
and bring down Heavenly Thunder.

355
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:32,310
If you dare to do anything to her,

356
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:36,590
I will break the pact even if I have to
face divine punishment!

357
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:54,460
It is all because of you,
a Water Divine Beast,

358
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,350
who tangles His Godship stubbornly.

359
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:59,340
You, with wishful thinking,

360
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:02,140
insisted on bringing this calamity to him.

361
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,730
Do you know why His Godship
doesn't want to see you now?

362
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,260
It's all because of you that
Daze Mountain was destroyed.

363
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:14,110
Then please tell us
how you will handle Yin.

364
00:33:14,590 --> 00:33:16,420
If I hadn't left Daze Mountain,

365
00:33:17,790 --> 00:33:19,590
I could've stopped all this
from happening.

366
00:33:26,110 --> 00:33:28,030
I am willing to receive
the Heavenly Thunder punishment

367
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:33,420
to prove my innocence.

368
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:35,110
Yin!

369
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,550
You don't have to pressure His Godship.

370
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,420
It's my fault, my personal mistake.

371
00:33:45,110 --> 00:33:46,070
I know I am guilty,

372
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,870
and I will bear it alone
without shifting blame.

373
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:58,150
But this matter has nothing to do
with Daze Mountain.

374
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,390
If you insult my sect again,

375
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:09,700
even if I have to risk my life,
I will defend Daze Mountain.

376
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:23,470
Your Godship,

377
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:26,860
I released Hong Yi
from the Immortal-locking Tower,

378
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,470
leading to the tragedy in Ghost Land.

379
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:34,280
It's my fault, and I admit it.

380
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:39,780
But if you say I plotted against
Daze Mountain, and harmed His Godship,

381
00:34:41,710 --> 00:34:45,990
I won't admit it. Never.

382
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,150
Please, Your Godship, bring down
the Heavenly Thunder.

383
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:53,950
Only this way
can my innocence be proved.

384
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:59,150
After this, let bygones be bygones,

385
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:03,180
and do not let it involve
Daze Mountain and Your Godship.

386
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,150
Do you even understand
what you're saying?

387
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:12,700
Don't you get what I just said?

388
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:16,220
Enough.

389
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,110
If you insist on a resolution,

390
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,800
how about this?

391
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:31,180
Water Divine Beasts are weak
and should be nurtured in Ningyun Mountain.

392
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,180
I will seal her immortal bones

393
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:40,150
and use the Spirit Sword to destroy
Ningyun Mountain, cutting off her escape route.

394
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,780
This way, regardless of whether there is
devil energy in her body or not,

395
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:44,910
she won't be able to do anything.

396
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,820
Are you satisfied with this?

397
00:36:00,110 --> 00:36:00,950
You...

398
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:04,700
You want to destroy Ningyun Mountain?

399
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,510
I am willing
to accept the punishment, really.

400
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:16,700
Spirit Sword!

401
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:21,110
Wait!

402
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,490
Wait!

403
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,330
Wait!

404
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,430
I am willing to accept the punishment,
Your Godship.

405
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:29,150
I really am willing to accept the punishment.

406
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,200
Your Godship.

407
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:32,570
Your Godship, I beg you.

408
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:34,950
You know how important
Ningyun Mountain is to me.

409
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,710
Your Godship, I beg you.

410
00:36:41,710 --> 00:36:43,030
The decision has been made.

411
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,690
- It's a done deal.
- I beg you.

412
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:45,530
I beg...

413
00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:47,430
No!
