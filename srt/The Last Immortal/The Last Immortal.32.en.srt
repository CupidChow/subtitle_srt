=Episode 32=

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,660
You may rise, ladies.

30
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:44,830
I'm usually easygoing.

31
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,500
Anytime you meet me,
you don't need to kneel. Just curtsy.

32
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,900
- Thank you, Your Majesty.
- Thank you, Your Majesty.

33
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,180
I have something to say,
Your Majesty.

34
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,310
Her Majesty Feng Yuan
and His Godship Yuan Qi

35
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,150
made me the Acting Heavenly Empress
as early as a thousand years ago.

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,780
So, I can no longer
curtsy to you as a subordinate.

37
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,020
Please kindly understand.

38
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,390
But according to the heavenly rules,

39
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:23,830
Her Majesty should curtsy
to the Heavenly Empress.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,780
Hua Shu is the Acting Heavenly Empress.

41
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:30,710
But she's been treated
as the Heavenly Empress.

42
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,950
Are you saying
I should curtsy to Hua Shu?

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:40,020
I'm just reminding you
not to forget the heavenly etiquette.

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,740
Thank you for reminding me, then.

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,990
Etiquette must be strictly obeyed.

46
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,390
But Hua Shu, you don't curtsy
to the Phoenix Queen.

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,060
Is it your own idea
or is it the Peacock King's?

48
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,550
What do you mean?

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,550
Today, the Peacock King will come, right?

50
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,900
When he sees the Phoenix Queen,
he'll have to kneel, too.

51
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,700
Your Majesty, as his daughter,

52
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,110
will you just stand around
and watch him kneel?

53
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,740
Hua Shu, you just said
you were made the Acting Empress.

54
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,830
Staying on Wutong Island,
I'm very ignorant.

55
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,180
I wonder if you still have
the royal edict.

56
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,900
Can I have a look?

57
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,860
There wasn't an edict.

58
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,430
But the nomination
was recorded in history.

59
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,460
Phoenix Queen, are you
questioning Her Majesty?

60
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,670
Without the edict, you aren't
the real ruler of the Immortal Realm.

61
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,110
Over hundreds of thousands of years,
we phoenixes have been worshiped by all birds.

62
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,180
If you no longer take me as your queen,

63
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,550
I need a good explanation for my clan.

64
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,130
You either show me the edict

65
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,350
or because of you,
your clan will be expelled.

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:56,190
You!

67
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,060
Your Majesty, as the Acting Empress,

68
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:01,400
you don't need to be subordinate
to the Phoenix Clan for the moment.

69
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:06,620
But your father and your clansmen
will be regarded as traitors.

70
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,230
It's about us. What does it have to do
with my father or my clansmen?

71
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,510
They never mean to disrespect you.

72
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,900
You're trumping up a charge.

73
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:18,710
Sounds like you'll completely
break off with your clan.

74
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,640
Good.

75
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,980
That's fine if you become
the Heavenly Empress.

76
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:30,100
But what if you fail to be that?

77
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,460
If she doesn't break off,
her clansmen will be traitors.

78
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,420
I think she should apologize
and curtsy to the Phoenix Queen.

79
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:42,590
Why so stubborn?

80
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,460
- Yeah.
- That's right.

81
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:46,440
Your Majesty, why don't you just
apologize to the Phoenix Queen?

82
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,780
She will let you go.

83
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:51,980
Your Majesty, focus on the big picture.

84
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,270
I'm Hua Shu from Bainiao Island.

85
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,900
Greetings, Phoenix Queen.

86
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,320
Forget it.

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,780
Sorry to have spoilt your mood.

88
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,420
It's mere courtesy
and superficial etiquette.

89
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,340
But you look so grudging

90
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,420
as if I was deliberately embarrassing you.

91
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,150
I'll let go of what happened today.

92
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,750
But Hua Shu, a word of warning.
Hope you can learn your lesson,

93
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,980
always remember who you are,

94
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,340
and never provoke me again.

95
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,340
I'll always keep that in mind.

96
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,270
You may rise.

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,190
Yuan Qi.

98
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,420
- Greetings, Your Godship.
- Greetings, Your Godship.

99
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,510
There's no need of that here.
You may rise.

100
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,340
- Thank you, Your Godship.
- Thank you, Your Godship.

101
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,718
Inheriting from the God Realm,

102
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:19,970
the Phoenix Queen has the status
of the Heavenly Ruler.

103
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,150
Only the Heavenly Emperor or Empress
doesn't need to bow to her.

104
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,510
In this world, the only certificated ruler

105
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:28,510
is Empress Feng Yuan.

106
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:37,580
The Phoenix Queen is easygoing

107
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,220
and doesn't bother
about the heavenly etiquette.

108
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,710
But it doesn't mean
anyone can disrespect her.

109
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:48,400
The more status one has,
the more rule-abiding she should be.

110
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:50,710
Am I right, Empress Hua Shu?

111
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,340
You're right, Your Godship.

112
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,780
Your Majesty, for His Godship's sake,

113
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,830
please forgive my reckless speech.

114
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,070
I said I would let it go.

115
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,510
No need to get His Godship involved.

116
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,630
I think His Godship has something...

117
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,020
Oh, no. Some instructions to tell Hua Shu.

118
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,520
Excuse me.

119
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:32,480
What's going on here?

120
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:33,790
Doesn't His Godship adore Her Majesty?

121
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,340
Why is he following the Phoenix Queen?

122
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Yeah.

123
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,670
Yu.

124
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,560
Let me do it.

125
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,390
You must be thirty.

126
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,850
Thank you, Yuan Qi.

127
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:51,700
You're welcome.

128
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,540
Why don't you rest somewhere else?

129
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,900
I have nowhere else to go.

130
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:03,630
This place doesn't seem to be crowded.

131
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,220
How about we sit together?

132
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:10,980
Tastes great.

133
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,950
Don't think you can push your luck

134
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:17,510
just because I borrowed something from you.

135
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,110
I've had my say. Don't bother me anymore.

136
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:26,750
Feng Yin, I actually want
to discuss the banquet thing with you.

137
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,940
- Greetings, Your Godship.
- Greetings, Your Godship.

138
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,020
You may rise.

139
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,940
Your Godship, it's about time.

140
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,660
Shall I send someone
to rush the Phoenix Queen?

141
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,230
No need. She often gets lost.

142
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,750
It's a mere banquet. Let's wait for her.

143
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,500
Your Godship, when I was
observing the stars,

144
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:23,270
I saw your Star of Love twinkle.
You seem to have good luck with marriage.

145
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,940
Speaking of this,

146
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:27,700
some of our relatives

147
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,150
are young, beautiful, and unmarried.

148
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,940
Your Godship, you're in the prime of life.

149
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:37,540
I wonder if you want to marry some ladies
who can take care of you here.

150
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:38,820
No need.

151
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,510
I appreciate your kind offer.

152
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,180
Your Godship, do you
not want to get married

153
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,870
or do you want to marry someone else?

154
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,150
(The Peacock Totem is about to appear.)

155
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,390
- Welcome, Your Majesty.
- Welcome, Your Majesty.

156
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,940
Please don't bother.

157
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:14,080
What's going on here?

158
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:15,870
Nothing.

159
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,390
You're just in time.

160
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,540
The Phoenix Queen appeared
with radiant splendor.

161
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,870
She must be the one for His Godship.

162
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,800
Your Godship, you were born
with the power of chaos

163
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,240
and have protected the Three Lower Realms
for more than a thousand years.

164
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,660
On behalf of the immortals,
I'd like to thank you for your grace.

165
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:52,820
We wish you a long life
and endless happiness.

166
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,270
Save the pleasantries.

167
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:59,180
Thank you everyone
for preparing this banquet for me.

168
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:01,110
Some of my guests are coming.

169
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,390
I hope you will receive them with me.

170
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,780
Don't stand on ceremony, Your Godship.

171
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,990
Since your guests are coming,
I will show them a good time.

172
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:24,590
Demon King, you can't get in!

173
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,750
Demon King, you can't get in!

174
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,970
Demon King, you...

175
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,160
How daring, you foxes!

176
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:38,350
You invited yourselves
to His Godship's birthday banquet.

177
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,420
How aggressive!

178
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:42,420
Lightning Lord, take them down
with your soldiers.

179
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:44,990
Wait.

180
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,270
They're exactly my guests.

181
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,270
Don't fight or hurt each other's feelings.

182
00:12:57,670 --> 00:12:59,060
But why, Your Godship?

183
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,700
The Demon King is here
to investigate the devils.

184
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:06,020
Devils?

185
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,110
What devils?

186
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,510
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

187
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:09,840
- What devils?
- Yeah.

188
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:11,110
I've never heard about it before.

189
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:16,870
Lately, the Demon King and I
have found quite a lot of clues.

190
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,990
And a thousand years ago,
devils started the Immortal-Demon War.

191
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,990
It still remains doubtful.

192
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:27,990
Why don't we take this chance
to make everything clear?

193
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,110
A thousand years ago,
devils stirred up trouble.

194
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,070
But demons truly committed crimes.

195
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,010
Hong Yi not only killed Lan Feng,

196
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,060
but also slaughtered Daze Mountain.

197
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,350
What have you to say now?

198
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:48,590
When you accuse him of killing,
can you prove it?

199
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:52,700
The other immortals and I
witnessed it in the Truth Mirror.

200
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:55,270
How could it be false?

201
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,180
Hua Shu,

202
00:13:56,670 --> 00:14:01,230
are you sure it was the Demon King
that you saw in the Truth Mirror?

203
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,020
You didn't experience that.

204
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,300
What right do you have
to talk about the truth?

205
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,180
She didn't experience that.

206
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,060
But someone else did.

207
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,230
What is he doing here?

208
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,820
I'm Qing Yi from Daze Mountain.

209
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,780
My sect was exterminated
a thousand years ago.

210
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,200
I think I'm qualified
to request a reinvestigation

211
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,180
on the massacre of my sect

212
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,020
and ask for justice.

213
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,390
That year, eleven senior immortals

214
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,470
saw the Demon King try to kill you.

215
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,060
Can there be any other reason?

216
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,300
What you witnessed indeed happened.

217
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,300
But that wasn't all the truth.

218
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,470
I'm sure the Demon King did that
because he was manipulated by devils.

219
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,150
I can be his witness, too.

220
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:09,020
If the Demon King hadn't
regained consciousness at the last minute

221
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,530
or hurt himself with the Nirvana Wheel,

222
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:12,820
Qing Yi and I wouldn't have escaped.

223
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,510
I support the Phoenix Queen
in reinvestigating the case for the truth.

224
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,660
I agree, too.

225
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:26,750
A thousand years ago, devils stole my sword
and killed Demon King Lin Sen

226
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,590
so that I was wrongly accused.

227
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,820
So, I earnestly request
a reinvestigation to vindicate me.

228
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:40,630
Qing Lin killed Emperor Lan Feng
and the late Demon King.

229
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,270
She framed the Wind Lord and me

230
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,763
just to aggravate the conflict

231
00:15:45,787 --> 00:15:47,590
between immortals and demons and start a war.

232
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,940
Then devils could
be the real beneficiary.

233
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,200
That's right.

234
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,420
Qing Lin had access
to the Heavenly Palace.

235
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:56,150
Someone must have been helping her.

236
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,660
If we don't get rid of the traitor,
there will be endless trouble.

237
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,700
Your Godship, hope you can
also find out the mole of devils

238
00:16:04,550 --> 00:16:06,150
and bring peace back to the world.

239
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,300
During the fight in the Ghost Land,

240
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,800
Yin was the one who helped Qing Lin.

241
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,800
Exactly.

242
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:19,440
After she entered the Secret Storeroom,

243
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,470
the God-killing Flower was stolen
and later planted on Daze Mountain.

244
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,190
Except her, who else could do both?

245
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:28,020
Yin was His Godship's...

246
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:28,860
Shut up!

247
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,310
Do you have to set Yin up

248
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,900
for colluding with devils?

249
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,900
Well, since everybody is here,

250
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,590
let's watch the truth together.

251
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,780
This is the Cloud Pearl of Original Chaos
I made with the broken Truth Mirror.

252
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,390
With enough spiritual power,

253
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,060
it can activate
the Spirit-mixing Truth Formation

254
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,990
and go back to any space-time in the past.

255
00:16:55,510 --> 00:16:57,540
Let's get back to the scene
and find out what happened.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,270
The truth will come out.

257
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,560
Good.

258
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,390
I've refined Zhuo Ying Ring.

259
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:09,150
With Qing Lin's weapon,

260
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,550
we can quickly locate where she was.

261
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,070
Tokens of the Five Lords
are needed for this formation.

262
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,660
Together with Chaos Power,
we can go back to the past.

263
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:21,590
Now, His Godship
and the Five Lords are here.

264
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,030
It's the best time to activate
the Spirit-mixing Truth Formation.

265
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,390
After them.

266
00:18:39,350 --> 00:18:41,180
- See you, Your Majesty.
- See you, Your Majesty.

267
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:46,630
It's really Feng Ming.

268
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:00,350
Let's go.

269
00:19:23,110 --> 00:19:26,740
So, Feng Ming and Zhuo Ying Ring
stole the God-killing Flower.

270
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:31,150
Get Feng Ming to us!

271
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,460
Let's find Qing Lin first.

272
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,280
Look over there.

273
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,530
Wait... Wait.

274
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:21,500
Wait.

275
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,830
I beg you, Your Godship.

276
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,310
You know how much
Ningyun Mountain means to me!

277
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,420
No!

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,590
We immortals owe it to Yin.

279
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:12,480
He disappeared.

280
00:21:13,270 --> 00:21:14,590
He used Ningyun Mountain's barrier.

281
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,630
Indeed, Qing Lin's accomplice
stole the sword and framed the Wind Lord.

282
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:21,630
Sadly, we didn't see his face clearly.

283
00:21:26,590 --> 00:21:28,260
Let's go back to the day
Lan Feng was killed.

284
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,870
Qing Lin's accomplice!

285
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,470
He must be the traitor

286
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:19,980
who got Qing Lin into the Palace
and stole my sword.

287
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:34,310
What's wrong?

288
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:40,460
Oh, no. The formation is damaged.

289
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,350
They're in danger.

290
00:22:43,310 --> 00:22:44,660
Feng Yin...

291
00:22:53,030 --> 00:22:53,870
What's going on?

292
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,420
Something's wrong
with the formation, I think.

293
00:23:05,590 --> 00:23:06,430
Are you all right?

294
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:07,840
Yes.

295
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,830
Now that you want
Ningyun Mountain that much,

296
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,660
you'll have it, for Hong Yi's sake.

297
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,180
(Tablet)

298
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,150
(So, that's how
Gu Jin got back Ningyun Mountain.)

299
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,500
(To help me...)

300
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:02,550
How's that possible?

301
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:24,050
Where's Feng Yin?

302
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:24,900
Not with me.

303
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,320
Let's go check over there.

304
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,870
For me, my junior sister Yin
sacrificed her lifespan.

305
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,180
I must make the pill to save her life.

306
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:43,070
I know there's a beast core
on the Peacock Feather Crown of your clan.

307
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:47,420
So, I'm here to borrow the Crown from you.

308
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:49,550
I don't think my father or my clansmen...

309
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:50,830
As long as you lend it to me,

310
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,420
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

311
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:56,900
This is a jade seal for commitment.

312
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,340
If you need my help in the future,

313
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,350
show this jade seal, and I'll fulfill my oath.

314
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,520
Are you all right?

315
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:16,480
I'm fine.

316
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,840
Glad to hear that.

317
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,630
We must get out immediately.

318
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,150
I guess the formation is collapsing.

319
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,900
Let's try together
and break out of here as light.

320
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:49,870
- Your Ladyship.
- Feng Yin.

321
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,630
Martial Uncle, are you all right?

322
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:54,870
Feng Yin, are you all right?

323
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,700
Hong Yi, are you all right?

324
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,540
I'm fine.

325
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:20,900
Confess! Was it you who planted
God-killing Flower on Daze Mountain,

326
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:23,010
colluded with Qing Lin,
and killed Lan Feng?

327
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:23,910
No...

328
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:26,590
I'm going to kill you for Lan Feng.

329
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,040
I'm sorry for your loss, Your Majesty.

330
00:26:35,790 --> 00:26:39,390
Feng Ming deserves legal punishment
for his evil doings.

331
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,790
But he hasn't confessed enough.

332
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:45,070
It's too early to punish him now.

333
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,150
Your Majesty, it makes sense.

334
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,310
Feng Ming committed numerous crimes
and we will punish him for everything.

335
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:59,460
But however angry you are,
please bear with it.

336
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,630
After he confesses everything,
I'll execute him myself.

337
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
Your Majesty,

338
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,390
I did steal the God-killing Flower's seed.

339
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:15,740
But I didn't plant it.

340
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,590
Nor did I kill Lan Feng.

341
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,000
Indeed.

342
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,110
I colluded with devils for greedy desires.

343
00:27:23,680 --> 00:27:27,980
But I only wanted to get the Fire Phoenix Jade
and stop you from coming back

344
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:30,110
in case I lose my position
in the Phoenix Clan.

345
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:33,260
I didn't do anything else.

346
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,260
Before, I ordered to declare
that Yin was innocent.

347
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,910
But for your dignity,
you refused to admit your mistake

348
00:27:56,910 --> 00:27:59,220
and insisted on having a scapegoat
to make yourselves feel better.

349
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:00,790
Now, everybody is here

350
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:04,420
and you've seen
what happened in the flashback.

351
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,070
You should know. Yin wasn't the sinner.

352
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:10,070
I am announcing today.

353
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:14,110
First, Yin of Daze Mountain,

354
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:20,830
the Wind Lord, and Demon King Hong Yi

355
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,180
are innocent victims framed by devils.

356
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,910
From this day on,
if anyone dares to spread rumors again,

357
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:31,310
I won't show mercy.

358
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:36,150
Second, Daze Mountain was destroyed.

359
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:39,660
Lan Feng and Lin Sen were killed.

360
00:28:40,270 --> 00:28:43,500
The accomplice hasn't been caught yet.
I'll investigate until we catch him.

361
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:48,030
According to laws,
Feng Ming will be given Thunder Strike

362
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,310
and put into the Heavenly Prison
until the accomplice is caught.

363
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:55,070
Devils killed Lan Feng
and the late Demon King

364
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,390
to sow discord between immortals and demons.
Daze Mountain was destroyed.

365
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:01,220
Yin of Daze Mountain
died a wrongful death.

366
00:29:02,350 --> 00:29:04,110
A lot of people died in the Ghost Land.

367
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:07,660
Everyone in the Three Realms
will mourn and repent.

368
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:13,310
From this day on, I want
immortals and demons to stop hating

369
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:14,740
and make up with each other

370
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,110
in case we are used by devils again.

371
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,870
- We will, Your Godship.
- We will, Your Godship.

372
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,000
I heard God Li just got
a new magic weapon.

373
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,590
- Let's go have a look.
- All right.

374
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:53,350
Greetings.

375
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,280
Yan Shuang.

376
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,830
Shuang, do you need to talk to him?

377
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:05,280
No.

378
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:11,560
No...

379
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:12,560
No?

380
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,550
I was late for just once.

381
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,310
Hurry. They're waiting for us.

382
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,630
Your Majesty, you wanted to see me?

383
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:30,700
In the flashback, I saw Lan Feng
take the punishment for you.

384
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:39,900
You tampered with the Truth Mirror, right?

385
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:41,630
Yes. So what?

386
00:30:42,830 --> 00:30:45,150
I only did the Fox Clan a little favor.

387
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,870
You still refuse to tell the truth.

388
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:55,740
You just wanted to get rid of Yin
who stood in your way, right?

389
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,180
Anyway, it didn't have much of an impact.

390
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:02,950
Don't try to get me involved.

391
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:04,980
Didn't have much of an impact?

392
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:08,940
Do you know Qing Lin was taking over
the Fox Queen's body at that time?

393
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,150
How dare you say

394
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:16,030
it didn't have much of an impact?

395
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,220
You don't need to panic, though.

396
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,430
Since Lan Feng figured out
you didn't collude with devils

397
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,830
and he took the punishment,

398
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:31,980
for his sake, I won't bring it up again.

399
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,310
What do you want, then?

400
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,630
I respect Emperor Lan Feng.

401
00:31:41,030 --> 00:31:42,420
He wanted to protect you.

402
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,740
Instead of telling the truth,
he took the punishment himself.

403
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,740
I'll certainly respect his choice.

404
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:53,940
Today, I'm here just to tell you this.

405
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,900
You'd better behave yourself.

406
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,220
Don't waste Lan Feng's love for you.

407
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,180
(Feng Yin and Lan Feng never met before.)

408
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,940
(Why did she let me go
for Lan Feng's sake?)

409
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,390
(What is she up to?)

410
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:31,590
You were injured in the turbulence.

411
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,840
Let me check.

412
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,080
I'm fine.

413
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:37,950
Just let me check.

414
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:40,630
Such an injury can hardly be healed.

415
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,110
Does it hurt?

416
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:14,070
Thank you, Your Godship.

417
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:16,950
Are you fine?

418
00:33:17,750 --> 00:33:19,940
You saw the flashback. I'm worried...

419
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,870
After dying a wrongful death,
Yin was vindicated.

420
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,260
Those who are guilty are exposed.
Nothing can upset me.

421
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,590
But you shouldn't have suffered this.

422
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,500
I should have taken good care of Yin.

423
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,630
Now, I believe

424
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,030
you really want to help Yin
find out the truth.

425
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:47,310
I will cooperate with you.

426
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,790
- Really?
- But that's all.

427
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,560
Fine.

428
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:55,110
I just have something to tell you.

429
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:58,460
Feng Ming is a lefty when he does spells.

430
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:01,940
But the one who planted
the God-killing Flower used his right hand.

431
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:14,910
Feng Ming didn't lie.

432
00:34:15,230 --> 00:34:18,300
But it doesn't mean
we can't get anything new from him.

433
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:20,510
That's exactly what I think.

434
00:34:22,030 --> 00:34:24,590
Feng Ming is just back from Qinglong Platform
after the Thunder Strike.

435
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,820
Let's go ask him.

436
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:31,740
After the Thunder Strike,
he would wish he had died.

437
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:37,150
Since he colluded with devils,
I guess he'll be locked here forever.

438
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,240
Let's go.

439
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,110
I can't die.

440
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,380
I've been trying for thousands of years.

441
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:02,340
I can't spend
the rest of my life in prison.

442
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,780
I just can't.

443
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,300
Oh, right.

444
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:09,150
I can atone for my sins.

445
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,590
Someone will lure Lan Feng away.

446
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:17,700
You just find a chance
and replace the Arrow.

447
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,070
Don't worry about the Truth Mirror
in the Secret Storeroom.

448
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,510
The record will be erased without a trace.

449
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:29,070
Who was it?

450
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:35,340
Who could erase the record
in the Truth Mirror?

451
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:38,430
Simple mission.

452
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,910
Make Xian Shan, Xian Zhu,
and Gu Jin leave Daze Mountain.

453
00:35:43,550 --> 00:35:46,180
I'll have someone else
take care of the rest.

454
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:58,760
- The gesture...
- It must be him!

455
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,590
He released the devil energy
to kill His Godship!

456
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,340
It's him!

457
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:08,680
Somebody!

458
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
I know it.

459
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,790
I know who colluded with devils!

460
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,340
I know who it is!

461
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:14,470
I want...

462
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,860
I want to see Yuan Qi!

463
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:16,990
I want to see...

464
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,340
We failed our duty.
We're ready for punishment, Your Godship.

465
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,740
He was killed by devil energy.

466
00:37:07,740 --> 00:37:08,630
A devil talisman.

467
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:10,700
I don't know when it was used.

468
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,630
He's already dead.

469
00:37:13,590 --> 00:37:15,780
This devil cultivator must be a demigod.

470
00:37:16,190 --> 00:37:19,660
We didn't sense him and he moved so fast.

471
00:37:20,590 --> 00:37:22,340
He may be among the immortals just now.

472
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,070
What else can we do about this?

473
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:57,140
(Fengyi Palace)

474
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,280
Feng Yin.

475
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,390
Eagle King.

476
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,630
Yan Shuang, why are you also here?

477
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,150
For some business with my father.

478
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,860
I heard Feng Ming was killed in prison.

479
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,470
By devil energy.

480
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,220
This is what we're talking about.

481
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,990
He was so quickly killed
even in the Heavenly Prison.

482
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:20,950
Who could have done that?

483
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,300
We checked the tracks
of all immortals yesterday.

484
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,820
Nothing was unusual.

485
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:29,820
The murderer is more cunning
than we think he is.

486
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:37,030
There's a way
to find out the devil immortal.

487
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,860
Devil energy and god light always repel.

488
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,820
In the god light,

489
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:45,340
all devil energy will be exposed.

490
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,380
However, we can't get god light

491
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,070
unless an immortal demigod
and a demon demigod get married.

492
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,350
By then, the god light
will be given as a present.

493
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,630
Everyone who comes to the wedding,

494
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:03,030
whether he is a demon or immortal,
can bask in the light for more power.

495
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,630
But with plenty of contradictions,
immortals and demons never get along very well.

496
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,790
I don't think it will work.

497
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:16,550
The god light will appear at the wedding

498
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,950
and it's a great thing
once in a million years.

499
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:21,180
Even if they don't get along very well,

500
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,660
they'll come to congratulate
and bask in the god light.

501
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,470
If someone doesn't come,
he'll be rather suspicious.

502
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,630
He has never responded directly.

503
00:39:34,230 --> 00:39:37,590
He actually loves someone else.

504
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,220
When you know he loves someone else,

505
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,380
why do you keep waiting hopelessly?

506
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:54,340
You two are demigods.

507
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:57,110
One of you is an immortal
and the other is a demon.

508
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,240
Would you like
to get married and try?

509
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,820
It won't work.

510
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,260
I can do it.

511
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:11,990
Why would I not?

512
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:13,320
Hong Yi.

513
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:15,590
I mean, this will work.

514
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,340
You and I pretend to get married

515
00:40:17,510 --> 00:40:20,820
just to find out the devil cultivator.

516
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,420
I said, it won't...

517
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:29,070
This is the best we can do now.

518
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:33,180
Feng Yin, everyone knows
you're close to Hong Yi.

519
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:37,240
His aunt also asked you to marry him.

520
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:40,150
When you marry him,
no one will suspect that.

521
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,310
Yan Shuang...

522
00:40:42,310 --> 00:40:44,380
Like you said, that devil cultivator
is nearly a demigod.

523
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,990
If we still delay,
there'll be endless trouble.

524
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,340
You can't hesitate anymore.

525
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,780
You should get married.

526
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,760
Yeah.

527
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:59,070
We thought it over but couldn't
come up with a better idea.

528
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:03,380
It would be good
to have you sacrifice for the big plan.

529
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Feng Yin, are you worried about Yuan Qi?

530
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,380
It has nothing to do with him.

531
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:29,070
Fine.

532
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,030
I'll marry you.

533
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:37,070
Well, I owe you one.

534
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,510
When it's over,
I'll explain it to everyone.

535
00:41:42,030 --> 00:41:43,070
That's all right.

536
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:44,470
I'll have the wedding arranged.

537
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:50,550
But anyway, I'll write
the invitation to Yuan Qi myself.
