00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,780
Otherwise, I don't think

187
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,630
you deserve her in this condition.

188
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,750
The devils. I'll find them myself.

189
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:26,540
But I'll never give up finding Yin.

190
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,540
She's still here. I can feel her.

191
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,390
Whether it takes ten years, a hundred,

192
00:15:40,630 --> 00:15:42,440
a thousand,

193
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:46,300
or ten thousand years, I'll find her.

194
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,180
I'll look for her as long as I can.

195
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,590
We'll meet again eventually.

196
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:56,220
(Ghost Land, the border between
the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm)

197
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,920
Jiu.

198
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,990
Jiu.

199
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,630
This is the end of Ghost Land.

200
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,390
Your Soul Restorer and my Eagle Eye
can't be wrong.

201
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,270
We've been searching for so long.

202
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,750
But there's still not a trace of
Yin's residual spirit.

203
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,940
Yin is really gone.

204
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:27,390
I don't believe it.

205
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,060
I don't believe it.

206
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:32,700
Yin! Yin!

207
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,440
Jiu.

208
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,660
If I had taken Yin away
from Daze Mountain earlier,

209
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:45,900
she wouldn't have died.

210
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,870
What's this?

211
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,260
This is my aunt's pendant.

212
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,110
Why is your aunt's pendant...

213
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:26,550
(Aunt is seriously injured.
Why did she come here?)

214
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,240
Who is it?

215
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,110
Aunt.

216
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,310
What happened to your hand?

217
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:45,660
Aunt, you really attacked me!

218
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,740
I've never been an active enemy
of the immortals.

219
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:51,880
But they knew no gratitude
and killed our kind in secret.

220
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,720
It's not right.

221
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:56,300
The shape of the wound looks familiar,
like a demon's job.

222
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,900
Before coming to the Ghost Land,
I met Qing Lin.

223
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,110
She ambushed me and took away
my Fire Phoenix Jade.

224
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,460
She has admitted that she controlled you
and exterminated Daze Mountain,

225
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:06,260
just to provoke the immortal-demon war.

226
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,460
You tricked me into entering the Abyss

227
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,390
and possessed me so you could
get out with me.

228
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:14,830
You finally remembered.

229
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:17,940
But I've done more than that.

230
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,000
Don't you hate your aunt Hong Ruo
the most?

231
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,260
What are you going to do to my aunt?

232
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:24,790
I've already killed her.

233
00:18:25,310 --> 00:18:27,310
Shouldn't you be thanking me?

234
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:29,220
Are you all right, Jiu?

235
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,870
Don't scare me.

236
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,260
Let me seal your memory.

237
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,700
Jiu, Jiu.

238
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,870
Jiu.

239
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,480
Jiu.

240
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:46,910
Jiu.

241
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,030
Are you all right?

242
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:51,030
Give me back my sandalwood beads.

243
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,720
How do I break it?

244
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:55,070
Use the spiritual power of your internal core.

245
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,480
So my aunt

246
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,180
died a long time ago.

247
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,590
How can this be?

248
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:22,030
Many demons have fallen into the path
of becoming the devil.

249
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,590
Every time I tried to track down them, Ruo

250
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,940
was always there.

251
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,550
And she was always one step ahead of me.

252
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,740
She was the only one there
when the Demon King died.

253
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,550
It just never occurred to me
to suspect her.

254
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,150
It happened because

255
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:52,630
I owed her too much.

256
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:54,500
It wasn't her at all.

257
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,590
I remember when you came out of
Guixu Mountain,

258
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:08,790
your aunt found devil traces in you.

259
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:13,420
She forced a string
of sandalwood beads on you.

260
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,150
There's her demon spirit on it
to protect you.

261
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,590
She had been protecting me all along.

262
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:31,420
I didn't know she was already
a victim of the devil.

263
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:38,500
Maybe she's had problems since then.

264
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:43,660
Can you help me?

265
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,660
Do you remember?

266
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:57,940
Once you wore a jade hairpin
for me like now.

267
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:02,830
I always felt that Ruo was
a different person at that time.

268
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,030
But I was so happy that she'd finally
come back to me.

269
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,500
So I neglected another possible reason
behind it.

270
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:15,350
Ruo had already been replaced
by Qing Lin.

271
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,460
A Nine-tailed Fox can only take
another Nine-tailed Fox's body.

272
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,030
There can be no mistake.

273
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:28,180
Qing Lin got out of the Abyss
by forcing her devil energy on me,

274
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,460
and then took my aunt's body.

275
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,590
Hong Yi,

276
00:21:40,350 --> 00:21:44,030
we need to get your aunt back.

277
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,350
I want to protect Daze Mountain.

278
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:06,460
I want to protect Yin too.

279
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:11,310
I wanted everything
and ended up with nothing.

280
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:13,220
What's the point?

281
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,390
Your Godship.

282
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,630
Get out!

283
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,260
It's about Yin.

284
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,150
Have you found her?

285
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,480
It's not about that.

286
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:28,440
Yin was falsely accused of working
with the devil.

287
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,220
It was Qing Lin's trap.

288
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,870
You asked me to look for her,
and I found her.

289
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,260
Where is she?

290
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,150
You're all the greatest generals
of the Demon Realm.

291
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,420
You must not forget

292
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,940
the Demon King was killed
by the immortals.

293
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:52,440
Now the immortals are off guard.

294
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,180
Slaughter the Heavenly Palace with me
to pay homage to His Majesty Lin Sen

295
00:22:56,550 --> 00:22:58,630
and the dead and wounded in Ghost Land.

296
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:05,150
Qing Lin,

297
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,630
you took my aunt's body and
possessed me to slaughter Daze Mountain.

298
00:23:10,110 --> 00:23:12,980
You're also responsible for the death of
the Demon King and Lan Feng.

299
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,220
You're a lot smarter than your aunt.

300
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,310
Then I don't need to hide anymore.

301
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:35,660
I lured you into the Abyss to take your body.

302
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,660
But your aunt was a fool.

303
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:45,420
She transferred the God-killing Flower
to herself to save your life.

304
00:23:45,830 --> 00:23:51,630
But her body was a big help to me.

305
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,030
Return my aunt.

306
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,350
Come and get her yourselves.

307
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,700
Surprise?

308
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,940
Your army has chosen to follow me.

309
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,000
Hong Yi.

310
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,720
Lin Mo.

311
00:24:23,350 --> 00:24:24,350
Believe me.

312
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:29,260
When my devil army breaks through
the Abyss and returns to the Three Realms,

313
00:24:29,550 --> 00:24:32,070
when I destroy the Immortal and
the Nether Realms,

314
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,180
you will be the new Demon King.

315
00:24:37,270 --> 00:24:41,070
I'll share the supreme position
of the Three Realms with you,

316
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,420
as long as you stand by my side.

317
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:03,220
I only want Ruo to come back.

318
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:20,150
My aunt's demon core.

319
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:22,110
What exactly do you want to do?

320
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:29,870
Lin Mo,

321
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:36,430
I originally planned to embed
her demon core in our wedding crown,

322
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,180
but you saw it ahead of time.

323
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:43,870
Even so, you'll never be with her.

324
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,070
Don't touch my aunt.

325
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:50,630
No.

326
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:06,940
Do you think killing me
and Hong Ruo is enough?

327
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:11,790
Do you know why I raise an army here?

328
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:15,070
Outside the Abyssal Prison,
under the Purple Moon,

329
00:26:15,790 --> 00:26:17,740
even if the Devil God can't get out,

330
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:21,180
there will be continuous devil power
to support me.

331
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,660
I will never die!

332
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,390
Since you are so heartless,

333
00:26:31,510 --> 00:26:33,260
I don't need to care about you anymore.

334
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,660
I will kill both of you now.

335
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:40,310
I will make the entire Demon Realm
devoid of any living creature.

336
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:44,560
Ruo!

337
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,260
Uncle Lin Mo!

338
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:00,840
Qing Lin,

339
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,240
was it really you who framed Yin?

340
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,470
So what?

341
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,640
The little Water Divine Beast
ruined my plan. She deserved it!

342
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,740
You deserve death!

343
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:47,150
You're just a devil who possesses others' body.
How dare you ruin her innocence,

344
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,460
and cause chaos in the Three Realms?
You deserve death!

345
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:54,220
Only by this, can I comfort
Hong Ruo's spirit in heaven.

346
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:02,390
Your Godship, kill this devil.

347
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:07,420
This is my wish and also Ruo's wish.

348
00:28:10,790 --> 00:28:11,980
Let me ask you again.

349
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,550
Who acted as a mole for you

350
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:17,910
to escape from the Immortal Net
of the eleven immortal lords?

351
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,310
Who conspired with you
to kill the Demon King?

352
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:24,790
I have many informants in both
the Immortal and the Demon Realms.

353
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,630
If I die, you will never know the answer.

354
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:44,790
I will find it out myself.

355
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,800
No.

356
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:56,550
No!

357
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:27,520
Are you okay?

358
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:31,800
I didn't expect the devils can cut
the connection between the Purple Moon

359
00:29:31,830 --> 00:29:33,550
and Ziyue Mountain.

360
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,590
What a meticulous plan!

361
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,390
Yin just wanted to stop them,
but she couldn't even prove herself.

362
00:29:40,510 --> 00:29:43,740
If it weren't for you not believing Yin
and sealed her immortal bones,

363
00:29:44,310 --> 00:29:47,900
no matter how meticulous the devils'
plan is, Yin would not die in vain.

364
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,110
Jiu.

365
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,870
It is indeed my fault.

366
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,940
You can blame me or hate me.

367
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,300
But now the barrier of the Abyss
is unstable.

368
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,420
The devils could break out of
the Abyss at any time.

369
00:29:59,790 --> 00:30:03,630
To stabilize the Three Realms, we need
to find out where the Purple Moon is.

370
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,320
Don't bother.

371
00:30:06,350 --> 00:30:07,700
I will find the Purple Moon myself.

372
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:11,630
From now on, you are forbidden to
enter the Demon Realm.

373
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,900
Now the demons have lost
the blessing of Purple Moon,

374
00:30:19,750 --> 00:30:22,260
I'm afraid some immortals
may come to make trouble.

375
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:30,150
Your Majesty, this is the Ever-burning
Lamp of Qingchi Palace.

376
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:33,870
Please use it to guard the Demon Realm

377
00:30:34,110 --> 00:30:37,420
and maintain a balance between the two
realms to avoid further conflicts.

378
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:43,940
I promised Yin to withdraw my troops,
I won't fight again.

379
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,870
My promise is far more important
than your Ever-burning Lamp.

380
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,180
I will find her,

381
00:30:51,270 --> 00:30:54,980
no matter where she is.

382
00:31:12,270 --> 00:31:16,870
Ming Qi is so powerful that
he can make the Purple Moon disappear.

383
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,070
I don't care. I'm going to find him now.

384
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:20,910
Ao Ge.

385
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,150
The Purple Moon disappeared
without a trace.

386
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,790
The Three Realms are so vast.
Where can you find it?

387
00:31:27,070 --> 00:31:27,910
I don't care.

388
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:32,110
Even if I have to uncover
every corner of the Three Realms,

389
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:35,660
I will find the Purple Moon
and enter the Abyssal Prison

390
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:41,350
to retrieve your remaining internal core.

391
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:44,740
Ming Qi has provoked a war
between immortals and demons.

392
00:31:45,310 --> 00:31:48,350
Many wronged dead in the Ghost Land
will enter the Nether Realm.

393
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:50,870
You cannot go now.

394
00:31:54,030 --> 00:31:55,110
Ming Qi,

395
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,500
I will never give up on this.

396
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:06,420
I will go to the Three Realms
to arrange enough agents

397
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:08,590
to search for the whereabouts
of the Purple Moon.

398
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:16,540
(Jingyou Valley, Second Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

399
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:41,180
That day in the forest,

400
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,110
I never expected it was the last time
I saw my aunt.

401
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,180
I thought she was going to catch me.

402
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:55,260
I desperately tried to break free,

403
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,420
but she sacrificed herself to save me.

404
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:12,590
She must have felt disappointed
at that time.

405
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,660
During the war in the Ghost Land,
I made the Demon Fire

406
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:23,350
fall into the human world and form a
scorched earth for thousands of miles.

407
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,150
If I don't go to atone for my crime,

408
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,830
a heavenly tribulation will
be given to the demons.

409
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:31,870
I will go to the Mortal Realm to
cultivate virgin land and create forests.

410
00:33:32,350 --> 00:33:34,180
When there are pear trees everywhere,

411
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,630
I'll come back to see you.

412
00:33:48,590 --> 00:33:49,430
Aunt,

413
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,630
I will not let you down again.

414
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,180
(Pear Blossom Cottage, the Mortal Realm)

415
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:08,020
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

416
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:14,660
Look, what do you think of
my arrangement?

417
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,470
Have you made up your mind?

418
00:34:24,110 --> 00:34:25,070
Yes.

419
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:29,550
I have also made up my mind.

420
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:32,350
What's it?

421
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,380
Stay with you.

422
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:37,590
I don't know how long I will stay here.

423
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,510
Maybe a hundred years
or a thousand years.

424
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,820
Why do you have to suffer with me?

425
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,470
After such a big change,

426
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:49,740
Yin is gone,

427
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,510
and Yuan Qi has become a god.

428
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,700
He might return to the Immortal Realm
at any time.

429
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:00,700
You are the only friend I have
in these Three Realms.

430
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:04,740
Instead of being lonely and bored for
thousands of years, I'll be with you.

431
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,180
Martial Uncle.

432
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:39,470
Qing Yi, go to the Mortal Realm
for experience.

433
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:44,630
There are many possibilities
ahead of you.

434
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,950
Martial Uncle, I don't understand.

435
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,590
You will understand one day.

436
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:59,380
(A thousand years later,
Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

437
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:02,820
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

438
00:36:07,110 --> 00:36:10,780
This peacock rob presented by
Weaver Maidens are too ostentatious.

439
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:14,990
Someone may say I can't afford
purple embroideries and gold pattern.

440
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,070
Now, Your Highness is already
the Acting Heavenly Empress.

441
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,180
The old five lords
in the Heavenly Palace have all retired.

442
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:25,220
Two of the new five lords
were promoted by you.

443
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,690
The Heavenly Empress Feng Yuan
is not here.

444
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:28,590
(Hua Shu, Acting Heavenly Empress)
You are the most esteemed

445
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,270
(of the Immortal Realm)
in the entire Heavenly Palace.

446
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,000
In my opinion,

447
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,260
(Zi Qing, Maid of the Heavenly Palace)
you even deserve the Dragon Robe

448
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,550
of the Heavenly Empress.

449
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:35,910
Zi Qing,

450
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:38,070
stop joking.

451
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,150
Some outsiders may hear and remember it.

452
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:42,950
Yes, Your Highness.

453
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:50,740
Hurry up.

454
00:36:51,230 --> 00:36:54,180
The immortals are waiting for me
to preside over the morning meeting.

455
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,550
Yes.

456
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:59,150
Your Highness is always the last one
to arrive to show respect.

457
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,160
But you can't let the immortals wait
too long to lose your manners.

458
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,220
Zi Qing,

459
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,340
don't take your wisecracks as your skill
when you're by my side.

460
00:37:14,670 --> 00:37:18,310
If you can't handle your work properly,
no matter how much I like you,

461
00:37:18,310 --> 00:37:20,780
I will never show mercy
when punishing you.

462
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:26,340
You know why Hongque was banished
to the Mortal Realm, right?

463
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,950
Yes, I see.

464
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,590
I'll be vigilant at all times
and take it as a warning.

465
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:34,660
Shu, it has been a thousand years.
Don't mention it again.

466
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:42,150
Is there any news
from His Godship Yuan Qi today?

467
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,740
No. His whereabouts are
always unpredictable.

468
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,910
He rarely stays in Qingchi Palace.

469
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:50,470
Although the Peacock Clan is now
a first-class immortal sect,

470
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:55,950
we had little contact with His Godship
in the past thousand years.

471
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:00,530
Shu, I know you only have Lan Feng
in your heart,

472
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:02,030
and you don't want to
seek another husband,

473
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,470
but you

474
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,630
should find opportunities to get close
to Yuan Qi from time to time.

475
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:12,300
If you can get his support, you'd not
only be an Acting Heavenly Empress.

476
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,500
(Northern Lands)

477
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,430
Your Godship,

478
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,780
this is the last parasol tree.

479
00:38:46,510 --> 00:38:48,550
There is still no immortal spirit
of Feng Yin.

480
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:35,470
Yin, pear blossoms have bloomed again.

481
00:39:37,340 --> 00:39:38,740
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

482
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,940
(Qingchi Palace, the Immortal Realm)

483
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,740
(Bright and Clear Moon)

484
00:39:56,920 --> 00:39:59,180
For thousands of years, you have used
the Spirit-mixing Fire

485
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:02,220
to refine the pieces of the Truth Mirror
into this Cloud Pearl.

486
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:04,910
This Cloud Pearl can trace the past.

487
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:07,160
Now, it is about to take shape.

488
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:11,590
We will know the truth
when the Cloud Pearl is refined.

489
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,380
Your Godship.

490
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:24,150
Is there any news about the devils and
the Purple Moon in these days?

491
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:27,950
No. You refused to return
to the God Realm.

492
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:32,220
You searched for Yin while surveying
the Purple Moon and the devils.

493
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:35,880
But there was no news in the past
thousand years, why…

494
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:36,910
Continue the investigation.

495
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,110
They will make mistakes one day.

496
00:40:40,030 --> 00:40:41,030
I have patience.

497
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:42,550
By the way,

498
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,720
where is Yu?

499
00:40:52,070 --> 00:40:52,910
Yu.

500
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:05,990
You're having so much fun.

501
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,780
Your Godship, you're too indulgent
towards this little beast.

502
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,260
It doesn't matter. Just let it be.

503
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,990
(Yin, Yu has hatched.)

504
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,260
(You must be very happy
if you see this.)

505
00:41:34,590 --> 00:41:35,470
(Soul Mark?)

506
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:36,720
Yin.

507
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,030
Xiu Yan, I feel Yin's soul mark again.

508
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,070
That's your illusion, Your Godship.

509
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,590
I will never make it wrong.

510
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:06,430
For a thousand years,

511
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,990
every time I feel the soul mark of Yin,
it is in the Nether Realm.

512
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,550
Tell me, where is she?

513
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,990
I said what I had to say
a thousand years ago.

514
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,470
Even if you come here every day,
I'll still tell you the same.

515
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,990
Do as you please, Your Godship.

516
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,340
What is this?

517
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,470
This is a trace of the immortal spirit
left by Yin.

518
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,220
Unexpectedly, under the Spirit Sword,

519
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,780
a small Water Divine Beast
didn't vanish into thin air.

520
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,380
I think it's Yuan Qi's soul mark
that protected Yin.

521
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,990
Can Yin come back?

522
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,850
This is the Blood Lotus that blooms
once every ten thousand years.

523
00:43:49,360 --> 00:43:54,220
I can only use it to see if it can protect
Yin's broken immortal spirit.

524
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:58,740
From now on, the Blood Lotus is
connected to Yin's soul power.

525
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:01,070
When the Lotus lives, Yin is alive.

526
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,910
When the lotus is dead, Yin will die.

527
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,990
Whether the Lotus can live or die

528
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:11,990
depends on her destiny.

529
00:44:16,510 --> 00:44:18,630
Now, the Blood Lotus only
has one petal left.

530
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:23,740
Yin's soul power is so weak that she can
only go through the last tribulation.
