=Episode 13=

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,910
How is Xian Zhu?

30
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,070
His immortal spirit has left his body.

31
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,430
I can only use immortal spells
to preserve his body.

32
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,710
If we cannot retrieve his immortal spirit
in time, this body won't last too long.

33
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:06,710
I thought of a treasure of the Fox Clan
that might be able to save him.

34
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,020
I'll go get it now.

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:15,620
(The Demon Realm)

36
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,340
(Unsullied Elegance)

37
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,228
The Fox Queen is a demon,
it's especially difficult for her

38
00:02:29,252 --> 00:02:31,300
to obtain this in the Immortal Realm.

39
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:33,300
She gave you this bracelet,

40
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,230
showing how important you are to her.

41
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,120
Who's there?

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,590
Aunt.

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,360
It's me,

44
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,430
Hong Yi.

45
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,270
What's the matter?

46
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,420
Aunt, I want to borrow
the Soul-scorching Grass.

47
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,180
Do you know how important this thing is
to me and the Fox Clan?

48
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,540
I know.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,140
Then why are you asking me?

50
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,820
What happened to your hand?

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,500
It's just a scratch. Nothing serious.

52
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:24,260
I'm curious. Who is worth you using
such a sacred item from our clan to save?

53
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,820
A friend.

54
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,100
An immortal?

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,900
You've refused to return home. I thought
you had some great ability and ambition.

56
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,140
Turns out, you're mingling
with the immortals.

57
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,260
Hong Yi, have you forgotten your parents
were killed by immortals?

58
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,780
This is not what you said before.

59
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,780
You never listened to what I said before.

60
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:50,820
Don't let those scheming immortals
deceive you.

61
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,500
They won't, Aunt.

62
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,220
They are my good friends,
and I trust them.

63
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:58,580
Please lend me the Soul-scorching Grass.

64
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,740
You are acting recklessly because I
spoiled you too much.

65
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,780
Now, you even want to use our
life-saving sacred item.

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:10,380
Do you want me to die sooner
so that you can become the Fox King?

67
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,220
I never meant that.

68
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,380
I was being ignorant before.

69
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,260
This time, I also came to apologize.

70
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,220
I said a lot of hurtful words in the past,

71
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:26,260
but after all, you are my only family.

72
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,780
Stop trying to use your affected manners
to deceive me.

73
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,020
I will never give it to you.

74
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:55,180
As long as I'm in power,

75
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:59,100
I won't allow anyone to take our clan's
sacred item to save an outsider,

76
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,620
especially an immortal.

77
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,180
I was being naive.

78
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,140
I even thought I was wrong before

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,620
and wanted to eliminate
the rift between us.

80
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:16,260
You are indeed
a selfish and heartless person.

81
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,500
Hong Yi, listen carefully.

82
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:22,340
I am the queen of the Fox Clan.

83
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:24,540
What I do is not up to you
to interfere with.

84
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:27,340
Over these years,
my patience with you has run out.

85
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,020
I won't let you have your way like before.

86
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:33,180
If you can listen to my words, stay.
If you can't, then leave.

87
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,980
From now on, I will make no exception
for you anymore.

88
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:49,580
You have truly opened my eyes today.

89
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,220
Your Highness.

90
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,620
Your Highness.

91
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,700
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

92
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,620
I'm sorry I couldn't bring
the Soul-scorching Grass.

93
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,140
Since the Fox Queen won't lend it,
there's nothing we can do.

94
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,340
Your intentions mean a lot.

95
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:43,020
Daze Mountain is already grateful.

96
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,900
Master.

97
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:50,180
Elder Feng Ming from Wutong Island
requests an audience.

98
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:51,340
Invite him in.

99
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,340
Yes.

100
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,540
Elder Xian Shan.

101
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,340
The Soul-burning Lamp?

102
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,260
It cost it extensive spiritual energy to
search for Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

103
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,740
If we infuse powerful spiritual energy
into it to replenish the losses,

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,580
we can temporarily repair it.

105
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,420
But the period that it can work
normally will be very short.

106
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,940
Powerful spiritual energy?

107
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,180
Will our spiritual energy be enough?

108
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:30,140
I'm afraid not.
It must be a demigod or higher.

109
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,300
Demigod?

110
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,940
But now, both Master and
the Heavenly Emperor are absent.

111
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,380
Where can we find a demigod?

112
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,940
In fact, I have a way.

113
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,140
Elder Feng Ming, please share.

114
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,660
Every sect has its own immortal vein.

115
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,780
An immortal vein's spiritual energy is
comparable to that of a demigod.

116
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,860
It can also be used
to temporarily repair the Lamp.

117
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,420
However, the immortal vein's spiritual energy
is vast and difficult to control.

118
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,260
Elder Feng Ming, could there be
any issues with this?

119
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,340
Elder Xian Shan, please rest assured.

120
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:05,420
This Lamp is a heirloom of Wutong Island,
passed down through generations.

121
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:09,060
No matter how powerful the spiritual energy
input, it will not leak.

122
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:13,860
I discussed it with the other elders of
the Phoenix Clan before coming.

123
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:18,220
We just hope that Wutong Island can
contribute something to Daze Mountain.

124
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:30,980
The Lamp must be activated within 24 hours
after the immortal spirit leaves the body.

125
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,540
Now, there are only two hours left.

126
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,300
Alright.

127
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,660
This formation can ensure that the body
remains intact after the immortal spirit leaves.

128
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,500
But remember, it only lasts for two hours.

129
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:58,980
Beyond that, the body will be ruined
without the immortal spirit.

130
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,100
Xian Zhu!

131
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,180
Xian Zhu!

132
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,580
Over there!

133
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,660
Wan Yue.

134
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,260
Sir.

135
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:10,100
You've been disturbing the Nether Realm
for a long time.

136
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,220
The Nether King
ordered me to take you away.

137
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,460
I'm sorry. I'll take him away now.

138
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:17,060
Xian Zhu.

139
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,580
Let's go.

140
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,780
It's the Nether King.

141
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:46,940
Oh no, time is running out.

142
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,700
If they don't return soon,
something bad might happen.

143
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,740
- Elder Xian Zhu.
- Xian Zhu.

144
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,460
Are you okay?

145
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm fine.

146
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,220
Bad news,

147
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,740
Xian Zhu has been captured by Ao Ge.

148
00:11:14,060 --> 00:11:14,940
What should we do?

149
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,860
We have the Three-life Stone.

150
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,300
Let's go.

151
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,380
What?

152
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,420
The God-killing Flower Seed
has been destroyed?

153
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,420
With the immense strength
of the Nether King,

154
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,220
such an unexpected accident
wasn't something I anticipated.

155
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,380
You...

156
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,740
Even though the flower seed is gone,

157
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,940
I left a secret talisman at the entrance
of the Immortal Vein.

158
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,820
With this talisman, anyone can enter
the barrier without being discovered.

159
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,700
Xian Zhu's life is uncertain now,
we still have time.

160
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,020
We just need to find another flower seed

161
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:12,700
and use the talisman to enter the barrier
to salvage the situation.

162
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:17,940
Currently, the last God-killing Flower Seed
in the Three Realms is in the Immortal Realm.

163
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:22,780
If you can find a way to retrieve it,
I can instruct someone to plant it.

164
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,660
How can something from the Demon Realm
exist in the Immortal Realm?

165
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:31,180
It's true.

166
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,140
It's in the secret vault
of the Heavenly Palace.

167
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:36,220
(The Nether Realm)

168
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,420
We've brought
the Three-life Stone back for you.

169
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,460
Listen, it's meaningless for you
to take me back.

170
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,580
I'll leave again until I become
the Heavenly Matchmaker.

171
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,940
Sorry about this.
We'll make it up to you next time.

172
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,660
You still came in the end.

173
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:15,620
(Special)

174
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:21,700
Take this tablet to Zhongling Palace,
and you can meet the Nether King.

175
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,140
Thank you.

176
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,010
Thank you.

177
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,540
Let's go.

178
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,300
I considered them as friends,
yet they treated me like this.

179
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:38,460
Although you seem angry,
you still helped them.

180
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:41,860
Xian Zhu's red thread was tied by me.

181
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,420
I can't really not help them, right?

182
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:56,140
However, this time,
I didn't return in vain.

183
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:02,860
I haven't touched
these noble hands in a long time.

184
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:03,900
Stop it now.

185
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm not him.

186
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,060
(Zhongling Hall)

187
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:29,060
Xian Zhu's lifespan
wasn't supposed to end,

188
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,340
but he used his immortal spirit
to intrude into my Nether Realm,

189
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,860
disrupting the rules of my realm.

190
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:43,220
He asked for that, didn't he?

191
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,340
Your Majesty,

192
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:49,980
Xian Zhu had just lost his loved one
and received the Heavenly Punishment

193
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,980
before he intruded the Nether Realm.

194
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:55,460
I hope you can forgive him
and allow us to reunite.

195
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:00,180
Can a simple apology cancel everything?

196
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:03,500
He violated the rules of my Nether Realm.

197
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,380
How do you plan to compensate?

198
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:14,420
Your Majesty, we can accept
any form of compensation.

199
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:19,380
(Ao Ge, the Nether King)

200
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:24,940
In that case,

201
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,980
if I...

202
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,220
That's not right!

203
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,660
I'm here to help you.

204
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:40,860
According to the rules,

205
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:44,020
if someone holds the guest tablet
from Xiuyan Tower,

206
00:15:44,020 --> 00:15:45,860
you must grant them a request

207
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,740
without additional conditions.

208
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:53,740
Since their request is to take away
Xian Zhu's immortal spirit,

209
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,860
how can you ask for compensation?

210
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:57,700
Three-life Stone.

211
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,740
I haven't punished you for leaving
the Nether Realm without permission yet.

212
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,540
However, you dare to
interfere with my matter now?

213
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,900
These are the rules set by Xiu Yan.

214
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,460
I am just telling the truth.

215
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,820
I can release him,

216
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,740
but I can only grant you one request.

217
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,420
Aren't you looking for
the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit?

218
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:28,220
If you take Xian Zhu's immortal spirit,
you can't take the Fire Phoenix's.

219
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:29,060
- But...
- Yin.

220
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:32,420
Xian Zhu's situation is more urgent now.

221
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,940
Let's figure out another way
for Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

222
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:45,420
Your Majesty, we'll take Xian Zhu's
immortal spirit.

223
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:51,100
For Feng Yin's immortal spirit, we'll find
other treasures to exchange for it.

224
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,300
Coincidentally, what I need
is right here with you.

225
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:04,980
If you agree to exchange, you can
take Feng Yin's immortal spirit today.

226
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,660
With us?

227
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,100
I want half of the internal core spiritual power
of you, the Water Divine Beast.

228
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,380
Your Majesty,

229
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,740
Yin's internal core spiritual power
is her lifespan.

230
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,860
We cannot exchange that.

231
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:26,100
Half the lifespan of a mere Water Divine Beast
for two portions of Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

232
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:27,780
This deal is definitely worth it, isn't it?

233
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,700
Two portions,

234
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:33,220
not one?

235
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:35,220
Jin,

236
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,020
with these two portions of immortal spirit,
we'll have six portions in total.

237
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,100
- I agree.
- I disagree.

238
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,110
Jin,

239
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,900
listen to me.

240
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:47,860
If we exchange treasures for it,
we need a thousand years.

241
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,580
By then, Feng Yin's body
may no longer exist.

242
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:51,940
Just do as he says.

243
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:52,780
Yin,

244
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:56,020
I won't let you
make any sacrifices for my mistakes.

245
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:57,860
- Listen...
- Not even a minute is acceptable,

246
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,180
let alone fifty years.

247
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,700
If he wanted my life today,

248
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,820
I would willingly let him take it.

249
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:06,540
But what he wants
is half of your immortal spirit.

250
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,460
I can't bear that cost.

251
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:13,180
I disagree with this trade.

252
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:15,220
Your Majesty,

253
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,980
Yin's internal core spiritual power
only has the healing effect.

254
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,980
I believe you intend
to use it to save someone.

255
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,540
You asked people to offer treasures
for the opportunity to meet with you,

256
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,620
I believe it's also for that purpose.

257
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:31,180
I am willing to do my best to collect treasures
from the Three Realms

258
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,020
to help you save the one you want to save.

259
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,660
But if you want Yin's spiritual power,
I absolutely won't agree.

260
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:48,060
You're quite bold for someone so young.

261
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:59,100
Let's see if you can fulfill your promise.

262
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,780
Xian Zhu is waiting outside.

263
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:07,100
If you have nothing else, then leave now.

264
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,700
Xian Zhu.

265
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:14,660
He's just firm in speech but soft in heart.

266
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
Don't take it to heart.

267
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,540
When you have time, come
to the Nether Realm to visit me.

268
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,020
Sure,

269
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,020
as long as the Nether King
doesn't kick us out.

270
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,780
Three-life Stone,
the demigod you mentioned earlier,

271
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:33,860
is he Ao Ge?

272
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,800
Shh.

273
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:40,540
(Xiuyan Tower)

274
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,660
Xiu Yan, did I do well?

275
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:44,980
You did very well.

276
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,020
But how will you protect yourself now?

277
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,860
Do you want to see Yin
lose half of her life?

278
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,220
I feel troubled about it.

279
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,660
(Be Decent and Noble)
Just like Xian Zhu's matter this time,

280
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:02,860
should I help him get together
with the one he loves,

281
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:07,340
or should I ruin their relationship
to avoid tragedy?

282
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220
Xiu Yan,

283
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,540
tell me what is right and what is wrong.

284
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:19,340
I just know you left the Nether Realm
without permission and it's wrong.

285
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,700
I'm wrong, Your Majesty.

286
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,980
Now I see I was wrong.

287
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:30,660
I shouldn't have left without permission.

288
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,180
Xiu Yan, I'll see you next time.
I should go now.

289
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,180
All right.

290
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,100
(Be Decent and Noble)

291
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,340
How could you still laugh?

292
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,660
Why are you so rude to everybody?

293
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,740
Look, no one in the Nether Realm dares
to talk to you except the Three-life Stone.

294
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,060
You should be grateful.

295
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:02,300
Otherwise, your long life
would be so boring.

296
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,500
But I have you, don't I?

297
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,700
Me?

298
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,940
How long can you have me for?

299
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,520
Martial Uncle.

300
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,700
- Martial Uncle
- Martial Uncle

301
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,460
Xian Shan.

302
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:26,740
Jin.

303
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:27,940
Yin.

304
00:21:29,260 --> 00:21:30,500
Are you all right?

305
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:34,420
Wan Yue...

306
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:37,860
They told me she was completely dead.

307
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:42,700
You tell me. She can be saved, right?

308
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,500
Martial Uncle!

309
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,890
- Xian Zhu.
- Xian Zhu.

310
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:48,750
Martial Uncle.

311
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:04,540
Now, he's exhausted and desperate.
And he's so unsettled

312
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,260
that he needs
to recuperate for a long time.

313
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,700
In the following days, don't disturb him
unless you feed him the decoction.

314
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:13,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

315
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,060
Everybody, leave him alone.

316
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,260
How about I stay and take care of him?

317
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,420
All right.

318
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:26,700
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

319
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,660
Why are you decocting it alone?

320
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:58,140
What about Yan Shuang?

321
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:00,220
Things were almost done here.

322
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:03,500
Princess Yan Shuang went back to her clan
upon hearing of some emergency.

323
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:08,700
You're decocting something
for the recovery of spiritual power?

324
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,300
Then decoct some for Yin, too.

325
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:18,780
She heals with her spiritual power
and also needs to recover.

326
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,340
I didn't know you could
also care about someone.

327
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,620
I thought you were only taken care of.

328
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,500
Just go get a boiler.

329
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:32,340
All right.

330
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:58,060
Here, Hong Yi. Take the decoction.

331
00:24:00,420 --> 00:24:01,300
Even if I die of illness,

332
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,980
(Young Hong Yi)
I will not take your decoction!

333
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,980
Give my father back to me!
Give my mother back to me!

334
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,180
Hong Yi.

335
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,180
Go away! Leave me alone!

336
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:13,060
I hate you! I hate you so much!

337
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,980
Come up. Sit up.

338
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:25,860
Hold me.

339
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,420
Hong Yi, listen up.

340
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:37,140
I am the Fox Queen.

341
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,340
You don't tell me what I should do.

342
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:42,140
After all these years,
my patience with you has run out.

343
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:44,740
And I won't give you
whatever you want as I did before.

344
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,860
If you can listen to my words, stay.
If you can't, then leave.

345
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,660
Yin,

346
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:01,140
how about you have a rest?

347
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:18,380
A low-level Water Divine Beast
has very weak healing power.

348
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:22,380
Girl, don't try to be a heroine.

349
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,540
It's you, Lady Hong Chou,
Chief of Qingchi Palace.

350
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,460
It is our pleasure to have you here.

351
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,260
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

352
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,820
Are you all right?

353
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,940
This is the Soul-calming Pill
of Qingchi Palace.

354
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,140
It can heal Lord Xian Zhu's
damaged spirit.

355
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:09,540
I'd like to thank you
on behalf of our sect.

356
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:11,540
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

357
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,300
Martial Uncle.

358
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:20,020
Thank you for the pill, Your Ladyship.

359
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,540
Lord Gu Jin, do you have a minute?

360
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,940
I have something to tell you.

361
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,740
You're the chief of Qingchi Palace

362
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,980
while I'm a mere immortal.
You don't need to curtsy like that.

363
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,740
You're the real master of Qingchi Palace.

364
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:08,740
I came down with you
and guarded Qingchi Palace

365
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:11,460
just to protect you all the time

366
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:14,980
so that you can safely return
to the God Realm.

367
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:18,980
You brought me up
and I'll always keep that in mind.

368
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,980
But experiencing in the lower realms
is something I have to go through.

369
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,020
I shall answer for whatever it is.

370
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,100
You should stop worrying about me.

371
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,660
As the son of True Gods,

372
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:32,580
you're extremely honorable.

373
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,960
How could you stick around
in the Three Lower Realms?

374
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:38,420
You're just experiencing here
to activate your god power.

375
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:42,580
Eventually, you will be a god again
and protect the whole world.

376
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,500
I knew you would lecture me again.

377
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:49,140
You think being a god
is the most important thing.

378
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:54,180
But I think the real precious thing
is what I'm experiencing now.

379
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:57,380
Within all this, how can I
not want to stick around?

380
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,340
I've never thought
about returning to the God Realm.

381
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:04,580
In this realm, I have
an unfinished mission,

382
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:08,860
a lot of companions and the girl I love.

383
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,540
The Water Divine Beast?

384
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:13,500
Lady Hong Chou, she has a name. Yin.

385
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,220
Please think twice, Your Lordship.

386
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:24,940
Do you know when you answered
for the tribulation under the Heaven Stone

387
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,660
to get back the immortal spirit
of the Fire Phoenix,

388
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,740
the tribulation emerged?
And that was Yin.

389
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,620
Donghua predicted that before he left
and made the master-servant contract

390
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:37,540
so that you could avoid the tribulation.

391
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,780
Now, the contract is
unexpectedly terminated.

392
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:42,820
Your love with Yin

393
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,360
will only make the tribulation
more terrifying

394
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:48,300
and put you in more danger.

395
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,220
So, this is why
Master made a contract for us?

396
00:28:59,020 --> 00:29:01,820
But we've gathered
four portions of the immortal spirit.

397
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,300
When we find the remaining portions,
the tribulation will be gone.

398
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,300
Don't you worry.

399
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,420
Your Lordship,
why must you be so stubborn?

400
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:13,340
A Water Divine Beast
can never go to the God Realm.

401
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:16,700
You just witnessed the tragedy
between Xian Zhu and that mortal girl.

402
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:19,220
You're the son of True Gods.

403
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,860
There's a tremendous gap
between you and that low-level beast.

404
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:27,580
Have you thought about it?
When Yin is gone in a hundred years,

405
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:31,660
you'll have to live alone.
What can you do, then?

406
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,420
Thank you for reminding me.

407
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:35,660
If Yin can't go to the God Realm,

408
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,820
I won't go back there, either.

409
00:29:37,820 --> 00:29:41,820
Let me be frank.
I can give up being a True God.

410
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,220
How could you not be a True God
just for a mere Water Divine Beast?

411
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:51,620
You... You're just
too young and impulsive!

412
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,420
I'm not impulsive, Lady Hong Chou!

413
00:29:56,780 --> 00:29:59,020
When I can't even end up
with my beloved girl,

414
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,780
how can I be a god
or protect the whole world?

415
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:07,780
I've made up my mind.
Stop trying to persuade me.

416
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,180
Why don't you give us your blessings?

417
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,100
(It's hopeless any way I look at it.)

418
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:32,300
(I can't see him
behave so arbitrarily and suffer.)

419
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,700
Xian Shan,

420
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:39,340
I made a mistake and troubled all of you.

421
00:30:39,780 --> 00:30:40,980
It wasn't your fault.

422
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,300
It was just destiny.

423
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:49,020
Wan Yue and I are from different realms.

424
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:53,620
But I was so obsessed
that I wanted to end up with her.

425
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:55,820
She trusted me that much.

426
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:00,820
But I... I failed to protect her.

427
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:02,580
Xian Zhu,

428
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:07,660
I found this in Miss Wan Yue's house.

429
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:10,140
It's for you, I guess.

430
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,020
(By Wan Yue)

431
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,620
When I'm alive, I'm in love with you.

432
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:28,660
Even if I have to die, I won't regret it.

433
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,060
I guess Miss Wan Yue knew
what would happen.

434
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,820
But she said she didn't regret it.

435
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:47,620
She didn't regret
knowing and loving you.

436
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:51,940
She also didn't regret her decision.

437
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,900
Who do you think

438
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:17,180
is more pathetic,
Miss Wan Yue or Xian Zhu?

439
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:23,380
Miss Wan Yue is completely dead
and she no longer exists.

440
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:29,380
Xian Zhu saw her disappear
and could never get her back.

441
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:35,300
I only know Miss Wan Yue said
she regretted nothing.

442
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:41,380
But Xian Zhu would never stop regretting
or suffering for the rest of his life.

443
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:44,020
But given a second chance,

444
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:50,060
I believe he would still
fight for Miss Wan Yue.

445
00:32:53,700 --> 00:32:55,340
I really don't understand.

446
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:02,300
What's so good
about such a strict hierarchy,

447
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,260
except giving immortals
a sense of superiority?

448
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,820
Yeah.

449
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:16,940
When Xian Zhu was looking
for Miss Wan Yue in the Nether Realm,

450
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,060
his heart must have been broken.

451
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,020
Yin,

452
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,460
I was thinking at that time.
I wanted to protect the one I cared for.

453
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:50,940
Do you remember what I said
when the Three-life Stone matched us?

454
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,600
I'm thinking instead
of the master-servant contract,

455
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,300
we can make a marriage contract
so we can be together forever.

456
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:07,540

Master-servant contract.

Marriage contract.

476
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:45,340
A couple meet and fall in love.

477
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:48,420
Then they become spouses.

478
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,660
Bounded by the red thread of fate,

479
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,460
a lifelong marriage is formed.
This is the marriage contract.

480
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:00,580
After the marriage,
they'll be an immortal couple

481
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:06,220
who support each other
and end up together forever.

(How shall I be dressed up?)

485
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,820
(No specific custom
for such an important ceremony?)

486
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,620
(What shall I wear?)

487
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,620
Your Ladyship.

488
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:52,180
I'm here to discuss Xian Zhu's problem.

489
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,540
Go ahead, Your Ladyship.

490
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:05,220
The Soul-calming Pill calmed down
his turbulent spirit and energy.

491
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:07,580
But he's unsettled and can't recover
from serious injuries.

492
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:09,940
Only you can help him recuperate.

493
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:12,020
I just don't know if you'll help.

494
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:13,220
Me?

495
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:22,620
But you said a low-level Water Divine Beast
had very weak healing power.

496
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:24,540
So now, I'm no longer weak?

497
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:27,260
Don't talk back so harshly.

498
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,700
I'm helping your sect.

499
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,460
I'm all ears.

503
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,940
It's the cliff where the spiritual energies
of the Three Realms meet.

504
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,780
Only a Water Divine Beast
with the Healing Core can break into the barrier.

505
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:08,580
So, only you can pick
the Worry-free Immortal Fruit.

506
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,820
Get in there.

507
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,940
When the moon shines over the cliff,

508
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:15,980
it's the best time
to get the Worry-free Immortal Fruit.

509
00:38:17,300 --> 00:38:18,260
Don't delay any longer.

510
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:10,140
I'm doing all this for His Lordship.

511
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:15,860
Yin!

512
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,700
Xian Shan, you...

513
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:37,540
In case you do something improper,
I've been watching Yin.

514
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:40,340
Anyway, she's one of our disciples.

515
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:42,980
I won't let anyone kill her willfully.

516
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,180
But she's a threat
to Lord Yuan Qi and your sect.

517
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,340
Don't lose your head
on something so serious.

518
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:49,580
Give her to me.

519
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:51,780
Yin!

520
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:54,860
Yin.

521
00:39:58,220 --> 00:39:59,060
Yin.

522
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,460
Yin.

523
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,180
Xian Shan, what happened?

524
00:40:09,820 --> 00:40:11,180
Lady Hong Chou, what are you doing here?

525
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:12,820
Don't be angry, Your Lordship.

526
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,620
I mentioned the Worry-free Immortal Fruit
can help Xian Zhu to recuperate.

527
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:20,660
Yin wanted to help him and risked it.

528
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,060
Jin,

529
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,980
a wind suddenly blew on the cliff.

530
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,620
She had a concussion and passed out.

531
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,300
When she wakes up, she'll be all right.

532
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,460
Lady Hong Chou,
you know Yin has weak power.

533
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:33,300
Why did you tell her about the fruit?

534
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:36,460
Didn't you know she could be in danger?

535
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,420
I'm loyal to you, Your Lordship.

536
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:45,620
If I did something thoughtless,
punish me.

537
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,700
- Jin...
- Your Lordship, you...

538
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,420
I've imprinted Yin with my soul mark.

539
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:21,420
If she's in danger, I will keep her safe.

540
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,940
You're a distinguished god.

541
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,740
But for an immortal beast,
you hurt your body and imprinted...

542
00:41:27,740 --> 00:41:28,580
Lady Hong Chou,

543
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,820
I'm sure you know how I feel about her
and how determined I am to protect her.

544
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:35,340
I don't want to repeat myself.

545
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:46,340
Xian Shan,

546
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:48,460
you have the soft heart of a woman.

547
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,420
Will you just watch your sect
shield Lord Yuan Qi in the tribulation?

548
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:56,660
Our sect is important.
Someone's life is precious, too.

549
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:58,460
Even if she's a lower-level beast,

550
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,540
I don't dare to decide
whether she lives or dies.

551
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:04,500
You can't always have
a perfect solution for everything.

552
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:09,260
I'll just try my best
and have a clear conscience.

553
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:14,540
I have a solution without hurting Yin.

554
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:17,220
Your Ladyship, you can give it a try.

555
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,380
This is the Forgetfulness Flute.

556
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:23,948
With the chaos power in the Spirit Sword,

557
00:42:23,972 --> 00:42:26,100
you can play the Flute
to draw out Jin's affection tie.

558
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:29,100
Just now, Jin exhausted
his energy to imprint Yin.

559
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,740
He needs to recuperate
with the power of the Spirit Sword.

560
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,220
This is the best opportunity.

561
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:36,180
When Jin loses his affection tie,

562
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,380
his feelings for Yin will be gone, too.

563
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:43,180
After that, we can separate them.
Maybe he can survive, then.

564
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:54,380
Hope it will work.
