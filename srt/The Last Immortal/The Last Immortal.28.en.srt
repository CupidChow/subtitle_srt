00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,950
I haven't figured out

30
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,230
how to face my new self.

31
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:16,900
But, I need to figure something out

32
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:19,020
with the new identity.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,020
Please give me more time, Master.

34
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,020
I'll stay in charge
for a little longer for you then.

35
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,270
But you need to make fast adjustments.

36
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,950
The reborn of the Fire Phoenix

37
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:31,150
will be honored by the Three Realms.

38
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,230
As the Fire Phoenix,

39
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,020
every move you make

40
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,860
will be watched by many.

41
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,620
It would be disrespectful

42
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:40,270
to delay the celebration for too long.

43
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,780
I understand.

44
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,430
Thank you, Master.

45
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,670
The experience in the Mortal Realm

46
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,020
has made you a better chess player.

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,920
I'm bored.

48
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,950
You should take some rest.

49
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,860
You've never been to the Heavenly Palace

50
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:23,710
since you were reborn.

51
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,430
How do you know its tedious rules?

52
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,740
When I was little,
you and the elders often whispered in my ear.

53
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,670
So I remember it.

54
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:36,300
You have a good memory

55
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,390
to be able to remember things
that happened

56
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:41,180
when you weren't even hatched
thousands of years ago.

57
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,270
(Gladly now with this ban on me,)

58
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,990
(even an old friend)

59
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:48,430
(won't recognize me)

60
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,620
(with this new look.)

61
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,940
(Charming Rosy Clouds)

62
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:19,220
(Charming Rosy Clouds)

63
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,310
This is the finest vintage

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,020
Pear Blossom Brew in the Heavenly Palace.

65
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,190
I'm sure it's good.

66
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:33,220
(Charming Rosy Clouds)

67
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,080
When we find

68
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:39,180
Jin's affection ties, we'll open this jar
of Pear Blossom Brew for celebration.

69
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,220
- What do you think?
- Great.

70
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:41,980
If you can't find it,

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,510
can I still drink this?

72
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,310
We will find it.

73
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:46,310
Then Yin can

74
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,140
be with the man she likes.

75
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,980
Lord Fu Chen,

76
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:50,390
I'll give you half of my share.

77
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:52,510
Well,

78
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,750
I'll give you half of mine, too.

79
00:04:54,750 --> 00:04:56,020
It's a deal.

80
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,220
Deal.

81
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,510
Yin, we will find the affection ties,
so you can be happy with His Lordship.

82
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,020
(When I empty this jar,)

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,460
(the past with him)

84
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,100
(will be erased completely, right?)

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,120
Where did you come from, little thief?

86
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,340
How dare you steal my treasure?

87
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:31,710
Do you want more?

88
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,310
The power of a demigod.

89
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:36,360
Are you the newborn girl

90
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,780
from the Phoenix Clan?

91
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,950
I don't care if you're the Fire Phoenix
or a nameless fairy,

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,780
it's wrong for you to steal my wine.

93
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:45,790
Give it back to me.

94
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,270
Is this wine

95
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,750
really yours?

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,420
Though it's not mine,

97
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,900
it's still wrong to steal Yin's wine.

98
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:55,310
Let me tell you something.

99
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:57,580
That girl never lets a grudge go unsettled.

100
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,870
When she comes back,
she'll seek revenge on you.

101
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:04,020
Are you referring to the Water Divine Beast

102
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:07,070
who worked with the devils
and was executed by the Spirit Sword?

103
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,190
Hasn't she lost all her immortal spirit?

104
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,980
How would she seek revenge on me?

105
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,070
Yin never collaborated with the devils.

106
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,540
She was framed.

107
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,570
This is complicated.

108
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,310
I can't make it clear in a short time.

109
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,860
My friend, Yin, is not a spy of the devils.

110
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:28,460
But who cares about

111
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,510
how a Water Divine Beast feels?

112
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:37,350
Right,

113
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,580
who cares about

114
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,580
how a Water Divine Beast feels?

115
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,460
Here's your wine back.

116
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:08,630
The flavor is very strong.

117
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,710
You really have no taste.

118
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,080
Where is she?

119
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:33,750
How did the newborn girl

120
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,150
know where Yin kept the wine?

121
00:07:39,630 --> 00:07:40,660
Even Her Majesty Feng Yuan

122
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:42,710
came back to Wutong Island
for the revival of Feng Yin.

123
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,340
Her Majesty is back?

124
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:45,900
Will you...

125
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:48,950
Gladly Feng Yuan doesn't intend
to stay long

126
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,310
and asks me to continue to
act on her behalf.

127
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:52,590
However,

128
00:07:53,310 --> 00:07:55,420
it seems like she's trying
to choose a successor.

129
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:58,270
Then what will you do?

130
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,070
I've been her second
for a thousand years.

131
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,590
Tomorrow,

132
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,830
let's find out the immortals' opinions.

133
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,520
Ruo and I

134
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,830
are both relieved that you're back.

135
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,110
I'll be able to spend more time

136
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,990
finding the Purple Moon.

137
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,700
The Purple Moon's whereabouts is a mystery.

138
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,300
And you've searched so hard
for a thousand years.

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,150
Why don't you take a break

140
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,510
and leave everything to me?

141
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:47,900
One day,

142
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,700
I'll get them all.

143
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,150
I'm glad that you have such an ambition.

144
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:59,230
But you're the rarest Ten-tailed
Heavenly Fox of the Demon Clan.

145
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:00,820
If you go alone,

146
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,870
the other two realms

147
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,630
will try to kill you.

148
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,470
But if you are the Demon King,

149
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,590
they'll have to weigh the pros and cons

150
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:09,940
before they harm you.

151
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,280
Uncle Lin Mo,

152
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:13,230
are you saying...

153
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:14,540
With your abilities,

154
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:17,060
you're the perfect candidate
for the King of the Demon Realm.

155
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,590
If you don't take the throne,

156
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,230
who else would dare?

157
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,060
My aunt always had high hopes for me.

158
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:27,780
In the past,

159
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:29,870
I often let her down.

160
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,750
Now, I can't go on like this.

161
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,230
I'll defend the homeland

162
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,540
my aunt had held dear.

163
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,510
I will be the Demon King.

164
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:45,110
Great.

165
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,630
I'm really happy for Ruo right now.

166
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:59,150
Speaking of her wishes, there's one more thing.

167
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,870
She had always wanted
to reconcile with the immortals.

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,060
Thousands of years ago, she took you
to Wutong Island to propose marriage.

169
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,270
Now that Feng Yin has awakened,
why don't we put the marriage on...

170
00:10:08,270 --> 00:10:09,110
Give me a break.

171
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,780
I'm not marrying that little girl.

172
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,870
If I have to make her happy every day,

173
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,300
I'll have no heart for the official affairs.

174
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:19,990
I've no objection to the marriage
of the two realms,

175
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:22,990
but I'm not interested in Feng Yin.

176
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,470
I knew that you still have feelings for Yin.

177
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:28,990
All right.

178
00:10:29,270 --> 00:10:30,860
You make your own decisions
about marriage

179
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,900
as long as you don't regret it.

180
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,350
I won't regret it.

181
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:38,990
Honey, it can't be delayed any longer.

182
00:10:39,630 --> 00:10:42,940
I'm old and my strength is failing.

183
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,860
(Yan Qiu, Eagle King)
Only your early succession

184
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,660
can give our clansmen peace of mind.

185
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,620
Your ability and prestige

186
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,510
are unrivaled in the Eagle Clan.

187
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,750
Tell me your concerns.

188
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:04,470
Father, I just think it's too early, so...

189
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,660
Is it about the demon lad?

190
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,870
You've been waiting thousands of years for him.

191
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,870
He never gave you a direct answer.

192
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:18,350
No, I must find him and ask him for an answer.

193
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:22,270
Father, there has been

194
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,180
someone else in his heart.

195
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,900
You know he loves someone else.

196
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,820
Why do you still want to wait for him?

197
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,470
Even if I'm not the Eagle King,

198
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:44,420
but an ordinary father,

199
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,300
I won't allow my daughter

200
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,270
to waste her prime years for nothing.

201
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,800
Honey,

202
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,900
it's time to make a decision.

203
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:31,600
(The new Fire Lord,)
Your Highness, will Her Majesty Feng Yuan

204
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,770
(one of the five lords of the Immortal Realm)
stay for long this time?

205
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,420
Her Majesty is only here for a while.

206
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,270
Soon she'll ascend to godship.

207
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,900
The affairs in the Heavenly Palace
will still be ruled by me.

208
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,940
(The new Thunder Lord, one of
the five lords of the Immortal Realm)

209
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,150
Your Highness,

210
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,233
(The new Lightning Lord,)
the Ten-tailed Heavenly Fox of the Demon Clan,

211
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:49,340
(one of the five lords of the Immortal Realm)
Hong Yi, took the throne today.

212
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,150
- They have announced it to the Three Realms.
- I see.

213
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,780
Your Highness, Feng Yin of the Phoenix Clan
was reborn recently.

214
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,180
The Phoenix Queen
is the head of all birds.

215
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,110
And the Heavenly Empress has returned.

216
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,060
It's no small matter.

217
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,230
So I ask for your instruction.

218
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,340
What gift should we give
on behalf of the Heavenly Palace?

219
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:07,750
Fire Lord, you're very thoughtful.

220
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,780
Indeed, we should send our congratulations
to the Phoenix Clan.

221
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,270
But no invitation has been sent out

222
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:17,750
from Wutong Island to the Three Realms.

223
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:20,060
Perhaps their clan has other plans.

224
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:22,670
Why don't we discuss this later

225
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,150
when we receive the invitation

226
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,270
from Wutong Island?

227
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:28,820
Doesn't the Fire Lord

228
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,180
remember who promoted her?

229
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:35,020
How dare she say the Phoenix Queen is the head
of all birds

230
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,470
in front of the immortal lords?

231
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:37,940
That's unacceptable.

232
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,780
The Fire Phoenix returned
with much fanfare.

233
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,870
A mere 1,000-year-old girl

234
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,590
is already a demigod!

235
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,550
And it happens that Feng Yuan chose

236
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,350
to find her successor at this time,

237
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:50,940
completely ignoring my accomplishments.

238
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,230
Obviously, she intends to offer the seat
to her own kind.

239
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:54,990
I noticed that the five lords

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,870
all had their own thoughts.

241
00:13:57,790 --> 00:13:59,110
They won't necessarily support me.

242
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,660
If I can get a True God's support,

243
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,150
I won't lose in the selection

244
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,180
for the next Heavenly Empress.

245
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:09,860
(Cangwu Hall)

246
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:10,710
Thank you, Elder.

247
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,060
- Elder.
- Thank you. Thank you.

248
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,650
- Thank you.
- Take it.

249
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,560
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

250
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:17,870
Chief.

251
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,030
Elder Feng Huan
is looking for you everywhere

252
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,200
to get the key to the treasury.

253
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,300
And here you are.

254
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,020
Does Her Ladyship

255
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,420
take a fancy to any treasures?

256
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:31,030
She heard
that the new Demon King had been crowned

257
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,190
and wanted to send a gift.

258
00:14:32,190 --> 00:14:33,030
What?

259
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:36,560
This is absurd.

260
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,590
A thousand years ago,

261
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,940
Hong Yi slaughtered the entire
Daze Mountain

262
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,910
and caused a war between the demons
and the immortals.

263
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,540
And now you were reborn as a demigod.

264
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:48,750
The entire Immortal Realm

265
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,080
expects that you, with your power,

266
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,020
will deter the demons.

267
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,700
How can we form an association

268
00:14:53,870 --> 00:14:55,660
with the demons at this juncture?

269
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:58,940
You're right, Chief.

270
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,110
I was negligent in this matter.

271
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:03,940
But it reminds me that

272
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,060
it'll be the Eagle Princess's birthday
in a few days.

273
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,630
We should prepare a special gift.

274
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,950
Will this make it equal
for immortals and demons?

275
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,180
Chief Feng Ming is unbelievable.

276
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:22,780
Though Your Ladyship

277
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,940
has declared not to take the throne
of the Phoenix Queen for now,

278
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,180
you're still the Fire Phoenix
we look up to.

279
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,840
You've shown him enough respect

280
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,780
by honoring him as the chief.

281
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,470
Why is he still so judgmental?

282
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:33,150
As the head of the clan,

283
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,830
he's got more concerns

284
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:35,990
than I do.

285
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,660
So he's not wrong.

286
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,510
In my opinion,

287
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,390
immortals and demons are
just two different kinds.

288
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,060
There's no such thing as good or evil.

289
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,990
Immortals and demons are
two different kinds.

290
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,020
There's no such thing as good or evil.

291
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,110
(I thought)

292
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:53,700
(I've tried hard enough to forget
all about him.)

293
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,750
(But without knowing,)

294
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,020
(he's affected me so much.)

295
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,380
(Cangwu Hall)

296
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,550
(She looks like)

297
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,940
(she doesn't want power,)

298
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,720
(and put me in full charge)

299
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:10,660
(of clan affairs,)

300
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,700
(but secretly, she deliberately
goes against me)

301
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,350
(and embarrasses me.)

302
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,160
Lord Hong Chou,

303
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:29,990
what does this mean?

304
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,350
His Godship Yuan Qi and the Phoenix Queen
are a match made in Heaven.

305
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,950
Now that the Phoenix Queen has been born,

306
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:39,470
His Godship hasn't waited a thousand years
for nothing.

307
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,780
I don't think
we should delay this wedding any longer.

308
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,380
(God Yuan Qi's thousand-year search for
Feng Yin's immortal spirit is not in vain.)

309
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,980
(Cangwu Hall)

310
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,630
(As long as Feng Yin is here,)

311
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,360
(Wutong Island will no longer)

312
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,510
(fall completely in my charge.)

313
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:06,390
(Why not marry her into Qingchi Palace?)

314
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,150
It's Her Ladyship's honor

315
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,940
to be able to marry His Godship.

316
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:17,220
Her Majesty is out at the moment.

317
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,420
As the chief of the Phoenix Clan,

318
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,790
I'll accept the engagement letter.

319
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:24,790
Your Majesty,

320
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:27,550
we received a gift from Wutong Island
of the Immortal Clan.

321
00:17:29,350 --> 00:17:30,390
A gift?

322
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,260
The immortals must be up to no good.

323
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,460
That Feng Yin was born a demigod.

324
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,550
I think they're doing this
to display their power to us demons.

325
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,560
I beg to differ.

326
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,900
Their envoy was respectful.

327
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,260
She even pointed out that

328
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:47,110
this is a personal gift from Lady Feng Yin.

329
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:50,110
I think maybe the Fire Phoenix wants
to thank Your Majesty

330
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:51,790
for helping His Godship Yuan Qi

331
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,070
collect her immortal spirit.

332
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:54,420
Whatever her intention is,

333
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,110
we cannot treat this lightly.

334
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,110
Qingchi Palace has just announced its engagement
with Wutong Island.

335
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,660
Offending Feng Yin will be regarded as an insult
to the God Realm.

336
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,500
And that won't do us any good.

337
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,280
What?

338
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,550
Yuan Qi is engaged with Feng Yin?

339
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,660
Is this true?

340
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,190
Hong Chou of Qingchi Palace
has confirmed it.

341
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,550
All Three Realms have got the news.

342
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:18,590
It can't be wrong.

343
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,900
Yuan Qi!

344
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,780
Your Highness, His Majesty is going to fight
with His Godship Yuan Qi.

345
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:29,670
What should we do?

346
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:30,510
Don't worry.

347
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,110
Their friendship

348
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,460
won't be destroyed just like that.

349
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,500
(Qingchi Palace)
Yuan Qi!

350
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,830
You ungrateful thing!

351
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,350
Come out!

352
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,790
Fox Demon, how dare you

353
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,590
show disrespect to His Godship?

354
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,320
Hong Yi,

355
00:18:56,590 --> 00:18:57,510
if you're not happy with me,

356
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,390
you can say so.

357
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:00,460
Why did you hurt my people?

358
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,660
How dare you lecture me?

359
00:19:02,830 --> 00:19:04,160
I thought that your feelings for Yin

360
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,300
were sincere.

361
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,420
Now you're preparing

362
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,270
to marry Feng Yin

363
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:09,630
with such fanfare!

364
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,660
What are you talking about?

365
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,670
This is nonsense.

366
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,940
You can drop this act.

367
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,180
You've sent the betrothal gifts.

368
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,500
And all Three Realms

369
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:19,590
know you're going to marry Feng Yin.

370
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,110
What's going on here?

371
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,630
Your Godship,

372
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,980
you haven't found the Water Divine Beast
after a thousand years.

373
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,500
Now that Feng Yin was born,

374
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:35,640
you should understand
who will be protecting all beings with you.

375
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,790
Aunt, it's been a thousand years.
How could you...

376
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:44,070
I'm going to withdraw from the marriage.

377
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:44,910
No.

378
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:46,980
If you withdraw from it now,

379
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,660
Feng Yin will become the laughingstock
of the Three Realms soon after she was born.

380
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,460
Even though Feng Yuan loves you a lot,

381
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,960
she'll probably be furious.

382
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,980
Aunt, you're wrong.

383
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,200
Should we ruin her happiness

384
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,190
for our reputation at the moment?

385
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:01,350
Yin is the only one I love.

386
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,160
I will never marry again.

387
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,310
Feng Yin shouldn't be the victim
of this marriage.

388
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,110
No matter how much
Aunt Feng Yuan blames me,

389
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,110
I can't let it lead to a bigger tragedy.

390
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,150
What?

391
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,940
Feng Ming accepted Yuan Qi's letter
of engagement?

392
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,780
Your Ladyship, His Godship Yuan Qi
is here at Wutong Island.

393
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,550
He's meeting with Her Majesty.

394
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:33,840
His Godship must be here to discuss the wedding.

395
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:36,250
He came right after we received
the letter of engagement.

396
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,550
He's far too eager.

397
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:40,780
His Godship is handsome and honorable.

398
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,700
And he's so devoted to Her Ladyship.

399
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,700
The other female immortals

400
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,940
are probably crying so sadly right now.

401
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:48,700
What's the use of being good-looking?

402
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,550
I won't even care

403
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,420
to look at an unfeeling man like him.

404
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:53,830
Unfeeling?

405
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,350
He's the God of Chaos.

406
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,390
He should be equal to the Three Realms.

407
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,900
How could he spare more feelings for me?

408
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:01,460
Even if he does love me,

409
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,480
what's the difference from his love

410
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,390
for street cats or dogs?

411
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,480
What?

412
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,310
You want to withdraw from the marriage?

413
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,240
Aunt, I haven't even

414
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,110
met Feng Yin once,

415
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:14,180
not to mention having affection for her.

416
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,660
Besides, I have other things to do.

417
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,160
You've been loyal

418
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,870
since you were young.

419
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,550
I can understand that you want

420
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:27,940
to focus on revenge.

421
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:32,110
However, they're not contradictory.

422
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:36,720
Your withdrawal will be a head-on blow

423
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,220
to the future Phoenix Queen.

424
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,740
This will make her the laughingstock
of the immortals.

425
00:21:43,110 --> 00:21:44,900
If you don't do something to make it up,

426
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:47,150
as her master,

427
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:49,660
I won't let you off the hook.

428
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,870
Whatever you request, Aunt,

429
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:54,260
I will do it.

430
00:21:54,830 --> 00:21:55,670
How about this?

431
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,350
We will announce the withdrawal.

432
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,590
That won't do too much damage

433
00:22:00,590 --> 00:22:01,740
to Feng Yin's reputation.

434
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:03,520
In addition,

435
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:04,950
you'll have to come down from your honor

436
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:08,070
and be Feng Yin's private servant for a month

437
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,660
to soothe her anger.

438
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,500
If you can do both,

439
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,500
I'll give my consent to the withdrawal.

440
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,080
Alright,

441
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,350
I'll do as you say.

442
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:23,900
She will never marry him?

443
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,500
Feng Yin actually said that?

444
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:29,500
Yes, Her Ladyship said exactly that.

445
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,870
Well...

446
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,220
Alright, go ahead and arrange it
as I instructed.

447
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:38,870
Yes.

448
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,420
Master agreed so easily?

449
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,460
And

450
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:48,660
how did that True God say?

451
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:52,790
(If Her Ladyship finds out)

452
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:55,000
(that she's been dumped by a man)

453
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,310
(she looks down on,)

454
00:22:56,790 --> 00:22:58,150
(she would be embarrassed.)

455
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:01,150
His Godship Yuan Qi

456
00:23:01,150 --> 00:23:02,390
regretted it a lot,

457
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,590
and begged Her Majesty.

458
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,150
Later,

459
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,990
after hearing the elders in the clan

460
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:09,070
mention Empress Hua Shu

461
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,550
and Yin's past,

462
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,390
feeling embarrassed,

463
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,780
he reluctantly agreed

464
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,220
to break off the engagement.

465
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,590
Was his reaction

466
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:18,830
really as you described?

467
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,350
Exactly like that.

468
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:29,660
(Fengyi Palace)

469
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:33,800
Your Godship,

470
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,260
Her Majesty ordered that

471
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,900
you and other disciples
should be treated equally,

472
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,180
with no special treatment.

473
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,950
But since all other positions
are already filled,

474
00:23:41,950 --> 00:23:43,380
I'll have to ask Your Godship

475
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,550
to take care of the courtyard.

476
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,350
I'll do whatever you arrange,
Elder Feng Huan.

477
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:30,320
Wait.

478
00:24:32,790 --> 00:24:33,940
Why are the flowers changed?

479
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,980
I ordered Golden Phoenix, Dragon Boat,
and Phoenix Tail Crown.

480
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,980
How can these plain varieties

481
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,110
match the dignity of Her Ladyship?

482
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,220
It's all right, Feng Huan.

483
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:48,110
I am tired of those colorful ones before.

484
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,700
I actually like

485
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,030
these elegant ones now.

486
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,040
Keep them.

487
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,260
I'll go back to my room.

488
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,040
Feng Ning,

489
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:27,910
who bought these flowers this time?

490
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:29,460
It was arranged by His Godship Yuan Qi.

491
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:40,000
Your Godship.

492
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:44,150
After thinking about it, the courtyard work
may not be suitable for you.

493
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,840
Coincidentally,

494
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,550
the kitchen needs people lately.

495
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,550
Why don't you go to the kitchen?

496
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,720
Alright then,

497
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,830
I'll do whatever you arrange,

498
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,830
Elder Feng Huan.

499
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:58,900
(Precious Delicacies)

500
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:20,320
Your Godship.

501
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,260
Her Ladyship doesn't like the delicacies
of the Immortal Realm,

502
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:26,310
but instead enjoys the simple meals
and ordinary snacks of the mortal world.

503
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,310
My culinary skills are useless,

504
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,390
and I have to study the recipes
in the Mortal Realm every day.

505
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,700
Your Ladyship, here are some
freshly made pastries.

506
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
Where did these pastries come from?

507
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,240
The cook made them.

508
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:10,350
The cook?

509
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:25,220
(Precious Delicacies)

510
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,040
Your Ladyship.

511
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,980
Why can you make
the delicacies in the Mortal Realm?

512
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:32,260
Your Ladyship,

513
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,310
I was taught by a new servant

514
00:27:33,310 --> 00:27:34,150
who just came.

515
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,590
He's inside.

516
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,480
Your Ladyship.

517
00:28:20,790 --> 00:28:22,110
Your hobbies are indeed

518
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,390
unique, Your Godship.

519
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,220
You know me?

520
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,460
On my day of Nirvana
a thousand years ago,

521
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,550
my immortal spirit
was scattered because of you.

522
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,110
Anyone would find it unforgettable.

523
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:34,420
I was being reckless a thousand years ago.

524
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,500
I sincerely apologize.

525
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,980
I accept

526
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,000
your apology.

527
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,190
Thank you.

528
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:44,550
Qingchi Palace needs you,

529
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,830
you should go back early.

530
00:28:46,590 --> 00:28:47,430
Your Ladyship,

531
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,500
I promised Aunt Feng Yuan

532
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,950
to work as a servant
on Wutong Island for a month

533
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,550
to make up for breaking up the engagement
unreasonably.

534
00:28:55,270 --> 00:28:56,460
(Breaking up the engagement?)

535
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,460
The snacks you are making

536
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,630
are really not to my taste.

537
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,700
Also, the garden you trimmed

538
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:12,420
looks increasingly unpleasant.

539
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,500
Why should I bear the consequences
of your mistake?

540
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,240
I will reflect on these matters
and strive to do better.

541
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,080
There's no need.

542
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:22,740
Go back to your Qingchi Palace.

543
00:29:23,310 --> 00:29:25,110
But I have promised Aunt Feng Yuan.

544
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,220
I should keep my word.

545
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,390
How typical.

546
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,220
You are only concerned
with keeping your word,

547
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,830
regardless of others' feelings.

548
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,900
You are always like this.

549
00:29:38,270 --> 00:29:39,110
Fine.

550
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,520
Just stay here.

551
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,070
Don't appear in front of me.

552
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:45,870
Out of sight, out of mind.

553
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,590
Her Ladyship is so cold.

554
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:57,950
Well...

555
00:29:59,550 --> 00:30:00,550
It tastes pretty good.

556
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,660
The kitchen is also quite tidy.

557
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,260
Her Ladyship has high standards.

558
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,660
It's my fault that her immortal spirit
scattered 1,000 years ago,

559
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,150
I can understand that she dislikes me.

560
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,620
I made that for Her Ladyship,

561
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,500
not for you.

562
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,060
She dislikes you anyway.

563
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:28,300
Pass the order, His Godship's birthday banquet
will be arranged according to this plan.

564
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,860
No mistakes will be allowed.

565
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,020
Do you understand?

566
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,940
Your Highness is so attentive
to prepare for the birthday banquet,

567
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:37,020
but we still don't know His Godship's thoughts.

568
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,780
If His Godship doesn't attend

569
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,540
the birthday banquet,

570
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,340
then it will be...

571
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,820
No matter what,
I will make him agree to attend.

572
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,700
Has he returned to Qingchi Palace?

573
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,660
He is still on Wutong Island.

574
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,900
(The rebirth of Her Ladyship is
a fortunate event for the Immortal Realm.)

575
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:55,720
(As the acting Heavenly Empress, I should
visit Wutong Island on behalf of all immortals.)

576
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,900
She's not quite qualified for the position
of the Acting Heavenly Empress,

577
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,220
but due to her relationship

578
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,060
with Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng,

579
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:04,020
the Heavenly Palace
wants to compensate her.

580
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,140
Lan Feng tragically died

581
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,460
a thousand years ago,

582
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,580
and Hua Shu believed that

583
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,300
it was a conspiracy between the demons

584
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,580
and an immortal beast.

585
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,220
However, His Godship

586
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,580
said it was the work of the devils.

587
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:17,220
The Peacock Clan still harbors revenge,

588
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,820
but with the oath of truce

589
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:20,660
made by His Godship,

590
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,700
the Immortal Realm
cannot provide support.

591
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:28,100
Even if you committed a terrible crime,

592
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,020
you're just an insignificant Water Divine Beast.

593
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,100
I will carry out the execution.

594
00:31:47,500 --> 00:31:50,300
Your Ladyship, do you feel unwell?

595
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:56,060
It's okay, I just didn't sleep well.

596
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,540
It seems that I can't meet
this Acting Heavenly Empress.

597
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:02,460
Please help me with this.

598
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,700
Do you find it hard to handle?

599
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,660
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

600
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:09,180
Rest well and take care of your health.

601
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:11,740
By the way,

602
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,580
she went through a lot.

603
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:18,020
Be polite to her and

604
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,020
prepare a generous gift.

605
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,820
Yes.

606
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,500
I came to congratulate Her Ladyship

607
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,740
on her rebirth after Nirvana,

608
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:38,020
but can't even meet her.

609
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:41,020
And you want to send me away with these.

610
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,580
Your Highness came
to Wutong Island in person.

611
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:45,340
We naturally dare not neglect it.

612
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,940
However, Her Ladyship is not
convenient to meet guests now.

613
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:50,340
Please understand.

614
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:54,020
This gift was personally selected
by Her Ladyship

615
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,180
as an expression of apology.

616
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,420
That's right.

617
00:32:57,340 --> 00:33:00,380
Feng Yin went through a lot to be reborn.

618
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,900
Not only them,

619
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,460
even I have to protect her.

620
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:07,020
Hua Shu, please understand.

621
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,980
Your Majesty, you are too kind.

622
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,300
Hua Shu, we'll have to rely on you

623
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,900
for the matters in the Heavenly Palace.

624
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:18,140
Feel free to tell me
if you need anything.

625
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:19,140
I mean, anything.

626
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,140
That's my duty, Your Majesty.

627
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,740
But I do need to ask you a favor.

628
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:26,260
I heard that His Godship is
still on Wutong Island.

629
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,660
I wonder if I can meet with him.

630
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,380
Next month is his birthday banquet,

631
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,060
and I have many matters
to discuss with him in person.

632
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:35,420
Yuan Qi?

633
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,980
He should be in the backyard now,
dealing with immortal herbs.

634
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,380
Your Godship?

635
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,780
Why are you doing these chores?

636
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,820
With your noble status,

637
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:02,540
the Phoenix Clan
actually asked you to do this

638
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,340
They are just taking advantage of your mild

639
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,500
and humble temperament.

640
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:09,940
I grew up by the side of Aunt Feng Yuan
and often played on

641
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,140
Wutong Island when I was a child.

642
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,140
I damaged so many immortal herbs.

643
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,540
Even if I take care of them now,

644
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,580
it's difficult to make up for it.

645
00:34:16,060 --> 00:34:17,180
Your Highness,

646
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,460
you don't need to make a fuss about it.

647
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:21,140
I'm sorry for that.

648
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,420
Is there anything else?

649
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,220
Your Godship's birthday

650
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
is approaching.

651
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,340
It's your 1,200th birthday

652
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:31,180
and is a grand occasion.

653
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,900
The immortals in the Heavenly Palace

654
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:36,260
intend to organize a birthday banquet,
and invite all the immortals to celebrate.

655
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,740
- So...
- There's no need.

656
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,140
I know you don't like these things,

657
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,940
but there is a necessary reason
for this birthday banquet.

658
00:34:42,950 --> 00:34:45,940
Recently, there have been continuous frictions
between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

659
00:34:46,180 --> 00:34:49,580
The demons seem to be violating the
truce agreement and preparing for a comeback.

660
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:53,380
The birthday banquet is an opportunity
to gather immortals and deter them.

661
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:55,380
After all, peace between the two realms

662
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,900
is also your wish.

663
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,100
Not much has changed here.

664
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,020
The first time I came to Wutong Island

665
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,780
was when Lady Feng Yin was born.

666
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,900
It was also the first time

667
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,500
I met you on this island.

668
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:13,980
Yeah,

669
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,220
thank you again for your help

670
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:19,260
at that time, Your Highness.

671
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:22,180
Like I said before, don't worry about it.

672
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,860
As for the birthday banquet,

673
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,140
I'll start to arrange it

674
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:27,740
and send out the invitations.

675
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,140
Let's talk about it later.

676
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,820
If this were in the past,

677
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:56,900
someone scrutinized
your every move like this,

678
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,380
you would surely make her embarrassed.

679
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,220
Aunt.

680
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,580
I wasn't eavesdropping.

681
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:07,500
I heard that

682
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,340
that Water Divine Beast named Yin

683
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:12,220
suffered a lot because of Hua Shu in the past.

684
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,940
I thought you might give her a hard time,

685
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,660
so I came to take a look.

686
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,820
I didn't expect that

687
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:21,860
you didn't get angry even
if she forced you like that.

688
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:24,020
You've really changed a lot.

689
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:25,260
To be honest,

690
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,100
the person least qualified
to blame others is me.

691
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,780
If we really want to settle accounts,

692
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,140
she and I should compensate Yin

693
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:35,420
for what we did before.

694
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,260
Stop doing this to yourself.

695
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:41,140
Are you going to torment yourself
with self-blame forever?

696
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,540
Forget it.

697
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,220
Since you've made up your mind,

698
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,900
I won't force you.

699
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,620
I originally thought

700
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:49,420
I could take advantage
of the time you stay here

701
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:51,660
to bring you and Feng Yin together.

702
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,940
How is that possible?

703
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:54,860
You must be kidding, Aunt.

704
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:58,300
I wanted to do that
because of your True God's body.

705
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:01,460
Feng Yin returned after a thousand years

706
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,740
and became a demigod
without going through Thunder Tribulation.

707
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,780
Who knows

708
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,500
what kind of tribulations are waiting for her.

709
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:11,900
I understand your intention.

710
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:13,580
If I have some strength

711
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,300
when that happens,
I will definitely help with all my might.

712
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,460
Why do you sound

713
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:24,540
so strange and ominous?

714
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,420
I just finished weeding,

715
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,540
and I'm a bit dirty.

716
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:35,780
I don't want to make you dirty too.

717
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:39,860
I'll clean up first.

718
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:47,420
How did this child become like this?

719
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,980
Enough.

720
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,540
Don't let anyone find out.

721
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,620
You know it's full of eyes here.

722
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,700
Instead of returning to Qingchi Palace,

723
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,140
why do you insist on staying here?

724
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:27,340
Just now, Her Majesty almost touched you.

725
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:28,900
She is at the peak of demigod.

726
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,220
If she touches you,

727
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:31,860
she will know what's going on.

728
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,540
It doesn't matter if she finds out.

729
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:36,260
I just don't want her to worry.

730
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:38,660
You should go back.

731
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,620
Ling Feng?

732
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,180
(Why did he sneak in?)

733
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:05,860
(Feng Yin practices and meditates
under the ancient tree at this time every day.)

734
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,460
(He might disturb her.)

735
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,700
I apologize.

736
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:23,260
I was taking a walk and enjoying the scenery,

737
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:24,440
and mistakenly entered this place.

738
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,900
I am sorry for disturbing your cultivation.

739
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,140
Please forgive me.

740
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,940
Your appearance

741
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,020
is truly stunning,

742
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:41,340
dazzling like the morning sun.

743
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:43,500
How come I've never seen you before?

744
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,900
Otherwise, I'd definitely remember you.

745
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:48,260
Could it be that you are

746
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,180
Lady Feng Yin, the newly born

747
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:51,180
Fire Phoenix of Wutong Island?

748
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:55,260
I heard that you have never seen outsiders
after your rebirth.

749
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,460
Unexpectedly,

750
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,820
I meet you in this situation.

751
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,860
I have to say,

752
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,460
this is our fate.

753
00:40:06,460 --> 00:40:08,220
Shameless.

754
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,260
What did you say?

755
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,340
(Thunder Fire Talisman?)

756
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,740
Lift it now!

757
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,260
Hey, don't use that...

758
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:31,260
(How could Feng Yin know
my Thunder Fire Talisman?)

759
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,780
What a coward.

760
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,300
Who gave you the courage to come

761
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,020
and pretend to have an encounter with me?

762
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:57,380
This is the ancestral tree of Wutong Island.

763
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,260
No outsiders are welcome.

764
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,420
Tell me,

765
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:02,980
who let you in?

766
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,140
Calm down, Your Ladyship.

767
00:41:08,740 --> 00:41:10,060
I have no ill intentions.

768
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:10,900
It's just that

769
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,340
I admire Your Ladyship

770
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:14,100
and asked Feng Ming for a favor,

771
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,740
- hoping to meet...
- Admire me?

772
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,540
You've never met me.

773
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,820
Where does the admiration come from?

774
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,180
You must think that

775
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:24,500
if you say a few flattering words,

776
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,820
I will be curious about you and like you.

777
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:29,780
You are as shameless

778
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,140
as a thousand years ago.

779
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,020
When I was born a thousand years ago,

780
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:36,020
it was also on Wutong Island.

781
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,740
You said something ignorant

782
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,540
and slandered the True God.

783
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:41,100
I still remember that.

784
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,820
And I taught you a lesson at that time

785
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,100
and hoped you would learn.

786
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,300
However, a thousand years later,

787
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,740
you are still making a fool
of yourself everywhere.

788
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,020
It was you!

789
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,860
It was you who stood up for Gu Jin back then,

790
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,300
not Hua Shu.

791
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,020
Since you know it now,

792
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,220
get out of here.

793
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,220
Show yourself.

794
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,060
The person who helped me out

795
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,180
on Wutong Island at that time was you.

796
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,740
You could show human form
before you were born?

797
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:49,260
I thought...

798
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:50,780
You don't have to say that.

799
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,620
It doesn't matter to me at all.

800
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:55,620
A thousand years ago, I just

801
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,340
taught a bully a lesson,

802
00:42:57,860 --> 00:43:00,340
I would do that for anyone.

803
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,620
Such trivial matters

804
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:03,700
don't need to be mentioned repeatedly.

805
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:05,460
By the way,

806
00:43:05,660 --> 00:43:07,620
it's time for you to return
to your Qingchi Palace

807
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,020
and give both of us a break.

808
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,060
Master,

809
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:20,900
it seems that Her Ladyship

810
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:22,500
really doesn't like you.

811
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,580
It's only now that I know that

812
00:43:26,780 --> 00:43:28,140
the person who helped me out back then

813
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:29,500
was not Hua Shu,

814
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,380
but Feng Yin.

815
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:33,860
Hua Shu has lied to me for 1,000 years

816
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,260
about this matter.

817
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:37,340
As for Feng Yin,

818
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,260
I actually mistook somebody else for her,

819
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,820
of course she would despise me.

820
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:45,300
It's just that
the Thunder Fire Talisman she used...

821
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,580
Thunder Fire Talisman?

822
00:43:47,180 --> 00:43:48,100
Is there a problem?

823
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:49,980
Isn't it the same as those you drew?

824
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:51,620
That's precisely the problem.

825
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,500
That was something I created

826
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:56,460
a thousand years ago for convenience.

827
00:43:57,460 --> 00:43:58,620
I only taught it to Yin.
