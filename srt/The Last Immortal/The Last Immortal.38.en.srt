Sir, don't throw it around. No, please. Don't.

Oh!

35
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:12,310
No.

36
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,150
Read it. Don't hurt it.

37
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,638
(Ancient texts from before the war)
(must have recorded)

38
00:03:19,662 --> 00:03:21,900
(against the devils)
(how the Ancestral God made gods.)

39
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:24,430
(I'm sure we can find a way
to save Yuan Qi.)

40
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,550
Why are all the previous files gone?

41
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,998
Your Majesty, the bamboo tiles
in these vacancies

42
00:03:33,022 --> 00:03:34,550
suggest they've been borrowed.

43
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:36,750
I don't know when the files
will be returned.

44
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,600
Borrowed?

45
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,950
The ones in the Archive were borrowed.

46
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,830
The ones here were also borrowed?

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,340
My library.

48
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:53,230
It's a bad habit to throw books around.
Do you know that?

49
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:57,150
Lord of Literature, who borrowed
the ancient files

50
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:58,890
(Lord of Literature)
about the birth of gods?

51
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,990
Well, I can't watch the library
every day.

52
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,300
How could I know?

53
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:07,400
By the way,

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:10,520
this year's imperial examination
in the Mortal Realm is about to begin.

55
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,400
I need to roll the dice and decide
the best candidate of the year.

56
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,620
I have to go. Bye.

57
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,680
Fu Chen.

58
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,460
Let go of me! Put me down!

59
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,560
A gentleman should be dignified
and elegant.

60
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,980
Put me down!

61
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,630
I'm gonna ask you one last time.

62
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:31,320
Where are the ancient files from before
the war against the devils?

63
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:32,390
If you don't tell me,

64
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,340
I wouldn't mind burning down
your library.

65
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,510
Don't be impulsive, Your Majesty.

66
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,980
I'll tell you.

67
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,750
It's Mr. Chang Que.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,070
Chang Que?

69
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,030
What brings Your Majesty here?

70
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,340
You do have it.

71
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,630
Did Yuan Qi tell you to do it?

72
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,780
He knew I'd read the files.

73
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,150
So he hid all of them.

74
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,020
What are you hiding?

75
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,310
Or do you already know how to save him?

76
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,190
Why don't you tell me?

77
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,830
Only when we fill up the Pool of Spirit,

78
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,980
can His Godship regain his spirit.

79
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,980
But to open the Pool of Spirit, each god

80
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,190
has to offer his beloved person's core
as a sacrifice.

81
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,190
True Goddess Yi He gave up
her Chaos Origin

82
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,750
to open the Pool
and save True God Di Juan.

83
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:05,150
True Gods and Goddesses are sustained
by Heaven and Earth.

84
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,390
As long as their god spirit is intact,
they'll survive.

85
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:13,100
To save His Godship, you have to
sacrifice your Phoenix core.

86
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:17,660
But you're not a True God.
Losing the core will kill you.

87
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,980
His Godship knows exactly that.

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,390
So he asked me to hide all the files
in secret.

89
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:30,020
He said you must never know
anything about it.

90
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,460
We all want to save His Godship.

91
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,460
But we don't want to see any harm
come to you.

92
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,340
So I secretly went through the files
His Godship told me to put away,

93
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:45,310
trying to find a better solution.

94
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,190
But now I simply don't know what to do.

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,980
That's a lot easier.

96
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,350
Feng Yin.

97
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,270
What's up?

98
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:12,580
Yuan Qi, you hid it from everyone.

99
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,780
You sacrificed yourself to resurrect
the whole Daze Mountain.

100
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,510
And you gave the last bit of
your god spirit to save me.

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,950
You need my Phoenix core.
Do you think I'll decline it?

102
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,540
Don't listen to them.

103
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:29,980
I don't want your core. I'm fine.

104
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,270
Fine?

105
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,390
Spirit Sword, tell us how long he'll
live.

106
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,540
The remaining Chaos Power in me...

107
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:40,900
Spirit Sword.

108
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,740
Say it!

109
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,780
It can only sustain him
for less than three months.

110
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,390
I can save you.

111
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,180
Feng Yin.

112
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,340
(Bright and Clear Moon)

113
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,660
It took me a long time to get you back.
I'm satisfied.

114
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,660
I lost Yin a thousand years ago.

115
00:08:19,190 --> 00:08:23,550
Can you bear to let me lose you again?

116
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,460
But how can I bear to lose you?

117
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:30,710
Your Godship.

118
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,060
Aunt Hong Chou.

119
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,180
What is it? What happened?

120
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:48,180
Your Majesty, I know I've made
too many mistakes in the past.

121
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:52,940
I'm grateful that you and His Godship
spared me.

122
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:57,230
Today, I must reveal a secret of
the God Realm

123
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,820
to atone for my past mistakes.

124
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:04,940
I'm willing to do it even if
True Goddess Yi He will punish me for that.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,630
A secret of the God Realm?

126
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:10,750
Please get up.

127
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,240
In order for His Godship to
restore his god spirit,

128
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,180
there's another way besides
the Phoenix core.

129
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:21,700
There is a substitute for it to open the Pool.

130
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,630
It's the Primus Spiritual Crystal.

131
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,340
It was left behind when the Ancestral God
established the realms.

132
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,270
It has no roots or leaves and belongs to
none of the five sacred creatures.

133
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,630
But it can absorb the energy of
all things and renew it.

134
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,420
So if we attach your Phoenix flare to it,

135
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:40,070
it will absorb your spiritual energy,

136
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:42,420
and refresh it as an alternative
for the Phoenix core.

137
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,270
Where is the Crystal?

138
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,230
The only piece left in this world

139
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,390
was created when the Ancestral God
built the Abyssal Prison to seal Ming Qi.

140
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,510
So the Crystal is in the Abyssal Prison.

141
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,510
The Abyss...

142
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,200
Feng Yin.

143
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:06,990
Your Godship, Your Majesty,
I've been guarding the North Sea.

144
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,420
Just now, a strong devil energy emerged
from Ruoshui Cave in Xuan Pond.

145
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,350
Before I had a chance to report it
to the Heavenly Empress,

146
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,150
many soldiers were sucked in by it.

147
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,590
Do you hear that?

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,660
This place has been completely polluted
by devil energy.

149
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,300
It's too dangerous.

150
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,180
Wait for me here.

151
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:25,510
Feng Yin.

152
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:33,180
You have to choose between
the Crystal and my Phoenix core.

153
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,270
There will be a way.
Don't be impulsive, please.

154
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,180
The only thing that can save you
is the Crystal.

155
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:45,270
It's a risk I have to take.

156
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,280
Feng Yin.

157
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,320
Spirit Sword.

158
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,320
Your Majesty!

159
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,160
Feng Yin.

160
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,840
Fu Chen.

161
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,800
Feng Yin, don't go.

162
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,630
At least not now.

163
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,700
Now Ruoshui Cave has become one
with the Abyssal Prison.

164
00:11:12,510 --> 00:11:15,350
If we do anything rash, we could bring
the Abyss to this world.

165
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,700
Do you remember Ao Ge and I said we
would find a way to seal the Abyss?

166
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:23,110
I've made a discovery now.
When I know for sure,

167
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,590
we'll get the Primus Spiritual Crystal.

168
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,230
I will find a way.

169
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,990
I've got three months to live.
I can handle it.

170
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:44,750
All right.

171
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,660
Let's think of something else.

172
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,560
Great.

173
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,820
This is where you're taking me.

174
00:12:01,630 --> 00:12:04,110
It's good. Nothing has changed.

175
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,470
You're the reason
that it's coming back to life.

176
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,420
Is that why you asked Fu Chen to take
Spirit Sword out for a drink

177
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,750
and brought me here alone?
To see this place?

178
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:35,710
Back in Daze Mountain,
you were always gluttonous.

179
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:39,700
I told you to do whatever you want

180
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,700
and whatever that's comfortable.

181
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,540
Stuffed tofu, braised pork joint,
and Pear Blossom Brew.

182
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:54,590
I didn't think I'd be able to drink your
handmade brew after a thousand years.

183
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,840
What's this?

184
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,780
A show in the Mortal Realm called
shadow play.

185
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,350
It tells a story.

186
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,390
Look.

192
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:11,680
Interesting.

the brew...

196
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,110
I'll drink Pear Blossom Brew
with you next time.

197
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,180
This is the strongest wine.

198
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:29,320
Why?

199
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:32,230
I know you don't want me to risk my life.

200
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,940
But I have to go to the Abyssal Prison.

201
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:44,990
Yuan Qi, you've done so much
over the years.

202
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:50,940
I'll do the rest.

203
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,060
Don't go.

(Cijian Pavilion)

208
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:13,870
It took me a lot of effort to knock
Spirit Sword out.

209
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,990
Um, why do you come to
the Nether Realm now?

210
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,840
Feng Yin.

211
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,230
I'm here to see Xiu Yan.

212
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,750
He was in the war against the devils
70,000 years ago.

213
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,350
And he personally sealed Ming Qi.

214
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:29,870
Now half of his core transforms into
a person in the Abyssal Prison.

215
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:33,060
He should know about
the Primus Spiritual Crystal.

216
00:15:39,270 --> 00:15:40,870
Bell Watching Tower?

217
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,040
Three-life Stone.

218
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:56,780
Feng Yin?

219
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,820
Feng Yin, what are you doing here?

220
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,230
I'm here to see Xiu Yan.

221
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:03,280
Well...

222
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,590
He... he's not here.

223
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:09,870
He's not here?

224
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,470
So where is he?

225
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,750
I... I don't know.

226
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,990
Don't mess with me anymore.
It's about Yuan Qi.

227
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,470
I'm really in a hurry.
I must see Xiu Yan today.

228
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,980
(Bell Watching Tower)

229
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,020
Why does Xiuyan Tower become
Bell Watching...

230
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,680
Xiu Yan...

231
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,420
Did something happen to him?

232
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,420
Tell me.

233
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,820
Xiu Yan sealed all
of Ao Ge's memories of him.

234
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:54,350
He said he felt his half of the core

235
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:58,350
can't seal the Abyssal Prison any longer.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:03,540
So he went to the Abyss to unite
the two halves of the core.

237
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,830
He wants do his best to defend the Abyss.

238
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:11,310
He's fighting against Ming Qi alone.

239
00:17:16,350 --> 00:17:21,110
He said he couldn't hold out for too long,

240
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,110
but he'd do his best to buy us more time.

241
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,940
He was ready to lose all his core.

242
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,310
That's why before he left,

243
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,590
he cast a spell to erase all of Ao Ge's
memories of him.

244
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:43,250
Feng Yin, but I really don't want to see
Ao Ge forget about him.

245
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:47,310
The Abyssal Prison
is about to be breached.

246
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,630
If this happens, Xiu Yan will be
in grave danger.

247
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,980
I'll definitely go to the Abyssal Prison.

248
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:03,700
But to save Xiu Yan, we must have
Ao Ge's help.

249
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,390
But Xiu Yan didn't want Ao Ge
to risk his life for him.

250
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,260
Ao Ge doesn't want to lose Xiu Yan,
either.

251
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,150
This irreparable regret of
losing someone forever

252
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,790
is going to be a lot more painful
than it is now.

253
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,110
Tell me. Where is Ao Ge?

254
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:40,500
(Bell Watching Tower)

255
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:41,660
To keep it company.

256
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:50,150
But why do I feel more lonely here?

257
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,550
That's because

258
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,740
70,000 years ago,
there were twin brothers.

259
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,390
The elder one sealed all the devils
in the Abyssal Prison.

260
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,180
His core shattered
after he sacrificed himself.

261
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,630
Xiu Yan, stay alive.

262
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:12,190
Go!

263
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,870
The younger one couldn't bear to see
his brother disappear.

264
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,260
So he took great pains to put half of
his brother's core inside him.

265
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,350
Since then, they've been sharing one body.

266
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:48,260
This building is not called Bell
Watching Tower, it's called Xiuyan Tower.

267
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:50,870
Xiuyan?

268
00:19:50,870 --> 00:19:52,590
There is a rule in the Nether Realm.

269
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,940
Whoever wants to meet with the Nether King
must bring something of great spiritual power

270
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,030
to Xiuyan Tower in exchange for
a guest tablet.

271
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:04,110
You're doing all this to keep
your brother's core.

272
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,150
Do you remember anything now?

273
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,110
Are you finished?

274
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:19,700
This is a touching story.
But what does it have to do with me?

275
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:22,480
Go.

276
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,110
Wait.

277
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,260
Your Majesty,
I want to show you something.

278
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:41,480
All memories will show
in this mirror. Transform.

279
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:00,760
Xiu Yan, what are you doing?

280
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:46,390
From now on, be yourself
and make your life count.

281
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:04,460
Your Majesty, are you all right?

282
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:06,940
Do you remember anything?

283
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,460
Xiu Yan.

284
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:13,280
Xiu Yan.

285
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,150
Why are you so stupid?

286
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:28,820
(Bell Watching Tower)

287
00:22:29,790 --> 00:22:31,940
The barrier of the Abyss is becoming
more and more fragile.

288
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:34,030
It's not hard for us to get in.

289
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,870
But it's difficult to ensure it's intact
after we get in.

290
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:43,900
What can be done to seal the Abyss
once it breaks?

291
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,030
Xiu Yan once repaired the cracks
in the barrier by sacrifice.

292
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,900
He may know something.

293
00:23:06,270 --> 00:23:07,550
This is Xiu Yan's notebook.

294
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,310
He'd write down all the important things.

295
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:20,870
The way to seal the Abyssal Prison.

296
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:26,240
Sacrificing the core of gods
born from Qiankun Platform

297
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:27,940
can repair the barrier.

298
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:31,350
Use True Gods' spirit as a lock

299
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:33,740
to reinforce the seal

300
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,260
and hold all devils in the Abyss.

301
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,390
True Gods' spirit?

302
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,830
No wonder Qing Lin must take Yuan Qi's
spirit a thousand years ago.

303
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:43,420
But now Yuan Qi is...

304
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:51,460
The odds are against us, right?

305
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:55,790
Take my spirit for that of a god
born from Qiankun Platform.

306
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,830
Though I'm not a True God,

307
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,940
we can seal the Devil God
for one more day

308
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:04,030
and save Xiu Yan.

309
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,740
How dare you set me up?

310
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,150
Spirit Sword.

311
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,870
I will split you into firewood.

312
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,300
Ouch! It hurts.

313
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,140
Ow.

314
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,550
Of my many good qualities,

315
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,460
you learned the tricky ones fast, like
giving someone the strongest wine.

316
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:33,430
Yuan Qi.

317
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,180
Luckily I know well, so I told Spirit Sword

318
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:39,870
to find me with senses
if he doesn't see me for a long time.

319
00:24:43,510 --> 00:24:46,420
I want to go to the Abyss to save
not only you

320
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,260
but also Xiu Yan who is also inside.

321
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:51,070
You and Xiu Yan have protected us
for so long.

322
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:54,070
This time we're going for sure.

323
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:58,220
Spirit Sword has just told me
about Xiu Yan.

324
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,500
Now you have Ao Ge's help.
I can't stop you anymore.

325
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:07,900
Since then, let's take a chance.

326
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,630
In the beginning,
the world was a chaotic one.

327
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,900
To dissolve the loneliness of the world,
the Ancestral God

328
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:21,220
turned a part of the God Realm into
the Lower Realms.

329
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,900
The latter was full of chaotic energy then.

330
00:25:24,790 --> 00:25:27,070
So the Ancestral God divided it

331
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:31,700
into the present immortal, demon,
and nether energies,

332
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,310
and forged boundary markers with
the Seal of the Supreme of the Three Realms.

333
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:41,110
The energies of the Three Realms
have been separated since then,

334
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,180
which also made three independent realms.

335
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:52,660
Immortal, demon, and nether energies
were born from the chaotic energy.

336
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:55,180
Putting the three in one,
it's the chaotic energy.

337
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,760
That's right.

338
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,180
Once the boundary markers are removed,
the three energies will become one.

339
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,830
Even without a True God's spirit,
we can still seal the Abyss.

340
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,350
This is the way I found.

341
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,150
As the Nether King, you can remove
the boundary markers with your seal.

342
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:21,830
This is indeed an unprecedented event
since the birth of the Three Realms.

343
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:24,630
It's going to mess up the nether energy

344
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,500
and disturb nether people's cultivation.

345
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:29,420
But I've been the Nether King
for tens of thousands of years.

346
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:31,070
I'm confident in my authority.

347
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,390
But it's not so easy for the Immortal
and Demon Realms.

348
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,460
I'll take care of them.

349
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:41,980
As long as you agree,
I'll give the message to remove

350
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:45,050
the boundary markers between the Three Realms.
It'll only take 15 minutes

351
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:46,350
to blend the three energies.

352
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:48,630
I believe you.

353
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:06,660
Though I lost one tail,
I've got nine left.

354
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,870
Why are you so worried
and standing guard around me?

355
00:27:10,870 --> 00:27:14,950
You're the Demon King now.
It's both my duty and personal care.

356
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,500
The injury is nothing.

357
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:25,870
But I haven't seen Yan Shuang
since we parted last time.

358
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,420
She's avoiding me, isn't she?

359
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:40,830
Blue Wolf, how dare you

360
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,180
bring a demon squad into Xuanjing Palace
to threaten His Majesty?

361
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,110
His Majesty?

362
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:48,740
All he does is suck up
to the immortal Eagle Queen.

363
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:50,310
What do I need him for?

364
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:56,260
Hong Yin, the tenth tail is a Heavenly
honor given to the Demon Clan.

365
00:27:56,750 --> 00:28:01,150
Instead of cherishing it,
you broke it to save an immortal.

366
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,390
You're not worthy of being our king.

367
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:07,310
You're a lackey of the immortals.

368
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,200
Right.

369
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,710
- Lackey.
- Lackey.

370
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:12,390
Your wounds have just healed.
I'll take care of them.

371
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,900
They are coming at me.

372
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:18,550
I'll have to settle it on my own.

373
00:28:19,590 --> 00:28:23,070
The Demon Clan worships the strong.
Let me show strength.

374
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:44,830
The tenth tail is mine.
I can give it to whomever I please.

375
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:49,070
You don't think I can lead the Demon Clan?

376
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:56,900
All right, then. Anyone who doesn't
like it can challenge me.

377
00:28:57,750 --> 00:28:59,430
You're asking for it. Go!

378
00:29:03,110 --> 00:29:05,030
I'll teach you a lesson today

379
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,940
and show you though I broke a tail,

380
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,740
you're still not my rival.

381
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,240
Hong Yi, be careful.

382
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,080
Yan Shuang?

383
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:10,550
Is this how you demons honor the strong?
By outnumbering your rival?

384
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,430
An immortal has no say
in the demon's affairs.

385
00:30:14,430 --> 00:30:17,390
Hong Yi is mine. Only I can bully him.

386
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,980
You guys are nobody.

387
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,460
You don't allow outsiders to meddle in
the demon's affairs, do you?

388
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,630
Look,

389
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,220
(Betrothal)
this is the betrothal between me and your king.

390
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:36,660
I'll be your queen from now on.

391
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,260
You have to stay alive to be
the Demon Queen.

392
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,630
Kill her. Go!

393
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:05,160
What are you waiting for?
Come and help.

394
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,080
Yes, my queen.

395
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:39,700
Yield.

396
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,630
I will serve Your Majesty.

397
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,420
We will serve Your Majesty.

398
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,030
There are indeed
a few devilish demons.

399
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,660
The devils have noticed your disrespect
for the Demon King.

400
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,110
So they used it to divide your clan.

401
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,550
You're all being used.

402
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:32,070
We will fully obey Your Majesty
and never challenge you again.

403
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:34,310
Forgive me, Your Majesties.

404
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,720
Forgive me, Your Majesties.

405
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,860
Never mind.

406
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:41,590
You were misguided. I'll forget it.

407
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:49,390
From now on, you have to obey
your king and your queen.

408
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:53,480
Did you hear that?

409
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:54,720
Yes.

410
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,420
I thought you came with sympathy
for my broken tail.

411
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,260
It turns out you just want to
borrow the emblem.

412
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:10,900
That's a nice thought.

413
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,390
It's important. Will you lend it or not?

414
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:16,670
Take it.

415
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:21,480
Anyway, I've gotten what I wanted most.

416
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:23,260
The emblem means nothing.

417
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:27,830
That was perilous, Demon King.

418
00:33:28,270 --> 00:33:30,030
Thanks to your help.

419
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,900
You broke your tail for me.

420
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:36,980
If it wasn't for me,
there wouldn't have been a mutiny.

421
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:46,790
Alright, the trouble's dealt with.
I'm leaving.

422
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,930
Hold on.

423
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:49,800
What?

424
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:52,070
Didn't you just have a betrothal?

425
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,830
It's just a blank sheet of paper.
See for yourself.

426
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,350
A blank sheet of paper?

427
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,220
I saw you were in trouble, so I lied.

428
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,510
Who's going to marry a disgrace like you?

429
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:13,910
See you.

430
00:34:16,510 --> 00:34:17,350
Yan Shuang, Yan Shuang.

431
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,240
Yan Shuang.

432
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,700
Yan Shuang, don't go.

433
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,910
You've just announced that
you're going to marry me.

434
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:30,660
How can you be so irresponsible?

435
00:34:30,660 --> 00:34:32,340
Hong Yi, why are you so cheeky?

436
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:38,380
As you can see, I'm weak and helpless.

437
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,070
I need your protection.

438
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:43,150
If you leave me, what will I do
if they bully me again?

439
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:45,180
Then you'll be bullied.

440
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,990
I don't have time to worry about you.

441
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:50,280
Are you serious?

442
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:54,780
Look, I can join your clan.

443
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:57,950
Yuan Qi joins the Phoenix Clan,
so can I join yours.

444
00:35:01,710 --> 00:35:04,630
Will you marry me, Yan Shuang?

445
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:10,340
I didn't want to force you,
but when I saw you coming,

446
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,820
I knew I couldn't let you go
no matter what.

447
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:18,800
So I've changed my mind.
I'm going to force you to be with me.

448
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:21,470
I've missed it a thousand years.
I can't miss my chance anymore.

Hong Yi, put me down.

00:35:48,630 --> 00:35:49,860
What are you doing, Hong Yi?

459
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,590
I've thought about it.
After I talk to your father,

460
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,220
we'll have the grandest wedding ever,

461
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,700
grander than Yuan Qi and Feng Yin's.

It doesn't matter if the demons
have objections.

The Eagle Queen I'm marrying is a warrior.

Anyone who doesn't like it
will have to fight us.

00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,030
You're so aggressive. Did I say yes?

466
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:09,630

What? Didn't you guys always
disturb us in the Mortal Realm?

472
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,990
We're leaving. You guys get on with it.

473
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:38,760
Let's go.

474
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:40,350
Stop right there!

475
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,150
This is nice.

476
00:36:49,590 --> 00:36:52,110
It's been a long time since the four
of us were so relaxed together.

477
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:58,180
When all the problems are solved,

478
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:02,030
we can be together more often.

479
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,320
Listen to the wind and enjoy the rain.

480
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,780
Now we've obtained the sacred objects
of the Demon and the Nether Realms.

481
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,220
All that's missing is the Seal of the Supreme
of the Heavenly Empress.

482
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,340
Tomorrow, I'll ask my master for it.

483
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,300
When the Three Realms and their energies
unite, chaos will seal the Abyss.

484
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:30,470
But Hua Shu has been promoted
to a Devil God and missing.

485
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:33,660
Hua Mo vowed to seize the Heaven.

486
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:35,950
I'm worried that Hua Shu will try to
seize the Seal of the Supreme.

487
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,910
The Seal of the Supreme serves
only the Heavenly Empress.

488
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:40,310
You can't just take it.

489
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:41,150
That's right.

490
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,150
But let's be more careful.

491
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,860
Master, judging by your power,

492
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:11,380
it won't take long
before we unify the Three Realms.

493
00:38:13,630 --> 00:38:16,910
The reason I want the Seal of the Supreme to
ascend to the throne of Heavenly Empress

494
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:20,780
is to deliver justice to all the immortals
who have betrayed Lan Feng.

495
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,180
I'm going to win.

496
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:53,760
Forget about it.

497
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,740
I'm not letting you out of here.

498
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,630
I'd like to stay here with you.

499
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,990
But I can't.

500
00:39:10,190 --> 00:39:13,260
Try to hold out for a few more days.

501
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,340
What's the point of hesitating
when you're already here?

502
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,030
It's an emergency, isn't it?

503
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:42,830
Master, we want to borrow
the Imperial Seal to seal the Abyss.

504
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,430
It's Yuan Qi's idea, isn't it?

505
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:51,110
Aunt, if it's true what they say in
the files, this method will work.

506
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:54,070
You want to remove boundary markers
of the Three Realms

507
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,300
and make chaotic energy
out of the three energies

508
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:58,910
to suppress the Abyss?

509
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:00,160
That's right.

510
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,150
It's a bold idea, but it's worth a try.

511
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:13,070
It's just that the Seal of the Supreme is
no longer in my hands.

512
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:14,820
It's not here?

513
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,110
It has returned to
the Nine Palace Tower itself.

514
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:25,700
The only way for you to get it is to
become the next Heavenly Empress.

515
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,180
Then I will fight for the throne
of Heavenly Empress.

516
00:40:34,110 --> 00:40:37,150
I'll get into the Nine Palace Tower to
retrieve the Seal of the Supreme.

517
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,300
Is Hong Yi ready?

518
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,780
He took the demon army around the
Lifeng Ridge to the Immortal Realm.

519
00:40:53,150 --> 00:40:54,470
They won't be discovered there.

520
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,100
Now they're ambushing on the west.

521
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,590
Together, we'll block the devil army.

522
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,780
(Yu Xiazi, Master of Wanyi Mountain)

523
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,180
(Grandmaster Tianhe)

524
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,030
Grandmaster Tianhe.

525
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:28,860
- What is he doing here?
- Why is Grandmaster Tianhe here?

526
00:41:29,110 --> 00:41:33,740
After countless years of cultivation,
I'm still one step away from ascension.

527
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:38,700
So I thought I'd take a look
in the Nine Palace Tower

528
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:40,820
and have a go for the Heavenly ruler.

529
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,910
Maybe I'll have an epiphany.

530
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:47,950
Your Majesty.

531
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,820
I've been the Heavenly Empress for
over a thousand years.

532
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:56,070
I'm deeply humbled to hold the throne.

533
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,590
Today, we hold this assembly

534
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:03,700
to elect a competent Heavenly ruler
for the Immortal Realm.

535
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:07,180
The three immortals in the back,
please come forward as well.

536
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,300
I will retire from the throne.

537
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:21,510
Whoever can pass the Heavenly tests
will get the Seal of the Supreme

538
00:42:22,280 --> 00:42:24,030
and become the new Heavenly ruler.

539
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:28,110
Whoever takes the throne must remember

540
00:42:28,110 --> 00:42:33,910
to serve every Immortal Clan and love
all of the Three Realms.

541
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:43,110
Disperse sunglow, and open tower.

542
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,150
Please enter the Tower.

543
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:13,150
Why hasn't the devil army made a move?

544
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:15,070
Is it possible that Hua Shu
has planned something else?

545
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,630
There's only one possibility
that they haven't shown up yet.

546
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:23,740
They're already in
the Nine Palace Tower in disguise.

547
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:29,860
Do you mean one of the three immortals
getting in with Feng Yin is Hua Shu?

548
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:33,780
The Nine Palace Tower is where the
Heavenly ruler is chosen.

549
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,630
They must have found a secret way to be
able to enter it without being detected

550
00:43:37,510 --> 00:43:39,300
by the devil energy.

551
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:42,740
The Master of Wanyi Mountain
has many friends.

552
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,150
It's not easy to impersonate him.

553
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:52,550
Is it... It has to be Grandmaster Tianhe
or Yu Xiazi.

554
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,060
Should we surround the Nine Palace Tower?

555
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,030
No, the Tower is closed.

556
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,470
Our presence will only alert them.

557
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,860
Don't worry. Hua Shu won't be alone.

558
00:44:03,070 --> 00:44:04,870
The devil army will come
at the right time.

559
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,910
It's best that we stay here.

560
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:12,510
