Yin.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,350
Jin!

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,940
Yin, you know this War God?

34
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,500
He's Gu Jin, a senior brother
of mine back in Daze Mountain.

35
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,940
Are you here to see me?

36
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:09,110
At the Spiritual Trigram Assembly,
the War God needs to wear an armor.

37
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,790
I've just taken the office,
and I don't have an armor,

38
00:02:11,790 --> 00:02:13,690
so I'm here to order a panoply.

39
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:14,780
You can count on me.

40
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,900
We've got quite a few new arrivals today.
Let me choose one for you.

41
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:24,340
Yin, let me ask you.

42
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:29,390
Is there a parasol tree in Sibing Hall?

43
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:34,060
Did you hear something
about the tree in the Heavenly Palace?

44
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,550
I don't think we have one here.

45
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,620
But according to the ancient books,
there's one growing right in Sibing Hall.

46
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,620
Fu Chen, you've been here for a long time.
Do you know anything about a parasol tree?

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,170
No. There isn't a parasol tree here.

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,340
But the ancient books say so.

49
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,150
How could there be
a divine tree like that in Sibing Hall?

50
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,510
Alright, let's drop this.

51
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,270
Go ahead and take measurements
for His Lordship.

52
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,150
Go on.

53
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,520
Open your arms.

54
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,740
Look. Look at that.

55
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:37,430
Then, is there any tree that looks
like a parasol tree in Sibing Hall?

56
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,270
That, I don't know.

57
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:45,950
It's a bare place.
I don't see any trees here.

58
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,120
Really?

59
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,510
Stand still.

60
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:05,800
Yin,

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,920
well…

62
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,150
It just hit me that
I've got another thing to do.

63
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,710
I'll come some other time.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,080
Your belt.

65
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:33,230
Confess. What's going on?

66
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,210
Hua Shu.

67
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,480
(Silu Hall, Heavenly Palace)

68
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,320
Hua Shu.

69
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:43,070
What's the matter with Lan Feng?

70
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:45,900
He said he'd let me be the Head,
yet I'm still waiting.

71
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,020
You should ask yourself.

72
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,880
Myself?

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,870
What did I do?

74
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,380
You promised that you'd fill your record.

75
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,140
As it turned out,
you fabricated the contributions.

76
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,300
Because of that, how could he still
give the Head position to you?

77
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,940
I had no choice.

78
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:10,660
Shu, you know how hard it is to make
contributions in the Heavenly Palace.

79
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,820
How could I fill the record
in such a short time?

80
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:18,660
Shu,

81
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:24,260
my Thunder Tribulation is approaching.

82
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,900
I failed two times already.

83
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:30,750
If I fail again, I can never break through
to become a Senior Immortal.

84
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,180
I, as the eldest son of the Peacock King,
have been staying at the Junior Immortal level.

85
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,460
The other immortals will laugh at me.

86
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,500
If you are worried about that,
you should've cultivated harder.

87
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,180
What's the point of saying that now?

88
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,260
Shu, there's an immortal weapon

89
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:00,380
in Sibing Hall called Xuanwu Shield
used for fending off thunderbolts.

90
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:01,700
If I can borrow it,

91
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:04,260
I'll be able to go through
the tribulation this time for sure.

92
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,700
His Majesty found out himself
that you faked the records.

93
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,180
I don't think you can ever be appointed
as the Head of Sibing Hall.

94
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,380
I can't believe that Lan Feng
would even check his own family.

95
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,860
Shu.

96
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:27,020
Shu, please help me.

97
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,820
Shu.

98
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,060
Shu.

99
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,940
Please do it
for the sake of our Bainiao Island.

100
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,460
Please help me, okay?

101
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,300
I have no one to go to.
You are my only hope, Shu.

102
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,940
Please help me.

103
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:46,100
Fine.

104
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,020
I do have a tablet for Sibing Hall.

105
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:56,140
(Sibing)

106
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,620
Take this tablet, sneak into
Sibing Hall in the middle of the night,

107
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:03,100
and then take Xuanwu Shield out in secret.

108
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,460
It can help you go through the tribulation.

109
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,620
Do not mess it up. Got it?

110
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,940
Understood.

111
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,460
You are my dear sister.

112
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,700
But, judging by his expression,

113
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,620
I guess he's not
on the same page with you.

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,860
That's not true.

115
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,740
He once confessed his love for me,

116
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,940
and we used to be very close.

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,940
But one day, somehow,

118
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:40,340
he seemed to have forgotten
everything that happened between us.

119
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,180
He only sees me as his junior sister.

120
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,780
What you said
reminds me of an immortal tool.

121
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,100
What tool?

122
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,140
I don't know what it's called,

123
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:02,140
but it can remove
an immortal's affection ties.

124
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:09,820
The one whose affection ties are removed
remembers everything connected to you

125
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:15,140
except his affection for you,
as if it was taken away.

126
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,340
Yes, it's exactly like that.

127
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,300
So, Jin's affection ties are removed.

128
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,660
No. No way.

129
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,940
No way?

130
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:27,420
What's so amazing about him?

131
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:29,700
Why would someone
remove his affection ties?

132
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,620
He is quite amazing.

133
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:34,420
But I'm not sure
why his affection ties were removed.

134
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,260
At least, I know what to do now.

135
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
I'll go ask him about it.

136
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,780
You can't.

137
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:46,380
If you tell it to the one whose affection ties
were removed before he could get them back,

138
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,860
his affection ties will be gone forever
and can never be found again.

139
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:54,940
If I can't ask him about it,
what else can I do?

140
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,980
I can't help you this time.

141
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,740
Just as I thought.

142
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:05,220
I knew he wouldn't forget me.

143
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:09,340
But how can I help him
get the affection ties back?

144
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,360
The only one who can fix the problem
is the one who created it.

145
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,540
If we knew who did it,
it'd be much easier.

146
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,700
But who would remove
Gu Jin's affection ties?

147
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,340
I don't understand.

148
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:20,980
Neither do I.

149
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,500
Did that person do it
to harm him or help him?

150
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,700
Gu Jin is the War God now.
Who'd dare remove his affection ties?

151
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,940
If that person wanted to help him,
how would doing this help him?

152
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,380
(Lady Hong Chou told me not
to tell anybody that Gu Jin is a True God.)

153
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,300
(It's his secret indeed.)

154
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,220
(It's better that
he reveals his identity himself.)

155
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,740
Maybe that person wants him
to stay away from me.

156
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:58,020
He'll leave me
after his affection ties are removed.

157
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:05,620
But, when it comes to love,
he should make his own decisions.

158
00:10:06,620 --> 00:10:08,340
Even if he doesn't love me anymore,

159
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:13,380
he should've told me in person
when he still had his affection ties.

160
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:17,540
I will find a way
and get his affection ties back.

161
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,700
Hua Yan,
how did you get into Sibing Hall?

162
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,820
In the name of the Head,
I order you to leave right now.

163
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:44,900
Cut the crap.

164
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:47,540
I'll be promoted soon. I need Xuanwu Shield
to fend off the Heavenly Thunder.

165
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,740
Hand over Xuanwu Shield right now.

166
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,500
Xuanwu Shield is damaged.
I can't lend it to you.

167
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:52,780
Besides, you don't seem
like you are here to borrow it.

168
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,940
Then I'll look for it myself.

169
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,620
Help. Help.

170
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:06,460
Let's go.

171
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,140
Xuanwu Shield.

172
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,380
Xuanwu Shield.

173
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:50,180
How dare you make trouble here?

174
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,540
Come on. Do it.

175
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,340
I have the Shield now.
Come on. Strike me.

176
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,100
Who broke into Sibing Hall?
Aren't you afraid of the Heavenly rules?

177
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:09,700
Hua Yan, Xuanwu Shield is damaged already.
It can't fend off the tribulation for you.

178
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,100
It'll be completely destroyed
if you keep using it.

179
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,748
If you want to go through the tribulation,

180
00:12:13,772 --> 00:12:15,420
you should find a place
full of spiritual energy.

181
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:18,340
These immortal weapons
are all forged by iron. So what

182
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,260
if they are destroyed?

183
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,580
You…

184
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:26,860
Sibing Hall.

185
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:29,940
(Courageous and Fearless)

186
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,700
Fu Chen.

187
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,180
- Yin.
- Yin.

188
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,900
Jiu.

189
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:55,540
Yin.

190
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,940
Let's go.

191
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:54,940
Are you okay?

192
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,180
One last strike. Help me take it.

193
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,180
Don't hurt me.

194
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,340
Don't hurt me. Don't hurt me.

195
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,820
Don't hurt me.

196
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,500
Yin, are you alright?

197
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:38,660
I have a headache.

198
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,740
Headache?

199
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,260
You weren't struck by the thunder.
Why do you have a headache?

200
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:47,900
I think my old condition is acting up.

201
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,500
Since when did you
have a headache problem?

202
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,580
Don't worry. It's no big deal.
I'll be better soon.

203
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,020
- Yin.
- Yin. Yin.

204
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,340
I'll go treat her. Please watch Hua Yan.

205
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,780
I'm fine.

206
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,380
She faked her headache for Gu Jin.

207
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,380
Is that necessary?

208
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,140
And you.

209
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,620
Hadn't been for me, you would've
been struck by the last thunderbolt.

210
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:26,700
I'm fine.

211
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,740
It's medicine. Apply it yourself.

212
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,660
Where did you get hurt? Let me see.

213
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,700
Tell me.

214
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,340
Where?

215
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,900
Here.

216
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,420
Here?

217
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,660
This is an old wound?

218
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,380
Yin, when did you become this delicate?

219
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,380
Though it's an old wound, it still hurts.

220
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,220
Don't move.

221
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,180
Where do you keep the medicine?

222
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,940
I don't have medicine.

223
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:34,060
Alright, I'll go get some for you.

224
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,700
Don't go.

225
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:37,940
What's wrong?

226
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,980
I can't be left alone
because of my wound.

227
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:48,740
You are hurt, and you need medicine.

228
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,740
Wait here. I'll be right back.

229
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,420
Then please hurry.

230
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
Okay.

231
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,020
Here.

232
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:20,180
Take it.

233
00:17:22,940 --> 00:17:24,260
You need to take medicine for recovery.

234
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:25,940
Hurry.

235
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,260
Three.

236
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,540
Two.

237
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:37,580
Tastes good?

238
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,700
What's this?

239
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:42,140
This is the pear blossom soup I learned
from the chef of War God Hall.

240
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,580
Tastes good, right?

241
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:54,100
I still have a headache.
And I feel a little dizzy.

242
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,780
I heard they keep a few
spirit leeches in the Elixir Room.

243
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:04,300
Once they suck your blood out,
they can tell what condition you have.

244
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,420
Have the soup. I'll go get a few for you.

245
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,740
No need.

246
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,580
Why not?

247
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,060
We need the leeches
to suck your blood out,

248
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,220
so we can find out
what condition you are suffering from.

249
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,900
Only then can we know how to treat you.

250
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,580
Well… I…

251
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,740
What? You are fine now?

252
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:25,580
Tell me, why did you lie to me?

253
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,300
- I…
- Be honest.

254
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,260
I want to see
if I still have a place in your heart.

255
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:37,940
Of course you do.

256
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,620
You are my junior sister.

257
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,060
I mean the most important place
in your heart.

258
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,860
Yin, I've told you, I'm your senior brother,

259
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:55,540
and I always will be. There's nothing more.

260
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,380
Are you sure?

261
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:00,620
But when my life was in danger,
you came to my rescue immediately.

262
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,860
I could see the concern and care in your eyes.
It's not something you can fake.

263
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:08,060
And, Jin, you do like me.

264
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,420
You just… just…

265
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,480
- Just…
- Just what, just?

266
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:18,620
I say, you've read too many
story books that Qing Yi gave you.

267
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,060
I'll confiscate them.

268
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,260
Try to sleep early.

269
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,020
Finish the soup.

270
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:31,660
By the way,

271
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:36,900
if you really have a headache,
send someone to War God Hall to find me.

272
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,740
Don't play tricks on me anymore.

273
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,060
Go to sleep.

274
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,300
(He still cares about me.)

275
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:49,100
(If the affection ties can be removed,
they can also be restored.)

276
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,060
(I must find your affection ties back.)

277
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:16,780
It's all Yin's fault. I had nightmares
because of the nonsense she talked.

278
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:20,020
Alright,

279
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,460
let me think of some delicious food.

280
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,780
Delicious food.

281
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,340
Roast chicken, steamed fish,
ribs, crispy gristle.

282
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,820
Try this. It's tasty.

283
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,340
Make it stop.

284
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,540
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

285
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,020
You want to see me?

286
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,940
You recognize this tablet?

287
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:12,260
(Sibing)

288
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,940
Hua Yan broke into Sibing Hall yesterday
with this tablet to steal an immortal weapon.

289
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:25,180
He caused a big mess in the hall
and damaged a lot of immortal weapons.

290
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:26,940
Did you know that?

291
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:33,340
Shu, you violated the Heavenly rules.

292
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:36,220
Hua Yan is my elder brother,
and the Peacock Prince.

293
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,900
He was about to be promoted,
but his cultivation base wasn't enough.

294
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:42,940
Without Xuanwu Shield, he'd never be able
to level up to Senior Immortal.

295
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,900
He came to me for help.
How could I reject him?

296
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,460
But, Shu, you weren't helping him.

297
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,100
If Hua Yan isn't gifted enough,
he should cultivate harder to get better.

298
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,860
If he relies on pulling tricks

299
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,780
and harming others to get promoted
instead of working hard,

300
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,820
what's the point
having an immortal like him?

301
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:06,860
You hold an important post in the Palace.
How can you win people's respect

302
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,140
if you abuse your power
for personal advantage?

303
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,020
So, Your Majesty,
are you going to punish me too?

304
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,620
Hua Yan made a big mistake.
He can't get away from it.

305
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,540
Shu,

306
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,540
I want you to write a self-criticism letter
and tell the entire Palace what you did.

307
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,820
Your Majesty, you are impartial
and righteous indeed.

308
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:44,820
I thought you'd treat me differently,

309
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,540
but I guess it was only
my own wishful thinking.

310
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,580
I'll take my leave now.

311
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,860
Your Lordship,
I didn't know you were coming.

312
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:39,220
Your Lordship, why are you
looking at me like this?

313
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:47,060
Fu Chen, where on earth
is the parasol tree in Sibing Hall?

314
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:51,780
Your Lordship, as I said last time,
I have no idea.

315
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,980
I still have things to do.

316
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,860
I'll take my leave.

317
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,260
Come back.

318
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:59,240
- Fu Chen.
- You really don't know?

319
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:00,300
You…

320
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,700
Jin, what are you doing here?

321
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:06,900
What are you…

322
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:11,020
I finally found the parasol tree.

323
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,980
What do you mean?

324
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,100
You used Fuchen Sword to shield off
the Heavenly Thunder yesterday, didn't you?

325
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:24,700
Shown on the Sword was the unique
Phoenix Flare Pattern of the parasol tree.

326
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,660
I… I am a wooden sword
made of the parasol tree wood.

327
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:39,820
And part of Feng Yin's immortal spirit
did fall on the heart of the tree.

328
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,220
But, my immortal spirit is damaged.

329
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:46,740
I can only stay alive
relying on Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

330
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:54,180
If you take her immortal spirit away,
I'll die.

331
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:55,020
Stop.

332
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,380
Stop.

333
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:03,100
- Fu Chen, let us see it first.
- Where is that parasol tree?

334
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:21,620
The wood element is damaged,
and the fire element is insufficient.

335
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,620
But, Fu Chen, don't worry.
I can help you.

336
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,020
Forget it.

337
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,220
It's no biggie. Let me.

338
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:31,580
You?

339
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:40,780
It's the seed of Sun Glare Herb
from our Daze Mountain.

340
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:43,740
It can restore the elements of wood and fire
and nurture your immortal spirit.

341
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:55,020
Thank you, Your Lordship.

342
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,020
In that case, please take
her immortal spirit away.

343
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,140
Thank you.

344
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,220
It's done.

345
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,620
I still have things to do
in War God Hall. I'll leave now.

346
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,700
Yin,

347
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,460
help me thank Elder Fu Chen.

348
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,300
I should thank you.

349
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:40,220
Your Lordship, you saved my life.
I'll never forget your kindness.

350
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,860
Go after him if you want to.

351
00:26:56,020 --> 00:27:00,140
I'll annoy him
if I go after him for no reason.

352
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,060
(Bainiao Island, the Immortal Realm)

353
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:14,060
Father.

354
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:19,260
Hua Yan failed to go
through his tribulation again.

355
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,460
My brother's got bad luck.

356
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,060
I'll try my best to find
a good position for him in the Palace.

357
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:31,220
He was severely punished, and you wrote
a self-criticism letter because of him.

358
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:35,380
I'm afraid he's too ashamed
to ask for a position now.

359
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,180
I already made a marriage arrangement
for him with Kunlun Mountain.

360
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:42,460
He was supposed to get married
upon his tribulation and promotion.

361
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,180
But yesterday, Kunlun Mountain sent me
a gift for ending the marriage arrangement.

362
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,020
So, the marriage deal is over.

363
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:55,020
The allies of our Bainiao Island
are getting fewer and fewer now.

364
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,020
If we can't form an alliance
with a big sect through marriage soon,

365
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:02,220
I'm afraid we can't
sustain our power anymore.

366
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:10,500
Shu, there's only one solution.

367
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:12,020
What is it?

368
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,260
The Third Prince of the South Sea
has been admiring you.

369
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:16,900
Why don't you marry him?

370
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:20,060
That way,
the South Sea will be on our side.

371
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:24,260
Father, if you want to get support from
the other forces, there are many ways to do it.

372
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:26,000
Why do we have
to form an alliance through marriage?

373
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:29,540
Ever since Immortal Lord
Quan Yun stepped down, there have been only

374
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,940
four Immortal Lords, in charge of
Wind, Fire, Thunder, and Lightning.

375
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:39,500
His position hasn't been filled in yet.

376
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:43,540
The positions of the five Immortal Lords
are honorable and important.

377
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:47,780
They're above all the other immortals,
and also serve as advisers to His Majesty.

378
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,260
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly
will be held soon.

379
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:55,700
A new Immortal Lord will be elected
after the Assembly to fill in the position.

380
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:00,740
I heard that the Eagle Clan
has been qualified to run for this position.

381
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:02,020
How's that possible?

382
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:04,140
They suffered great losses in the battle.

383
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:06,660
How could they get the resources
they need for the election so quickly?

384
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:10,700
It's all because they humiliated us
at the birthday banquet last time.

385
00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:14,500
Through doing that, they won
a lot of support and benefit.

386
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:18,500
And now, they are
as equally powerful as us.

387
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,980
Shu, if someone from the Eagle Clan
becomes one of the five Immortal Lords,

388
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:27,500
our Peacock Clan will never
get a chance to make a comeback.

389
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,780
Lan Feng is way too upright and honest.

390
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:33,340
He will not show favor towards us for you.

391
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,660
In that case, I'd rather you
marry into the South Sea.

392
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:39,740
The Third Prince of the South Sea
is known as a womanizer in the Immortal Realm.

393
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,260
How could you let me marry him?

394
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:44,128
Shu, with your intelligence, if you marry him,

395
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,700
it won't take long
before you take over the power.

396
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:50,940
As for that Third Prince,
as long as he's not a ruthless villain,

397
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,260
marrying him will do you
more good than harm.

398
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,020
Shu.

399
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:06,300
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

400
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,340
(I can't marry the Third Prince
of the South Sea.)

401
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,980
(But, if I don't,)

402
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,180
(which sect would agree
to ally with our Bainiao Island?)

403
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,300
(It's all because of Yan Shuang and Yin.)

404
00:30:24,820 --> 00:30:28,500
(Hadn't been for them, my brother
wouldn't have ended up like this,)

405
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:30,860
(and I would've still had other options.)

406
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,060
Your Highness, you've got a visitor.

407
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:36,900
I'm not available.

408
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,980
It's His Majesty.

409
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,180
Let him in.

410
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,340
Yes.

411
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,700
Shu,

412
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,620
I was being too harsh on you earlier.

413
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,340
I'm here to apologize to you.

414
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,820
You look pale. Are you feeling unwell?

415
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:13,580
Your Majesty, you still think of me
when you are busy with the court matters.

416
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,500
I feel so flattered.

417
00:31:15,780 --> 00:31:18,260
Shu, don't say that.

418
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,700
Let's sit down and…

419
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:23,820
You say you care about me,
but it's all talk.

420
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,580
I've served the Heavenly Palace for centuries,
and I've never taken a leave.

421
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,940
It's the first time I've done it,
so I can come here to see you.

422
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,340
It's not just all talk.

423
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,208
But, do you know my father is going to
marry me off

424
00:31:38,232 --> 00:31:40,260
to the Third Prince of the South Sea?

425
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,700
How come?

426
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:47,620
You and I are in love, and your father knows
that I've proposed to you.

427
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
You proposed,
but I didn't say I'd marry you.

428
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,490
Kunlun Mountain turned my brother's
marriage arrangement down a few days ago.

429
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,860
My father has no other choice but
to marry me off to the South Sea

430
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,980
to steady the power of the Peacock Clan.

431
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:02,380
Though our Penglai Island
is not as influential,

432
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,540
do you consider your marriage
a business deal only?

433
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:11,980
It matters to the future of our clan.
Anything can be a business deal.

434
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:25,260
If you really love me,
there is one thing you can do.

435
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:27,820
Tell me.

436
00:32:28,060 --> 00:32:31,460
The vacant Immortal Lord position will be filled
soon. If you grant me the position

437
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:34,980
as a wedding gift, I assure you
my father will marry me off to you.

438
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:36,700
Shu,

439
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:41,580
our marriage is a private matter,
while the election is a court matter.

440
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:45,420
If you run for the position,
I will give you a fair vote.

441
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:49,380
But, if you want me to convince the others
to vote on you and manipulate the election,

442
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:51,980
I cannot do that.

443
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:55,900
Even if you'll watch me
marry someone else?

444
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
Shu,

445
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,140
you are the only girl I've ever loved,

446
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,900
and I only want you to be my wife.

447
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:15,380
If our relationship
becomes a trade of power,

448
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,180
that's not what I want.

449
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:20,340
If you love me,

450
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:22,860
you should see me only in your eyes,

451
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,820
not the benefits or interests
you can gain from our marriage.

452
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:27,140
Alright.

453
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:31,460
I'm way too benefit-driven.
I'm sorry I disappointed you.

454
00:33:32,380 --> 00:33:33,820
I don't want to stain your reputation.

455
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,940
Your Majesty, please leave
this place full of covetousness.

456
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,540
Shu.

457
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:54,700
Okay.

458
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:00,340
Then try to sleep early.
I'll come to see you another time.

459
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:46,700
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

460
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:51,140
Lady Hong Chou, you haven't
left Qingchi Palace for a long time.

461
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:54,500
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly was held
for the harmony among the Three Realms.

462
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:58,820
Unfortunately, it's been suspended
since the Immortal-Demon War 200 years ago.

463
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,420
This year, it'll finally be relaunched again.

464
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,060
It matters a great deal,

465
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:07,140
so, I'm here to show my support
for the Assembly on behalf of the God Realm.

466
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:11,420
Lady Hong Chou, since you are here in person,
the Assembly will attract great attention.

467
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,460
(War God Hall)

468
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:18,140
His Lordship went to train the soldiers.
He's not available for now.

469
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,940
Then please help me
give this armor to him.

470
00:35:25,180 --> 00:35:28,620
Tell him that Yin of Sibing Hall
made it for him especially.

471
00:35:28,620 --> 00:35:29,460
I will.

472
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,860
Thank you.

473
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,220
(War God Hall)

474
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,060
You again.

475
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,140
Lady Hong Chou.

476
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,900
What are you doing here
in the Heavenly Palace?

477
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,980
I work in Sibing Hall.
Of course I'm in the Heavenly Palace.

478
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:00,220
Then you should focus on your own job.

479
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,940
Why did you come here to disturb Gu Jin?

480
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:05,260
Disturb?

481
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,740
It's a little weird for you to say that.

482
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,980
Jin is my senior brother,
and I'm his junior sister.

483
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:14,100
It's only normal for me
to come to see him.

484
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,700
I'm afraid you never
consider yourself as his junior sister.

485
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:19,700
Instead, you have wrong thoughts
towards him, and keep bothering him.

486
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:22,340
Let me remind you again.

487
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:26,020
His Lordship is the son
of True Goddess Yi He.

488
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,700
He's way out of your league.

489
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:30,540
You should give up
and stop wasting your time.

490
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:31,980
Fine.

491
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:34,500
Then, Lady Hong Chou,
let me make this clear again,

492
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,340
I like Jin.

493
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:39,420
Whether he's a mortal, a god, or an immortal,
I like him as who he is.

494
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,180
Besides, Jin is different from you.

495
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:44,860
He doesn't care about such a thing as origin.

496
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:47,700
Unlike him, although you are
from the God Realm,

497
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:50,500
you are so narrow-minded
and don't act like a god at all.

498
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,580
You are sharp-tongued,
but you should save your energy.

499
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:56,420
No matter what you say,
you don't get to decide who he likes.

500
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,300
I will stay in the Heavenly Palace
for a while.

501
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:03,860
I will not let you ruin
His Lordship's life.

502
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,860
And who he likes is not
up to you either, Lady Hong Chou.

503
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,860
We should let Jin
decide his own matters.

504
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,180
If there's nothing else, I'm leaving.

505
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,020
See you.

506
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,180
Your Highness.

507
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:31,620
Your Highness,

508
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,060
Gu Jin is actually a god.

509
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,500
But there's nothing special about him.

510
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:37,500
Gu Jin's status is very distinguished.
Be careful with what you say.

511
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,980
I should've long thought of that.

512
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:48,420
Donghua hadn't taken in any disciple
for long, yet he only favored Gu Jin.

513
00:37:49,340 --> 00:37:53,420
Feng Yuan is awed by the Three Realms,
yet she didn't even blame Gu Jin at all.

514
00:37:54,500 --> 00:37:56,740
I should've thought of it earlier
that he is a god.

515
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,340
Come to think of it,
it's not a bad thing, though.

516
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,620
He once admired you so much.

517
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,180
It's all in the past.

518
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,460
After all, I did turn him down.

519
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:10,460
If I had known that he's
the only True God in the Three Realms,

520
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,460
I would've gone out my way
to get close to him.

521
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,740
That way, in the Immortal Realm…

522
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,260
No,

523
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:19,700
Bainiao Island would become distinguished
in the entire Three Realms.

524
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,900
Unfortunately, Gu Jin
kept a low profile before.

525
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,780
I chose the wrong man
between him and Lan Feng.

526
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,020
Your Highness.

527
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,060
Although Gu Jin is of a high status,
Lan Feng is not bad either.

528
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,900
I can see that His Majesty
is truly in love with you.

529
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,460
In the Immortal Realm,
true love means nothing.

530
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,700
I want someone who can
back me up and help Bainiao Island.

531
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:53,780
It seems that I have to
win Gu Jin's love back.

532
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,660
But Yin is by his side all the time.

533
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,100
It's hard for us to do anything.

534
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:05,300
I didn't know Gu Jin's real identity before,
so I never made a pass at him.

535
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:06,940
Now it's different.

536
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,820
As long as I want to, I'm sure
I can make him love me again.

537
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,660
Your Ladyship.

538
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:26,260
I heard about the beauty
of the Peacock Princess.

539
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:29,860
Now that I see you today,
you do live up to your reputation.

540
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:33,940
I'm just an ordinary girl.
I'm so flattered by your compliment.

541
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,740
So, what brings you here?

542
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,580
I heard you came to oversee the preparation
of the Spiritual Trigram Assembly.

543
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,220
I'm in charge of Silu Hall,

544
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,580
so I'm here to discuss
the work division with you.

545
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,260
I don't know many people here.
I assume you must've come prepared.

546
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,660
Tell me what your plan is.

547
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,420
The Three Realms will all
send envoys here this time.

548
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,460
The security of the Assembly
is the most important thing.

549
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,780
Very few are qualified to do this job.

550
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,780
And that's what bothers me the most.

551
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,420
Luckily, there is one rising warrior,

552
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:05,340
who's young but has strong leadership.

553
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,500
He's also very smart,
determined, and brave.

554
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,340
I've never met
an outstanding man like him before.

555
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:15,260
I won't feel relieved
unless he does the job.

556
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,220
Who is this man
who impressed you this much?

557
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,980
It's Immortal Gu Jin of War God Hall.

558
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,340
Gu Jin. I see.

559
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:25,620
You've got a good eye.

560
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:28,020
He's qualified for the job indeed.

561
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,060
You are right.

562
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,940
You overheard
Gu Jin's real identity just now,

563
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:36,820
so you said those things
to please me. Well done.

564
00:40:37,460 --> 00:40:38,860
Your Ladyship, I…

565
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:41,500
Don't be afraid.
I didn't say I'd punish you.

566
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,820
I just want to warn you
not to eavesdrop anymore.

567
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:50,980
If you think you can trick me,
you are sadly mistaken.

568
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:53,060
Thank you for your forgiveness.

569
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,980
I didn't do it on purpose.

570
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,460
On purpose or not, it doesn't matter.

571
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,460
But, I can see your appreciation
towards Gu Jin is real.

572
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,540
I dare not have improper thoughts.

573
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:08,740
Thoughts are thoughts, improper or not.

574
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,860
Our Gu Jin came to
the Three Realms for a trial.

575
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:17,060
If someone truly loves him,
I won't get in the way.

576
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:22,660
But whether you'll be that someone
depends on your destiny.

577
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,940
I can see you are a smart girl.

578
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:33,540
In the future, if Gu Jin needs any help,
I hope he can have your support.

579
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,820
Alright, I'm tired. You can go now.

580
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,660
I'm taking my leave.

581
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:58,460
You are far from
being a good fit for Gu Jin.

582
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,740
But I can use you
to make Yin back off. It's good.
