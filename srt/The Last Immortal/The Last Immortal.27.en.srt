29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,580
(Pear Blossom Cottage, the Mortal Realm)

30
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,740
I know my father's thoughts now.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,940
Uncle, please go back first.
I need to think about it.

32
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,430
Yan Shuang.

33
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,020
(Beautiful Spring after the Snow)
Your father's asked you to succeed to the throne,

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,070
but you all refused.

35
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,900
You know your father's temper.

36
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,380
He wouldn't have sent me here

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,460
if he'd had other choices.

38
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,910
Is my father okay? Is he unwell?

39
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:08,670
He's well, but he's worn out.

40
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,740
After the battle on the Ghost Land,

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,180
though the Three Realms appear
to be peaceful, danger is lurking everywhere.

42
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,800
Since the Peacock King and his daughter
took over the Heavenly Palace,

43
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,900
they've been harboring evil intent
towards us Eagle Clan.

44
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,670
Your father is too old

45
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,900
to deal with these tiresome things.

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,920
Uncle, please give me some more time.

47
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,710
I'm not trying to push you.

48
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,550
But you need to look at the bigger picture.

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:41,580
You are an immortal.

50
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:46,270
People will judge you
if you always hang out with a demon.

51
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,620
I'll go back now.

52
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,340
Please think about it.

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:20,510
The Pear Blossom Brew
tastes the best this year.

54
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:25,510
If Yin were here, she'd ask us
to drink with her until we are drunk.

55
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:26,870
Hong Yi.

56
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,670
If Yin hadn't risked her life
to save me back then,

57
00:03:33,430 --> 00:03:35,700
she wouldn't have got in trouble
on the Ghost Land.

58
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:39,670
Hadn't been for my willfulness,
my aunt wouldn't have…

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:50,550
It's all my fault.

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,340
No one could've predicted
something like that would happen.

61
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:04,910
It's all the devil's fault.
It had nothing to do with you.

62
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,830
Yan Shuang,

63
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,460
thank you for keeping me
company these years.

64
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:12,900
I've redeemed myself
for what I did to the Mortal Realm.

65
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,950
You need to go back to the Eagle Clan
and succeed to the throne.

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,790
The relationship between immortals
and demons is quite tense.

67
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,390
If I succeed to the throne, I'll no longer

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,950
be able to hang out with you.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,070
The Pear Blossom Cottage
is right here in the Mortal Realm.

70
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,460
After you become the Eagle Queen,
you can come and go at will.

71
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,540
And you don't have
to waste your time on me anymore.

72
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:37,070
Waste my time?

73
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:46,190
So, I've been spending
a thousand years here wasting my time?

74
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,540
(This silly fox. It's been a thousand years,
and he still doesn't understand my feelings.)

75
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:05,900
Things in the Eagle Clan
are too troublesome.

76
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,750
It's more relaxing here.

77
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:09,870
Besides, I still need to look for Yin.

78
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:14,020
Like Yuan Qi said, if Yin is really going
through tribulations in the Mortal Realm,

79
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:16,420
maybe I'll come across her soon.

80
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,900
But, your father…

81
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,190
Stop nagging. I'll take care of it.

82
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,630
Yin, you are back so quickly.

83
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:45,460
Yep.

84
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:48,350
I thought this time I could hold
for 50 or 60 years.

85
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,950
As it turned out,
it didn't even last for 16 years,

86
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,780
and I'm back to the Nether Realm again.

87
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,590
By the way,

88
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,140
where's Xiu Yan?

89
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,910
Xiu Yan said he'd design
a very good fate for you this time.

90
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:01,250
He's now working on it,
and he sent me to welcome you.

91
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,420
Please wait for him for a while.

92
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,290
This is the barrier
that Xiu Yan prepared for you.

93
00:06:08,290 --> 00:06:09,660
It'll help you enhance your soul power.

94
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,080
Let's go.

95
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,190
That immortal still hasn't found
the person whom he's waiting for?

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,580
Yes. It's been a thousand years already.

97
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,710
I don't think he can ever find her.

98
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,900
He killed her in person.

99
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:53,710
Why bother pretending to care anyway?

100
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,150
Trick.

101
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,710
It's all a trick.

102
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,990
Hong Yi. Hong Yi.

103
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,220
Quick and go to the Nether Realm.

104
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:22,620
(The Neither Realm)

105
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,100
Three-life Stone, what's up?

106
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:32,100
I have news about Yin.

107
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,590
Yin. Yin, wait for a sec.

108
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,680
Why?

109
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,710
Xiu Yan said he'd assign you
the best fate this time.

110
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:41,680
But…

111
00:08:41,790 --> 00:08:43,590
Wait for a moment. I'll go urge him.

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,200
What?

113
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,870
Yin went through tribulations
in the Mortal Realm for a thousand years?

114
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,660
Where is she? Take me to her.

115
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,510
Although her shattered
immortal spirit was saved,

116
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,350
she's still very weak.

117
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,000
Even though Xiu Yan assigned her
a high-ranking identity every time

118
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,180
to nurture her soul power,

119
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,320
she still ended up dying a violent death,

120
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,150
causing her soul power
to become weaker and weaker.

121
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:17,200
And now, she only has one last chance left.

122
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,040
What?

123
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,470
What will happen if she still can't recover

124
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,060
her soul power after this last tribulation?

125
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,390
If you don't tell me,
I'll go ask Xiu Yan myself.

126
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,820
Don't go.

127
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,990
I'll tell you.

128
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,390
If she still can't make it this time,

129
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,940
Yin will vanish altogether.

130
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,350
Where is she?

131
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,260
Is she going through the trail right now?

132
00:09:45,270 --> 00:09:48,940
She's on the bridge,
waiting to finish this last tribulation.

140
00:10:48,390 --> 00:10:50,390
How do you know my name?

141
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,230
You don't remember me?

142
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,700
It's alright. Either you don't remember me,

143
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,350
or you are still mad at me,

144
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,060
as long as you are here,
we'll have time to start over.

145
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,590
But your soul power is still unstable.
I need to take you to the Heavenly Palace

146
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:08,790
so you can recuperate in the Xuan Pond.

147
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,370
And then you can come back
to the Nether Realm.

148
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:10,910
I'm not going.

149
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,940
Why would I go
to the Heavenly Palace with you?

150
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,900
I don't even know you.
I can't accept your help for nothing.

151
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,820
Yin,

152
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:26,080
I made a mistake. Please give me a chance
to make it up for you, okay?

153
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,590
Could it be…

154
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:32,750
Who is he?

155
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,900
He looks distinguished,

156
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,590
but why does he look so sad?

157
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:42,990
I know.

158
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:46,392
I heard a thousand years ago,
the female immortal he adored

159
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:48,960
fell in love with the Fox King.

160
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,118
She helped the Fox King
destroy an immortal mountain

161
00:11:51,142 --> 00:11:53,300
and started an Immortal-Demon War.

162
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,840
In front of all the armies,
he killed his beloved immortal

163
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,990
with his magic weapon.

164
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,630
So, every year, he comes here

165
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,180
to see if he can find the shattered
immortal spirit of hers.

166
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:09,420
He killed her but still doesn't leave her alone.
Rather ruthless.

167
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,510
I was the female immortal
whom you killed in person?

168
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,590
That female immortal
already died. I'm not her.

169
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,180
I'm Yin from the Nether Realm.

170
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,150
You don't have
to compensate me for anything.

171
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,060
And I won't accept any help
that I don't deserve.

172
00:12:28,910 --> 00:12:32,180
Yin, this is your last tribulation.

173
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:34,700
With your current soul power,
you might not be able to make it.

174
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,270
Listen to me. Go to the Xuan Pond
and recuperate, okay?

175
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:39,110
Let go of me.

176
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:39,960
Wait.

177
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:43,040
Yin, wait.

178
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,300
Let me find a better fate for you.

179
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,260
Don't bother.

180
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:49,300
You picked the best fate for me every time,

181
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,900
but it all ended up the same.

182
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:52,590
Yin,

183
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,510
let me take you to the Demon Realm,

184
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,540
where there are a lot of treasures. I'm sure
they can help to nurture your soul power.

185
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:01,110
You want to help me

186
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:04,590
because you all think of me
as that female immortal.

187
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,900
Yin, you don't remember anything?

188
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:18,770
As it turned out, I've been living
in the shadow of the female immortal,

189
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:20,150
and my life has been out of my own control.

190
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:27,470
But I don't remember anything
about the female immortal you talked about.

191
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,270
It's okay if you don't remember the past.

192
00:13:30,670 --> 00:13:33,590
But no matter who you've become,
I'm always your best friend Jiu.

193
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:34,630
Yin,

194
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,630
please go to the Demon Realm with me.

195
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,630
No.

196
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:43,060
Since I'm not her, I no longer
have connections with any of you.

197
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,870
Good or bad,

198
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,831
I'll take control
of this last tribulation myself.

199
00:13:47,855 --> 00:13:49,300
It's none of your concern.

200
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,920
Yin.

201
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,870
Yin.

202
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Where's Yin?

203
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,820
How come she didn't come back with me?

204
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,160
Oh, no.

205
00:15:20,870 --> 00:15:22,150
What's going on?

206
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,540
Yin's soul power is too weak.

207
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,270
She's already started to struggle
before the tribulation starts.

208
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:39,700
Yin's immortal spirit
has returned to the Blood Lotus,

209
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:42,660
which is now too weak to nourish her.

210
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:49,230
Yin will vanish soon.

211
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,060
I'll save her.

212
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:05,350
It won't work.

213
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,020
Even your god power can't nourish her.

214
00:16:13,390 --> 00:16:16,060
Stop it. I'll take Yin to the Demon Realm.

215
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,110
You can't watch him
mess around and do nothing.

216
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,060
He'll destroy her.

217
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:31,420
The Blood Lotus withered already.
There's no way she can come back to life.

218
00:16:32,550 --> 00:16:33,540
Just leave him be.

219
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,540
He won't give up until he tried.

220
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:41,900
Yin really can't be saved?

221
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,190
Master, please stop.

222
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,630
At this rate, your god power will run out,
and your god spirit will scatter, Master.

223
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,150
Yin.

224
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,630
Master,

225
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:23,790
the Blood Lotus is dead already.
Please stop trying.

226
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,220
If I can't save her with my god power,
I'll try with my god spirit.

227
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,590
You can't, Master.

228
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:36,460
If you remove your god spirit,
you'll die, Master.

229
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:39,350
Master.

230
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,940
Yin died because of me.

231
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,260
If I can't make her come back to life,

232
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,260

(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

258
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:08,020
(Qingchi Palace, the Immortal Realm)

259
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:16,760
Little girl.

260
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,260
What are you doing?

261
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,180
Don't disturb Master.

262
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,460
(Yu, Water Divine Beast)

263
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,110
You took on a human form.

264
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,740
Lower your voice.

265
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,110
Amazing, aren't I?

266
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:44,260
Don't you dare throw me back and forth
like a toy ball again.

267
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:49,390
There'll be less fun
in Qingchi Palace in the future.

268
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,980
But, Master will be very happy
when he sees you

269
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,700
take on a human form successfully.

270
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:54,980
Then get out of my way.

271
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,320
Yu,

272
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:00,550
please talk to Master.

273
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:26,390
Yuan Qi, look at me.
I finally transformed into a human.

274
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:29,870
Yu, you finally…

275
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,260
Yin would be happy if she saw you.

276
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:49,350
Yuan Qi, how long have you been crying?

277
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,700
Don't your eyes hurt?

278
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:52,950
Yu,

279
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,240
sorry.

280
00:21:59,270 --> 00:22:00,460
I failed to protect her.

281
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:02,740
She's really gone this time.

282
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,940
Stop blaming yourself.

283
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:09,110
You had no other choice
under the circumstances.

284
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,220
I did.

285
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,660
If I had known
that her immortal bones were sealed,

286
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,630
I would've protected her at all costs.

287
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,070
But you didn't know.

288
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,070
No matter a demon or an immortal,
no one can live forever.

289
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,740
You said my sister cherished life the most.

290
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,390
But you are idling away yours right now.

291
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:02,010
Although you punished Qing Lin a thousand
years ago and announced Yin's innocence,

292
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:06,570
the Three Realms accused you
of favoritism for lacking hard evidence.

293
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,270
The real murderer who killed my sister

294
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,700
is still at large in the Immortal Realm,

295
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,030
living freely under the sun.

296
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,830
Yuan Qi, you want to refine the Cloud Pearl
of Original Chaos to catch him, right?

297
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:22,220
You haven't avenged my sister yet.
Are you going to keep sinking like this?

298
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:27,740
You are right.

299
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,110
I still have a lot of things to do.

300
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,660
Stop drinking.

301
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:47,590
It's not your fault that Yin died.

302
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:49,590
How long will you torture yourself?

303
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,390
Leave me alone and let me drink.

304
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:58,150
The most cruel thing in this world

305
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,550
is giving one hope and
destroying it right away.

306
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,260
(Xiuyang Hall)

307
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,790
Are you sure?

308
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,110
Don't worry, Your Highness.

309
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,180
All three realms can do nothing.

310
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,790
There's no chance of Yin surviving.

311
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:30,460
Now he'll finally get over her.

312
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,550
Without that girl,

313
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:37,790
I'm sure His Godship will soon
see your charms and turn to you.

314
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:41,260
Your Highness will be the mistress
of Qingchi Palace in no time.

315
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,700
Mistress of Qingchi Palace?

316
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:50,260
You think I care about Yuan Qi
because I like him?

317
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,180
You're wrong.

318
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:59,500
What I want is the entire Immortal Realm.

319
00:25:01,030 --> 00:25:03,590
I want Yuan Qi to serve me

320
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,330
(Clouds Form over Mountains)
and make me the Heavenly Empress

321
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,660
by using the entire God Realm.

322
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,870
I'm in a good mood today.

323
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,260
Bring me the colorful peacock garments
from the Weaver Maidens.

324
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,560
Yes.

325
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,540
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

326
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:26,540
Since Hua Shu became
the Acting Heavenly Empress,

327
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:29,980
the Peacock Clan has gained so much power
that it has become one of the top clans.

328
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,530
(Feng Hui, Elder of the Phoenix Clan)
They're likely to replace us

329
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:33,830
and become the head of all the birds.

330
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:37,940
I think it's time to revive
the Birds' Assembly.

331
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,940
Show these peacocks
who the true leader of the birds is.

332
00:25:43,270 --> 00:25:46,900
The Birds' Assembly has been hosted
by the Fire Phoenix of our clan.

333
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,940
Now the Phoenix Queen
is in seclusion elsewhere.

334
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:52,460
And Feng Yin has not been revived.

335
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,500
What should we do?

336
00:25:56,070 --> 00:25:57,220
We still have Feng Ming.

337
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,460
Feng Ming is the head of all the birds
as the chief.

338
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:08,420
(Feng Yun, Elder of the Phoenix Clan)

339
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,420
It's against the rules.

340
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,940
Who made the rules? We did.

341
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:16,340
(Lingyu Hall)

342
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:48,660
I suggest Chief Feng Ming preside over
the Birds' Assembly,

343
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:51,260
receiving the adoration
of the Immortal Birds.

344
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:56,550
Your insistence leaves me no choice
but to...

345
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:07,740
This is an auspicious sign.

346
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:10,030
It must indicate the return of Lady Feng Yin.

347
00:27:10,590 --> 00:27:12,220
Lady Feng Yin has finally returned.

348
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,870
We have a new queen.

349
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,550
Lady Feng Yin is finally back.

350
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:18,400
It's great! She's back!

351
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,240
That's great.

352
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:22,180
It's so good.

353
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:42,660
Fire Phoenix Jade?

354
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,310
The Phoenix Queen has returned?

355
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:17,900
But I haven't even collected the last portion
of her immortal spirit yet.

356
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,590
What's going on?

357
00:28:44,310 --> 00:28:48,900
Seven-colored haze that only appears
at the ascension of demigods?

358
00:28:49,510 --> 00:28:50,390
It's from Wutong Island.

359
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:54,550
This gorgeous totem is clearly a sign of
the rebirth of the Fire Phoenix.

360
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:56,220
The Fire Phoenix is born.

361
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,590
Lady Feng Yin was born a demigod
and the future Phoenix Queen.

362
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:01,500
What an honor.

363
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,550
Feng Yin has returned.

364
00:29:09,070 --> 00:29:12,790
Even Feng Yin can be reborn,
but Yin can't come back.

365
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:53,980
(Feng Yin)

366
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,550
Welcome back from the Nirvana,
Your Ladyship.

367
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:49,660
(Fengyi Palace, Wutong Island)

368
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:50,550
Someone's here.

369
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:52,880
Give her my gift first.

370
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,390
Elders, please calm down.

371
00:30:54,790 --> 00:30:57,420
Her Ladyship has received
your goodwill and gifts.

372
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,950
Has she?

373
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,550
But she said she can only take one gift
from each of you.

374
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,160
(Feng Huan, Elder of the Phoenix Clan)
Please take the rest back.

375
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,150
Save them for your own ascension
and sharing.

376
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,180
We've been looking forward
to her return for a thousand years.

377
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,250
Naturally, we want to give
everything we have to her.

378
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,110
- That's right.
- Yeah.

379
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:16,220
How can one gift express our respect?

380
00:31:21,550 --> 00:31:23,390
Your Majesty.

381
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:38,840
Master.

382
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,630
Why did you have to come back
at this juncture?

383
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:04,820
(Qingchi Palace)

384
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,830
Yuan Qi has just found peace.

385
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:16,350
And I broke the Fire Phoenix Jade.

386
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,640
I'm screwed.

387
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,790
He'll be angry.

388
00:32:21,510 --> 00:32:24,220
I'd better hide somewhere
before he finds out.

389
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:40,980
Why is there a cabin here?

390
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:46,790
Yuan Qi said a lot of bad guys out there
want to catch me.

391
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,980
Ningyun Mountain has become
a wasteland.

392
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,900
There shouldn't be anyone else here.

393
00:32:56,260 --> 00:33:01,620
(Blessed Cave)

394
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,870
Who are you? Why are you taking me?

395
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,040
Are you all right?

396
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:41,660
I thought I'd never see you again.

397
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,800
Of course, you will.

398
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,240
I'm glad you're fine.

399
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,790
Did you get a good look at that man?

400
00:33:48,270 --> 00:33:49,180
No, I didn't.

401
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,590
That man is masked.

402
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,500
Why did you leave Qingchi Palace?

403
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,220
I broke the Fire Phoenix Jade.
I'm afraid you'll be angry.

404
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,350
Now Feng Yin has returned.

405
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:07,200
The Fire Phoenix Jade has completed
its mission.

406
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,110
Never mind.

407
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,220
Your safety is the most important thing.

408
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:12,300
I'm sorry.

409
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,240
Yu?

410
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:19,620
But Yuan Qi,

411
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,390
Ningyun Mountain was destroyed so much.

412
00:34:21,390 --> 00:34:22,910
Why would anyone come here?

413
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,640
Hong Yi.

414
00:34:32,190 --> 00:34:33,110
Yu.

415
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,700
How is that possible?

416
00:34:37,230 --> 00:34:39,510
The Xuan Lake has been destroyed.
How could she break out of her shell?

417
00:34:44,630 --> 00:34:45,470
Yu?

418
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:52,150
You rushed back as soon as I woke up.

419
00:34:52,670 --> 00:34:54,760
You can ask me anything you want.

420
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,300
I've never been one to pry into
other people's personal affairs.

421
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:04,700
You can tell me if you want to.
I won't force you.

422
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,590
At the time of my descent,

423
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:14,300
I was destroyed by Lord Gu Jin
of Daze Mountain.

424
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,000
My immortal spirit was scattered
around the realms.

425
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,260
One portion of it fell to the Nether Realm
for tribulations.

426
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:25,590
I think it's probably because of
the instincts of the Phoenix's Nirvana.

427
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:31,030
I've preserved the memories of every life
in the past thousand years.

428
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:34,780
In my last life, I jumped into
the Pool of Tribulations.

429
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:39,340
With the return of my immortal spirit
to Wutong Island, I awakened.

430
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,990
It's not uncommon for immortals to go
down to lower realms for tribulations.

431
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,110
But I've never seen such a way.

432
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:47,340
This isn't a tribulation.

433
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,070
This is an unusual test of your will.

434
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,150
No wonder in only a thousand years,

435
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,110
you've developed such a
detached character.

436
00:35:56,590 --> 00:35:59,150
Throughout the ages, I've seen things

437
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,660
and experienced all the world's honors.

438
00:36:05,230 --> 00:36:08,820
Though I'm a bit detached nowadays,

439
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:14,590
it saves me the trouble
of having to see the world later.

440
00:36:15,070 --> 00:36:19,150
Tribulations in the Mortal Realm can only
refine the immortal spirit.

441
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:23,180
Where did you get your demigod power from?

442
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:27,990
Besides, there was no Thunder Tribulation
when you ascended to godship.

443
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:29,820
That's unheard of.

444
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:32,510
Ascension doesn't always come with
a Thunder Tribulation.

445
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,860
Maybe I've been through this before.

446
00:36:46,840 --> 00:36:48,660
I was just joking with you, Master.

447
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,700
I don't know why I'm having
the god power.

448
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,180
Maybe it's just because I'm lucky.

449
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,120
Forget it.

450
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,860
I'm about to ascend and you're going to
succeed as the Phoenix Queen.

451
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,510
But I just woke up.

452
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,470
Isn't this too fast?

453
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:13,600
Not at all.

454
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,740
If you hadn't been asleep,
I would have ascended.

455
00:37:19,030 --> 00:37:21,700
We can't afford to delay now.

456
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,380
The priority right now is to catch
the one who tried to abduct Yu.

457
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,510
There are traces of that man's fight
on that wood.

458
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:40,860
I found some demon poison left.

459
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:45,300
Does someone from the Demon Realm
want to hurt Yu?

460
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,260
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

461
00:37:47,550 --> 00:37:49,630
I didn't get a good look at him.

462
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:52,150
But I sensed a trace of immortal energy.

463
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:54,430
The devils have infiltrated
the Immortal Realm.

464
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:58,070
It's also very likely that this is the work
of a devilish immortal.

465
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,660
The devils?

466
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,510
We haven't settled the old score yet.

467
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,120
Right.

468
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,700
Instead of beating ourselves up,

469
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,780
catching the real evil-doer and clearing
Yin's name is the most important thing.

470
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,390
I'll take this clue back
to the Immortal Realm.

471
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,750
As for the demons, Hong Yi...

472
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,740
You don't have to teach me.

473
00:38:36,030 --> 00:38:36,990
Let's go, Yu.

474
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,170
Though Yuan Qi killed the murderer Qing Lin,

475
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,510
the Purple Moon hasn't been found.

476
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,790
Yuan Qi is even more...

477
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,700
Master, the elders have told these to me.

478
00:38:55,590 --> 00:38:56,950
It's just an old story.

479
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,950
After your ascension to the God Realm,

480
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,220
the Heavenly Empress...

481
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,220
I'm not fit to lead a realm under Heaven.

482
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:13,300
Lan Feng is a good candidate.

483
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:16,030
It's a pity that things are
so unpredictable.

484
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:22,110
Today, I'll issue the Heavenly Decree
to the entire world.

485
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:26,910
In three months, the one who can pass
my Jiugong Tower in the Heavenly Palace

486
00:39:27,070 --> 00:39:30,630
and get the Seal of the Supreme will be
the next Heavenly Emperor or Empress.

487
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,780
You're so curious.

488
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:36,760
Why don't you come to the audition?

489
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,070
Master, you know

490
00:39:38,630 --> 00:39:42,470
those people in the Heavenly Palace
are always following the rules.

491
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:43,950
That's the last thing I want.

492
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:48,260
I'm afraid I'll get sick if I go.

493
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,030
Suit yourself.

494
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:52,180
Just take care of the Phoenix Clan.

495
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,220
Don't worry, Master.

496
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:57,150
I'll do my best to protect
the Phoenix Clan.

497
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:01,220
(Qingchi Palace, the Immortal Realm)

498
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:12,180
You were asked to investigate in secret.

499
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,260
His Godship fought with a demon today.

500
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:17,110
He can't waste the Chaos Origin like this.

501
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:20,380
No one can stop him now.

502
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:23,540
He wants to refine the Cloud Pearl
as soon as possible

503
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,380
and find the truth by reviewing the past.

504
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:28,060
Now in order to refine this Cloud Pearl,

505
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:30,910
His Godship is about to exhaust
his Chaos Origin.

506
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,030
- Your Godship.
- Master!

507
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:41,340
Your Godship, you've consumed too much
soul power today.

508
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,270
Don't be too hasty.

509
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:45,960
Master, can you stop refining
the Cloud Pearl for now?

510
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:49,820
Only when the Cloud Pearl is refined
can justice be done to Yin

511
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:53,700
and all those who died in vain
a thousand years ago.

512
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,660
I was born from the spiritual power
of Heaven and Earth.

513
00:40:58,070 --> 00:41:02,700
Wouldn't it be nice to return it
to Heaven and Earth?

514
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,260
All right.

515
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:07,110
Your Godship.

516
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:10,280
What is it, Aunt?

517
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,480
Lady Feng Yin was born.

518
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,660
You should go to Wutong Island
to congratulate her.

519
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:22,340
I'm in seclusion, so I can't go.

520
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,950
As for Wutong Island, my parents
have left behind many rare treasures.

521
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,820
Aunt, help me pick one for Feng Yin
as a congratulatory gift.

522
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,470
Absolutely, I'll take care of it.
