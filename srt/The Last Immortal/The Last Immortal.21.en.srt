=Episode 21=

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,710
Extend Yin's lifespan?

30
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:41,550
Yes.

31
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,300
You are a Water Divine Beast.

32
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:44,740
Do you have a way?

33
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:47,710
This is going against Heaven's wish.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,790
It's too difficult to achieve.

35
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:53,710
If you have a way, tell me.

36
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,660
Well…

37
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,710
Tell me if you know how, Bibo!

38
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,990
It matters to her life. Just spill it.

39
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,700
I do have a way,
but I'm not sure if it'll work.

40
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,540
What way?

41
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,830
Except some rare divine species in our clan,

42
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,180
most of the Water Divine Beasts
have a short lifespan.

43
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,680
They can only live
to several hundred years old.

44
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:20,860
An elder back then refused to yield
to this fate and spent his whole life studying

45
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:25,990
on making a cure that could extend our lifespan.
It's called Spirit-nourishing Elixir.

46
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:27,150
Spirit-nourishing Elixir?

47
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,430
To make such an elixir,

48
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,460
it requires the refiner to sacrifice 100 years
of spiritual power to make the fire,

49
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,110
and three main ingredients are needed,

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,900
which are Soul-scorching Herb, the most
valuable treasure of the Demon Clan,

51
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,990
the water of the Xuan Pond
in the Heavenly Palace,

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:45,550
and the internal core
of a 10,000-year-old flying beast.

53
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,730
The internal core
of a 10,000-year-old flying beast?

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,430
Be it an immortal, a demon,
or a flying beast,

55
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,830
the internal core means life.

56
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:54,510
If you want to get the last ingredient,

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,620
you'll have to kill a beast.

58
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,870
That's right.

59
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,430
A life for a life.

60
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,230
To extend her life, you can only do it
at the cost of another life.

61
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,780
That's way too brutal.

62
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,550
We Water Divine Beasts always
commit ourselves to saving lives.

63
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,860
So, in the end, our clan came to a consensus
that we'd give up on refining the elixir.

64
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,570
So, to make the elixir, all I need to do is
collect the Soul-scorching Herb, the water

65
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,460
of the Xuan Pond, the internal core
of a 10,000-year-old flying beast,

66
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,520
and sacrifice one hundred years
of my spiritual power.

67
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,360
That's right.

68
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,640
I see.

69
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,550
Jin!

70
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,740
(Bainiao Island, the Immortal Realm)

71
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,500
Shu, on the Double Ninth Festival,
I'll marry you in the Heavenly Palace.

72
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,380
(This letter is hereby presented to Hua Mo,
for wedding Hua Shu, the Peacock Princess.)

73
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,980
(Please accept the betrothal gifts
and grant my wish of marrying Hua Shu.)

74
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,710
Shu, are you really going
to marry Lan Feng?

75
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,550
Are you sure about that?

76
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,750
Father,

77
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:14,170
everything that I did before
was for our Bainiao Island.

78
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,750
But this time, I want to do something
for my own happiness.

79
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,380
Lan Feng saw through my mind,
but he still loves me regardless.

80
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,870
If I can marry him, I'll live with no regrets.

81
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,140
(Lingyu Hall, Heavenly Palace,
the Immortal Realm)

82
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:40,960
Gu Jin.

83
00:04:43,630 --> 00:04:44,660
Your Majesty.

84
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,100
I need the water of the Xuan Pond
to refine an elixir.

85
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,580
But it takes 10,000 years for the divine tree
to bloom, so I need to wait for 100 years.

86
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,190
I know Her Majesty Feng Yuan gave you

87
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:55,070
a bottle of the Xuan Pond water.

88
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,070
I wonder if I can borrow it.

89
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,150
When the Thunder Lord
was hurt by the Flame Blade,

90
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:02,470
he used half for treating his wound.

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,390
There's only half left.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,490
The Xuan Pond water
is a magic cure for injury,

93
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:09,270
as well as a valuable treasure
of the Heavenly Palace.

94
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,950
But you said you'd use it
for refining an elixir?

95
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,341
My junior sister Yin lost her lifespan
for helping me

96
00:05:14,365 --> 00:05:16,510
me collect the immortal
spirit of Feng Yin.

97
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,310
She's fallen into a coma.

98
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,070
collect the immortal spirit of Feng Yin.

99
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:21,460
You are borrowing it for Yin?

100
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:28,270
Take it.

101
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,510
Hope it can save Yin's life.

102
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:37,070
Your Majesty, I won't forget your kindness.

103
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,000
If you need help in the future…

104
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,220
Gu Jin, you don't have to.

105
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,540
It matters to her life.

106
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:43,390
This bottle of Xuan Pond water
belonged to Her Majesty.

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,420
I'm just doing what I can to help.

108
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,660
Just go ahead and refine the elixir with it.

109
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:49,150
When Yin is recovered,

110
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:55,710
don't miss my wedding on the
Double Ninth Festival one month later.

111
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,710
Your wedding?

112
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:00,750
Your Majesty, you and Princess Hua Shu…

113
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:05,900
Congratulations!

114
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,660
The Peacock Feather Crown
is the crown for the Peacock Kings.

115
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,470
I used it to trade
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella back then

116
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:14,180
because it was an emergency.

117
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:17,780
And now, you'll use it to refine
an elixir for your junior sister.

118
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,950
I'm afraid my father and my clansmen…

119
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,390
As long as you lend it to me,

120
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,830
I'll do whatever you ask me to do.

121
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:30,780
You'll really do whatever I ask you to do?

122
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,070
This is a jade seal for commitment.

123
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,550
If you need my help in the future,

124
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,460
show this jade seal, and I'll fulfill my oath.

125
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,580
Alright.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,460
Bring me the Peacock Feather Crown.

127
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,190
Thank you, Your Highness.

128
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:02,220
I didn't know Yin is
that important in your heart.

129
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:06,070
To me, nothing's more important
than Yin's life.

130
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:13,150
Thank you so much.

131
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,150
Your Highness,

132
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:23,340
why did you agree to lend him the holy item
of our island to save Yin's life?

133
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:27,390
Since I know now where my heart
sets on and I'll marry Lan Feng soon,

134
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:30,750
I should let go of the past.

135
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,020
Just like what Lan Feng said,

136
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,870
in the future, I'll do my best to become
a better version of myself.

137
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,580
My wedding is approaching.
It's a good thing

138
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,950
to form a friendship with him.

139
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,780
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

140
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,190
Yan Shuang and Jiu fed Yin a lot of elixirs.

141
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:51,580
Master also transferred a great amount
of spiritual power to Yin.

142
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,660
But it didn't work at all.

143
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,900
She's still unconscious.

144
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:54,940
I'm so worried.

145
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,030
Jiu would've long brought Yin

146
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,300
to the Demon Realm for treatment
if Yan Shuang hadn't stopped him.

147
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,950
I'm afraid Jiu can't wait
any longer at the moment.

148
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,950
Where are my senior brothers?
Why don't they stop him?

149
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:04,740
Unfortunately, they have to go
and light the Nine-star Lamp.

150
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,420
If they missed the constellations,

151
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:08,910
they'd have to wait
for another 60 years to light the lamp.

152
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:11,910
Master and Martial Uncle had to go
to Yantian Hall to light the lamp first.

153
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,580
Yan Shuang, don't push me.

154
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,150
I will not leave this place.

155
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,830
Stop fighting. Martial Uncle Gu Jin is back.

156
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:17,670
Jiu.

157
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,750
Gu Jin, you are finally back.

158
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,390
So, have you found a way?

159
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,710
What's going on with you?

160
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,340
You said you'd go to find Bibo,

161
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,980
but someone saw you
go to Bainiao Island.

162
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,630
If you can't save Yin,

163
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:30,940
I'll take her to my clan
for treatment right now.

164
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,110
I went to Bainiao Island
to borrow an elixir ingredient for Yin.

165
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,090
According to Bibo, the only way to save Yin
is refining a Spirit-nourishing Elixir.

166
00:08:37,090 --> 00:08:38,900
But one of the main ingredients is
the internal core

167
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:41,260
- of a 10,000-year-old spiritual beast.
- Spirit-nourishing Elixir.

168
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,660
That's why I went to Bainiao Island.

169
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,250
Did you find it?

170
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,780
What else do you need
besides the internal core?

171
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,800
I found it.

172
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,900
There's only one ingredient missing now.

173
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,230
Why are you looking at me?

174
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,390
What's missing? Tell us.

175
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,420
Soul-scorching Herb, the most
valuable treasure of the Demon Realm.

176
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,900
Soul-scorching Herb?

177
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,590
Wait here.

178
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,750
Hold on, I'll go with you.

179
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:22,590
Yin.

180
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:32,510
How did it happen?

181
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,300
I thought we still had half a year.

182
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,270
How did it happen?

183
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:46,120
♪It's a trip to the seasons♪

184
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,660
♪The years are like a dream♪

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:55,200
♪The wind rises,
the thoughts are in the way♪

186
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:04,880
♪The ink is thick, the past is stained♪

187
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,140
♪The past in dark in light♪

188
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,570
♪The old face of yesteryear♪

189
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:20,260
♪Diluted in the moment of looking back♪

190
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:27,350
♪Drinking all the time♪

191
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,870
Spirit Sword.

192
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:37,510
Master once told me that the blood of chaos
can detoxify all kinds of poison.

193
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,470
At this point, I have to try
with my blood of chaos.

194
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:46,510
Do it.

195
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,150
♪Be with you♪

196
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:58,670

♪For-♪

199

♪Ever♪

200
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:16,870
Yin.

201
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:17,990
Yin.

202
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:22,590
Yin.

203
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:25,280
How do you feel?

204
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,800
Easy.

205
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:35,590
Why are we here?

206
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,870
You sacrificed half of your lifespan.

207
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,020
How can your body deal with that?

208
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,870
Senior brothers and I want you
to take a rest here in Daze Mountain.

209
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,270
Am I dying?

210
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,870
Don't talk nonsense.

211
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:18,420
How could you die?

212
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:26,750
Qing Yi told me

213
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,870
that if an immortal's hair
suddenly turns grey,

214
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,830
it means he's at the end of his life.

215
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:35,870
He lied.

216
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,040
Stop looking at it.

217
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:38,940
You are only injured.

218
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,780
Just take a rest here
and take the medicine on time.

219
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,900
You'll be well soon.

220
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,510
Then I'll go back
to Ningyun Mountain to recuperate.

221
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:56,840
No.

222
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,110
Though it's a small injury,

223
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:07,350
senior brothers and I want you
to recuperate here.

224
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,660
When you are recovered,
you can go anywhere you want.

225
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,870
But now, you need to take a rest here.

226
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,230
Jin,

227
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,780
I traded my lifespan
for Feng Yin's immortal spirit

228
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:22,900
to repay you for training me.

229
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:29,270
I didn't do it for a payback
or holding you accountable.

230
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:32,660
I know that. But I'm worried about you.

231
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,060
So are our senior brothers.

232
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:36,780
They need to spend a month

233
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:41,020
in Yantian Hall to gather magic power
and light the Nine-star Lamp.

234
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,780
If you leave, they'll be distracted.

235
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,550
Besides, Yan Shuang has helped you
ask for a leave in the Heavenly Palace

236
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:48,470
so that you can take a good rest here.

237
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:49,870
If you insist on leaving,

238
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,020
I'll just have to go wherever you go.

239
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,020
Fine.

240
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,350
I'll stay here then.

241
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,230
I'll be in the back mountain
for a closed-door cultivation.

242
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,020
Let me know if you need me.

243
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,020
What's wrong?

244
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:25,510
Nothing.

245
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,060
(Why is Jin acting weird?)

246
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,900
(And why is he looking so pale?)

247
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,620
(The Demon Realm)

248
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,230
Today I finally see why people say guarding
against a thief within a house is difficult.

249
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,900
No matter what you say,

250
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,020
I must take the Soul-scorching Herb today.

251
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,900
I'll see if you are capable of doing it.

252
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:28,590
Aunt, are you really trying to hurt me?

253
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:33,700
Our Fox Clan can't stand someone
who betrayed his clansmen and parents like you.

254
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,420
If you want to take the herb, fine.

255
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,020
Give the sandalwood bracelet back to me.

256
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:42,110
From now on, we'll part ways,
and I'm no longer your aunt.

257
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:45,180
Aunt, my parents are both gone.

258
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,870
You are my only family now.

259
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,150
I don't want to hurt our kinship.

260
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,700
If you still see me as your aunt,

261
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:57,070
you should draw a clear line
between you and the Immortal Clan,

262
00:15:57,070 --> 00:15:59,950
and tell us the truth about
how they tricked you

263
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,870
and alienated you from your own clansmen,

264
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:04,440
who henceforth can be alerted.

265
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:05,900
No one tricked me,

266
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,740
and no one alienated me from our clansmen.

267
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,750
Since when did you become this stubborn

268
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:13,630
and have such a strong prejudice
against the Immortal Realm?

269
00:16:13,790 --> 00:16:14,820
I don't have any prejudice.

270
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,930
You are the one who's tricked by the immortals
and lost the sense of right and wrong.

271
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,180
How dare you question me?

272
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,870
I've given you a chance.

273
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,540
If you don't change your ways,

274
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,990
I'll have to hold a clan meeting
and expel you from the Fox Clan.

275
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,390
Why?

276
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,510
Because I'm the Queen of the Fox Clan.

277
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,870
Because you won't listen to reason, and you
insist on taking the holy item of our clan.

278
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,680
Fine.

279
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:47,020
Then from now on,
I'm no longer your nephew.

280
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:51,230
I'll give you the bracelet back.

281
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:55,350
But I must take the Soul-scorching Herb.

282
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,110
How to open it?

283
00:17:02,870 --> 00:17:05,030
Use the spiritual power
of your internal core.

284
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:26,830
Also,

285
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:31,980
the Nirvana Wheel
was my father's personal weapon,

286
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,830
which has made a contract with me.

287
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,500
I want to take it with me.

288
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:38,900
Suit yourself.

289
00:18:31,830 --> 00:18:33,150
Just save it.

290
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,220
His body has been possessed
by half of my devil energy.

291
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,220
There's no way you can
protect him this time.

292
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:42,630
By the way,

293
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,740
I was worried that the Nine-star Lamp
would get in the way of my plan.

294
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,870
Who would've thought that your
nephew would soon ascend?

295
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,900
And my devil energy
can be of great help to him.

296
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,390
He'll become a handy weapon of mine.

297
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,260
I'll let you watch me destroy
all the things that you care!

298
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,430
Here you go.

299
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:29,900
- Jiu…
- Stop.

300
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:33,180
Everything that I did is for Yin.
It has nothing to do with you.

301
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:37,820
Go ahead and start to refine the elixir.

302
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,980
We'll go check on Yin.

303
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:42,590
She woke up briefly just now.

304
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,900
She has no idea what happened.

305
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,070
Neither does she know about the elixir.
Please keep it a secret for me.

306
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,520
You bet.

307
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,000
Let's go.

308
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,860
You know what?
You only left for a few days,

309
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,030
but the magic weapons in the Hall of Arms
all missed you like crazy.

310
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:09,590
They talked about you
all the time, especially Fu Chen.

311
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,180
Although you gave him the formula
for the Pear Blossom Brew,

312
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,480
he still can't make it as good as yours.

313
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,700
It really bothers him.

314
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:19,900
Then please take some to him when you
go back to the Heavenly Palace.

315
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,830
Okay. That's exactly what he wants.

316
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,500
You haven't gone back to the Heavenly Palace
for a long time. Is that okay?

317
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,790
You aren't there. Why would I go back?

318
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:33,390
Besides, I've got
my father's Nirvana Wheel.

319
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,420
Let me take a look at the Nirvana Wheel.

320
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,700
Let me see.

321
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:02,500
- Come on, let me see.
- Nope.

322
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,460
- No way.
- Just for a sec.

323
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,110
Don't be so petty.

324
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,350
- Why would I show it to you?
- Come on, let me see.

325
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:11,790
What's the matter?

326
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,590
It won't do you any harm anyway.

327
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,220
No. I won't show it to you.

328
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:17,840
Come and get it.

329
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:19,980
- Just for a sec.
- No.

330
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:21,420
No way.

331
00:22:22,350 --> 00:22:23,830
So petty.

332
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,310
I won't show it to you.

333
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:30,310
- Let me take a look.
- Come and get it.

334
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,940
No.

335
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,400
- I'll show you my whip.
- I'm not interested.

336
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,940
Let me take a look.
Let's switch, come on.

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:38,150
I don't want to.

338
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:39,180
Jiu.

339
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:42,900
(Jin is lazy and likes to have fun.)

340
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,030
(Why does he start
a closed-door cultivation suddenly?)

341
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:49,220
(He's avoiding me.)

342
00:22:50,790 --> 00:22:54,220
(He's nice to me because he feels guilty.)

343
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,760
Gu Jin.

344
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,040
Gu Jin.

345
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,770
Yin fell asleep.

346
00:23:55,770 --> 00:23:56,610
What is it?

347
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,620
Hong Yi will ascend soon.

348
00:23:58,620 --> 00:23:59,630
Where is he right now?

349
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,310
Jiu chose to do it in the side hall.

350
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,310
It's too close to Yantian Hall.

351
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:15,880
My senior brothers are lighting
the Nine-star Lamp next door.

352
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,260
Then, when the thunder strikes,

353
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,630
will it hurt the Nine-star Lamp
in Yantian Hall?

354
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:21,940
Shall I take him away from here?

355
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,870
It's too late now.

356
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,110
Jiu has got settled, and his Qi is unsteady.

357
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:32,630
If we move him,
it'll destroy his defensive energy.

358
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,500
I'll set up a barrier
to protect Yantian Hall.

359
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:36,660
But we still need to watch him.

360
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,310
I guess it's the best we can do.

361
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,620
When I first saw you,

362
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,870
I already couldn't help thinking
you were such an arrogant little girl.

363
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,500
When you first saw me?

364
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:44,980
You mean the time when you gave me
the pouch of star sparkles?

365
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,350
I was a big girl already.

366
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:50,790
Actually, I'd seen you even before that.

367
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,870
You may not remember it.

368
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:57,230
Years ago, when the Heavenly Empress
Bai Zhi held a banquet on Wutong Island,

369
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:58,390
I was also invited.

370
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,150
You attended it with your father.

371
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,630
You already knew me back then?

372
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,310
I was too small,
and my immortal power was still weak.

373
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:10,350
No one paid attention to me.

374
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,790
You might be a little girl,
but you were so tough.

375
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,550
The servant of the Empress
neglected your father,

376
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,550
so you punished him severely.

377
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,070
You saw that?

378
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,150
I was young and ignorant.

379
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,630
I caused trouble in the Heavenly Palace,
and it made the Heavenly Empress mad.

380
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,310
Hadn't been for
the Heavenly Emperor's forgiveness,

381
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:32,110
our entire Peacock Clan
would've been punished by the Empress.

382
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,030
So, why did you think
His Majesty got there in time?

383
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,420
I felt so bad to see
that you almost burst into tears,

384
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:42,310
so I begged His Majesty
in secret to come to save you.

385
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:56,390
Shu.

386
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,420
I've never thought
that you'd become my wife one day.

387
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,460
Come to think of it, it was
the best thing ever that I met you back then.

388
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,110
Yes, the best thing ever.

389
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:21,110
Do you think our child
will be a peacock or a dragon?

390
00:27:21,830 --> 00:27:22,940
I hope it's a dragon.

391
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:27,870
If he's born into a first-class immortal clan,
he won't be looked down upon.

392
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,660
As long as it's your child,

393
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,460
our child, everything will be fine.

394
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,220
I'll love and raise him
with every bit of my heart.

395
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,840
Shu,

396
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,660
I wasn't capable enough
to protect you before.

397
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:58,260
From now on, I'll share
all your burden with you.

00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:25,040
I should carry forward the will of the
ancestral gods and protect the Three Realms.

403
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:28,220
I can't waste my energy
and time on one person only.

404
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,660
In fact, I had my affection ties
removed myself.

405
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:34,420
I didn't expect you'd find them back.
Sorry for the confusion.

406
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,630
To me, all lives
in the Three Realms are equal,

00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,260
Fine.

409

Why are you here drinking?
You should rest in bed.

419
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:35,980
The Pear Blossom Brew
has a strong kick. Stop drinking.

420
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,320
I…

421
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:02,520
I…

422
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:27,260
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

423
00:32:32,790 --> 00:32:37,660
The first bell is to welcome the guests.

424
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,390
The second bell is to welcome the bride.

425
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:50,590
Princess Hua Shu and His Majesty
Lan Feng are a perfect match.

426
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,790
Tell me about it.
A perfect match made in Heaven.

427
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,910
Greetings, Your Highness.

428
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:28,590
The third bell is to welcome the groom.

429
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:45,380
What's going on?
Why isn't His Majesty here yet?

430
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,300
Could something happen?

431
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,470
His Majesty is overwhelmed with joy.
He's still preparing.

432
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:00,300
Go to Lingyu Hall and invite
His Majesty over for the wedding ceremony.

433
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:02,260
Yes, I'll go right now.

434
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,320
- Look, that's…
- That's…

435
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,590
The form of a golden dragon.

436
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:14,870
His Majesty.

437
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,470
Oh, no. Something happened
in Lingyu Hall.

438
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,510
Wind Lord.

439
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:26,340
Let's go. Hurry.

440
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,910
Hurry.

441
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,380
Lan Feng.

442
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,550
- Your Majesty.
- Lan Feng!

443
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:39,740
- Your Majesty.
- Your Majesty. Your Majesty.

444
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,320
Lan Feng.

445
00:35:48,190 --> 00:35:49,030
Your Majesty.

446
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,510
Shu.

447
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,860
I…

448
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,110
I'm sorry.

449
00:36:02,230 --> 00:36:03,700
I failed my promise.

450
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,180
Lan Feng.

451
00:36:11,710 --> 00:36:12,660
Lan Feng.

452
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,820
Lan Feng!

453
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,550
What happened to you, Lan Feng?

454
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:22,550
Tell me, Lan Feng.

455
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,590
His Majesty's

456
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:33,300
internal core ruptured.
His blood flew backwards,

457
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,820
and his immortal spirit scattered.

458
00:36:37,710 --> 00:36:38,630
He's

459
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:46,780
passed away.

460
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:52,350
Your Majesty.

461
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:53,950
- That's not possible.
- Your Majesty.

462
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,380
That's not possible!

463
00:36:59,320 --> 00:37:00,800
That's not possible.

464
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,660
Lan Feng,

465
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:05,950
tell me what happened, please.

466
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,740
The Xuan Pond water.

467
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,150
Where's the Xuan Pond water?

468
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:18,020
He told me that

469
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:22,470
the Xuan Pond water Her Majesty gave him
can bring the dead back to life.

470
00:37:22,670 --> 00:37:25,340
It'll save his life.

471
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,470
Where's the Xuan Pond water?

472
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,820
I don't know.

473
00:37:30,110 --> 00:37:33,340
His Majesty's internal core ruptured.

474
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:37,920
I'm afraid even the Xuan Pond water
can't help him.

475
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,760
The Soul-burning Lamp.

476
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,860
The Soul-burning Lamp can summon
his immortal spirit back, right?

477
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,220
The Soul-burning Lamp.

478
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,510
Elder Feng Yun,

479
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:47,340
I'm begging you.

480
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,320
The Soul-burning Lamp.

481
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,380
The Soul-burning Lamp has been fixed.

482
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,630
I'll give it to you.

483
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,700
The injury is too serious.

484
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:37,150
The Soul-burning Lamp is not working.

485
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,470
Even the fragments
of his immortal spirit are gone.

486
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:50,110
If we don't pull Her Highness back,

487
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:53,030
her immortal spirit will disappear
in the space-time turbulence.

488
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:58,070
Shu.

489
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,950
Lan Feng.

490
00:39:16,110 --> 00:39:19,030
Lan Feng, please don't leave me alone.

491
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,070
Lan Feng.

492
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:23,740
Today is supposed to be our wedding day.

493
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:27,260
You said you'd hold my hands.

494
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,260
You said you'd be with me forever.

495
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,990
You haven't done any of those.
How could you leave?

496
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,070
I haven't had a chance
to tell you how much I love you.

497
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:39,180
Please come back.

498
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,020
Lan Feng.

499
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:42,590
Lan Feng.

500
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:47,260
Please come back.

501
00:39:49,510 --> 00:39:51,130
Lan Feng.

502
00:39:51,130 --> 00:39:52,860

00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:17,460
(Sky-holding Pillar, the border between
the Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm)

505
00:40:19,190 --> 00:40:20,030
Your Highness,

506
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:25,780
what we should do right now is to find out
who murdered His Majesty and avenge him.

507
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,590
Who murdered Lan Feng?

508
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:33,860
Why weren't you here when it happened?

509
00:40:34,550 --> 00:40:35,860
What happened exactly?

510
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,620
Your Highness,

511
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,700
one hour ago, His Majesty
suddenly sent us away

512
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:46,300
without telling us why.

513
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,990
He only told me to stay quiet and asked me

514
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:52,860
to take everybody to the front hall
to prepare for the wedding ceremony.

515
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,740
We didn't expect
something like this would happen.

516
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,260
Who

517
00:40:58,260 --> 00:41:00,780
murdered the Acting Heavenly Emperor

518
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:04,340
in front of all the immortals here?

519
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:10,470
We need to use the Truth Mirror
to find out what happened.

520
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,860
The attacker was so sly

521
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:35,990
using spiritual power and black mist
to cover up his identity.

522
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,430
- Nine-tailed Fox.
- Nine-tailed Fox.

523
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,630
Wicked demon.

Nine-tailed Fox.

The Nirvana Wheel.

526
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:14,470
Someone killed Lan Feng with
the most valuable treasure of the Fox Clan.

527
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:16,820
It's Hong Ruo.
