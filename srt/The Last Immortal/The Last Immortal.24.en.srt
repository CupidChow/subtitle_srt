Is His Godship not coming back?

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,190
Report!

00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,500
Lords,

34
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,580
demons are invading the Heaven Gate.

35
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:03,990
These beasts.

36
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:06,070
Prepare for battle.

37
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,540
(Immortal-locking Tower, Heavenly Palace)

38
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,430
Evil demon,

39
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,950
this is the consequence
of your evil deeds.

40
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,390
Elder Hong Huo.

41
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,510
Elder Hong Rui.

42
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,020
You killed my clan members.

43
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,020
You killed my clan members!

44
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,340
Attack me if you want
to do something. Attack me!

45
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,730
You demon, listen to me carefully.

46
00:02:42,730 --> 00:02:45,110
If your clan dares to
persist in your delusion,

47
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,130
we will not show mercy.

48
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,860
I'll kill you all!

49
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,310
Come on.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,020
Greetings, Your Godship.

51
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,550
What are you doing?

52
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:09,150
Your Godship,

53
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,510
these demons are causing a massacre
in Heavenly Palace.

54
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:16,820
Countless heavenly soldiers
and generals died in their hands.

55
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,580
Are we going to be killed
without fighting back?

56
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,670
This matter should not involve
all the demons.

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,950
If all the charges are proven,

58
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:32,550
he should bear it alone.

59
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,620
(Hall of Arms, Heavenly Palace)

60
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,830
(What is exactly the truth?)

61
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:28,940
Yin.

62
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,940
How are you?

63
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,100
How are Yan Shuang and Qing Yi?

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,300
They haven't woken up,

65
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,900
but you don't have to worry.

66
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,580
Their injuries are gradually healing.

67
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,980
But it will take several years
to restore their immortal power.

68
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,940
Immortals have a long life.
They will eventually recover.

69
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,420
You just took the elixir and haven't
merged it with your internal core.

70
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,880
Don't worry about other matters for now.

71
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:00,900
I made some mung bean cakes for you.

72
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,580
Can we go inside?

73
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:05,020
I want to talk to you about Jiu.

74
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,220
Can we?

75
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,380
Your Godship.

76
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:15,340
Has the mourning
for Emperor Lan Feng ended?

77
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,660
How can the deceased rest in peace
if the murderer is not killed?

78
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:20,740
I'm sorry to disappoint you.

79
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,620
Lan Feng's coffin is still placed
in Lingyu Hall.

80
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:28,900
The demon made so severe crimes

81
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,540
that it's not enough to kill him
and destroy his demon core.

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:37,700
There will be answers
under the Heavenly Thunder.

83
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,540
In that case, I'm leaving now.

84
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,140
Yin,

85
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:56,620
Hong Yi's matter concerns
both the Immortal and Demon Realms.

86
00:05:58,380 --> 00:05:59,380
Stay out of it from now on.

87
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,900
- But…
- I have other things to do now.

88
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,140
Chang Que,

89
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,820
send Yin back to rest.

90
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,020
No need.

91
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm leaving now.

92
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,460
Your Ladyship, don't worry,
I will save you out right away.

93
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,260
Your Ladyship,

94
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,900
I have consumed a lot of internal core
to save you.

95
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,700
You must remember this favor.

96
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:22,740
This little fox has no devil energy now.

97
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:27,420
It will be interesting
under the Heavenly Thunder.

98
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
- Just now…
- Stop!

99
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,340
Just now, a surge of devil energy
escaped from here.

100
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,460
Please go take a look.

101
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,700
Do not speak nonsense here. Leave now!

102
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:03,660
Jin.

103
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,940
- Your Godship…
- His Godship doesn't want to see you.

104
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,300
Your Ladyship, I have something
to tell His Godship.

105
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,060
It's the truth about Daze Mountain.

106
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:25,500
Let me tell you the truth
about Daze Mountain.

107
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,580
Do you know why I removed
His Godship's affection ties

108
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,220
to prevent you from being together?

109
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:35,660
Because you are the calamity
destined for His Godship.

110
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,220
You are his calamity.

111
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:40,180
Now, Daze Mountain is suffering
from a great calamity.

112
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,380
It is to block the calamity
for His Godship.

113
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:45,140
There is retribution for everything
in this world.

114
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,220
True Goddess Yi He once helped
Daze Mountain nurture the immortal vein.

115
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,460
Now, Daze Mountain is destined to
return the blessings

116
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:55,220
to True Goddess Yi He's son
and block the calamity for His Godship.

117
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:56,900
But where did this calamity come from?

118
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,300
It is all because of you,
a Water Divine Beast,

119
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,980
who tangles His Godship stubbornly.

120
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,540
Originally, His Godship had
already destroyed his affection ties

121
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,340
to avoid you, the calamity.

122
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:11,940
But you, with wishful thinking,

123
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,620
insisted on bringing this calamity to him.

124
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,340
I see, he deliberately avoids me

125
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:22,700
because of this.

126
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:27,380
To His Godship,

127
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:31,460
you're just a passerby in his long life.

128
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,340
How dare you say this?

129
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,900
In the future, His Godship will be
accompanied by the Phoenix Queen

130
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,980
Feng Yin of Wutong Island, who'll awake
when her immortal spirit is gathered.

131
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:47,360
If it weren't for your usual trick of
pretending to be injured,

132
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,620
how could His Godship
encounter a calamity?

133
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,500
How could Daze Mountain
suffer from this disaster?

134
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,820
Do you know why His Godship
doesn't want to see you now?

135
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,700
It's all because of you that
Daze Mountain was destroyed.

136
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,940
He wishes he has never met you,
the lowly Water Divine Beast.

137
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:28,020
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

138
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,660
(So, all of this is my fault.)

139
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,540
(It's me who caused the disaster
in Daze Mountain,)

140
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:05,060
(but I don't want you to
bear all this for me.)

141
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:10,100
(What should I do to bring you back?)

142
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,900
I find this flower near the barrier.

143
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:36,740
It seems to carry the voice spirit talisman
of Daze Mountain.

144
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:41,980
I suppose it's one that was not sent
before the disaster at Daze Mountain.

145
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:46,380
Unfortunately, this spirit talisman
is broken beyond recognition.

146
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:57,580
Jin.

147
00:11:58,460 --> 00:11:59,300
Yin.

148
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,860
It's Xian Shan.

149
00:12:01,460 --> 00:12:03,020
When you hear these words,

150
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,780
Daze Mountain may no longer exist.

151
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:07,860
Fortunately, both of you are safe.

152
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:11,980
Now, only you two and Qing Yi
are left in Daze Mountain.

153
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:14,100
Take care of yourselves.

154
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,780
This disaster in Daze Mountain
is entirely caused by devils.

155
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:21,180
Jiu was controlled by a devil and
attracted the Heavenly Thunder,

156
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:22,780
which led the Nine-star Lamp to go out.

157
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,860
They are using Jiu

158
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,100
to provoke the conflict between
immortals and demons.

159
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,380
You mustn't be instigated by the devils.

160
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:33,900
It's really the devils.

161
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:37,860
All of this is a deliberate provocation
by the devils.

162
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,620
We must not let them succeed.

163
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,740
The spirit talisman is gone.

164
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,580
If there is no spirit talisman
and Yan Shuang doesn't wake up,

165
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:06,140
where should we find evidence?

166
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,380
Oh no,

167
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:11,140
I just saw a surge of devil energy
leaving the Immortal-locking Tower.

168
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:14,180
Has the devil on Hong Yi escaped?

169
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:15,580
If that's the case,

170
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:19,220
Hong Yi will definitely die
under the Heavenly Thunder.

171
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:21,300
Yin.

172
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:24,380
The Three Realms will be in great chaos
when demons appear in the world.

173
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,500
Now, Daze Mountain
has been destroyed by them.

174
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,380
If we cannot find the person
behind the scenes,

175
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:31,300
there must be a greater calamity
in the future.

176
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:36,140
Even if Yuan Qi is the son of True Gods,
it is difficult for him to stand alone.

177
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,060
Even if not for Hong Yi,

178
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:41,140
for Yuan Qi and the people who died
unjustly in Daze Mountain,

179
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,580
and to maintain peace
between the immortals and demons,

180
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,220
Lady Yin, please do save Hong Yi.

181
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,060
Lin Mo and the Demon Realm
will remember this favor.

182
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,020
Greetings, Your Godship.

183
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,220
Has Wind Lord gone
to the Immortal-locking Tower?

184
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:18,580
Yes.

185
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,580
Please wait, Your Godship.

186
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,180
The fox demon will be brought
for punishment soon.

187
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,460
Yin,

188
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,660
why are you here?

189
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,100
I know you'll take Jiu
to the execution now.

190
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,260
But I still want to ask him in person,

191
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,220
why he treated Daze Mountain like this?

192
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,220
I brought Jiu back to Daze Mountain.

193
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,660
If I don't make it clear, I can't let it go.

194
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,420
Wind Lord,

195
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,260
can you just give me ten minutes?

196
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,940
I will come out immediately
after I finish asking.

197
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,700
Fine.

198
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,940
Get in.

199
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,500
But you only have ten minutes.

200
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:39,260
Thank you, Wind Lord.

201
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:04,780
Jiu.

202
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,820
Yin.

203
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,380
Don't.

204
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,620
Don't sacrifice your lifespan for me.

205
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,660
Jiu, Prince Lin Mo gave me
a magic tool to block immortal power.

206
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,100
Escape from the Tower quickly
when the Immortal Net is open.

207
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,740
Someone will meet you
at the Heaven Gate.

208
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:47,260
I knew you would believe me.

209
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:51,180
As long as you believe me, I'm willing
to go to Qinglong Platform

210
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:53,460
to bear the Thunder punishment.

211
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:57,100
But it's true that Daze Mountain
was destroyed by me,

212
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,020
I should bear it.

213
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,900
Stop talking nonsense.

214
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,940
I don't have much time.

215
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,860
If you truly feel guilty,
you should go out,

216
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,380
and find out the truth behind the tragedy
of Daze Mountain and the real culprit.

217
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,980
Yin, leave here now.

218
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:32,100
Jiu.

219
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:40,900
Wind Lord.

220
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,900
Catch them.

221
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,140
Yin, let's go.

222
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,140
- Hong Yi.
- Lin Mo, take Jiu and leave now.

223
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,980
Yin, go with me to the Demon Realm.

224
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,420
You let me go. They won't go easy on you.

225
00:18:34,940 --> 00:18:35,900
I will be fine.

226
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,180
Jin is here. He will believe in me.

227
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,660
Remember what I said, find the truth
and explain it to Daze Mountain.

228
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,340
If we don't leave now,
no one will be able to leave.

229
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,380
- Go now.
- Yin.

230
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:47,500
Go now!

231
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,340
Let's go.

232
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:26,300
Are you okay?

233
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,860
Where is Hong Yi?

234
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:38,980
Your Godship.

235
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,180
She secretly let go of that fox demon.

236
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,540
You're still protecting her like this.

237
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:47,660
J...

238
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,980
Your Godship.

239
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,700
Jiu is not the real culprit
of the massacre in Daze Mountain.

240
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,500
I found the voice spirit talisman left
by Xian Shan before his death.

241
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:00,260
He said that Jiu was being controlled
by a demon.

242
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:03,340
So it attracted the Heavenly Thunder
and turned the Nine-star Lamp off.

243
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,540
The purpose is to cause conflict
between immortals and demons.

244
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,380
Let everyone listen to it.

245
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:13,540
I can't.
The voice spirit talisman is broken.

246
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,660
How can we believe you
without any evidence?

247
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:18,620
Today, under the Heavenly Thunder
on the Qinglong Platform,

248
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,140
the devil will reveal itself if there is any.

249
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,700
But now, the truth is about to
be revealed,

250
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,260
yet you released the fox demon.

251
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,500
Isn't it self-contradictory?

252
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:30,260
I clearly saw the devil energy
leaving the Immortal-locking Tower.

253
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,420
Hong Yi has no devil energy now.

254
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,340
If you use the Heavenly Thunder,

255
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:36,220
he will die in vain,

256
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,220
and the truth will be covered up.

257
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,900
Your Godship,

258
00:20:43,580 --> 00:20:45,420
Lan Feng's great vengeance
remains unavenged.

259
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,980
The culprit who killed him
was let go by Yin,

260
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:51,260
leaving me with no outlet
for my grievances.

261
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:56,180
I implore you to bring justice
to Lan Feng and me.

262
00:20:59,140 --> 00:20:59,980
Your Godship,

263
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,380
please investigate thoroughly.

264
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,260
Regarding the escape of devil energy
from the Immortal-locking Tower,

265
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:07,660
did anyone else witness it?

266
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,820
No,

267
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:18,820
only I

268
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:21,260
did.

269
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,220
You don't trust me?

270
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,020
I truly saw it.

271
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,060
As long as I'm here,
Daze Mountain still exists.

272
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,300
Yin is a disciple of Daze Mountain,

273
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,300
and all decisions about her
will be made by Daze Mountain.

274
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:04,260
Your Godship, do you remember
the promise you made to me back then?

275
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:08,460
This is a jade seal for commitment.

276
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,940
If you need my help in the future,

277
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,700
show this jade seal, and I'll fulfill my oath.

278
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:23,700
You said that you'd help me
fulfill one of my wishes.

279
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,060
Am I right?

280
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,660
Yes, that's right.

281
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,300
Then I request Your Godship

282
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:43,140
to fulfill your promise
and punish the guilty immortal Yin.

283
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,180
Your Godship, please punish her severely.

284
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,580
Please punish her severely.

285
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,140
She is guilty.

286
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:14,260
But as I stated, all decisions will be made
by Daze Mountain.

287
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,860
Then please tell us
how you will handle her.

288
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:33,620
Yin privately released Hong Yi,
that's a serious crime.

289
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,580
From today, Yin will be confined
to the Hall of Arms,

290
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,191
and half a month later,
she will receive punishment

291
00:23:41,215 --> 00:23:42,780
and be stripped of her immortal status,

292
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,940
confined to Qingchi Palace and forbidden from
entering the Immortal and Demon Realms

293
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:52,500
until Daze Mountain sees a day of rebirth.

294
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,980
Although Yin and I
share a bond as fellow disciples,

295
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,220
she is merely a passer-by
in the Three Realms.

296
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,100
I harbor no personal favoritism toward her.

297
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:15,140
I hope you all refrain from further
speculation and gossip.

298
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,060
I explicitly told you not to intervene
in this matter anymore.

299
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:13,100
You also promised me you wouldn't
save people by burning your internal core again.

300
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:15,780
Yin,

301
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,940
Water Divine Beasts are fragile.

302
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,220
Stop doing this to yourself.

303
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,580
In your eyes,

304
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,900
I am just a passer-by.

305
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:32,540
Is that true?

306
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,260
Even if I am a humble Water Divine Beast,

307
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,500
and even if my sincere feelings for you
are insignificant,

308
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,380
we have spent so much time together.

309
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,020
You should at least trust me.

310
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,060
That's just Jin's memory.

311
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,493
Regarding Jin's experiences, to me,

312
00:26:02,517 --> 00:26:04,860
they are just fleeting fireworks
that have long dissipated.

313
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,180
It doesn't prove anything.

314
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,660
For me,

315
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,620
Jin is the most important person

316
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,540
in her short and fleeting life.

317
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,900
I have been with you since I was born.

318
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:35,020
I gained the human form in front of you
and we experienced

319
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,420
life and death together.

320
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:43,460
Anyone can choose not to believe me,
but you cannot.

321
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,420
Why can't I?

322
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,340
Why not?

323
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,420
Regardless of my feelings
for you or for others,

324
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,540
I can only judge based on the facts.

325
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:55,620
If, just because of your words,

326
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:58,220
I were to show favoritism towards you,
how could it be considered fair?

327
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,380
As a True God,
how could I gain the trust of others?

328
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,340
I really didn't lie.

329
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:09,020
I found Xian Shan's last words.

330
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:11,060
Jiu is not the culprit.

331
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,020
After the Energy Protection Arrow matter,

332
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:19,380
you said that you would believe me
no matter what.

333
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:21,620
Why are you still unwilling to trust me?

334
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:25,020
It's not about whether
I believe you or not.

335
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:28,220
It doesn't matter at all.

336
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,180
How can it not matter?

337
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,860
Jin!

338
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,580
Don't call me Jin anymore.

339
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:41,780
The name has disappeared along
with Daze Mountain.

340
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,008
Perhaps if I hadn't found
that Water Divine Beast egg

341
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:48,940
in the forbidden valley of Daze Mountain,

342
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,500
the outcome might have been different.

343
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:53,020
Do you regret it?

344
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,540
I once did.

345
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:14,820
From today onwards, don't intervene in the
disputes between the Immortal and Demon Realms.

346
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:19,100
Just stay in Qingchi Palace.

347
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:27,260
(Hall of Arms)

348
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,180
Chang Que, you stay here and guard her.

349
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,100
I'm going to the Demon Realm.

350
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,140
Your Godship, do you want to
go to the Fox Clan?

351
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:39,460
But I don't want to bring back Hong Yi.

352
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,020
I suddenly thought of something.

353
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:45,980
In this world, besides Hong Ruo and Hong Yi,
there is another

354
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:47,700
Nine-tailed Fox.

355
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Qing Lin?

356
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,100
But Qing Lin is locked
in the Abyssal Prison.

357
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:54,300
- Could it be...
- Indeed.

358
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,800
Devils cannot leave the Abyssal Prison,

359
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,940
but that doesn't mean there are
no other possibilities.

360
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,020
When Hong Yi entered the Abyssal Prison
for no reason,

361
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,900
it was quite suspicious.

362
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,940
You want to find Hong Yi
and figure everything out?

363
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,020
If Qing Lin really grasped a chance
to leave the Abyssal Prison,

364
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:18,140
the demon fox who killed Heavenly Emperor
Lan Feng in the Truth Mirror,

365
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:21,540
and the devil who possessed Hong Yi

366
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,300
could all be attributed to Qing Lin.

367
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:28,700
(The Demon Realm)

368
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,220
- Ten Tails!
- Look!

369
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,100
It's the Ten-tailed Heavenly Fox,
a demigod pinnacle being.

370
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:51,500
The Ten-tailed Heavenly Fox, a rare existence
for thousands of years, has appeared.

371
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:59,380
(Hong Yi was supposed to die, which would
provoke the war between immortals and demons.)

372
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,940
(It seems that the plan
needs to be expedited.)

373
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,900
Good,

374
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:10,780
your aunt risked her life to save you

375
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:12,180
when you were captured by the Net,

376
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,140
and she was seriously injured,
forcing her to return for help.

377
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,500
She is still recuperating,

378
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,540
so she couldn't come to support you.

379
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,500
How is my aunt's injury?

380
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,220
It's fine, but she still needs
some time to recover.

381
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,460
I wonder how Yin is doing.

382
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:31,580
She must be facing difficulties
in the Immortal Realm because of me.

383
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,300
I hope Yuan Qi can take good care of her

384
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:38,820
and not betray her trust.

385
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,780
(Xuanjing Palace, Third Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

386
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,860
Your Majesty.

387
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:14,660
Give us some privacy.

388
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:39,540
Ruo, I already know about
Hong Yi's situation.

389
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:44,540
Rest assured, I will help seek justice
for you and Hong Yi.

390
00:32:45,340 --> 00:32:47,060
This is not just a matter
for the Fox Clan.

391
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

392
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:57,700
- Ruo!
- Aunt!

393
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,740
Ruo!

394
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,920
- Aunt!
- Hurry!

395
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,740
Go save His Majesty!

396
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,980
Someone has taken away
the Demon-gathering Banner.

397
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,420
Brother!

398
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,220
Why did the Demon King also...

399
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,580
(Ghost Land, the border between the
Immortal Realm and the Demon Realm)

400
00:34:58,340 --> 00:34:59,180
It's Ghost Land.

401
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:01,840
Immortals and demons are already fighting.

402
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,820
Let's go to Ghost Land first.

403
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,140
The weapon used to assassinate His Majesty
has been confirmed

404
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,940
to be the sword of Wind Lord
from the Immortal Realm.

405
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:13,620
The name "Wind Lord"
is clearly engraved on it.

406
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
(Wind Lord)

407
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,140
It is full of immortal power,

408
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,020
with no possibility of forgery.

409
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,180
The immortals are so audacious

410
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,660
as to kill our Demon King!

411
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,500
This revenge must be avenged!

412
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:27,020
This revenge must be avenged!

413
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:28,820
Report!

414
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:33,160
The Immortal Realm's army stationed
in Ghost Land is mobilizing,

415
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,720
intending to wage war against our clan.

416
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,300
- What?
- They want a war?

417
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,140
The Immortal Realm is too arrogant!

418
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,100
If we don't counterattack now,
it will be hard to find peace.

419
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:44,780
Uncle Lin Mo,

420
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:49,460
please allow me to lead the army back to
the Immortal Realm and avenge our King.

421
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:55,300
Please lead the troops to the Immortal Realm

422
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:58,420
and avenge our King!

423
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,460
Uncle, what are you hesitating for?

424
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,420
It's not that I don't want revenge.

425
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:11,340
Once we go to war,
there's no turning back.

426
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:15,420
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

427
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,220
You dare to come here?

428
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,300
Rest assured,

429
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,460
Ningyun Mountain's concealing barrier
is quite effective.

430
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,140
Didn't you use it
to steal Wind Lord's sword,

431
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:45,380
caught Lin Sen off guard and killed him?

432
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,300
When will you open the barrier
of the Abyssal Prison?

433
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:56,100
That chaos raised by the devils
70,000 years ago,

434
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,180
even gods couldn't easily suppress it.

435
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:02,020
The power was extraordinary.

436
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,220
Only when the Devil God appears

437
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:08,860
that we will have a chance to overturn
the Three Realms.

438
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,580
We are just one step away
from making the plan work.

439
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:18,220
However, the war between immortals
and demons is just a small skirmish.

440
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:23,660
We still need to give Hong Yi
some more stimulation.

441
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,940
You mean...

442
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
Yin.

443
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:29,740
Yin?

444
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,740
When I possessed Hong Yi,
I learned a secret.

445
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:37,740
Yin is a Water Divine Beast?

446
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,180
Yes,

447
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,100
I accidentally discovered this.

448
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:47,300
So Yuan Qi has been
concealing her identity.

449
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:49,540
And after she released the demon fox

450
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:54,260
that killed Lan Feng,
Yuan Qi also defended her.

451
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
I don't understand!

452
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:00,020
The Xuan Pond water was also
exhausted by Yuan Qi to save her.

453
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:05,060
Otherwise, Lan Feng wouldn't have
lost his last chance for survival.

454
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,660
Father,

455
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,820
you just mentioned that the internal core
of the Water Divine Beast could be refined

456
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:17,300
to reshape the immortal spirit
of Lan Feng and resurrect him?

457
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,020
That's just a rumor.

458
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:24,060
I still have to try it.

459
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,540
She owes Lan Feng this much.

460
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,660
Devil energy.

461
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,020
Who is it?

462
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,620
I've been waiting here for a long time.

463
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,380
Yet you don't even dare to show yourself!

464
00:38:58,140 --> 00:38:59,100
Come out!

465
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:05,180
Qing Lin?

466
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,500
Correct.

467
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:09,060
Even though you have the status

468
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,260
of a True God,
you still couldn't protect your sect.

469
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:17,300
That kid, Hong Yi, is quite useful.

470
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,820
With the help of his demigod body,
I exterminated Daze Mountain.

471
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:26,540
You controlled Hong Yi to kill
everyone in Daze Mountain?

472
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:27,660
That's right.

473
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:32,420
Those in Daze Mountain were
exterminated by me.

474
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,700
I savor the screams of those people
before their deaths every day.

475
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,340
Shut up!

476
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,540
Master!

477
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:32,340
Congratulations, Master.
The grand plan is about to succeed.

478
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,140
Guard this place.

479
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:38,540
I want Yuan Qi to witness

480
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:43,780
how I destroy the peace of the Three Realms
his father exchanged his life for.
