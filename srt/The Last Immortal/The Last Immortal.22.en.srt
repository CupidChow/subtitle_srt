=Episode 22=

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,810
Someone killed Lan Feng with
the most valuable treasure of the Fox Clan.

30
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:45,330
It's Hong Ruo.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,280
Demons assaulted us.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,250
We will not show mercy!

33
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:53,570
- That's right.
- That's right.

34
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:54,840
- We won't show mercy.
- We won't show mercy.

35
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,680
Everybody,

36
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,360
before we figure out the truth,
let's not do anything rash!

37
00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,810
What's there to be figured out?

38
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,180
Throughout the Three Realms,

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,200
only Fox Queen Hong Ruo
is a Nine-tailed Fox.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,640
She's loyal to the Demon King.

41
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,890
Without his order, why would she
suddenly murder Lan Feng?

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,850
In plain sight,

43
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,610
even our Acting Emperor was killed.

44
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,800
Shouldn't we immortals
feel insecure, then?

45
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,850
We're going to be humiliated.

46
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,480
I will kill her myself.

47
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,330
Your Highness,

48
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,570
True God Di Juan sacrificed his life

49
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,610
for the peace between demons and us.

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,570
Such hard-earned harmony
is of great importance.

51
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,240
We must get the Heavenly Empress back
to find out what happened.

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,010
And before that,

53
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,850
we can't vent our anger on demons.

54
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:52,200
If the murderer runs away,
which one of you can hold the blame?

55
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Your Highness,

56
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,680
three thousand years ago,
Hong Ruo and I fought in the Ghost Land.

57
00:03:00,910 --> 00:03:05,680
But the murderer used
quite a different fighting skill.

58
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,450
I don't think it's Hong Ruo.

59
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,050
Your Highness,

60
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,410
the murderer fought Emperor Lan Feng

61
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,080
and must have been stained
with his immortal energy.

62
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:19,850
With one drop

63
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,790
(Master of Wanyi Mountain)
of His Majesty's heart blood,

64
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,680
I can use our tracking skills

65
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,010
to follow the trail
and trace the murderer.

66
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,520
So without further ado,

67
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,360
please lead us to catch the demon.

68
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,220
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

69
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,050
Daze Mountain?

70
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,520
How come the fox ended up here?

71
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,800
Daze Mountain has a barrier.

72
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,730
Why could that fox get in
without any hindrance?

73
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,000
Your Lordships,

74
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,410
I don't know why that fox is here.

75
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,000
But in no case will we
harbor the murderer.

76
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Take it easy.

77
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,170
Daze Mountain is well known
for its righteous disciples.

78
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,730
We will not break in.

79
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:55,480
Chief Xian Shan, I'm the Wind Lord.
Some immortals and I are here to see you!

80
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,770
Hope you can spare some time!

81
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,920
What's going on up there?

82
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,050
They look quite hostile.

83
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,240
Yin, you get in for some rest.
I'll take care of this.

84
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:19,000
You're the Eagle Princess.

85
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,120
I don't think you should go.

86
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:24,730
I'll go get this straight.

87
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,770
Let me go with you, then.

88
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:07,840
(Done.)

89
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,610
(After it's soaked
in the spring for one hour,)

90
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,680
(Yin can take it.)

91
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:38,360
I'm Yin, Donghua's youngest disciple.
Greetings, Wind Lord.

92
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,730
Your Lordships, I wonder
what you're doing here.

93
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,270
Yin,

94
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:49,610
where are Chief Xian Shan
and Lord Xian Zhu?

95
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,360
They're having closed-door cultivation
for lighting the Nine-star Lamp.

96
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,000
What about Lord Gu Jin?

97
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,410
I'm sorry,

98
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,560
but he's also in closed-door cultivation.
What on earth happened?

99
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,790
How about you tell me first?

100
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,920
Are you in charge?

101
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,920
If I say that your Daze Mountain
harbors the demon who killed Lan Feng,

102
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,410
can you still make a decision?

103
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,540
If you can,

104
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,480
give us access to your territory

105
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:18,800
so that we'll catch the Nine-tailed Fox
who killed Lan Feng.

106
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,850
What... What are you talking about?

107
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:22,880
Someone killed

108
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,170
Lan Feng?

109
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:26,790
Hua Shu!

110
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:32,680
Your Lordships,

111
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:35,440
there is a Nine-tailed Fox
in our Daze Mountain.

112
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:38,530
Hong Yi, son of the late Fox King.

113
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:45,920
But I promise you. He can't be
the one who killed Emperor Lan Feng.

114
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:48,286
A few days ago, Yin and I searched
the Demon Realm

115
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:50,240
for Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit.

116
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,720
Unfortunately, we were trapped
in the barrier of the Abyssal Prison.

117
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,240
Hong Yi helped us out.

118
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,020
Because of that, his core was injured.

119
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,880
So, we brought him back for recuperation.

120
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,290
Now, he has just recovered.

121
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,800
How could he be strong enough
to have killed Emperor Lan Feng?

122
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,730
Maybe he recovered a long time ago

123
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,880
and lurked on Daze Mountain,
waiting to assault some immortals.

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:12,880
Hua Shu,

125
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:16,020
I understand your anger
over Lan Feng's murder.

126
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,530
But Hong Yi isn't the murderer.

127
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,410
Today, he's been in Yantian Hall,
preparing for his ascension.

128
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,520
He never left.

129
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,090
Weren't you in closed-door cultivation?

130
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,530
How can you prove that
he never went to the Heavenly Palace?

131
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:28,880
Hua Shu,

132
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,560
Hong Yi is a mere junior,

133
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:34,140
incapable of killing
Lan Feng, the Heavenly Emperor.

134
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:38,130
With the Truth Mirror
and the tracking skill,

135
00:08:38,130 --> 00:08:41,030
I saw him kill His Majesty
with the Nirvana Wheel

136
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:42,320
and flee into Daze Mountain.

137
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,130
He lied about the ascension
just to deceive you.

138
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,530
Inactivate the barrier of the mountain.

139
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,770
I will catch him myself

140
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:54,650
and prove to everyone
that he isn't a mere junior.

141
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:57,650
I'll commemorate Lan Feng
with the blood of the murderer.

142
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,560
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

143
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,680
Hua Shu!

144
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:22,870
Hua Shu,

145
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,410
we also feel sorry and angry
about His Majesty's death.

146
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,800
But this case is quite suspicious.

147
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,490
I can let you in
to seek the real murderer.

148
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:31,840
I can also let you test Hong Yi's power.

149
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:33,920
But I won't let you take him away.

150
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,410
He's arrogant, but he means no harm.

151
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,410
Demons are different from us,
but not all of them are evil.

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,920
What if I insist on taking him away?

153
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,720
Gu Jin, will you fight me?

154
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,040
Hua Shu,

155
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:55,310
Gu Jin can be believed.

156
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:56,800
My sect can vouch for Hong Yi.

157
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,890
He can't be the one
who killed Emperor Lan Feng.

158
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,630
Hua Shu,

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,560
let alone the truth of this case,

160
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,200
isn't it inappropriate for you to break in
with the Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

161
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,510
Shu,

162
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,490
stop it.

163
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,590
Chief Xian Shan,

164
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,960
my daughter lost her husband
on her wedding day.

165
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,010
She was so grieved that she offended you.

166
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,200
Please don't bother yourself
being angry with her.

167
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:31,920
Forget it.

168
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,560
His Majesty was lenient and righteous.
We didn't expect him to be killed.

169
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,530
Your Highness, I'm sorry for your loss.

170
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,770
But don't fall for someone's trap

171
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,720
in case immortals and demons
fall out and start a war again.

172
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,010
When losing the Emperor,
immortals should stick together.

173
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,840
My sect is no exception.

174
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:51,130
Today, you can get in and search.

175
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,600
If you find the real murderer,
we won't harbor him.

176
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:08,410
Chief, it's about the safety of immortals
and the death of His Majesty.

177
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,080
Sorry for this.

178
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,080
Your Highness, we'll get in and check.

179
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,530
You'll stay here and wait.

180
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,900
(Benevolent and Virtuous)

181
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:09,320
Those immortals are searching
Daze Mountain with the Immortal Net.

182
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,650
- Will they find out...
- It's just a demigod tool.

183
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,960
I got my demigod qualification

184
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,840
from the pure power of the Devil God.

185
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,560
I'm strong enough to fight it.

186
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,890
The God-killing Flowers aren't in bloom.

187
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,250
The devil energy I hid
in Hong Yi's body isn't leaking.

188
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:31,720
The Immortal Net can't detect it.

189
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,560
Hong Yi is indeed a junior.

190
00:12:40,030 --> 00:12:43,080
And we found nothing suspicious.

191
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,410
Chief Xian Shan, I'm sorry for today.

192
00:12:54,550 --> 00:12:56,290
Please kindly forgive us.

193
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,380
This is too big of a deal.
You don't need to apologize.

194
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,370
Please keep investigating this case
until you find the real murderer.

195
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:07,080
If some devils have stirred up trouble,

196
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,490
they can't get away
under the detection of our Nine-star Lamp.

197
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,960
Now, you should get back
the Heavenly Empress and put her in charge.

198
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,250
Don't worry.

199
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:18,530
Immortals and demons
have been at loggerheads.

200
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,490
But we don't dare
to jump to conclusions on this.

201
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:26,600
What we regretted a hundred years ago
can never happen again.

202
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,720
Hong Ruo can hardly distance herself
from His Majesty's death.

203
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,720
So, I'll send a messenger to the Demon King
and ask him to investigate the Fox Clan,

204
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,050
to account for this case.

205
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,160
Are you all right?

206
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,840
Jin,

207
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,440
you did a very good job
instead of losing your temper.

208
00:14:02,790 --> 00:14:05,650
Before Master left,
he worried most about you,

209
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,890
thinking you were so young
and joined us so late

210
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,370
that he had no time to instruct you.

211
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,840
Now, he can finally rest assured.

212
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,770
You've grown better
than I thought you would be.

213
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:18,390
Thank you, Xian Shan.

214
00:14:19,510 --> 00:14:20,560
Yin, you did a good job, too.

215
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,560
But what matters most now
is to take good care of yourself.

216
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,490
Stop exhausting yourself.

217
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,650
Tomorrow, the Nine-star Lamp will be lit.

218
00:14:30,150 --> 00:14:34,290
Xian Zhu and I will block our senses
and focus on nourishing it.

219
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:37,800
I'll leave

220
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:39,900
(Tablet)
our sect to you.

221
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:45,680
Take it.

222
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:52,020
(Tablet)

223
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,960
Jin,

224
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,770
whatever decision you make in any case,

225
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,800
we will always support you.

226
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:06,440
Do whatever you want without concern.

227
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,770
Thank you, Xian Shan.

228
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,680
Look.

229
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,800
Looks like Jiu will become a senior.

230
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,530
I must return to Yantian Hall
and light the Lamp with Xian Zhu.

231
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,320
Remember. Don't let the thunder
strike Yantian Hall by mistake.

232
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,440
Or our efforts would be wasted.

233
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,470
I get it.

234
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,110
Are you all right?

235
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:45,720
Why are you so cold?

236
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,440
How do you feel?

237
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,840
Yin.

238
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,710
Yin. Yin!

239
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,950
- Martial Aunt!
- Yin!

240
00:15:51,950 --> 00:15:52,790
Martial Aunt!

241
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,940
Why did the
Spirit-nourishing Elixir shatter?

242
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,890
Her immortal energy is exhausted.
She's dying.

243
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:25,440
How did this happen?

244
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:28,920
How did this happen?

245
00:16:30,150 --> 00:16:34,200
With the three ingredients,
you can make the Spirit-nourishing Elixir

246
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:37,320
and extend Yin's life.

247
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,130
Bibo lied to me.

248
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,080
There must be
something missing in the elixir.

249
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,250
I have to go to Ziyue Mountain.

250
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,770
I'll lead Qing Yi and the other disciples
to help Jiu survive the Thunder Tribulation

251
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,720
and protect the Nine-star Lamp.

252
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,680
It'll be two hours
before the thunder comes.

253
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,470
We can hold it.

254
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,120
You go and save Yin.

255
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,840
All right.

256
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,560
I'll count on you.

257
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,870
Don't worry.

258
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,700
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

259
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,560
Father,

260
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,530
did your deal with Hong Ruo
have anything to do with Lan Feng?

261
00:17:27,510 --> 00:17:30,080
At the Spiritual Trigram Assembly,
Hong Ruo wanted to collude with devils

262
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,530
and disturb the Heavenly Palace.

263
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,450
Did Lan Feng find something

264
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
so that he was killed?

265
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,880
Father, tell me.
Was Lan Feng killed by Hong Ruo?

266
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,210
What are you talking about?

267
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,940
Hong Ruo is a good friend of Feng Yuan,
the Heavenly Empress.

268
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,970
How could I know
that she colluded with devils?

269
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,320
Now, I quite regret that.

270
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:54,290
Besides, Hong Ruo just wanted
to get back the Nirvana Wheel.

271
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,530
How could Lan Feng be involved?

272
00:17:56,830 --> 00:17:59,050
What about the Nirvana Wheel
and the nine-tail mark?

273
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:02,000
If Hong Yi really wasn't
away from Daze Mountain,

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,730
what other Nine-tailed Foxs could
kill Lan Feng with the Nirvana Wheel?

275
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,120
Don't trust their version of the story.

276
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,920
You should believe
what you saw in the Truth Mirror.

277
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,160
Immortals have been sent
to investigate the case.

278
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,320
Soon, we'll know
if Hong Ruo is suspicious.

279
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:25,560
And you'll know who told the truth,
Daze Mountain or the Truth Mirror.

280
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,260
(Infinite Cave, Bainiao Island)

281
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,010
Didn't we agree not to meet lately?

282
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,010
What did you come for?

283
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:49,490
I killed Lan Feng in the form of a fox.

284
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,320
If immortals find out the truth,

285
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,050
I'm afraid they'll catch me
with the Immortal Net.

286
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,690
It may be hard for me to fight them.

287
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,970
You said everything was arranged.

288
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:05,530
But how could a junior like Hong Yi
kill someone like Lan Feng?

289
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,640
Immortals aren't fools.

290
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:14,160
Don't worry. I've got a plan.

291
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,120
Immortals of Daze Mountain
have vindicated Hong Yi.

292
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:20,730
When Feng Yuan is back,
considering she's Hong Ruo's good friend,

293
00:19:20,730 --> 00:19:22,840
she will go to the Fox Clan
and investigate everything.

294
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,010
I'd like to see

295
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:29,530
how much longer
you can still keep your identity.

296
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,050
Hua Mo has successfully
planted the God-killing Flowers

297
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,320
and used some spells to cover them.

298
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,160
When they blossom
and destroy the immortal vein,

299
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:10,800
we'll kill Gu Jin and grab
the Fire Phoenix Jade

300
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,450
to inactivate the barrier
of the Abyssal Prison.

301
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,930
By then, Ming Qi, the Devil God,
will come back to the world.

302
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,280
After being trapped in anger
for thousands of years,

303
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,530
he will dramatically stir up the world.

304
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:29,140
(Demon Realm)

305
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,150
His Lordship?

306
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,840
Why are you trying to run away?

307
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,080
I can't let Jin see me.

308
00:20:47,510 --> 00:20:48,350
Wait.

309
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,290
You're keeping something from him, right?

310
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:53,430
Nothing.

311
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:54,620
Don't stop me!

312
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,050
- What is it? Tell me.
- Let me go!

313
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,840
You can't go.

314
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,880
Spirit-nourishing Elixir.

315
00:21:07,830 --> 00:21:09,350
Is this the elixir you asked me to make,

316
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:10,190
Bibo?

317
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,640
- Jin...
- What's needed for the elixir? Tell me!

318
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,110
I...

319
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,320
Bibo,

320
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:23,360
I know you must have a reason for this.

321
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,320
But it decides whether Yin can live.

322
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,880
Whatever the truth is,
whatever happens, or whatever he may lose,

323
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:31,970
you should tell Gu Jin
and let him decide.

324
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:36,050
He's old enough
to be responsible for his life.

325
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:38,870
Bibo.

326
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:41,770
Yin matters a lot to me.

327
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:49,530
She's as important as you,
Father, Mother,

328
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:52,730
and Aunt Feng Yuan.

329
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:57,360
Help me save her.

330
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:02,000
Jin, I thought you would give up

331
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,730
when you couldn't find
the beast's internal core.

332
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,050
Unexpectedly, you really
made the Spirit-nourishing Elixir.

333
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,040
I didn't lie to you.

334
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:12,160
The Spirit-nourishing Elixir does exist.

335
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,450
It has never been made before

336
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,640
because no one managed
to get the last ingredient.

337
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:17,760
What is it?

338
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:20,050
Abyssal Devilish Marrow.

339
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,360
You can't make
the real Spirit-nourishing Elixir

340
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,640
unless you get the Marrow from the stamen
of the God-killing Flower King.

341
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,080
But Jin, you haven't got
your god power back.

342
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,320
You can't even defeat
the most common devil.

343
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,880
I don't want you to die there!

344
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:38,670
Dragon,

345
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:42,120
open the Abyssal Prison for me.

346
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:49,150
All right.

347
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,590
Jin,

348
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:53,950
don't go.

349
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:54,850
It's too late.

350
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,840
Even if you get the Marrow now,

351
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:00,080
you'll have no time to make the elixir.

352
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,400
And considering your immortal power,

353
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:04,770
how can you defeat
the Flower King and so many devils?

354
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,770
Bibo, however hard it is, I will go.

355
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,640
If I have to watch my beloved girl die,

356
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,640
I just can't.

357
00:23:31,450 --> 00:23:33,600
I'm the reason she's dying.

358
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:41,600
If she dies, I won't be able to live.

359
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:55,770
Here. Keep it for me.

360
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:10,560
Dragon, give me a minute.

361
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:12,430
All right.

362
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,970
Yin, wait for me.

363
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:28,050
I'll be right back.

364
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:52,260
(Abyssal Prison)

365
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:15,900
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

366
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,110
(Oh, no.)

367
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,290
(I nearly missed.)

368
00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,490
(I don't know
if the Nine-star Lamp will be struck.)

369
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,950
Who's there?

370
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,320
Come out!

371
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:43,010
Fox, you can't see me.

372
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,970
I am you.

373
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:46,600
You're only bluffing.

374
00:26:50,030 --> 00:26:50,870
Show yourself!

375
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:59,580
(Benevolent and Virtuous)

376
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,450
(The last strike is always
the most terrible.)

377
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,490
(I have to get through it.)

378
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:40,350
Are you all right?

379
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,320
I didn't fail Gu Jin, after all.

380
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,360
It's all over.

381
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,160
Why are there more thunders?

382
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:00,840
The golden flash...

383
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,880
Is Jiu going to be a demigod?

384
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,690
Jiu, go back to your room!

385
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,870
Jiu...

386
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,560
Jiu, what are you doing?

387
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:40,190
You're not Jiu.

388
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:43,970
Who are you?

389
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,500
(Yantian Hall)

390
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:53,690
The depletion of their immortal energy
is a sign of impending death.

391
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,770
Master!

392
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,490
- Master!
- Master!

393
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,840
Master!

394
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,490
Wake up, Master!

395
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:26,530
Master!

396
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:20,160
Oh, no.

397
00:31:20,590 --> 00:31:23,360
He isn't going to be
a senior, but a demigod.

398
00:31:24,110 --> 00:31:25,770
He deceived everyone.

399
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,250
Daze Mountain is in danger.

400
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,880
Gather the immortals and head for it.

401
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:53,450
Powerful chief, indeed.

402
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,860
You even struggled out
of the Thunder Tribulation for a demigod.

403
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,400
Who are you? How dare you assault my sect?

404
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,800
What's so good about your sect?

405
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:07,050
When I want to kill, I'll kill all of you.

406
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:37,050
Jiu, I don't believe
you're going to kill us!

407
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:44,560
Don't make a terrible mistake!

408
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,880
Don't do this.

409
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,160
Jiu!

410
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,010
Form up!

411
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:50,410
What a shame for such a graceful sect
of thousands of years!

412
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,370
The immortal vein
of Daze Mountain is ruined.

413
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:58,560
Master, no one can stop you
from grabbing the Fire Phoenix Jade.

414
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:08,010
Xian Zhu, you and I should
bring up the rear for our disciples.

415
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,760
Sure.

416
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:21,280
Qing Yun, take everyone
to leave through the barrier!

417
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,430
Master,

418
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,970
I'm not leaving!

419
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:25,920
- We're not leaving!
- We're not leaving!

420
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:26,810
- Leave!
- Leave!

421
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,640
Where our sect is,

422
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:31,330
we are there!

423
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,080
We'll defend Daze Mountain to the death!

424
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,410
- We'll defend Daze Mountain to the death!
- We'll defend Daze Mountain to the death!

425
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:52,560
Your Highness, this is our tribulation
and it has nothing to do with you.

426
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,490
Please leave immediately.

427
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:56,350
No.

428
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:57,210
I can't leave.

429
00:35:57,210 --> 00:35:59,080
Today, someone has to leave alive

430
00:35:59,670 --> 00:36:02,280
and tell everyone
that devils have returned!

431
00:36:02,510 --> 00:36:03,600
Then they can take precautions.

432
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,280
But Chief...

433
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,120
Your Highness,

434
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,930
could you please do me a favor?

435
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:20,850
Please take out Qing Yi,
our youngest disciple,

436
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,970
as the last blood of our sect.

437
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,410
- Chief...
- Please do me the favor!

438
00:36:29,150 --> 00:36:29,990
Master.

439
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,030
Master!

440
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:33,530
I'm not leaving, Master!

441
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:36,190
I'm not leaving.

442
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,030
Leave!

443
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:38,380
I'm not leaving,

444
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:39,280
Master!

445
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:41,970
Leave!

446
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:44,280
Master,

447
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,050
I'm not leaving.

448
00:36:48,590 --> 00:36:49,970
Master!

449
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:54,550
I don't want it.

450
00:36:54,710 --> 00:36:55,550
No.

451
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:56,640
Master,

452
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,850
I don't want it.

453
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,280
I just don't.

454
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,330
Qing Yi, Daze Mountain
will be your responsibility.

455
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,930
Master!

456
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,970
At my command, my disciples!

457
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,240
- Yes, Master!
- Yes, Master!

458
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,200
Let's kill the devils!

459
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:07,200
All-benefit Sword Formation!

460
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:15,620
(Yantian Hall)

461
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:05,560
Those reckless immortals!
How dare they destroy my devil soldiers?

462
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,070
What?

463
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:17,640
Feeling bad?

464
00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh, I almost forgot.
Those people took care of you.

465
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,370
I should have been gentle.

466
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:31,810
Don't worry. After I'm done using you,

467
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,280
I'll kill you the way I killed them.

468
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:44,080
I guess the immortals are coming.

469
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:47,850
Lan Feng's death can't start a war
between immortals and demons.

470
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,680
But the destruction of Daze Mountain
will be quite enough, huh?

471
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:55,050
I've been preparing for a hundred years.

472
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:58,280
The day of chaos is finally coming.

473
00:42:10,550 --> 00:42:11,930
No one shall live!

474
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:56,490
