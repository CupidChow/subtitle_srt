=The Last Immortal=

28
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:38,980
=Episode 39=

29
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,140
(Gate of Tribulation, Nine Palace Tower)

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,270
(If the devil army doesn't show up
before entering the Nine Palace Tower,)

31
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,660
(then devils are likely among these people
who enter the Tower.)

32
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:02,070
There is another world
in the Nine Palace Tower.

33
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:05,860
The light gate ahead is
the first Heavenly test,

34
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:08,550
specially used to inspect
the immortal foundation.

35
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:13,460
When passing through this gate,
countless heavenly thunders will descend,

36
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,510
just like those that appear
when you ascend to a higher level.

37
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,860
Everyone, who will go first?

38
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,580
What about Yu Xiazi and I go first?

39
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,620
The cultivation of you three is higher
than mine, I'd better be the last.

40
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:42,230
What difference does it make
to go first or last?

41
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,150
Is it that there are some
inexplicable concerns?

42
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,580
Of course not.

43
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,510
I will go with you first.

44
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:32,020
(Reverse Immortal Power?
He is not a devil.)

45
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:38,740
You cultivate against the norm
to improve your cultivation.

46
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,710
What a shame.

47
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,140
Reverse training is strictly prohibited
by the Heavenly Palace.

48
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,270
Since you made this mistake,
you can't move forward anymore.

49
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,020
Do you think my words don't count?
Go and receive your punishment.

50
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,460
Thank you for saving him.

51
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,150
It's nothing.

52
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:02,020
Since you have passed
the Gate of Tribulation,

53
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,300
you can go ahead now.

54
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:26,460
(Realm of Forgetfulness,
Nine Palace Tower)

55
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:33,900
(Why are these cloud steps
going up endlessly?)

56
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,200
Martial Aunt.

57
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,350
Martial Aunt.

58
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,020
- Yin.
- Yin.

59
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,630
- Yin.
- Yin.

60
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:21,790
Come over here.

61
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,580
Where have you been for so long?

62
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:26,350
Finally you came.

63
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:29,310
If Qing Yi didn't go to find you,
I really couldn't find you.

64
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,980
You, as a girl, should stay away
from the Forbidden Valley.

65
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,150
There are many beasts.
It's dangerous. Do you know?

66
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,980
I think it's the beasts that are in danger.

67
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,070
This girl is always fierce.

68
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,270
Those beasts in the Forbidden Valley
run away as soon as they see her.

69
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,000
What's wrong?

70
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,460
I was just joking.
Why are you staring at me?

71
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:03,790
Jin.

72
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:08,540
Master.

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,070
You bullied Yin again.

74
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,000
I didn't.

75
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,070
If so, why are Yin's eyes red?

76
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:30,980
Yin, I ask you here to tell you that

77
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,070
you are my closed-door disciple
from today on.

78
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:39,200
That's great.

79
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,120
- Great!
- Great!

80
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,960
That's great!

81
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:44,150
I never expected that I would
have a junior sister one day.

82
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:45,870
I am a senior brother from now on.

83
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,390
- That's great!
- I am a senior brother.

84
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,540
- Great!
- Yes.

85
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,460
Yin, I will grant you this
sword tassel today.

86
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,400
Let me do it.

87
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,710
Come, let me grant you the sword tassel.

88
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,030
What's wrong? Are you unhappy?

89
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:28,150
No.

90
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,150
I am willing to see Master,

91
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:39,230
you,

92
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:45,870
and Daze Mountain.

93
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,220
But I cannot indulge in this.

94
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,150
You must be Feng Yin
from Wutong Island.

95
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,710
You are…

96
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,110
Qing Qiong.

97
00:08:19,310 --> 00:08:22,870
Your Lordship. I heard that you have
been traveling around the world.

98
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,660
Why are you in this Nine Palace Tower?

99
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,580
It's important to choose
the Heavenly ruler.

100
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,020
The second pass of this Tower
is called Realm of Forgetfulness.

101
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:31,830
It needs an immortal who is proficient
in illusion to guard the entrance.

102
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,660
I came back to help.

103
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,560
Little girl.

104
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,510
(Lord Qing Qiong)
How did you see through the illusion?

105
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,470
Xian Shan had always shown
respect and courtesy.

106
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,420
He wouldn't let Jin take the sword tassel.

107
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:50,540
Jin respected Master and Xian Shan.
He would never take the sword tassel.

108
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,510
It's just so?

109
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:57,390
It is more than that.

110
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:04,270
The scene in front of me
was so beautiful,

111
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,020
but I only felt sad in my heart.

112
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,900
At that time,
I didn't remember anything.

113
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:24,230
But when I heard them
calling me Martial Aunt,

114
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:33,750
the scene when Daze Mountain
was destroyed

115
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:38,350
seemed to reappear before my eyes.

116
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,230
So I can no longer indulge
in the illusory beauty.

117
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:55,780
There is only one Daze Mountain.

118
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:00,660
It is my sect when it's prosperous.

119
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,350
It can't be replaced when it's perished.

120
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,150
What I need to do now

121
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:16,110
is to prevent the Three Realms
from suffering from such a disaster.

122
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,660
Good. You passed this test.

123
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:25,820
If you become the Heavenly Empress,
remember your original intention.

124
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:30,630
Go ahead.

125
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:18,230
The position of the Heavenly ruler
is mine.

126
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:54,110
Three chimes announce
the arrival of the groom.

127
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:32,710
Shu.

128
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,350
Lan Feng.

129
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,940
Is it really you?

130
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,660
It's me, Shu.

131
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:10,040
Today is our wedding day,
please don't cry, okay?

132
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,780
Shu, it's time.

133
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,780
After we exchange jade tokens,
we can complete our ceremony.

134
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,230
Lan Feng.

135
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,590
Lan Feng.

136
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,160
Lan Feng.

137
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,780
Lan Feng, where have you been?

138
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,750
Come back, okay?

139
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,470
Lan Feng.

140
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:18,750
Hua Shu, it's wrong for you to use
the Illusion Veil to enter the Tower.

141
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:24,350
And you can't see through the illusion,
you're not the chosen Heavenly Empress.

142
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:29,470
Leave the Tower now.

143
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:37,420
Why did you end the illusion?

144
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,590
You have long seen through the illusion?

145
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:42,780
- Why didn't you…
- A thousand years have passed.

146
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:45,020
I've been fantasizing

147
00:15:48,270 --> 00:15:52,270
if Lan Feng walked up to the hall
and married me that day,

148
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:01,990
what would I be like after that?
Today I finally saw it.

149
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,940
But why did you take away all of this?
Why?

150
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,750
You all deserve to die.

151
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,420
You… You fell into the devil path.

152
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:25,390
All of you will
accompany Lan Feng in death.

153
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,700
Ling Feng? What happened?

154
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,470
The devils invaded Wanyi Mountain
last night.

155
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,180
Hua Shu killed my father and took away
the Illusion Veil of Wanyi Mountain.

156
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,150
So, the Maser of Wanyi Mountain
is actually Hua Shu in disguise.

157
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,180
Illusion Veil can change forms
and transform into gas.

158
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:06,980
It's the best concealment tool,
and no one can see through it.

159
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,940
With this treasure, Feng Yin
may not see through Hua Shu.

160
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:13,870
What should we do?

161
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,500
Nine Palace Tower is closed now.
No one can enter it.

162
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,380
(Jianwu Hall, Nine Palace Tower)

163
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:15,260
It seems that only you and I
have arrived here.

164
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,030
Is that the Seal of the Supreme?

165
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,350
Yes.

166
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,350
I have met you several times.

167
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,660
Now, only you and I are vying for
the position of the Heavenly ruler.

168
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,500
It's quite fate.

169
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,150
Since we are destined to compete,

170
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:52,220
I'll let you try first to see if you
can take the Seal of the Supreme.

171
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:53,430
Thank you.

172
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:59,630
I heard that the Seal of the Supreme
has its destiny to choose its master.

173
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,550
I will give it a try first.

174
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,830
You have made no progress in a thousand
years and still can't be patient.

175
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,180
How did you recognize me
from the Illusion Veil?

176
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,340
(Wanyi)

177
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,220
One of you is a God and
the other is the Phoenix Queen.

178
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:02,220
You are born to be a perfect match.

179
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,260
People like you are born esteemed.

180
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,700
You have a smooth road ahead
and a way out behind.

181
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,180
Naturally, you can be
carefree and desireless.

182
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:19,770
But do you know how much effort I have
put in just to not be inferior to others?

183
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,180
Do you know what will happen to

184
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:25,830
people like us
with ordinary qualifications?

185
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,110
You hate others for their noble birth,

186
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:33,980
but you are born as
the Princess of the Peacock Clan,

187
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:38,310
the prettiest immortal at the peak
of Senior Immortal.

188
00:20:38,350 --> 00:20:40,390
You'd been the Acting Heavenly
Empress for a thousand years.

189
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,180
But you turned around and
suppressed inferior immortals.

190
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,830
Are such acts not despicable?

191
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,550
Hua Shu, I advise you to turn back
and not be obsessed with greed.

192
00:20:55,310 --> 00:21:00,530
Ask me this when I get
the Seal of the Supreme

193
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,630
and change the Heavenly Palace
into Lan Feng's mourning hall.

194
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,630
Hua Shu is indeed inside.

195
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:51,760
They are coming.

196
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,260
Yuan Qi had guessed your trick long ago.

197
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:14,260
You are now trapped in the
Devil-trapped Formation. It's a dead end.

198
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,110
The Purple Moon shines on the Three Realms.
The Devil God will come visit.

199
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,840
Are you alright?

200
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,150
The Seal of the Supreme is mine.

201
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:02,980
Hua Shu, your father is here.
Think it over.

202
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:06,420
You'd better hand over the Seal
and retreat the devil army.

203
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:12,590
Shu, haven't we come all the way to
today just to unify the Three Realms?

204
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,460
You must not hand over the Seal.

205
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:22,460
Shu, take out the
Demon-gathering Banner that I robbed.

206
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,180
Demon-gathering Banner?

207
00:23:58,270 --> 00:24:01,180
It's the most powerful object for demons.
The Demon-gathering Banner is here.

208
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:04,030
Let's see who can trap me.

209
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:13,470
So it was indeed you who stole my sword
and killed the Demon King Lin Sen.

210
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,830
So what if it was me?

211
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:17,110
Lin Sen is dead.

212
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:20,460
But the immortals and the demons
are still fighting each other.

213
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,390
It's really ridiculous.

214
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,870
The source of the sins a thousand years
ago has finally been found.

215
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,790
Killing you will bring good results
to the Three Realms.

216
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,900
That depends on whether
you have the ability.

217
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,180
Shu, activate the Demon-gathering
Banner. Open the Demon-release Gate.

218
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,900
Summon all the devil soldiers
in the Infinite Cave.

219
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:58,630
Stop dreaming.

220
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:01,150
The Demon-release Gate is the most
powerful tool in the Demon Realm.

221
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,590
Without god power, it can't be opened.

222
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,110
You are far from being doing it.

223
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:09,500
I can't do it, but Shu can.

224
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,280
Move.

225
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,070
Hua Shu, if you do this,
you can never correct it.

226
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,390
Shu, don't listen to their nonsense.

227
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,030
For the sake of me and Lan Feng,
kill them all.

228
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,630
Stop Hua Shu.

229
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:46,630
Hua Shu, take a good look to see
who deceived you.

230
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,110
The one who killed Lan Feng
was concealed in the black mist.

231
00:26:50,350 --> 00:26:53,070
Now take a good look at
who this person is.

232
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,980
The killings of Lan Feng and Lin Sen
were a set of interconnected schemes.

233
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,630
The ultimate goal is to provoke a battle
between immortals and demons.

234
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:08,940
Now, the Demon-gathering Banner
is in his hands.

235
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,050
How could he not know
who killed Lan Feng?

236
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:16,630
What does Lan Feng's death have to do
with me? Don't try to instigate Shu.

237
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,870
Why did you remove
Hongque's immortal bones

238
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:23,980
and descend her to the Mortal Realm
immediately after Lan Feng was killed?

239
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,110
I didn't do this.

240
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,790
I was descended to the Mortal Realm
by the Peacock King.

241
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:45,940
Hongque, you are still alive.

242
00:27:47,790 --> 00:27:48,646
Your Highness.

243
00:27:48,670 --> 00:27:51,260
Father said you blamed yourself
for Lan Feng's death.

244
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,150
So you asked him to remove your bones
and descend to the Mortal Realm.

245
00:27:55,070 --> 00:27:58,180
You died of depression soon.

246
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,830
No, Your Highness, it's not like that.

247
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,070
On the day of your wedding,

248
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:06,700
I saw Peacock King went to Lingyu Hall
to find His Majesty Lan Feng.

249
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:19,500
After he went in, Lingyu Hall
was separated by a barrier.

250
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,220
Then, His Majesty was killed.

251
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,330
Later, Peacock King used the excuse of
me not taking good care of the Emperor,

252
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,940
descended me to the Mortal Realm.

253
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:32,310
Your Highness,
I followed you for many years.

254
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,660
How could I not know your affection
for His Majesty?

255
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:39,180
But I haven't had the opportunity
to talk to you in these years.

256
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,630
Hua Shu, we all know that
you want to save Lan Feng,

257
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,110
but Lan Feng has been dead
for a thousand years.

258
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,590
How could it be possible for him
to come back to life?

259
00:28:49,070 --> 00:28:52,870
Lan Feng should have been able to
come back to life. It's because of you!

260
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,220
Should have.

261
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,830
Now I will show you his true state.

262
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,660
How could it be?

263
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:14,150
Even if Lan Feng couldn't come back to
life, he should not be like this.

264
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,790
This ice coffin is nothing
more than an illusionary coffin.

265
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:20,660
What you see are all illusions
created by Hua Mo for you.

266
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:25,110
Hua Mo, His Majesty Lan Feng
was kind and upright.

267
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,900
Just because he loved Hua Shu,
you took the opportunity to kill him.

268
00:29:29,550 --> 00:29:30,870
If he could be buried in the ground,

269
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:33,870
he should have been reshaped
and reincarnated.

270
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:37,150
But he was covered by your ice coffin,

271
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,550
exhausted all his immortal spirit
and can never be reincarnated now.

272
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:52,110
Father, is that true?

273
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:56,920
In front of the enemy, you and I should
unite against them.

274
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,220
Is that true?

275
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:08,940
Yes, it was me.

276
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:29,070
If I didn't provoke a conflict between
the immortals and the demons,

277
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,470
how could the Peacock Clan stand out?

278
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:34,830
Look at these immortals,
who shows respect to us?

279
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:37,550
Are you willing to be trampled
by them forever?

280
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,680
Shu, activate the Demon-gathering
Banner and summon the devil army,

281
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,550
then we will be the ruler
of the Three Realms.

282
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:48,830
Only one step left, only this last step!

283
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:57,740
But so what?

284
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:04,830
What's the point of doing all these
without Lan Feng?

285
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,310
I knew that even you couldn't be
relied on at the critical moment.

286
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,350
Fine. Since you refuse to take action,

287
00:31:17,920 --> 00:31:19,420
I will help you.

288
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,560
Stop Hua Mo!

289
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:34,530
I asked the Devil God
for this Mind-Blowing Spell

290
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,390
to avoid this.

291
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:46,260
Listen, activate the Demon-gathering
Banner. Open the Demon-release Gate.

292
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,500
- This…
- The gate is open.

293
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,150
The gate is open!

294
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,200
The gate is open!

295
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:19,040
Feng Yin!

296
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,830
What are you going to do? Come back!

297
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:27,950
Feng Yin!

298
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:56,660
If you still respect Lan Feng,

299
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:01,900
please trust me this time
for the sake of Lan Feng.

300
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,430
Shu!

301
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,630
Let's make the Three Realms
disappear forever!

302
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:37,110
Father,

303
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:45,630
what should disappear forever is us.

304
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,510
Shu!

305
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:22,340
Shu!

306
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,150
Shu!

307
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,950
Shu!

308
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:09,220
Hua Shu from the Peacock Clan
is unforgivable.

309
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:15,180
Please exhaust my immortal spirit to
seal devils in Demon-gathering Banner.

310
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:18,630
I don't ask for any forgiveness,

311
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,220
but my fellow clansmen were
forced to practice devil power.

312
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,550
Now I have extracted the devil energy
from their bodies.

313
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:32,340
Please consider that they are forced,

314
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,470
and don't exterminate them.

315
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,070
I will guard the Demon-gathering Banner
forever to redeem the crimes for the clan.

316
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:59,030
You have passed the Nine Palace Tower,
and become the new Heavenly Empress.

317
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:05,630
You decide what to do and give the order.

318
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,820
The crimes of the Peacock Clan
have been cleared by Hua Shu.

319
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:29,180
From today on, no immortals shall
make trouble for them.

320
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:33,200
Any violator will be severely punished.

321
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,180
I will obey Your Majesty's order.

322
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,240
No need for formalities.

323
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

324
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:09,070
Feng Yin.

325
00:37:09,710 --> 00:37:14,030
A thousand years ago, I caused
your immortal spirit to dissipate,

326
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:18,550
now, I am here to reap what I have sown.

327
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:22,550
It is a retribution.

328
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,990
Our resentments are settled today.

329
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:34,300
Rest assured, as long as I am alive,
no one will touch the Peacock Clan.

330
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,430
Thank you, Feng Yin.

331
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,910
I'm afraid we will never see
each other again.

332
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:49,700
Before I leave, I have some words
to tell you.

333
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:55,110
Many years ago, I envied
your background,

334
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:57,550
and admired your talent.

335
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,110
But now I realize that

336
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:05,550
I don't need to admire you
for one thing.

337
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:13,910
Because I also have someone
who can give up everything for me

338
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:17,660
and considers me more important
than his life.

339
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:50,350
That's…

340
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,910
It's devil energy.

341
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,140
It can come and go freely
in the Three Realms. It's Ming Qi.

342
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,440
Let's follow the Demon-gathering Banner.

343
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Go.

344
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,100
(Ruins, Bainiao Island)

345
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,070
Why is the Demon-gathering Banner
landed here alone?

346
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:26,150
Because the true devil energy
has been extracted by me.

347
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,950
It is useless now.

348
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,120
Ming Qi?

349
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,380
No, that's not his true form.

350
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:44,470
Don't worry. We have plenty of time
to talk after I open the Abyss.

351
00:39:51,670 --> 00:39:54,150
He is absorbing the devil energy
suppressed here.

352
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,640
He wants to make his true form appear.
Stop him!
