=Episode 5=

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,580
Young man,

30
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:45,980
are you really willing to

31
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:48,100
enter the Abyssal Prison for the Fire Phoenix?

32
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:49,420
Of course.

33
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:51,100
It was my fault.

34
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,620
I have to bear the responsibility.

35
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:00,140
In the Abyssal Prison,

36
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,380
there are God-killing Flowers

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:05,340
and many powerful devils.

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,700
Even I dare not enter.

39
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,780
You are just an immortal.

40
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,220
Do you wish to die?

41
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,060
Rest assured.

42
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:14,260
Frankly,

43
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,300
I have a Heaven-shuttling Garment.

44
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
It can protect me.

45
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,140
Heaven-shuttling Garment?

46
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,900
Wait! Wait for a moment.

47
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:22,780
Is it the one that

48
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,460
can cover the scent of everything?

49
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,100
Isn't it a thing of the God Realm?

50
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,220
How could you get this treasure?

51
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,140
Who on earth are you?

52
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,140
I am just

53
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,060
a nobody.

54
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:35,900
Save it.

55
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,300
You don't want to tell me.

56
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:38,460
I needn't know it.

57
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:39,820
True God Di Juan

58
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,020
did leave a god spirit

59
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,460
in my body.

60
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:44,740
I can open the Abyssal Prison.

61
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:45,980
But,

62
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,700
I need you to do something for me.

63
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,580
Ningyun Mountain?

64
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,460
Ningyun Mountain

65
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,060
is an earthly paradise

66
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,300
for Water Divine Beasts.

67
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,300
The Xuan Lake there

68
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,260
is the source of the spiritual power

69
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,660
for Water Divine Beasts.

70
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,460
If you want to

71
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,620
revive the clan of Water Divine Beasts,

72
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,740
you must find the Ningyun Mountain.

73
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:11,500
Your beloved Yu

74
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,780
is hurt.

75
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,380
It needs to be

76
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,580
fostered by the Xuan Lake

77
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,580
to be born.

78
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,380
Where is the Ningyun Mountain?

79
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,020
The Ningyun Mountain

80
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,380
has a special barrier.

81
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,660
It can be hidden in mountains and lakes.

82
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,700
It was established to protect
weak Water Divine Beasts.

83
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,780
But 70,000 years ago,

84
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,660
a God-Devil War happened,

85
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,420
so Water Divine Beasts

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,860
and the Ningyun Mountain were ruined.

87
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,340
Then…

88
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,700
Ancestor.

89
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,980
Ancestor.

90
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,940
Yu, don't worry.

91
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,900
I will find the Ningyun Mountain.

92
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,500
(Abyssal)

93
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,060
(Barrier Entrance, Abyssal Prison)

94
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:17,980
So the barrier of the Abyssal

95
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,220
is in the purple moon.

96
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,180
Young man, with my power,

97
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,620
I can only open the barrier for two hours.

98
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,820
Then, the devils inside may

99
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,220
break the prison barrier.

100
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,860
Come out as soon as

101
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,180
you get the thing.

102
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,340
Don't lose your life.

103
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:34,180
I see.

104
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,500
What are you doing?

105
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,740
Why are you here?

106
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,420
Go back now.

107
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,380
This is the Abyssal Prison.

108
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,100
Go back now. It's dangerous here.

109
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,060
You want to find Feng Yin's
immortal spirit, I will go with you.

110
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,460
This is about the two of us.

111
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:56,740
I don't trust you.

112
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
Let me go with you.

113
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Wait.

114
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,660
You're too weak. It's too dangerous.

115
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:02,380
What do you mean?

116
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,780
Look at me.

117
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,180
See?

118
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm here.

119
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,900
Isn't it powerful?

120
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,260
But I only have one.

121
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,700
I can't protect you.

122
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,340
- You…
- That's it.

123
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,820
Let's go.

124
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,820
Go.

125
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,460
(Abyssal Prison)

126
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,900
This is the Abyssal Prison?

127
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:43,980
Don't run around.

128
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,540
These are God-killing Flowers.

129
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,380
They are very dangerous.

130
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,860
They can swallow everything.

131
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
With your power,

132
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,940
you'll die if you touch it.

133
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,340
As long as we are together,

134
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,180
the Heaven-shuttling garment
can protect us.

135
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:58,660
The Fire Phoenix Jade is moving.

136
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,020
The sycamore tree is really here.

137
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,460
But this place is so big.

138
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,900
Where can we find it?

139
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:11,660
It should be in that direction.

140
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,380
How do you know?

141
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,620
I don't know.

142
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,580
It's my intuition.

143
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,580
You…

144
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,740
Fine.

145
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,700
Let's go check.

146
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,620
It's fine.

147
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:33,980
There is a barrier.

148
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,460
The devils can't come in.

149
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:37,100
Get the immortal spirit now.

150
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,260
I got another portion.

151
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,260
Let's go.

152
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,540
Wait.

153
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,700
I promised Three-headed Fire Dragon

154
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,400
to get the heart of
the sycamore tree for him.

155
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,580
Wait for me.

156
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,820
Be careful.

157
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,500
A little fox?

158
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,060
It's so weak.

159
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,660
Don't be afraid.

160
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,500
I won't hurt you.

161
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,940
I'm helping you.

162
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:27,580
Hong Yi?

163
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,140
Yin!

164
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,060
Fire Phoenix Jade?

165
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,460
It dares to come here.

166
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,860
Jin!

167
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,740
Are you alright?

168
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,660
Are you hurt?

169
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:22,060
No. I'm fine.

170
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,260
What about you?

171
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:25,900
I took Hong Yi together with me.

172
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,980
These things are difficult to deal with.

173
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,500
Let's go now.

174
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,700
Jin.

175
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,900
Bad luck.

176
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,220
It's a big trouble.

177
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,580
You opened the prison barrier?

178
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,460
Jin entered there?

179
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,340
No, no.

180
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,740
He must have entered there.

181
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:30,860
Dragon, Dragon.

182
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,060
You made a big trouble.

183
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,620
Wait.

184
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:36,100
Who is this immortal man?
Why are you so worried?

185
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,700
Jin is Yuan Qi!

186
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,540
The only son of True Goddess Yi He
and True God Di Juan,

187
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,340
and the only true god
in the Three Lower Realms.

188
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,740
If he's eaten by a God-killing Flower,

189
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,500
you'll be peeled by True Goddess Yi He.

190
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,220
Yuan Qi, why don't you stay
at the God Realm

191
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,460
and enjoy your life?

192
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,380
Why did you come to my place

193
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,260
and enter the prison?

194
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,020
What to do? What to do?

195
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:56,380
It doesn't matter.

196
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,740
Yuan Qi has
the Heaven-shuttling Garment.

197
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,740
He won't be discovered by the devils.

198
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:01,540
How foolish you are!

199
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,140
Don't you know the effect
of the Heaven-shuttling Garment

200
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,530
depends on the immortal power
of the user?

201
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,780
Jin hasn't woken his god power.

202
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,220
He's no more powerful than
a junior immortal.

203
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:08,620
I'm afraid he's already exposed.

204
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,540
No, I have to go help Jin.

205
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,140
Don't go.

206
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,180
It's useless.

207
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,020
Let me go.

208
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,420
Be careful.

209
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,820
Let's move.

210
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,380
It's not working.

211
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,340
Are you okay?

212
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:44,260
Use the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

213
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:45,860
Why?

214
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,960
Let's use the
Moonlight Illusion Formation.

215
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,820
Start.

216
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,640

00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,240

You are

234
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,940
that little fox just now, right?

235
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,260
Hold on tight.

236
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,220
Your Lordship!

237
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,620
Catch. Catch. Catch.

238
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,740
I'm sorry, Dragon.

239
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:44,060
It's okay.

240
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,260
Little fox.

241
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:52,060
Yin, are you alright?

242
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:56,820
Where's the Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

243
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,180
Why didn't you use it?

244
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,100
The Umbrella?

245
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:07,340
I've used too much of my power.

246
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,540
I couldn't open the umbrella.

247
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,500
Nonsense!

248
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:11,300
You know that.

249
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,940
Even if it doesn't open,

250
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:14,420
it can resist for a while.

251
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:15,620
Where's the Umbrella?

252
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,140
It's not the same as it used to be.

253
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,260
How could it be the same
when I was in the Forbidden Valley

254
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:21,060
as when I'm in the Abyssal?

255
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,940
You lent the Umbrella to Hua Shu.

256
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,820
I think I was injured.

257
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,660
Jin, where is it hurt?

258
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:29,380
Don't worry about him. He's pretending.

259
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,100
No, I'm not.

260
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,020
I'll check it out for you.

261
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,220
Of course you should.

262
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,540
I've been hurt so badly.

263
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,980
You must check

264
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:38,660
what kind of injury it is.

265
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,500
Right?

266
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,620
Yin!

267
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,180
Yin, well, I did pretend.

268
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,140
The Umbrella…

269
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,020
The Umbrella, I…

270
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,860
I…

271
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,700
Jin!

272
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,220
Oh my!

273
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,260
He's really hurt this time.

274
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,980
Devil energy has entered his body
through the wound,

275
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,820
and hurt his heart vessel.

276
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,740
- Jin!
- Come on, Help him up.

277
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,580
Jin.

278
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,060
(If the Demon Dragon finds it out,)

279
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,420
(I'm afraid I'll lose the whole thing.)

280
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:17,580
(Fire Phoenix Jade,)

281
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,500
(I'll take it next time.)

282
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,540
(Bibo's Hut, Ziyue Mountain)

283
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:37,380
Why does he have no response

284
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,500
to my healing skill?

285
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,860
Bibo, you're a Water Divine Beast.

286
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:43,540
You must have better healing skills
than mine, right?

287
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,060
Yes.

288
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:46,820
Teach me now.

289
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,780
But this skill

290
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,060
will burn your internal core.

291
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:51,620
Are you sure about this?

292
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,260
All right.

293
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,420
Listen.

294
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:18,980
Jin is awake.

295
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,540
Yin, are you alright?

296
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,420
Yin!

297
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,580
Thank you.

298
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:34,100
I knew

299
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,700
you're good to me.

300
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,500
If you use half of these ideas

301
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,660
on Hua Shu,

302
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,060
it'll be good.

303
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:44,260
Why did you lend her the Umbrella?

304
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,300
Again?

305
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:48,260
I was playing the bad guy

306
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:50,060
to keep the Umbrella,

307
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,260
but you

308
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,100
lent it out so easily.

309
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,180
It was a little dangerous,

310
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,300
but

311
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,540
we defeated

312
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,580
the devils

313
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,540
and came back safely, right?

314
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:00,940
If we had the Umbrella,
would we've fallen into

315
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,100
such a dangerous situation?

316
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,620
I've been with you
through thick and thin

317
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,220
to find the immortal spirit
of the Fire Phoenix.

318
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,520
Do you really put your
and my life in your mind?

319
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,110
I know why we can't perform
the Moonlight Illusion Formation well,

320
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,180
because you

321
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,820
don't have the same mind as me.

322
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,460
Yin, it's my fault this time.

323
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,300
Slow down.

324
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,420
It's such an important thing,

325
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,900
but you didn't even say a word

326
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:20,780
and just lent it to her.

327
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,220
Taming My Master.

328
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,740
Jin,

329
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:27,940
you're being kept as a pet.

330
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:39,620
Acting cute, provocation, and hypnotism.

331
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:44,540
You said we can't perform
the Moonlight Illusion Formation well,

332
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,620
because I don't
have the same mind as you.

333
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,260
So this is your mind?

334
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,620
I just read it once in a while.

335
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,780
You did read it anyway.

336
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:54,740
I thought you'd really be nice to me,

337
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,740
but the result is,

338
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,100
you read such a book to tame me.

339
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,860
It's because

340
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:05,140
you don't have much immortal power
and you're lazy.

341
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:06,940
So I want to use these methods

342
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,420
to improve your cultivation base.

343
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,500
You dislike me, right?

344
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,300
I don't like you to be my spirit beast.

345
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:17,340
You are not good at fighting,
and you're bad-tempered.

346
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,740
I don't want to keep you.

347
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,300
Fine!

348
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,020
Since we don't like each other,

349
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:25,420
let's find the immortal spirit of
the Fire Phoenix as soon as possible

350
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,500
and break up then.

351
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,180
Okay.

352
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,700
That's what I think too.

353
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,020
But as long as we don't break up,

354
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:36,700
you're my servant.

355
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,140
You can never control me

356
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,980
with this kind of trick.

357
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:51,020
This idiot Gu Jin.

358
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,980
I'd rather I didn't save you just now.

359
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,540
You wouldn't listen to me.

360
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:58,940
Little fox,

361
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,660
why are you here?

362
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,180
I'm glad you're fine.

363
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,420
Otherwise, the Fox Queen will be worried again.

364
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,420
You're an ordinary

365
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,260
spirit cat.

366
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,060
How could you get the healing skill?

367
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,060
No.

368
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:39,340
This is a skill that
only Water Divine Beasts can have,

369
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,260
camouflage.

370
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,620
I just saved you.

371
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,180
We're friends now.

372
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,180
You…

373
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,540
You have to keep my secret,

374
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,460
(Water Divine Beasts could help me.)

375
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:52,340
All right?

376
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,540
Okay.

377
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,980
Thank you for rescuing me from the Abyssal.

378
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,060
By the way,

379
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,020
I heard you talking about Gu Jin.

380
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,460
Don't mention him to me.

381
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,420
So it's really that ignorant

382
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,500
and incompetent guy.

383
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,020
It's a pity that my internal core is injured,

384
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,220
otherwise, I'd back you up right now.

385
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,220
Don't be afraid.

386
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,220
Let me help you.

387
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,500
Listen to me,

388
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:04,580
you're just turning better now.

389
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,180
If you want to restore your internal core,

390
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,980
it needs some time.

391
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:09,300
Thank you.

392
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,740
Cater to his tastes and humor his needs

393
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,540
by praising and encouraging him.

394
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,740
Induce him step by step.

395
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,020
It's called guidance.

396
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,620
You can refer to the specific steps

397
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,740
to tame a spirit dog.

398
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,900
The mung bean cake is to cater to my pleasure

399
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,780
to tame me.

400
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,860
(Taming My Master)

401
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,020
(I didn't expect that girl)

402
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,060
(risked her life)

403
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:08,900
(to save me at the Abyssal.)

404
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,420
(What a shame.)

405
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:12,220
(No.)

406
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,780
(I'll never give her the chance)

407
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,980
(to stand in front of me.)

408
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,300
Yin.

409
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,300
Yin.

410
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:28,420
Yin!

411
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,580
Yin!

412
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,340
Yin, stop it!

413
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:46,860
Are you okay?

414
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,060
I'm fine.

415
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,100
Come with me.

416
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,620
Why?

417
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:55,900
Come here.

418
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,020
No. What are you doing?

419
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:04,420
Who taught you the healing skill
you used just now?

420
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,580
Bibo.

421
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:06,420
What's wrong?

422
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:08,260
Do you know it may kill you?

423
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:09,100
I know.

424
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,740
So what?

425
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,620
Water Divine Beasts are healing beasts.

426
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,820
We're supposed to save people.

427
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:18,700
That's it. It's none of your business.

428
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,420
I don't allow you to do that.

429
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:21,980
You can't even take care of yourself.

430
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,020
How could you care about others?

431
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:24,740
You may get yourself killed.

432
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:25,580
It's not worth the candle.

433
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,940
Can you stop talking

434
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,900
like that?

435
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,300
I saved you just now,

436
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,700
and you said thank you to me.

437
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:33,420
This is called only the officials are allowed
to start fires,

438
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,990
but the people are not allowed
to light a lantern.

439
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,740
You used the same way to save me?

440
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:37,900
What do you think?

441
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,300
Who permitted you to do that?

442
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,340
You…

443
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Wait a minute.

444
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,780
When I ask you for an elixir,

445
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,500
you're so stingy.

446
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,180
But you gave so many rare elixirs

447
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,020
to Yuan Qi

448
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,860
without hesitation?

449
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,500
Of course.

450
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:05,260
You have a problem with that?

451
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,980
Give me one, just one.

452
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:09,660
- Just one, just one!
- Old Dragon.

453
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,900
- Just one, just one!
- Let me go!

454
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,940
Why don't you give me one?

455
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,860
Give me one.

456
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:16,780
Oh my!

457
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,940
My immortal elixirs!

458
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,260
You taught the healing skill
of burning the internal core to Yin?

459
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,180
Jin,

460
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:30,740
I…

461
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,620
Yin is a member of

462
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:34,660
the Water Divine Beast Clan.

463
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,420
I taught her some skills.

464
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:38,220
What's wrong with that?

465
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,700
You're a senior Water Divine Beast.

466
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,620
She's just an ordinary one.

467
00:25:44,620 --> 00:25:45,860
You have different life lengths.

468
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,000
How could she do the same as you?

469
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:50,020
This spiritual power of her internal core
decides her life.

470
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,380
If she saves people with this skill,

471
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:52,340
she'll lose her life.

472
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,940
I was worried about you.

473
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,020
It's a dangerous journey
to collect immortal spirits.

474
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,460
That's why I taught it to Yin.

475
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:58,660
I hope she can save your life

476
00:25:58,770 --> 00:25:59,620
at critical times.

477
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,700
Save my life?

478
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:01,820
If I have to sacrifice

479
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:03,340
a spirit beast to save my life,

480
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,180
I…

481
00:26:05,020 --> 00:26:06,780
I'd rather kill myself
with a piece of tofu.

482
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:07,940
Bah, bah, bah!

483
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:08,900
Never say that!

484
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,500
Why did you bully Bibo?

485
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:20,700
My immortal elixirs!

486
00:26:21,620 --> 00:26:22,460
Listen,

487
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,820
this is my spiritual power.

488
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,340
I have the right to decide

489
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:26,380
who I use it for and how to use it.

490
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,060
You're in no position to say anything.

491
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,580
What a stupid immortal beast you are!

492
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,660
I'm just trying to be kind,

493
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,500
- you think…
- Kind?

494
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,220
Who wanted to dig out my internal core

495
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,140
and take my life before?

496
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,540
I was just joking.

497
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,660
Why are you so vindictive?

498
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,620
I am vindictive!

499
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,260
Yes.

500
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:45,700
I have a cruel tongue sometimes,

501
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,380
but apart from that,

502
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,860
I'm full of qualities

503
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,940
from top down.

504
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,380
Don't say anything
if you don't appreciate it.

505
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,580
The good-for-nothing playboy

506
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,300
in Daze Mountain.

507
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,140
It's the way I call you.

508
00:26:59,140 --> 00:26:59,980
You…

509
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,860
Don't argue.

510
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
You! You! You!

511
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,940
Look what you've done

512
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,780
with my elixirs!

513
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:09,060
I…

514
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,220
Since you two don't like each other,

515
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,060
why do you work as master and servant?

516
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,100
Why don't you break

517
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,340
the master-servant contract?

518
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:17,620
- You think I don't want to do that?
- You think I don't want to do that?

519
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,340
But we have to

520
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,740
collect all the immortal spirits of Feng Yin
before that.

521
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,420
Who told you that?

522
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,460
Your contract is established by Donghua

523
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,860
with his demigod power.

524
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:33,260
All immortals with demigod power
in the Immortal Realm can help you break it.

525
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:34,820
You can do it?

526
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,660
Well,

527
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:37,940
I'm a demigod in the Demon Realm.

528
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,780
I can't do it.

529
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:44,380
As for the others,

530
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,140
you can ask around.

531
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,500
If that's the case,

532
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,260
my master-servant contract with him

533
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,780
would be broken soon!

534
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,260
If it is possible,
I hope the master-servant contract

535
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:57,420
can be lifted in the next second.

536
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:58,820
And I'll be free.

537
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,300
Why did I argue with her again?

538
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,140
Keeping a spirit beast is so hard.

539
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,740
I never thought that after ten years,

540
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,820
you're still as incompetent as ever

541
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,580
and even learned to bully young girls.

542
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,740
With a disciple like you, I'm afraid

543
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,460
Donghua won't be at peace

544
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,460
even in the God Realm.

545
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,260
What are you saying?

546
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:33,380
Who are you?

547
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:39,100
Hong Yi?

548
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,180
Not bad,

549
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,100
you can still recognize me.

550
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,420
It's not recovered yet?

551
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,620
What's your problem?

552
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,940
You know it's not.

553
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,380
Let me tell you,

554
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:00,140
if it hadn't been for your injuries,

555
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:01,540
I would have taken my revenge.

556
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:04,580
It seems

557
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,420
Yin has healed you.

558
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,860
Right,

559
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,300
I owe her a favor.

560
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,060
Since you're bullying her like this,

561
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,340
I don't want to see her

562
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:13,380
suffer with you.

563
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,580
I'm taking her away.

564
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,860
What are you thinking?

565
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,740
She belongs to our Daze Mountain.

566
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:18,940
Daze Mountain's affairs

567
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,700
are none of your Fox Clan's business.

568
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,140
Have you heard of a saying?

569
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,220
Nothing forcibly done is going to be agreeable.

570
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,180
Yin doesn't want to be

571
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,060
your spirit beast.

572
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,900
As a man, why do you

573
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:28,780
have to hold onto

574
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:29,620
a young girl?

575
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,580
How about

576
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,900
releasing the master-servant contract

577
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,300
and giving Yin her freedom?

578
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,460
What do you say?

579
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:35,860
Let go.

580
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,980
You even have the nerve to say

581
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:40,140
giving her freedom.

582
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,460
You just have ulterior motives.

583
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,100
I'm just helping

584
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,180
when I see something unfair.

585
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,780
After all, our Fox Clan

586
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,980
is not as overbearing as

587
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:48,820
you immortals.

588
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,180
Shut up or I'll take you back to

589
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,540
the Jingyou Mountain right now.

590
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,260
Whether I return to the Fox Clan is not
up to you.

591
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,900
I was entrusted by your aunt
to take you back to the Jingyou Mountain.

592
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,540
Don't you think I have the right?

593
00:29:58,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Gu Jin,

594
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:02,300
stop threatening me with her.

595
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,540
Otherwise, I'll beat your spirit

596
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:05,500
out of you.

597
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,500
You want a fight, huh?

598
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,980
Bring it on!

599
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,340
I just mastered the way

600
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,900
to wield my Spirit Sword.

601
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,660
I'll try it on you first.

602
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,460
You...

603
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,500
Where did you go?

604
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,180
You are afraid, huh?

605
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,900
You have gone too far!

606
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:00,580
If you are not happy with anything,

607
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,100
just vent your anger on me.

608
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,460
How can you bully

609
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:04,780
an injured little fox?

610
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,260
- And you.
- Bully...

611
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:07,540
You're injured,

612
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:09,780
you should defend against bad people.

613
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,340
He... He attacked first, okay?

614
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:29,140
Your Lordship,

615
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,260
well...

616
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:32,620
The matter about that Fox Clan guy
being imprisoned in Abyssal Prison

617
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,020
has already been clarified.

618
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,300
It was just an accident.

619
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,780
Your Lordship, please help me

620
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,420
explain to the Fox Clan.

621
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,420
Don't let them go to

622
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,940
True Goddess Yi He

623
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,620
and file a complaint about my negligence.

624
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,580
Otherwise, my tendon will be...

625
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,420
Don't worry.

626
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:48,860
You won't lose it.

627
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,380
Yin, Yin.

628
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:53,380
Don't always quarrel with Jin.

629
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,300
Companions

630
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,540
should get along harmoniously,

631
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,380
right?

632
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,420
Rest assured,

633
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,860
I won't lower myself to his level.

634
00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,500
Goodbye.

635
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,460
Bye.

636
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,620
Go ahead, go.

637
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:27,060
(Jingyou Valley, Second Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

638
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:27,900
Abyssal Prison?

639
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,780
Why would Hong Yi go there?

640
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,940
I also don't know

641
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,060
about the specific situation,

642
00:32:33,060 --> 00:32:36,100
but we did find Hong Yi
in the Abyssal Prison.

643
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,000
Going into the Abyssal Prison
is not a small matter.

644
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,220
Where's Hong Yi?

645
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,900
Here.

646
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,460
In my Qiankun Pouch.

647
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:49,180
Come out.

648
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,660
Hong Yi is in there?

649
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:52,060
Come out now.

650
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:53,460
You are home.

651
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:05,460
He's not in the Qiankun Pouch.

652
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,380
I clearly saw him enter the pouch this morning.

653
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,220
I...

654
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:11,060
I thought the disciples of Lord Donghua

655
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,020
would be different.

656
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,020
I didn't expect them

657
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,100
to boast as well.

658
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,300
How dare you deceive the Fox Clan!

659
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,300
Everyone, please calm down.

660
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,500
We never meant to deceive the Fox Clan.

661
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,020
But Hong Yi really just separated from us
not long ago.

662
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:24,420
There should still be

663
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,660
Hong Yi's aura in this Qiankun Pouch.

664
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,980
Test it and you'll know

665
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,060
if we're lying.

666
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,900
Yes,

667
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,260
one test will reveal the truth.

668
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:46,660
It seems they didn't lie.

669
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,900
If Hong Yi willingly comes back with you,

670
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:53,260
it doesn't seem like his temper.

671
00:33:53,620 --> 00:33:54,460
Your Highness,

672
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:56,700
although we didn't successfully

673
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:57,540
bring back Hong Yi,

674
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:00,580
at least we took him out of the Abyssal Prison.

675
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,820
Regarding the matter of entering
Jingyou Valley for the immortal spirit,

676
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:05,700
we hope you can prove it.

677
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,580
Since you have taken Hong Yi

678
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:09,500
away from the Ziyue Mountain,

679
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,020
our Fox Clan will keep our word.

680
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:13,060
Hong Huo,

681
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:14,260
take them to the Jingyou Valley

682
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,140
to find the immortal spirit.

683
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:17,820
Remember,

684
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,020
don't disturb that senior.

685
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,620
(The sycamore tree, Jingyou Valley)

686
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,220
Such a big sycamore tree.

687
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:29,220
Greetings, Mr. Wu Gui.

688
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,260
Mr. Wu Gui?

689
00:34:37,380 --> 00:34:38,900
(Mr. Wu Gui?)

690
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:46,620
The tree spirit is not in.

691
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,780
I'll take people to look around.

692
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,420
I feel like the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit

693
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,620
is not far away.

694
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,100
Your feeling again.

695
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:03,500
Earlier, you said you could feel
the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit.

696
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,060
And it was the Water Divine Beasts'...

697
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,460
What does that mean?

698
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,860
Don't you believe me?

699
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:10,820
I said I could sense it...

700
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,460
Fine,

701
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,740
let's split up

702
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:14,860
and see who finds it first.

703
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:16,700
You go that way.

704
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,140
Fine.

705
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:23,060
Why are you getting upset again?

706
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,700
(Yes.)

707
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,420
(It must be here.)

708
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,700
You, little girl from the Fox Clan,

709
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,500
how dare you intrude on the forbidden land?

710
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:23,660
It's you?

711
00:36:23,660 --> 00:36:24,540
(Wu Gui)

712
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:26,140
You know me?

713
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,740
You have a part of her in your body.

714
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,380
Are you okay?

715
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,980
Who do you think you are?

716
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:49,380
How dare you interfere with my matter?

717
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:50,820
I'll go tell the Fox Queen!

718
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,380
Wanna run?

719
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,980
Are you okay?

720
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm fine.

721
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,420
What's wrong?

722
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,460
Yin, this is the Illusionless Realm.

723
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,180
I read about it in ancient texts.

724
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,780
The only way to break this realm

725
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:23,340
is to find each other's location

726
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,660
and then use water-based magic.

727
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:26,300
Water-based magic?

728
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:29,300
Moonlight Illusion!

729
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:30,340
Smart.

730
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,700
Does it hurt?

731
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,020
It's okay.

732
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:14,100
I'll be fine.

733
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:20,300
Mr. Wu Gui,
we are disciples of the Daze Mountain,

734
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,020
with no intention of offense.

735
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,940
But we want to request the return
of the young Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit

736
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,900
to aid in her rebirth.

737
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,500
Please return it to us.

738
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:45,780
Yin, I remember you were
particularly interested in

739
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,340
hearing Lady Feng Chi's story, right?

740
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:49,820
Do you want to hear it now?

741
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,260
Actually, Mr. Wu Gui

742
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,460
used to be one of the twin ancestral trees

743
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,860
on Wutong Island.

744
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:58,580
Seventy thousand years ago,

745
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,620
he fell in love with Lady Feng Chi,

746
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,860
the Phoenix Queen at the time.

747
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,140
In the God-Devil War,

748
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,500
Lady Feng Chi died.

749
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:07,820
(Feng Chi, Former Phoenix Queen)
Mr. Wu Gui secretly collected her immortal spirit

750
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,260
and reshaped her body,

751
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:10,300
sealing her memories

752
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,740
and keeping her company.

753
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,580
However, as long as the former Phoenix Queen
does not die,

754
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:19,300
the new Fire Phoenix can not be born.

755
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,120
- Feng Chi.
- When the Phoenix Clan realized it,

756
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:22,380
they restored Lady Feng Chi's memories.

757
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,220
Don't go.

758
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,100
- Lady Feng Chi chose to leave Mr. Wu Gui,
- The child.

759
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,820
letting herself dissipate through Nirvana.

760
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:36,980
Then Mr. Wu Gui was expelled by the
Phoenix Clan

761
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,980
and later saved by the former Fox King.

762
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:43,580
Bearing a broken heart due to
Lady Feng Chi's resolute departure,

763
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:47,620
he decided to stay in the Jingyou Valley
and nurture young foxes for the Fox Clan

764
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,580
for thirty thousand years.

765
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:51,500
But I heard that Lady Feng Chi

766
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,020
seemed to have sought the Ancestral God,

767
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:55,060
but I don't know what she asked for.

768
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,860
There might be some untold secrets.

769
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:58,700
That's right.

770
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,580
There is indeed an untold secret.

771
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,740
Mr. Wu Gui brought Lady Feng Chi
down to the Mortal Realm.

772
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:06,460
According to the ancient laws,

773
00:40:07,460 --> 00:40:09,580
he should have faced the extreme penalty
of thunder strike.

774
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,780
However, Lady Feng Chi made a deal

775
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,540
with the Ancestral God to protect him.

776
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:18,300
What kind of deal did she make?

777
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,380
Unfortunately, Mr. Wu Gui is not here now,

778
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,540
so to whom should I tell this?

779
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,620
Well, if that's the case,

780
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,540
we should leave now.

781
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:27,900
Let's go.

782
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,340
Wait a minute.

783
00:40:32,380 --> 00:40:33,220
Tell me what deal

784
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,300
she made with the Ancestral God.

785
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:44,100
Ancestral God,

786
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,220
I asked him to go against the natural order
to save me.

787
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,420
I asked him to erase my memories.

788
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,780
Everything is my fault.

789
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
It has nothing to do with Wu Gui.

790
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,300
I voluntarily choose to undergo Nirvana
to bring forth a new Fire Phoenix.

791
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,980
But please, change the rule
that the new Fire Phoenix

792
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:03,820
can be born only after the old one is gone.

793
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:18,020
I only request that in this world,
there won't be another lonely Fire Phoenix,

794
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,100
and there won't be a second

795
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,460
sorrowful Wu Gui.

796
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:25,540
Will you regret it?

797
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,020
I will not.

798
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,380
No, it's not like that.

799
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:38,380
She didn't know anything!

800
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,220
It's me!

801
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:40,780
It's me!

802
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,820
Actually, Lady Feng Chi

803
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,990
didn't want to leave you back then.

804
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,660
But she had no other choice.

805
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,740
I thought I could protect her,

806
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,500
but I messed it all up.

807
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,380
Lady Feng Chi didn't want you

808
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,700
to live in constant pain.

809
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,220
We're looking for
the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit

810
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,060
to bring back Feng Yin.

811
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,020
It's also Lady Feng Chi's wish.

812
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:12,260
I almost ruined her hope.

813
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:24,540
Here is the the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit.

814
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,740
Thank you, Mr. Wu Gui.

815
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,500
Thank you, Mr. Wu Gui.

816
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,300
You've obtained the immortal spirit.

817
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:48,940
You can leave now.

818
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,140
Mr. Wu Gui,

819
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,940
there's something we'd like to trouble you with.

820
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:55,060
You are a demigod of the Immortal Realm, right?

821
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,580
Can you help us break

822
00:42:56,580 --> 00:42:57,820
the master-servant contract?
