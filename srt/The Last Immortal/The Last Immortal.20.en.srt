Congratulations, everyone, for entering
the runoff election for the Cloud Lord.

30
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:46,460
The Cloud Lord is one of the Five Lords
in the Heaven.

31
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,990
It enjoys a supreme position.

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,300
Today, His Majesty has other
important matters and is absent.

33
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:56,020
He has entrusted me
to announce on his behalf.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:00,220
In advance, he has put the name of the favored
candidate into Qianyuan Cauldron

35
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:03,430
together with chiefs of various sects
and heads of each hall.

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,070
Please understand.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,270
Thank you.

38
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,460
Congratulations, Mu Yue.

39
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:38,750
Thank you.

40
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:45,110
Congratulations, Cloud Lord.

41
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,020
Congratulations.

42
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,520
Representing the Hall of Fortune,
I assure you that

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,620
we will fully cooperate with you to
protect the peace of the Immortal Realm.

44
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,230
Thank you, Your Highness.

45
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,020
(Lingyu Hall)

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:01,900
Your Highness.

47
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,950
Where is His Majesty?

48
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,340
His Majesty...

49
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,680
He forbade me from telling anyone.

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,060
Anyone?

51
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,100
Have you forgotten the relationship between
Her Highness and His Majesty?

52
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:15,510
I dare not.

53
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,780
His Majesty has been at
Qinglong Platform these days

54
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,300
and has not returned.

55
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:22,620
Qinglong Platform?

56
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,180
Why is it covered by mist and clouds?

57
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,510
Where is His Majesty?

58
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,150
His Majesty...

59
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,180
Oversight Commandment!

60
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,180
I should have

61
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,460
been careful and diligent,

62
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,230
but in opposite,

63
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,790
I have made mistakes.

64
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,630
I, Lan Feng,

65
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:56,900
failed to discern the truth.

66
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:01,180
This is a negligence.

67
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:12,900
Lan Feng acknowledged the crime of destroying
the Energy Protection Arrow.

68
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,420
No one else is allowed to enter
until the punishment is over.

69
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,540
Cover-up Commandment!

70
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,460
Did His Majesty already know about
your involvement in this matter?

71
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:41,710
I, Lan Feng,
was partial to someone I'm close to,

72
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:46,780
and covered up for her.

73
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:06,590
Lan Feng,

74
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,660
you have been under punishment
for three days.

75
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:11,660
The 81 commandments have been observed.

76
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,340
Your mistakes are forgiven.

77
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,630
Do not blame yourself excessively.
Return to your duties immediately.

78
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:19,190
I

79
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,270
feel unworthy of the imperial seal

80
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,980
and Feng Yuan's trust.

81
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:30,950
I know my virtues
are not fitting for this position.

82
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,710
When Feng Yuan returns,

83
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:35,100
I

84
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,340
will step down.

85
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,540
(Lingyu Hall, Heavenly Palace,
the Immortal Realm)

86
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:18,820
(Upright and Honest)

87
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,390
Why did you confess
and undergo the punishment alone?

88
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,850
You even had your attendant
hide it from me.

89
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,220
Since the Truth Mirror is not working,
just put it away.

90
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:35,230
Shu,

91
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:38,870
I already know everything.

92
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,950
That day, I sensed something unusual.

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,830
How could the perfectly fine Truth Mirror
suddenly lose its spiritual power?

94
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,710
So, I personally conducted
a thorough inspection

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:59,510
and discovered a very subtle
immortal power on it.

96
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,150
Peacock Feather Pure Water.

97
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:05,630
Are you suspecting me?

98
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:13,750
In this world, there are only a few tools
capable of sabotaging the Truth Mirror,

99
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:17,510
and Peacock Feather Pure Water
is one of them.

100
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,660
It is a secret treasure of the Peacock Clan,

101
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,070
not something
an ordinary immortal could obtain.

102
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,220
Moreover, within the Heavenly Palace,

103
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:33,420
who else from the Peacock Clan could
possess such capability?

104
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,580
I know you've never liked Yin,

105
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,020
so you took the opportunity
to erase the images in the mirror,

106
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,070
intending to frame Yin,

107
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:51,830
who already had serious suspicions about her.

108
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,150
But, Shu,

109
00:08:04,310 --> 00:08:05,540
do you realize that your actions

110
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:10,580
could unjustly implicate an innocent
immortal attendant?

111
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,238
If Gu Jin and Yin hadn't found
the devil cultivator

112
00:08:13,262 --> 00:08:15,340
who damaged the arrow in time,

113
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:18,710
this matter could have sparked a war
between the immortals and demons.

114
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,150
If that's how you feel,

115
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:22,990
why not have me investigated?

116
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:24,660
Why took on the blame yourself?

117
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,780
How could I bear to investigate you?

118
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,510
In fact, I had tested you before

119
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:37,390
and confirmed that
you had no trace of devil energy.

120
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,750
I know, Shu,

121
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:44,190
you had no ulterior motives
regarding the Arrow.

122
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,900
It was just a moment of confusion
when you targeted Yin.

123
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:49,350
If that's the case,

124
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,300
I can easily make you come around.

125
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:58,780
Trust me.

126
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:03,060
I won't tell anyone about this.

127
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,820
However, I've broken Feng Yuan's trust.

128
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,350
And I cannot avoid
dealing with this matter.

129
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,750
Therefore, I had to bear all the blame
and consequences

130
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,350
for the sins we committed.
All the divine punishments

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,420
will be shouldered by me.

132
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:32,590
Shu,

133
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,660
over these years,

134
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,270
you've put in countless efforts
for the Peacock Clan,

135
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,470
considering your brother's mediocre talent
and your father's old age.

136
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,780
If I were not in this position,

137
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,870
I would surely help you share the burden.

138
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,230
But since I've taken on the role
of the Acting Heavenly Emperor,

139
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,630
I must be fair in all matters.

140
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,110
Therefore,

141
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,660
in the vote for the Five Lords,

142
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:05,540
I had to cast my vote for the immortal
whose conduct surpassed others.

143
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:09,350
You are so upright and selfless.

144
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,470
You don't have to
bear these punishments for me.

145
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,310
How do you want to punish me? Just say it.

146
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:16,110
I can endure anything.

147
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,900
If your punishment is

148
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,590
marrying me,

149
00:10:33,790 --> 00:10:37,780
and letting me take care of you
for the rest of our lives,

150
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,390
will you accept it?

151
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,180
What did you say?

152
00:10:45,670 --> 00:10:48,110
You already know what kind of person I am.

153
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
Why?

154
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,230
Shu,

155
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,870
what I've said is not to blame you.

156
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:02,590
I just hope that you can stop
disguising yourself.

157
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,390
I love everything about you,

158
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:15,780
including your pride,
sensitivity, insecurity,

159
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,540
and even all your flaws.

160
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,420
Let's face everything,
the good and the bad, together.

161
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:31,060
I just hope you don't
hide everything in your heart

162
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,820
and live such an exhausting life.

163
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,820
You love everything about me?

164
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,350
Do you think that marrying me
would change me?

165
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,590
In the future, I will use the title
of the Heavenly Empress

166
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,660
to scheme for personal gain
at every opportunity.

167
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:57,590
Well, I will use my power to stop you,

168
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:03,060
so you don't harm others and yourself.

169
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,820
It's better if you love me longer

170
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,350
so that I don't become
a truly wicked person.

171
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,150
Don't worry.

172
00:12:19,630 --> 00:12:20,990
I'll always hold onto you.

173
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:39,940
Why did you come to me again?

174
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,110
I almost got caught last time
when I helped you to change the Arrow.

175
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,150
Now that you have got
the God-killing Flower's seed.

176
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,750
No matter what happens,

177
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,590
I won't get involved anymore.

178
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,430
What?

179
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,250
You are not worried about
the return of the little Fire Phoenix now?

180
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:57,870
I've done what I need to do.

181
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:00,150
If it continues like this,

182
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:02,300
I will be punished before

183
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:05,420
she can return.

184
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,160
Fine,

185
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,300
you can withdraw,

186
00:13:09,870 --> 00:13:10,750
but

187
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,990
you have to help me with one last thing.

188
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,750
After this, our transaction is complete.

189
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,110
It's simple.

190
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:32,700
Just get Xian Shan, Xian Zhu and
Gu Jin out of Daze Mountain,

191
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,470
and I'll take care of the rest.

192
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,460
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

193
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,740
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

194
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,150
Since the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
was refined by Hua Shu,

195
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,110
the immortal vein of Daze Mountain has been
protected by a weak barrier.

196
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,390
Some time ago, Xian Zhu was injured
and lost some immortal power,

197
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:11,420
so the ignition of the Nine-star Lamp
has been delayed.

198
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,020
Now that his condition has improved,

199
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,710
we should immediately light the Lamp
to protect the immortal vein.

200
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,300
I've already informed the Heavenly Palace

201
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,390
and will guard the mountain gate
while you two ignite the Lamp.

202
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,510
Masters, Martial Uncle,

203
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:28,900
something happened to Feng Yin's
Soul Suppressing Pagoda.

204
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,540
Let's go to Wutong Island first.

205
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:39,660
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

206
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:11,780
Starting from today, the Soul Suppressing Pagoda
has been restless.

207
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:14,700
I've been trying to repair it,
but it's not working.

208
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:18,590
That's why I sent people
to Daze Mountain to seek your help.

209
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,940
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)
The immortal vein of Daze Mountain is here.

210
00:15:47,670 --> 00:15:49,950
(The chief of Daze Mountain)

211
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:51,630
(set up a formidable barrier.)

212
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:56,060
(Thankfully, I have the talisman
from the Devil Lord.)

213
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:29,700
Elder Feng Ming, why did the Pagoda
suddenly become restless?

214
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,860
Feng Yin's immortal spirit
has not returned for too long,

215
00:16:31,870 --> 00:16:33,950
and the spiritual power
of the Pagoda has been weakening.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,780
It's the accumulation of days
that has caused this disaster.

217
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:41,350
Is there any way to save
the Soul Suppressing Pagoda?

218
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,750
It needs eight portions of Feng Yin's
immortal spirit to stabilize.

219
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,940
Otherwise, in less than half a day,

220
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,820
Feng Yin's body will decay

221
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,540
and disappear forever
within the Three Realms.

222
00:16:58,360 --> 00:16:59,200
Feng Ming,

223
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,110
besides this method, is there any other way

224
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:03,700
to temporarily stabilize Feng Yin's body?

225
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:04,940
There is another way,

226
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:09,180
but it has never been tried.

227
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:12,958
It requires two portions of the immortal spirit

228
00:17:12,982 --> 00:17:15,590
of another immortal to be infused
into Feng Yin's body.

229
00:17:15,790 --> 00:17:16,780
I'll do it.

230
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:17,620
No.

231
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:19,420
You need to oversee
the affairs of Daze Mountain.

232
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,280
Let me do it.

233
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:22,180
Both of you are outsiders after all.

234
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,870
The Phoenix Queen
is the leader of our Phoenix Clan.

235
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,700
It should be me who offers the sacrifice.

236
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,110
There's no need to argue.

237
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,240
Feng Ming is injured.

238
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,990
If there must be a sacrifice of immortal spirit,
I should do it.

239
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:34,830
No.

240
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,800
Jin.

241
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:38,460
Once the immortal spirit is sacrificed,
it cannot be recovered.

242
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:40,590
You will suffer from the pain
of restless immortal spirit

243
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:42,870
for the rest of your life.
Xian Zhu and I will...

244
00:17:42,870 --> 00:17:44,310
I know you two care for me,

245
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,550
but Feng Yin's immortal spirit dispersed
because of me.

246
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,260
Let me offer the sacrifice.
It's a way for me to make up for it.

247
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,500
The dishes are ready.

248
00:18:05,030 --> 00:18:06,580
Martial Aunt! Martial Aunt!

249
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,430
Qing Yi?

250
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,310
Why are you here?

251
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,030
The Soul Suppressing Pagoda is in trouble.

252
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:13,110
Martial Uncle Gu Jin is going to sacrifice
his immortal spirit to preserve Feng Yin's body.

253
00:18:13,110 --> 00:18:15,590
Elder Feng Ming says
we need eight portions

254
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:16,990
of her immortal spirit to preserve it.

255
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:18,430
Now, we still need two portions.

256
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,660
Martial Aunt, I remember you mentioned that
a parasol tree exists in the Nether Realm.

257
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,950
Can you find a way
to obtain the immortal spirit

258
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:25,300
from the Nether King?

259
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,740
Once Martial Uncle Gu Jin sacrifices
his immortal spirit,

260
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,110
he will suffer for the rest of his life.

261
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,030
Qing Yi, don't worry.

262
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:34,500
Jiu, Yan Shuang,

263
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,830
go back with Qing Yi
and make sure to stop Jin.

264
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:37,870
Alright.

265
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:39,460
I'll go to the Nether Realm.

266
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,840
Wait.

267
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,460
Last time, you saved the Three-life Stone
but didn't get the immortal spirit.

268
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,560
This time...

269
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,030
I know what to do.

270
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,080
I'll go with you.

271
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,550
No.

272
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,460
This time, only I can save him.

273
00:18:57,070 --> 00:18:58,190
We must hurry,

274
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,110
otherwise, we won't be able to stop him.

275
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,260
(The Nether Realm)

276
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:09,180
I will exchange half of my spiritual power
for Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

277
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,840
Girl,

278
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:23,590
you already know that your internal core
spiritual power represents your lifespan,

279
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,260
and you are still willing to exchange?

280
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,100
Yes.

281
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:32,390
Your Majesty, aren't you willing
to do anything for Xiu Yan?

282
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,180
Do you know what you're saying?

283
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,180
Your influence is felt
throughout the Three Realms.

284
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,420
If it weren't for your permission,

285
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,460
who would dare sell tablets
for entering the palace?

286
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:52,030
When I saw Xiu Yan last time,

287
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:53,940
his spiritual power was extremely weak.

288
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,700
We Water Divine Beasts
have the ability to restore it.

289
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,540
Your Majesty, you've been collecting
treasures in Xiuyan Tower

290
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,660
and trying to obtain my spiritual power,

291
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,990
it must be for Xiu Yan, right?

292
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,720
Girl,

293
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,500
you've come after all.

294
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,420
Wouldn't your senior brother
feel heartbroken about what you're doing?

295
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,180
My life was awakened by him.

296
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,350
I'm willing

297
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,030
to help him fulfill his longstanding wish.

298
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:19,110
(The God-killing Flower's seed should
have been planted by now.)

299
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,270
- Jin!
- Jin!

300
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:00,110
Are you okay?

301
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,350
I'm fine.

302
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:03,110
I can endure this pain.

303
00:23:03,750 --> 00:23:04,590
Let's continue.

304
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,320
Stop!

305
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,100
- Jin!
- Jin!

306
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,070
Jin!

307
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,430
Your Highness, what do you mean by this?

308
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,030
Gu Jin, Yin learned that you were going to
sacrifice your immortal spirit

309
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,500
and asked us to stop you.

310
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,700
If it weren't for Yin's desperate plea,

311
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:31,330
I wouldn't have come to save you.

312
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,500
If this technique is interrupted
without being restored promptly,

313
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,700
the previous efforts will be wasted.

314
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,500
I've come to break it.

315
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,110
Yin asked me to do it.

316
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,320
Where is Yin?

317
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:43,430
Where is she now?

318
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:46,660
She said she had a way
and went alone to the Nether Realm.

319
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,940
Do you know
what the method she mentioned is?

320
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,800
Oh no!

321
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,110
Jin!

322
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,900
Yin, are you okay?

323
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:22,740
Please give me
Feng Yin's immortal spirit now.

324
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:24,870
I need to take it to Wutong Island.

325
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,390
If Jin's immortal spirit enters
the Soul Suppressing Pagoda,

326
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,220
it will be too late.

327
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:31,660
The parasol tree in the Nether Realm
is different from elsewhere.

328
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,740
It needs to be slowly extracted.

329
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:37,310
After I take it out, I'll use the teleportation
technique to send you to Wutong Island.

330
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:38,940
You will definitely make it.

331
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,420
Thank you.

332
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,240
Yin,

333
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,870
as a token of gratitude,
I have a gift for you.

334
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,550
I've become a junior immortal.

335
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,110
But the cultivation
still needs to conform to destiny.

336
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,980
So, that's all I can do for you.

337
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,900
But if you need anything in the future,

338
00:25:35,110 --> 00:25:36,740
I will do my best to assist.

339
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:40,590
Thank you, Your Majesty.

340
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,660
What did you call me?

341
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,500
I know you are Ao Ge, the Nether King.

342
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:57,700
We Water Divine Beasts leave an aura
every time we save people.

343
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:00,900
When I went to Xiuyan Tower,

344
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:04,460
I sent spiritual power to Lord Xiu Yan.

345
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:15,390
Girl,

346
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,990
you already know that your internal core
spiritual power

347
00:26:17,990 --> 00:26:21,350
represents your lifespan, and you are still
willing to exchange?

348
00:26:23,030 --> 00:26:27,180
At that time,
I left my aura on this ring.

349
00:26:31,550 --> 00:26:33,150
This ring must be the only one of its kind.

350
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:37,180
So, I know you are Ao Ge,
the Nether King.

351
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,390
You are indeed clever.

352
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,700
In the last ten thousand years, you're
the first one who has discovered this.

353
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,070
That's right, I am Ao Ge,

354
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,070
but at the same time, I am also Xiu Yan.

355
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:56,660
110,000 years ago,

356
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,350
Ao Ge and I were born
in the Ancient God Realm.

357
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:01,220
We were a pair of twin brothers.

358
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,940
Ao Ge was born for managing life,

359
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,280
and I, death.

360
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,460
I, Xiu Yan.

361
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,080
I, Ao Ge.

362
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,870
Swear that I'll fight for the Three Realms,

363
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,150
give the people a happy life,

364
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:12,990
and protect eternal peace.

365
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,790
The God Realm
selected me as the Nether King,

366
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,900
the guide to the netherworld.

367
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,390
While Ao Ge became the ruler of the
Heavenly Palace, leading Heaven.

368
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:22,910
Later,

369
00:27:23,550 --> 00:27:26,030
seventy thousand years ago,
the war against devils started.

370
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:30,030
Devil God Ming Qi broke through the seal
of the Abyssal Prison with all devils,

371
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:34,740
and True God Di Juan and True Goddess Yi He
happened to enter the Mortal Realm,

372
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:37,180
both absent from the Ancient God Realm.

373
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:42,160
Only Ao Ge and I led tens of thousands
of soldiers to quell the insurrection.

374
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,180
How foolish!

375
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:48,030
Just two new gods attempt to stop me!

376
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,220
Accept your death!

377
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:02,870
Ao Ge!

378
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,080
Xiu Yan!

379
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,420
Live on!

380
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,940
Go!

381
00:28:41,550 --> 00:28:42,830
Self-sacrifice!

382
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:45,110
The gods remain asleep
and have not awakened.

383
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,790
The two of us
are guarding the Three Realms.

384
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:49,310
I will never let you massacre the people.

385
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,030
Finally, I used the method of self-sacrifice
to reseal the Abyssal Prison.

386
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,630
Xiu Yan!

387
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,460
Xiu Yan!

388
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:08,240
Xiu Yan!

389
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,940
But the cost was my internal core scattered
throughout the heaven and earth.

390
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,030
After Ao Ge found the fragments,

391
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,790
he broke into the Hall of Life and Death,
stealing the Reincarnation Book.

392
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,980
He found True Goddess Yi He
in the Mortal Realm,

393
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:25,900
and begged her to use the power of chaos
to reshape the fragments of my internal core.

394
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,660
Your Ladyship,

395
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,660
please save Xiu Yan!

396
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:35,460
You and your brother are twins
born from the Qiankun Platform,

397
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,500
with roles bestowed upon you by the Heaven.

398
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:40,180
You manage life, and he manages death.

399
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:44,550
You are the future Heavenly Emperor, born to
wield the Heavenly Emperor's seal,

400
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:48,500
while Xiu Yan presides over the
Three Realms' tribulations and hardships.

401
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:51,900
If I use the power of chaos to assist
Xiu Yan's rebirth,

402
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:54,500
for the tens of thousands, or even

403
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:58,990
hundreds of thousands of years
during his resurrection,

404
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:03,420
Qiankun Platform will not give birth to
a new guide for the tribulations.

405
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,310
No one will manage
the tribulations and hardships,

406
00:30:06,590 --> 00:30:10,900
causing great chaos in the Three Realms
and even the God Realm.

407
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,480
Your Ladyship,

408
00:30:13,070 --> 00:30:14,940
can I replace him
as the guide for the tribulations?

409
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:16,830
Xiu Yan and I are twin brothers.

410
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,420
If I nurture his internal core,

411
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,390
his consciousness can awaken
in less than a thousand years.

412
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:24,220
By then, he can use my body
to preside over the Nether Realm.

413
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,940
We are twins with
the same source of god power.

414
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,870
So Ao Ge served as the vessel with his body,

415
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:34,630
asking True Goddess Yi He to reshape
my internal core within him.

416
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,790
From then on, we've lived in one body.

417
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,660
Because I was the guide to the netherworld,

418
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:45,350
during this long period
of internal core restoration,

419
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:46,980
no one could guide the tribulations.

420
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,680
Your Majesty.

421
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,790
So, Ao Ge willingly abandoned his status
as the Heavenly Emperor

422
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,590
and came to the Nether Realm,
replacing me as the Nether King.

423
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,600
Because restoring the internal core requires
a massive amount of spiritual power,

424
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:02,830
Ao Ge built the Xiuyan Tower, using tablets

425
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:05,630
to exchange for treasures with profound
spiritual power from the Three Realms

426
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:08,500
to help me nourish
my internal core fragments.

427
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:11,220
Without this parasol tree,

428
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:15,420
we might not have held on for so long.

429
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:35,590
Now, I also have someone I want to protect.

430
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,540
(Abyssal Prison)

431
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:51,550
It has been seventy thousand years.

432
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,000
(Ming Qi, Devil God)
The Three Realms underwent drastic changes.

433
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:58,720
Your attitude hasn't changed at all,
huh, Xiu Yan?

434
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,220
It's only been seventy thousand years.

435
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,900
We will remain here forever.

436
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:10,940
You seem willing,

437
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,630
but it's a pity for your little brother.

438
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:20,260
I heard he spent tens of thousands of years
restoring your internal core.

439
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,630
However, your internal core fragments
are with me.

440
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,900
You sacrificed your entire life to seal me,

441
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,940
and also wasted ten thousand years
of your brother's time.

442
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,030
Is it worth it?

443
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,110
Protecting the Three Realms has always been
the mission of the two of us.

444
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:40,150
I believe Ao Ge

445
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,460
would do the same.

446
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:45,180
I thought the God Realm was filled with

447
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:47,900
hypocritical and cowardly beings,

448
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,350
but unexpectedly, there is someone like you,

449
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,590
who would actually sacrifice himself.

450
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,480
Xiu Yan,

451
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:58,420
seventy thousand years have passed,

452
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,870
and the Three Realms

453
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,590
have long forgotten about us.

454
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:14,630
For the sake of the Three Realms,

455
00:33:15,030 --> 00:33:17,200
your internal core has scattered
for seventy thousand years.

456
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,980
But how many of them
remember what you did?

457
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:25,460
Why not let me go out and let them
get to know you again?

458
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,900
Since I have already reconstructed
your physical body,

459
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:32,940
you just need to go out and merge with
the internal core condensed by Ao Ge,

460
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,550
and you can be as good as new, becoming
the supreme ruler of the Three Realms again.

461
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,240
Devil God,

462
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,740
You possess the power
to transcend life and death.

463
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:57,030
With just the fragments of my internal core,
you can rebuild my physical body.

464
00:33:58,310 --> 00:34:02,070
You're so powerful,
how could I dare to let you out?

465
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,310
Moreover, I don't care whether
the Three Realms remember me or not.

466
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:11,430
I only care about
whether I can seal this barrier

467
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:16,990
as long as possible.

468
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,150
Your Majesty! Gu Jin
has caused trouble in the front hall.

469
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,150
Ao Ge!

470
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,800
Where is Ao Ge?

471
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:57,470
Let him come out!

472
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,780
Is everyone deaf?

473
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:00,510
Ao Ge, come out!

474
00:35:00,510 --> 00:35:01,470
Jin.

475
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:04,070
Yin!

476
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:05,470
Yin,

477
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,660
are you okay?

478
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,740
I've obtained Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

479
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,600
Take it to the Soul Suppressing Pagoda now.

480
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:19,030
His Majesty didn't trouble me
and even promoted my rank.

481
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:22,910
Yin.

482
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:26,550
Yin.

483
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,840
Let him go.

484
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,980
Yin.

485
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:44,950
Yin.

486
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,100
(Zhongling Palace)

487
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:50,680
I told you not to use your spiritual power
to exchange for immortal spirit.

488
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:52,300
Why don't you listen?

489
00:35:52,630 --> 00:35:54,110
Consider it my repayment

490
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:58,470
for bringing me out of the Forbidden Valley
and nurturing me.

491
00:35:59,510 --> 00:36:02,490
I've repaid what you owe
Feng Yin for you.

492
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,990
But you are not Bibo.

493
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:06,550
You can't live
for thousands of years like him.

494
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,000
Do you know what it means
to lose half of your lifespan?

495
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:09,840
I know,

496
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:13,430
but I calculated it.
I still have fifty years,

497
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,220
enough time to do what I want to do.

498
00:36:20,670 --> 00:36:22,470
Don't worry, Yin.

499
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,550
Even if I search the Three Realms,

500
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,820
I will find a way to extend your life.

501
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:35,950
On the day you severed the love thread,

502
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,510
I understood your intentions

503
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
and didn't intend
to entangle with you anymore.

504
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:45,740
I didn't get Feng Yin's immortal spirit

505
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,430
to win your gratitude

506
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:54,030
or regain your favor.

507
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:00,860
You should hurry to Wutong...

508
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,640
Yin!

509
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,660
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

510
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,800
Jin,

511
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:24,510
what happened?

512
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:29,070
Yin, she...

513
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,660
She exchanged half of her internal core
spiritual power

514
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:39,470
with the Nether King for two portions of
Feng Yin's immortal spirit,

515
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,140
and lost half of her lifespan.

516
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:42,980
What?

517
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,280
Xian Shan,

518
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,430
could that be the reason for Yin's...

519
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,780
- Gu Jin!
- Jiu.

520
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:51,710
- Jiu.
- Jiu! Jiu!

521
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:53,990
If you already knew that the Nether King
would demand such a condition,

522
00:37:53,990 --> 00:37:55,150
why didn't you tell us earlier?

523
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:58,070
Were you deliberately using this strategy

524
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:00,700
to let Yin exchange her spiritual power?

525
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,840
Jiu.

526
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,150
- Say it!
- Jiu!

527
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:14,950
Xian Shan,

528
00:38:16,150 --> 00:38:17,550
right now, I just want to know

529
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:23,030
if there's any way to extend Yin's life
within fifty years.

530
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:27,780
I'm afraid she doesn't
have fifty years left.

531
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:30,590
Xian Shan, what do you mean?

532
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:32,640
Jin,

533
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:35,108
have you ever thought about it?

534
00:38:35,132 --> 00:38:37,530
Water Divine Beasts have been extinct
for sixty thousand years.

535
00:38:37,590 --> 00:38:39,950
Why did Yin appear in our Forbidden Valley?

536
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:43,990
Also, why has this Water Divine Beast egg

537
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:46,860
never hatched in sixty thousand years?

538
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,980
Seventy thousand years ago,
during the war against devils,

539
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,430
many immortal beasts
were unfortunately annihilated,

540
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,660
including Water Divine Beast Clan.

541
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,190
At that time, Yin's parents entrusted
the yet-to-hatch Yin

542
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:03,260
and her younger sister to Master,
then left to fight against devils.

543
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:05,070
They never returned.

544
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:10,990
Why didn't Master let them hatch?

545
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,820
That was the wish of Yin's parents.

546
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,320
Back then,

547
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:19,630
when Yin's mother was pregnant with them,
she was injured by a devil.

548
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,950
Even though she barely gave birth to Yin
and her younger sister,

549
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,220
their immortal spirit
was damaged by the devil,

550
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,780
making it difficult for them to break
out of their shells.

551
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,590
Although Yin was fortunately born later,

552
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:36,300
her lifespan is at most ten years.

553
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,150
Ten years?

554
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,990
Ten years?

555
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:52,910
Ten years.

556
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:01,320
Ten years.

557
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,030
Should she come out,
experience this world, and die,

558
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,910
or should she sleep forever?

559
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,660
Yin's parents couldn't decide,

560
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:14,180
so they left it to fate.

561
00:40:15,230 --> 00:40:17,590
They asked Master
to seal Yin in the Forbidden Valley.

562
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:20,470
If her fate allowed her
to break out of her shell,

563
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:24,780
then it meant
she should have this short life.

564
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,660
Fate determines everything.

565
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,510
Ten years?

566
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,030
Yin sacrificed five years of her lifespan

567
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,740
and has been in this world
for over four years.

568
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:43,700
In other words...

569
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:50,760
Yin only has less than one year left.

570
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,600
I don't believe it.

571
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,220
This is impossible.

572
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,030
Is there no other way to save her?

573
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,576
For immortal beasts to break through
the shackles of lifespan,

574
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,700
they have to ascend to a god.

575
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:05,780
Ascending to godhood is definitely not feasible.

576
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,300
Water Divine Beasts
have frail immortal bodies,

577
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:12,470
this is probably their natural fate.

578
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:14,150
But I don't believe in fate.

579
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,830
Since Yin could defy fate
and came out of her shell,

580
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:20,680
I will surely find a way to save her.

581
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:21,860
Yes, Master,

582
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,740
there must be a way in those ancient books.

583
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,950
There is nothing in the books.

584
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,300
Xian Zhu and I have already checked.

585
00:41:30,510 --> 00:41:33,340
Just because it's not in the books
doesn't mean there's no way out.

586
00:41:37,230 --> 00:41:38,220
Bibo,

587
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:40,870
like Bibo.

588
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:43,220
Bibo is still alive, right?

589
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,270
Although Water Divine Beasts
are almost extinct,

590
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,740
Bibo has a blood connection to Yin.

591
00:41:51,670 --> 00:41:52,990
I'll go to Ziyue Mountain to find him.

592
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,550
I must find a way to save her!

593
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,540
(Bibo's Hut, Ziyue Mountain)

594
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:21,070
What happened?

595
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:25,740
Extend Yin's lifespan?

596
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,760
Yes,

597
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,470
you are a Water Divine Beast.

598
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:29,800
Do you have a way?

599
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,950
This is going against Heaven's wish.

600
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,150
It's too difficult to achieve.

601
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,720
If you have a way, tell me.

602
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,600
Well...

603
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,820
