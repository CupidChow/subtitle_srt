=Episode 37=

29
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:05,910
Your Godship is actually being so ruthless
to our Bainiao Island!

30
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,900
You led all your people
into the devil path,

31
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,230
how dare you say I am ruthless!

32
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,670
You indeed have extraordinary perception,

33
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,230
even able to sense things
across space so clearly.

34
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,060
It's a pity, though. Their descent
into the devil path was voluntary.

35
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:22,780
It's not my fault.

36
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,020
Open the barrier of the Ruoshui River.

37
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:06,150
So, you knew about it.

38
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:09,580
If you don't open it,
I will tear you into pieces.

39
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,110
What difference does it make
if I open the Ruoshui River's barrier?

40
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,780
The barrier of the Purple Moon is so fragile.
Do you dare to touch it?

41
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:21,830
Aren't you afraid that you will unleash
the tiger from its cage?

42
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:49,150
Where is Hua Shu?

43
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,510
Don't waste your efforts.

44
00:03:52,630 --> 00:03:55,460
The barrier of Ningyun Mountain
is under my daughter's control.

45
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,460
You won't find her.

46
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:01,710
Now that my daughter
has become a Devil God,

47
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,780
when she stabilizes her cultivation,
she will come to rescue me.

48
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:11,740
The Immortal Realm will sooner or later
belong to our Peacock Clan.

49
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,540
Hua Shu has become a Devil God?

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,780
We need the help of the Three Realms
to find her whereabouts.

51
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:39,900
I've noticed that you don't look well today.

52
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:41,950
- Is there anything...
- I'm fine.

53
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,950
I'll take Hua Mo to the Heavenly Palace first.

54
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,630
You go take care of Yan Shuang.
I'll come later.

55
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,460
Your immortal spirit isn't stable yet,
you need more rest.

56
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,950
Don't get angry, and think less.

57
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:23,870
If you don't like anything I've done,
just let me know.

58
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:27,220
Here, take the medicine.

59
00:05:30,270 --> 00:05:31,150
I'll take it myself.

60
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,510
You go have a rest.

61
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,640
I'm fine.

62
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,070
I feel more at ease watching over you.

63
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,540
I'm not at ease.

64
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:55,710
If you continue being like this,
how can I repay you?

65
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,390
I just want to save you.

66
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:00,580
I don't want to see you suffer.
And I'm afraid I won't see you again.

67
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,300
So, as long as you are well,
even if you don't want to talk to me

68
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,310
and keep avoiding me, I don't mind.

69
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:10,120
Yan Shuang, I know you have
heavy burdens as the Eagle Queen.

70
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,470
I understand. I also can't abandon
the Demon Clan just for my own pleasure.

71
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:18,390
But this doesn't conflict with my feelings
for you or my commitment to protect you.

72
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,950
Anyway, I just can't let you go.

73
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,340
How is Bainiao Island?

74
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,200
Where is Yuan Qi?

75
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,540
Hua Shu has become a Devil God.

76
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:13,760
Devil God?

77
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,070
Yuan Qi caught Hua Mo and took him
to the Heavenly Palace.

78
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,220
Things are getting more complicated.

79
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,660
Fortunately, we've caught Hua Mo.

80
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,630
But I am afraid
he won't reveal anything significant.

81
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,580
Don't expect too much from him.

82
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,460
We can only proceed carefully.

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,870
It's time for Yan Shuang
to take the medicine.

84
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:39,630
I'll go decoct it. Help me look after her.

85
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,820
You look so pale...

86
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:42,660
I'm fine.

87
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,080
Yan Shuang.

88
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:58,950
Are you leaving?

89
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,960
Let me help you.

90
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:23,340
If you don't want to go,
stay for a few more days.

91
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,580
He's here with you,
stop staring at his clothes.

92
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:31,750
I just think his robe

93
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:34,230
is delicate and want to take a look.

94
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,150
Foxes are always flamboyant.

95
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,470
You guys are just stubborn.

96
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:45,060
You know Hong Yi is full of sincerity.

97
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,590
So do you want him to wait for you or not?

98
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:55,020
I admit that I'm always
soft-hearted towards Hong Yi.

99
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:59,540
However, I really can't
give him an answer right now.

100
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,270
If only the two of us were like
you and Yuan Qi.

101
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,020
Although you went through a lot,
you didn't miss each other in the end.

102
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,820
Alright, you should go back now.

103
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,020
Otherwise, Yuan Qi will worry about you.

104
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,470
Lately, I've felt that Yuan Qi is hiding
something from me, but...

105
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,300
Did something happen?

106
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,700
I might be overthinking.

107
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,750
It's about to break.

108
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,280
Xiu Yan!

109
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:30,630
What was that feeling just now?

110
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:32,780
You're drunk, Ao Ge.

111
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,160
Nonsense.

112
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,750
Even if we drink for ten thousand years,
I will never get drunk before you.

113
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,870
Tens of thousands of years
is too long, Ao Ge.

114
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:12,110
Instead of saying
I've shared the same body with you,

115
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:16,020
it's more accurate to say that I've been
occupying your life and refusing to leave.

116
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,940
Now is the time. I have to go.

117
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,160
Xiu Yan.

118
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:31,440
I will return your remaining life to you.

119
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,390
Go and do the things you want to do.

120
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:42,559
Didn't you want to travel
through the Three Realms?

121
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:44,660
Go see the world you've never seen.

122
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,630
Xiu Yan.

123
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:53,180
Take a look for me.
I'm afraid I won't be able to.

124
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,660
Ao Ge, don't think of me.

125
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,990
Never.

126
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,590
Xiu Yan, are you going to leave now?

127
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:59,020
(Xiu Yan, I will fulfill your request properly.)

128
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,900
Xiu Yan, you don't have time
to mend so many cracks.

129
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,710
We have been together
for tens of thousands of years,

130
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,700
I will miss you after you go.

131
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:29,350
Why don't you just give up
and go out with me?

132
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,540
Impossible.

133
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,700
How naive.

134
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:16,900
Xiu Yan, how long do you think
you can trap me?

135
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:21,900
In the end, you will vanish completely.

136
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,780
I must trap you as long as possible.

137
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,060
The longer time I buy for the kids out there,

138
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,390
the greater the chance of winning we have.

139
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,060
Alright.

140
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,020
After all these idle years,

141
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,630
I'm here to try your power,

142
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,150
and see how long you can trap me
in your current state.

143
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:18,230
You are...

144
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,060
I am the Three-life Stone, Your Majesty.

145
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,870
Three-life Stone?

146
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,420
You have become a big girl.

147
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:33,900
Why did you come to the Immortal Realm
from the Nether Realm?

148
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,700
This is the Nether Realm.

149
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,470
You are the Nether King.

150
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,700
I am the Nether King?

151
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:56,540
Right. I am the Nether King now.

152
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:06,820
What is that?

153
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:08,590
That's the Bell Watching Tower.

154
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:13,150
You said the Zhongling Palace is
magnificent but appears lonely.

155
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,980
So, you ordered to build
this tower across from it.

156
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,150
Just to keep it company.

157
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,510
You mean, I built that tower?

158
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,860
If Ao Ge asks me about
the origin of Xiuyan Tower,

159
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,940
what should I say?

160
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:40,660
Just tell him it's called
the Bell Watching Tower.

161
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:45,540
I hope that he will forget me one day.

162
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:56,020
(Hall of Arms)

163
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:57,750
Lord, greetings.

164
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:58,590
Alright, alright.

165
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,220
Qing Yi, glad to see you.

166
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,780
Help me check what name is on this.

167
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:10,260
- The Heavenly Palace has recruited
- Well...

168
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,740
a group of new immortals,

169
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:15,180
but the one assigned to my Hall of Arms
hasn't reported to duty yet.

170
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:18,980
I was going to check the name on the list,

171
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:24,820
but I spilled some wine
and the name is unclear now.

172
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,100
Calm down, sir.

173
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,500
The newly appointed immortals
will report first to the Hall of Fortune.

174
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:29,460
Let me check for you.

175
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,620
Thank you.

176
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,820
Why do I keep coming back here?

177
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,220
(Hall of Fortune)

178
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:49,100
Sir, are you heading to the Hall of Arms?

179
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:55,660
Excuse me, could you please tell me
how to get to the Hall of Arms?

180
00:17:57,820 --> 00:18:00,460
(Shan, Immortal)

181
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,300
Master.

182
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:08,860
Please take my youngest disciple,
Qing Yi, out

183
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,820
and leave the last hope
for our Daze Mountain.

184
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,580
Master! Master!

185
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,140
I won't leave, Master!

186
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,660
Master!

187
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,140
Master?

188
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:35,940
Master!

189
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,820
Master, why are you...

190
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:43,780
Sir, my name is Shan.

191
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,660
I'm just an ordinary immortal
from Yupeng Island,

192
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,700
with a mere 500 years of cultivation.
Please stop calling me Master.

193
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:53,340
Master, don't you recognize me?

194
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,380
No, I don't.

195
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:05,100
(Bright and Clear Moon)

196
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,300
Why is he suffering so much
from the heavenly thunder?

197
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:32,620
It's the Heavenly Punishment.

198
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:36,620
The punishment for getting god light
by cheating has not been completed yet.

199
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,180
If it's the Heavenly Punishment,
why am I not taking it?

200
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:43,540
He took all the blame

201
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:47,620
and brought all the heavenly tribulations
onto himself.

202
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:53,900
Yuan Qi.

203
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,340
Master.

204
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:56,900
Are you okay?

205
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,500
I'm fine.

206
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:11,140
Just a few heavenly thunders. No problem.

207
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,420
Why are you so weak?

208
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,820
Is the punishment compounded
because you used

209
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,940
god power in the Mortal Realm?

210
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,820
Martial Uncle!

211
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,500
- Sir!
- Martial Uncle!

212
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:25,380
- Martial Uncle! Look!
- Why did you drag me here?

213
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,780
Martial Uncle!

214
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,620
Sir.

215
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:28,620
Xian Shan?

216
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:40,980
I am Shan and I don't belong to any sect.

217
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:44,380
I'm really not the one you know.

218
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,660
You must find it unbelievable, right?

219
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,620
He is a newly appointed immortal
in the Heavenly Palace,

220
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,420
and his appearance is exactly
like my master's.

221
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:55,500
I don't know what you're talking about.
Can you let me go?

222
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:01,460
My mother once said that

223
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:05,820
although the Ancestral God is gone,
he still cares for everything.

224
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,700
Perhaps it's because
the disciples of Daze Mountain

225
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,980
sacrificed themselves to resist the devils,
which moved the Ancestral God,

226
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,300
leaving room for recovery.

227
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,100
So, will all the disciples of

228
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:20,300
Daze Mountain regain a new life?

229
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,740
The Disciple Roll. Martial Uncle, take a look

230
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,020
and see if it has changed.

231
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,740
What you said is true!

232
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,340
He is indeed my master.

233
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:51,380
The entire Daze Mountain has been revived.

234
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:15,100
Qing Yi, from today onwards, you will be
the Chief of Daze Mountain.

235
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,780
Me?

236
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,420
(Tablet)

237
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:27,220
You have the highest seniority
throughout Daze Mountain now.

238
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,580
Of course you'll be the Chief.

239
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:30,100
I...

240
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:34,340
The responsibility of reviving Daze Mountain
is entrusted to you.

241
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:42,180
(Tablet)

242
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:08,500
This is yours now.

243
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:11,220
With this,

244
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:14,260
(Disciple Roll)
sooner or later, you can find all the disciples.

245
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,180
After gathering all the disciples,
bring them to Daze Mountain.

246
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:21,660
I believe that the immortal vein
can be reshaped.

247
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,060
When that happens,

248
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:28,500
we... we can go back home.

249
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,820
Master, since you have no sect,

250
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:41,020
would you be willing to join
our Daze Mountain again?

251
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:45,060
After hearing so much from you,
I seem to have understood something.

252
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:48,300
Are you saying that I have a predestined
connection with Daze Mountain?

253
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,300
Actually, I entered the path of immortality

254
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:53,500
while I was sleeping,
guided by an immortal.

255
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:57,180
The appearance of that immortal
is now blurry in my memory,

256
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,020
but it does feel familiar.

257
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:05,860
Since that's the case,
I will respectfully comply.

258
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:10,340
(Tablet)

259
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:19,820
Your name is Shan,

260
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,620
and we'll put a "Xian" before your name.

261
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,940
So your new name is Xian Shan.

262
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,420
Xian Shan?

263
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,260
Master, you've finally returned.

264
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,780
Allow me to bow to you.

265
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,380
No, no, no. You are the Master.
I should bow to you.

266
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,660
No way.

267
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,940
You will always be my master.

268
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:41,420
No, you are my master. Let me bow to you.

269
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,660
It's not easy to find
all the disciples one by one.

270
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:56,260
My injuries have not healed, so I cannot
go with Qing Yi to search.

271
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,780
Don't worry. I'll handle it.

272
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:08,100
You know that Daze Mountain has been
my deepest regret.

273
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,580
I thought I would never see them again

274
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:14,220
and could never make up for my mistakes,
but fortunately,

275
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,260
now there is hope.

276
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:24,100
I'm worried about your health though.

277
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:25,660
It's fine.

278
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:28,420
I'll rest at Qingchi Palace to recover.

279
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:32,780
If you and Qing Yi find all the disciples
during this time,

280
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:36,380
we can revive Daze Mountain together.

281
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:42,260
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

282
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,260
To become a pair of lovebirds,

283
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,980
we have no fear of death.

284
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:16,100
I've never heard this phrase before.

285
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,060
"Love is greater than everything."

286
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:22,380
I really don't know whether this is
willful fearlessness

287
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,820
or naive innocence.

288
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:27,780
To be able to stay with my loved one,

289
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:31,180
I'm willing to give up everything.

290
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:37,580
Unfortunately, as you said,
it's just wishful thinking.

291
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:43,540
The vast sea changes in an instant,

292
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:46,860
and only the osmanthus blossoms.

293
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,460
Lian Xi, you...

294
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:57,420
I'm sorry about this.

295
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,780
This is the Annulment of Engagement.

296
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:03,700
Please, Eagle Queen, leave your seal
and annul our engagement.

297
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,940
Make it known
throughout the Immortal Realm.

298
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,900
I didn't do well enough. I disappointed you

299
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:17,860
and let you down.

300
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,620
I love you, Yan Shuang.

301
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,020
Even now, my feelings haven't changed.

302
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,900
But I know you will never love me.

303
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:38,380
Compared to disappointment, I hope
you can gain true happiness.

304
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,740
Yesterday, I went to the Demon Realm.

305
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:46,700
When the Demon King cut off his tail
to save you, I was outside the door

306
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:51,180
and heard what he said to you.

307
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:59,180
I know that in your heart,
he is the indelible light.

308
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:06,940
Yan Shuang, you and he have experienced
too much together,

309
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,420
far beyond what I can compare.

310
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,500
I know there are still some obstacles

311
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,460
or troubles between you.

312
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:19,940
But at least,
I won't be one of them anymore.

313
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:31,700
Do your best to fight for what you want.

314
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,260
You two are...

315
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:54,060
An immortal in my dream said that
I had an immortal fate, and it is true.

316
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,540
Your Godship,
you've handled another matter.

317
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,980
Didn't you deliberately let Qing Yi
and the others in?

318
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:30,740
The return of Xian Shan is a joyous occasion.

319
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,340
If I had stopped them,

320
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,900
they would have known that you already
knew about this matter.

321
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:40,540
However, knowing it is one thing,

322
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:45,380
witnessing it is another.

323
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:52,420
It was so delightful to meet Xian Shan today.

324
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:57,380
Everyone from Daze Mountain has returned,

325
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:00,300
but you are...

326
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:01,380
How wonderful.

327
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,020
It's what I wished for, and it's worthwhile.

328
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:15,340
- Your Godship!
- Master!

329
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,460
Your Godship!

330
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,100
- Master!
- Your Godship!

331
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,100
Only Xian Zhu's not been found yet,

332
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,100
and there's no record of him at all.

333
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,300
We don't even know which direction
we should go.

334
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:35,060
Xian Zhu was once punished
on the Qinglong Platform

335
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:39,220
and had fluctuations in his immortal spirit,
almost not being rescued.

336
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,580
Could this be the reason?

337
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,340
The Qinglong Platform?

338
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:46,580
Do you know where those punished
immortals would go after experiencing

339
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,780
tribulations in the Mortal Realm?

340
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,780
The Qinglong Platform.

341
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,460
The Qinglong Platform?

342
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,700
Yuan Qi told you that a thousand years ago?

343
00:31:58,500 --> 00:31:59,340
That's weird.

344
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,300
It seems like he knew that this day
would come a thousand years ago.

345
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:05,860
He told me to go out for trial, and
the timing of my return was just right.

346
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:07,740
It's as if he predicted that

347
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:10,220
I would become the Chief
of Daze Mountain at this moment

348
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:12,380
and lead all the disciples back.

349
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,980
I asked Yun Qing and Qing Yun.

350
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,980
They were led by an immortal in their dreams

351
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,740
and entered the Immortal Realm.

352
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,460
Master also mentioned this.

353
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:25,500
But unfortunately, they forgot
the appearance of that immortal.

354
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:28,500
I'm thinking it might be His Godship.

355
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,500
It doesn't matter.

356
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:34,540
Once we find Xian Zhu,
everything will settle down.

357
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:58,500
I've long been displeased with this
Qinglong Platform.

358
00:32:58,820 --> 00:33:00,860
Today, I will set it on fire and burn it down.

359
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,020
Xian Zhu.

360
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,820
Stop!

361
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,780
Greetings, Your Majesty.

362
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:19,100
Sorry about that. Let me handle this.

363
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:30,940
Who are you? What are you doing?

364
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:32,700
The Qinglong Platform was forged
from divine stones.

365
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,940
With your mere few hundred years
of cultivation, trying to destroy it

366
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,780
will only result in injuring yourself.

367
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,860
Why do you sound just like
that immortal in my dream?

368
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,420
It seems I have to find a proper master
for cultivating

369
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,260
to fulfill my wish one day.

370
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:53,460
The immortal in your dream led you
into the path of immortality?

371
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:55,940
He seemed suspicious,

372
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,980
but I felt close to him.

373
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,340
He used magic to make me forget him.

374
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:04,780
Fortunately, I drew his portrait in advance.

375
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,580
I planned to investigate him
when I had the chance.

376
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:11,700
It's him.

377
00:34:22,740 --> 00:34:23,900
It's really His Godship.

378
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,340
That means he found the members
of Daze Mountain one by one

379
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,500
during their tribulations and guided them
into the Immortal Realm.

380
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,300
(He knew that the disciples of Daze Mountain
would regain their vitality.)

381
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:37,420
(But why didn't he tell anybody about it?)

382
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,280
(And why did he let us take the tablet)

383
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:42,820
(and come here to find him now?)

384
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,820
Qing Yi, I'll leave Xian Zhu to you now.

385
00:34:53,740 --> 00:34:55,500

Since you returned from Nirvana,
His Godship has been holding on like this.

394
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:10,420
Now, his god spirit is exhausted
and his physical form is dissipating.

395
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:13,900
He barely maintains his existence using
the chaotic power of the Spirit Sword.

When His Godship first became a god,
he used nine-tenths of his god spirit

406
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:50,460

Although the formation is complete,

426
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,620
nourishing the mountain with god spirit
still requires a thousand years.

427
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,180
During this time, no accidents can occur.

428
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,020
- Master!
- Your Godship!

429
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,340
This is my greatest sin.

430
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:06,700
The things I did led to the destruction
of Daze Mountain.

431
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:10,220
Yet, he sacrificed himself
to bring everyone back,

432
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:12,380
redeeming my mistakes.

433
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,300
When Daze Mountain is revived,

434
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,660
Yin will return to the Three Realms.

435
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:29,380
So, he had planned it all.

436
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:33,340
At that time, the devils were causing chaos,

437
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:35,780
and you became
the target of public criticism.

438
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,860
His Godship was afraid that he might
not be able to protect you,

439
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,580
so he ordered to put you under restriction.

440
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:45,420
From today, Yin will be confined
to the Hall of Arms.

441
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:48,660
She's confined to Qingchi Palace

442
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,540
until Daze Mountain sees a day of rebirth.

443
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,540
(Hall of Arms)
It's better to let her be disappointed in me

444
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:01,060
rather than letting her be disappointed
in the Three Realms.

445
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:05,700
Moreover, even if I want to protect her,

446
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:09,500
how long can I do that?

447
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,620
I did regret it once.

448
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:19,820
She was just a Water Divine Beast
born against fate.

449
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:25,180
If it weren't for me accidentally
hatching her in the Forbidden Valley,

450
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,380
she shouldn't have faced all of this.

451
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:32,340
It's better to let her forget everything
and go to Qingchi Palace,

452
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:35,180
where my mother has set up
a protective formation,

453
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,740
and with your care, she will surely be safe.

454
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:45,580
People think she's my calamity,
but perhaps, I am hers.

455
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,980
Let her forget me and start anew.

456
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,380
Right now, I just want her to live well.

457
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,220
Nothing else is important.

458
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:04,620
He never intended to permanently
confine me here.

459
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,300
Things are unpredictable.

460
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,140
Unexpectedly, you entered the Ghost Land
for His Godship.

461
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:17,980
At that time, his god power was already
difficult to sustain.

462
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,500
If he couldn't make both sides withdraw,

463
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,420
the consequences would be unimaginable,

464
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,990
and it would be even more difficult
to protect you.

465
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,860
With Yin's current immortal power,

466
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:34,300
whether or not she harbors devil energy,
she will dissipate under the Heavenly Thunder.

467

468
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:38,220

punishment to prove my innocence.

leading to the tragedy in Ghost Land.
It's my fault.

I had no idea how tormented he was.

I made him watch me perish,

478
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:22,420
left him alone for a thousand years.

479
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:27,140
