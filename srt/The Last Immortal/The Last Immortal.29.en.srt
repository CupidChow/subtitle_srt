=Episode 29=

29
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,860
Your Ladyship is back.

30
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,630
About Ling Feng,
I feel I'm responsible.

31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,990
For the bother it caused,

32
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,070
I apologize to you.

33
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:03,300
But you shouldn't have hurt him.

34
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,020
Our honor is hurt
now that word has gotten out.

35
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,740
So, Chief Feng, you're here
to condemn me.

36
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,620
Your Ladyship is noble, free and easy.

37
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,580
And I know you always do what you like.

38
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,980
But as the chief of the Phoenix Clan,

39
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:24,390
I must consider all matters
related to the Phoenix Clan.

40
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,740
Networking among the immortal sects

41
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,800
has never been
based on personal preference.

42
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,860
What are you trying to say?

43
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,740
Now that your marriage with
His Godship Yuan Qi is impossible,

44
00:02:35,030 --> 00:02:37,550
they're all asking me about proposing.

45
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,460
Recently, many first-class sects
came to propose.

46
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:43,180
Shouldn't Your Ladyship meet them?

47
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,780
And, immortal sects have always used
marriages to maintain their prestige.

48
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:52,990
At this time, you should give
more thought to our clan.

49
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:56,620
You accepted Qingchi Palace's proposal
without my permission.

50
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,430
Now you're so eager
to find me another husband.

51
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,340
Do you want so much for me to go?

52
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:02,800
I'm doing this for our...

53
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,900
Don't say it's for our clan.

54
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:07,670
The honor of the Phoenix Clan is
earned by the strength of our clansmen,

55
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,060
not by all this convoluted networking.

56
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:13,920
Chief Feng,

57
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,060
my marriage is not a tool for you to
cozy up to other immortal sects.

58
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,340
Be it first class, second class,
or last class,

59
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:28,150
no one can tell me whom I like
and to choose.

60
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,780
I'm not interested in getting married.

61
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,800
But if you're interested, you go.

62
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,620
(Fengyi Palace)

63
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,950
It's been a long time, and your temper
is getting hotter and hotter, girl.

64
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,900
It's you.

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,340
You know me?

66
00:04:02,030 --> 00:04:03,860
There's a part of her in your body.

67
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,430
Mr. Wu Gui.

68
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:17,580
I'd like to sneak over to see my brother,
the ancestral tree.

69
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:20,950
Well, I ran into your encounter with
Ling Feng and Yuan Qi.

70
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,390
Their love was too much

71
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,270
for me to handle, so I had to decline.

72
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:27,750
We haven't met for years.

73
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,630
You're just as sharp-tongued
as you were back then.

74
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,870
I remember you and Yuan Qi...

75
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:35,710
Feng Yin.

76
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,390
Mr. Wu Gui.

77
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,750
How did you know
the Thunder Fire Talisman?

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,580
Mr. Wu Gui,

79
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,350
how did you...

80
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,320
Your Godship.

81
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:54,780
I made it very clear just now.

82
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,190
Leave quickly.

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,660
Sir, you're a rare guest. Let's go talk.

84
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,110
Please.

85
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:18,390
(When did she become friends
with Mr. Wu Gui?)

86
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:21,780
I'm glad you were reborn.

87
00:05:22,870 --> 00:05:25,830
Back then, you went to Jingyou Valley
with Yuan Qi to convince me

88
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,710
to return Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

89
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,580
Feng Chi's wish has finally come true.

90
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:33,980
Now you've returned
as the second Phoenix Queen.

91
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:38,100
This also means the end of the destiny
that one Fire Phoenix has to die

92
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,830
before another rises.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,460
So when Yin was at Jingyou Valley,
you knew

94
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,780
I had a portion of immortal spirit
in that Water Divine Beast.

95
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:54,270
Exactly.

96
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,710
I'd used my tree core to nourish
a portion of your immortal spirit.

97
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,900
Naturally, I could feel it.

98
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,780
But I couldn't tell you.

99
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,710
Or, the life chance Yuan Qi had gained
with a tribulation would be gone.

100
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:12,830
I didn't know Yin was a tribulation
for him and Daze Mountain.

101
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,020
Is that why you act like a stranger
to Yuan Qi?

102
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,020
Why should I tell him who I am?

103
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,900
Yin and I are two different individuals.

104
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,420
But you remember everything about Yin.

105
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:34,870
Furthermore, the portion of immortal spirit
in you determines your character.

106
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,020
You are Yin.

107
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,710
No matter how many lives
you've lived, you're still her.

108
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,320
It's been too long. I forgot.

109
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,870
You can't just forget the love
you had at the time.

110
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,930
You just don't want to admit it.

111
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:56,020
That's why you want him
to stay away from you.

112
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,950
It's not love, sir.

113
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,750
Yuan Qi broke up with me
and forgot me.

114
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:07,420
Now I'm the Phoenix Queen.
I can't be weaker than him.

115
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,460
As to who's in love and who's in debt,

116
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:15,150
I don't want anything to do with it.

117
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,150
Whatever you say.

118
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:25,950
It's time for me to go.

119
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,710
Feng Chi always wanted to see
the wonders of the world.

120
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,310
I'm going to take a look for her.

121
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:37,340
I hope you've really let go
next time we meet.

122
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,420
This soup is a bit too sweet today.

123
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,110
The servant

124
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:58,580
(Feng Ge, Maid of the Phoenix Clan)
Her Majesty brought here made the soup.

125
00:07:58,830 --> 00:07:59,900
Now that he's gone,

126
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,630
we're still trying to figure out
Your Ladyship's preferences.

127
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,750
I'll go to the kitchen
and make another bowl.

128
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,950
Don't bother, this is alright.

129
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
Yes.

130
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:11,030
By the way,

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,750
I'm going to be late for bed today.

132
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,270
There are still
a lot of documents to read.

133
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,340
Get me some refreshing incense.

134
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,150
Your Ladyship's favorite incense was
also made by the departed servant.

135
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,420
We don't know if we can make it.

136
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:47,180
Find a way to keep you alive.

137
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,510
Good luck.

138
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,100
If you make wishes
when you see the meteor,

139
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,630
your wishes will come true.

140
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
Well, I wish we could win the wager

141
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,230
and get the clan emblem
in the gambling house tomorrow.

142
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,750
Yu, it records that

143
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,390
the water of Xuan Lake can nourish
your spiritual power.

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,420
You'll hatch soon enough.

145
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:36,180
From now on, stay out of the dispute
between the immortals and demons.

146
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:40,470
Stay at Qingchi Palace.

147
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,150
Your Godship, I beg you.

148
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:49,260
- The decision has been made.
- I beg you.

149
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,230
Please...

150
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,820
No!

151
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:02,620
(Fengyi Palace)

152
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:14,300
(Blessed Cave)

153
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,590
You're so cheap.

154
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:42,200
Who are you?

155
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,150
Where are you from?

156
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:45,940
I'm the owner here.

157
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,390
The owner?

158
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,470
Miss, do you want an iced fruit?

159
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,230
Miss, your hand is injured.

160
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,280
No harm done.

161
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,840
Why is this place...

162
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,510
You're a Water Divine Beast.

163
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,730
- Yuan Qi.
- Yu.

164
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,630
Yuan Qi.

165
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
What happened?

166
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,420
What brings Your Ladyship here
at Ningyun Mountain?

167
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,750
She's Yu?

168
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:54,630
She's the Water Divine Beast?

169
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,590
A thousand years ago, the mountain
was destroyed, along with the Xuan Lake.

170
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:06,590
How did the Water Divine Beast egg
hatch and take the human form?

171
00:12:12,790 --> 00:12:13,630
Your Ladyship,

172
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,980
why do you know Yu on your first trip
to the Immortal Realm?

173
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,200
I don't know her.

174
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:22,940
I'm just curious.

175
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,940
Why is there demon energy here?

176
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,180
It's not the first time, is it?

177
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,510
No, but it's not a demon.

178
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,820
It's an immortal disguised as a demon.

179
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:43,020
So there are still a lot of traces left.

180
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:49,940
The immortal energy has indeed
left its mark.

181
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,110
I can't tell which clan it's from
due to the demon poison.

182
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:58,480
I remember Fu Chen has
a tracking device to amplify the power.

183
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,470
I can go to him and ask him
to find out what happened.

184
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:01,310
Fuchen Sword?

185
00:13:01,310 --> 00:13:02,150
That's right.

186
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,390
Why do you know so much about
the weapons of Hall of Arms as well?

187
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:13,870
I read some canonical books
when I was bored.

188
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,110
I kind of like this Water Divine Beast.

189
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,020
Would you like to come with me
to Wutong Island?

190
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,700
Sure. I like you too.

191
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,940
Let me go, Yuan Qi.

192
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:35,150
She just saved me. Please.

193
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:37,630
Can I go?

194
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,980
(Hall of Arms)

195
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,540
Master, I don't even know you
anymore.

196
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,990
A god following and spying on a girl...

197
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:39,670
She went straight to the Hall of Arms
in the Heavenly Palace

198
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:40,700
without a single detour.

199
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,540
She knows here well.

200
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,870
Gourd, where's Fu Chen?

201
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,820
Why did you sneak up on me?

202
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,390
Because I'm looking for confirmation.

203
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:11,870
I want to know why you know so much
about everything here.

204
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:13,590
What do you think is the reason?

205
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,590
It seems that ever since I used
your original Thunder Fire Talisman,

206
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:19,420
you've got a lot more curious about me.

207
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,800
Right.

208
00:15:21,790 --> 00:15:25,020
Because I don't know except for her,

209
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,540
who else would know
the Thunder Fire Talisman,

210
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,700
care so much about a Water Divine Beast,

211
00:15:33,790 --> 00:15:35,590
and know so much about the weapons
of the Hall of Arms.

212
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:37,630
Her?

213
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:43,780
Are you referring to the Water Divine Beast
that you've missed for a thousand years?

214
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,990
Did I remind you of an old friend?

215
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,870
Don't you think that's offensive to me?

216
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:57,420
Let me tell you once more.

217
00:15:58,430 --> 00:16:00,323
Before I was reborn,
I was traveling in the Immortal Realm

218
00:16:00,347 --> 00:16:02,420
and I'm familiar with all of it.

219
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,870
It's not surprising, is it?

220
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,230
I'm not interested in being

221
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,750
a reminiscing tool for you.

222
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,510
Just to remind you.
The Water Divine Beast is dead and gone.

223
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:18,350
Whether you feel guilty or regret,

224
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,700
it doesn't mean anything to her.

225
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,150
Why don't you just let it go and move on?

226
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I didn't know Lady Feng Yin
could be so sarcastic.

227
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,230
But I like it.

228
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,870
If you like me,

229
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,420
can you do me a favor, Lord Fu Chen?

230
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,750
Girl, you're good at pushing your luck.

231
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,300
Don't even think about it.

232
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,420
Why should I help you?

233
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,660
I only believe in and admire
one person in my life.

234
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,420
It's the Water Divine Beast Yin
you're talking about.

235
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:08,390
It's a pity she's gone now.

236
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,940
She was killed by this god himself.

237
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,070
Lord Fu Chen,

238
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:23,630
this has nothing to do with him.
I'm asking for your help.

239
00:17:24,070 --> 00:17:27,310
If you're willing to help me, you can
ask for whatever you want.

240
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:43,000
A gift. Do you like it?

241
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:51,260
Nice wine.

242
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,620
You guys from Wutong Island
are really generous.

243
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:58,740
In that case, can we...

244
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,550
No, no, no, you can't either.

245
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:04,260
Why not?

246
00:18:05,070 --> 00:18:06,150
I've heard about it.

247
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:09,460
You two are already engaged.

248
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:11,980
If I help you, I'll feel bad about it.

249
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,870
You're not well-informed,
Lord Fu Chen.

250
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,300
I have nothing to do with him.

251
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,180
I refused his offer of marriage.

252
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,660
It's true.

253
00:18:29,070 --> 00:18:30,630
Nice work.

254
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,030
You're a very interesting Fire Phoenix.

255
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,790
But that's gonna make things
very difficult for me.

256
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,500
I'll give you a chance.

257
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:50,900
If you can win a fight with me,
you can do what you want.

258
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,390
If I beat you, will you recognize me
as your master as well?

259
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,630
If you win, I'll recognize you
as my master.

260
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:02,740
But first, you have to be able to win.

261
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,870
I won. Remember your promise.

262
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,260
I lost.

263
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,550
You're too strong. I can't beat you.

264
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,390
I'll honor my promise.

265
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,110
From now on, you're my master.

266
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,270
(Gallant and Formidable)

267
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,740
I'm at your service.

268
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,700
It's the colorful silk of
the Phoenix Clan.

269
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,220
But the colorful silk has been kept
by Feng Ming.

270
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,320
Feng Ming?

271
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:36,070
He said once that someone was trying to
destroy my body by attacking the Pagoda.

272
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:39,070
But the Soul Suppressing Pagoda
is also in his hands.

273
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:43,530
If that's the case, it's really interesting.

274
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:47,160
As far as I know, any senior immortal
from the Phoenix Clan

275
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,660
can use this weapon.

276
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:50,680
As for whether it is Feng Ming,

277
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,790
maybe we'll have to wait for Fu Chen
to track him down.

278
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,220
The man who attacked Yu earlier
was wounded in the arm by me.

279
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
As long as Fu Chen can track this man,
we'll identify him.

280
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,660
How dare you, Feng Ming,
to increase your power

281
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,660
by secretly refining the demon core
and practicing the forbidden arts?

282
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,500
You really disappointed me.

283
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,390
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
I know it's wrong.

284
00:22:04,550 --> 00:22:06,940
There's been a lot of friction between
immortals and demons over the years.

285
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,030
That's why I captured those demons.

286
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,910
I was confused for a moment.

287
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:13,870
I won't do it again.

288
00:22:14,030 --> 00:22:14,870
That's ridiculous.

289
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:19,820
Demon provocation should be dealt with
by the rules of the two realms.

290
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,990
You executed them on your own.

291
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,830
And now you're still justifying yourself.

292
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,350
Your Ladyship,

293
00:22:26,790 --> 00:22:30,870
you were born with extraordinary power.

294
00:22:31,790 --> 00:22:34,830
How can you understand the hardship
of cultivation like us mediocre people?

295
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:38,060
Yes, I did consume those demons' power.

296
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:41,830
But I just want to be strong enough
to protect the immortals

297
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,960
and the Phoenix Clan!

298
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:46,390
You spread the demon poison
on Ningyun Mountain

299
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,220
and tried secretly to hunt the core of
the Water Divine Beast, Yu.

300
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:54,030
Is this what you call protecting
the immortals and us?

301
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,030
I can't believe this is happening.

302
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,430
No, I didn't.

303
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:58,720
Your Ladyship,

304
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,350
are you trying to pin everything on me?

305
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,630
The immortals know

306
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,350
Ningyun Mountain has long been
a barren and scorched landscape.

307
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,570
Water Divine Beast?
Why would I want to hunt something

308
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:11,980
that doesn't even exist?

309
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,070
Your Ladyship, don't frame it against me.

310
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,150
We'll know if it's a frame-up.

311
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,964
As expected, that's the wound
by the Spirit Sword.

312
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,900
What else are you going to say?

313
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,630
Only a few know that we have kept
the last Water Divine Beast

314
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:36,240
at Qingchi Palace
in the past thousand years.

315
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,310
And you're one of them.

316
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:47,900
Your Godship is indeed intelligent.

317
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,420
How funny.

318
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,790
After all these years,

319
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:58,180
no matter how hard I tried,
I still lost to you

320
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:01,220
and

321
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,070
all who are born royal

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,110
and immortal.

323
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:17,590
Feng Ming, there is nothing wrong
with desiring power.

324
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:23,420
But the only way to get it is
to be honest.

325
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:27,940
You've been defending yourself
with no remorse.

326
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:32,830
If we don't punish you today, it'll be a
great violation of our clan rules,

327
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:36,150
and a challenge to keep peace
in the Immortal Realm.

328
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:52,960
Give it to me.

329
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,440
Feng Ming has now been removed
from the list of senior immortals

330
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,110
and put into the Heavenly Prison.

331
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,980
But I don't think it's that simple.

332
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,940
He may be involved in something that
happened a thousand years ago.

333
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:05,630
But now he won't answer any questions.

334
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,900
You don't have to...

335
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:08,980
Give it to me.

336
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:11,260
mention the past to me.

337
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,320
By the way,

338
00:25:15,550 --> 00:25:19,500
I'll tell the Three Realms that
I've taken Yu as my sister.

339
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,830
Wutong Island will always protect her.

340
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:22,830
Give it to me.

341
00:25:22,830 --> 00:25:25,390
Yu also said she wanted to stay
on Wutong Island.

342
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,150
I didn't tell you earlier

343
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:30,870
because I think this is a private matter
between me and Yu.

344
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:32,940
There's no need to tell you.

345
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:38,350
Yu seems to have
a natural affinity for you.

346
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,350
It's a good thing you're willing to
shelter her like family.

347
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,630
I am. You don't have to worry about it.

348
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,830
- Master.
- Yuan Qi, Feng Yin.

349
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:52,950
Your Ladyship.

350
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,070
Well, goodbye, then.

351
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:00,630
Yu, I'll take you to a fun place.

352
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:01,760
Oh, good.

353
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,720
Don't you want your fruit?

354
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:08,980
What fruit?

355
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,700
Iced fruit. It's super, super delicious.

356
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:14,180
Let's go. We've been given
an eviction order.

357
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:15,910
Just like that?

358
00:26:16,510 --> 00:26:19,840
So have you dispelled your suspicion
about Lady Feng Yin?

359
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,660
The elders say you asked for all the files
Feng Ming has handled over the years.

360
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,420
Do you think something's wrong
with him?

361
00:27:06,030 --> 00:27:06,870
No.

362
00:27:07,550 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm just organizing the affairs
of the clan.

363
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:13,790
You refused to be the Phoenix Queen
in the first place.

364
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:17,940
Now you take things more seriously
than anyone else.

365
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,110
Take it.

366
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,580
(Fengyi Palace)

367
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,050
Master, I was...

368
00:27:39,050 --> 00:27:42,180
That was your succession ceremony.

369
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:45,870
From now on, you are the Phoenix Queen.

370
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:48,150
Don't joke on me, Master.

371
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:49,660
Succession ceremony?

372
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,350
No more nonsense.

373
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,550
You've already traveled around the world.

374
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,070
There are eight sufferings of life.

375
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,350
I'm sure you've been through each
so many times over the millennia.

376
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,260
- But...
- In a fair competition,

377
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,310
no one will stand as a rival to you.

378
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:07,260
If you don't take the throne, who will?

379
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,500
Feng Yin, as you have seen,

380
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:11,750
(Fengyi Palace)

381
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:18,260
the Heavenly Palace doesn't act in
a fair and just manner as you wish.

382
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,830
I know you don't like the way

383
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,590
immortals oppress the weak
by their ranks.

384
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,350
It's easier to get away from it all.

385
00:28:31,550 --> 00:28:34,310
But what about the weak and those
who can't defend themselves?

386
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,460
They can't get away from it.

387
00:28:38,350 --> 00:28:42,180
I know you'd never sit on your hands
and do nothing.

388
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:47,420
Instead of saving them every time,
why don't you get involved?

389
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:54,070
Because you have the power
to change it all.

390
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,900
What you said is very true, Master.

391
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,830
The Phoenix Queen's throne,

392
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:09,190
I'll take it.

393
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,940
Your Majesty.

394
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:32,110
Stupid boy, I'll get you
if you break my globes.

395
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,800
It's been a stalemate for a long time.

396
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:47,550
You can't win.

397
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:51,150
It's not the right time yet.

398
00:31:01,550 --> 00:31:06,660
You... you devour your own kind.
You are not our king.

399
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,460
So noisy.

400
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,800
The Devil God.

401
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,310
Your Lordship.

402
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:45,150
You didn't let me down.

403
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,030
It took you so little time to relinquish
the immortal spirit.

404
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:51,420
Thanks to the devil skill you taught me

405
00:31:51,830 --> 00:31:54,350
and the trace of true devil energy
in my body,

406
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,110
I could be able to recover it so quickly.

407
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,150
Though Qing Lin is not of much use,

408
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:04,460
she gave you her true devil energy
so that you could find me.

409
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,830
It's kind of smart.

410
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,870
I'll try harder than Qing Lin

411
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,740
to serve you.

412
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,870
Very good.

413
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:18,740
Any progress in what I asked you to do?

414
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,080
Not yet.

415
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,110
But please don't worry, Your Lordship.

416
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,790
I'll do my best to fulfill it.

417
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:28,220
Hua Mo,

418
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,500
don't make me wait too long.

419
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:06,660
I've found the brother of Yan Si,
the servant who switched the Arrow.

420
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:11,220
He said Yan Si didn't show any signs of
devil cultivation before the incident.

421
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,390
It's just that after they began to cast
the Energy Protection Arrow,

422
00:33:14,390 --> 00:33:17,740
Yan Si suddenly received
a lot of precious elixirs.

423
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,030
Looks like Yan Si was really
bought off back then.

424
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:25,500
After the incident was exposed, he was
made to look like a devil cultivator

425
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,340
and took the blame.

426
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:31,350
Now the person behind it
has gotten away.

427
00:33:31,790 --> 00:33:36,570
If an immortal is still hiding in
our realm and in league with the devils,

428
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,830
isn't that dangerous?

429
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:46,640
Feng Ming was the one
who caught Yan Si.

430
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,590
Feng Ming, what happened?

431
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,990
When I was patrolling here,
I saw this man doing devil cultivation.

432
00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:53,470
I fought him, then.

433
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,870
Unexpectedly, he scattered
some explosive powder.

434
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,430
Yan Si.

435
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:05,460
He was part of the team that sent
the Arrow to the Heavenly Palace.

436
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,320
My duty is to guard the Secret Storeroom
and I have no authority to enter.

437
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,380
So I'll wait outside for you two.

438
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:13,630
I'm afraid this is...

439
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,340
I'm going to the Heavenly Prison.

440
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,240
Release me!

441
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,260
Release me!

442
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:30,220
Release me!

443
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:36,660
Your Majesty, are you also here
to question Feng Ming?

444
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:37,550
What a coincidence.

445
00:34:42,630 --> 00:34:43,820
Did you get any answer?

446
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,780
Feng Ming said he didn't touch
the Energy Protection Arrow,

447
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,150
or enter the Secret Storeroom.
He didn't capture Yan Si alive

448
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,430
due to a small lapse.

449
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,150
But it's not that simple.

450
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,590
There's more to this incident.

451
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:00,760
That's true.

452
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,300
But there's something else
I don't understand.

453
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,260
You have just returned.

454
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,550
Why do you know so many details?

455
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,660
I guess that's something
you can't read in the records.

456
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:23,780
I don't need to explain it to you, do I?

457
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,470
Feng Ming is from Wutong Island.

458
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,910
What's wrong with trying to find out
the truth about what happened?

459
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,070
But I'm sure it's nothing to do with
that Water Divine Beast.

460
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:41,910
I've learned about your affair with it
in the clan records.

461
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:48,820
She should be grateful to be
Your Godship's fellow disciple.

462
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,340
How dare she try to win your love?

463
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,180
She forgot what she was. How ridiculous.

464
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,630
Your Majesty, I'm the one who caused you
to lose your immortal spirit.

465
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,950
I'm also the one who damaged
Wutong Island's reputation.

466
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,060
If you have any grievances,
just direct them to me.

467
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:13,030
Even if you're not related to Yin,
you shouldn't taunt her like this.

468
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,780
I didn't realize that you would be
so protective of Yin.

469
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:24,430
If you're so protective,
where were you back then?

470
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:29,220
What are you trying to prove with
this deep affection?

471
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:46,430
(I thought if Yin's death could bring
peace to the immortals and demons,)

472
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,110
(it would be worth it.)

473
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,070
(But it was all for nothing.)

474
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:58,340
(We haven't found the devil hiding
among the immortals yet.)

475
00:37:00,030 --> 00:37:04,030
(The senior brothers from Daze Mountain
and all the fellow disciples)

476
00:37:05,550 --> 00:37:06,990
(cannot die for nothing.)

477
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:12,030
(Who was it that slaughtered
Daze Mountain?)

478
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:16,030
(How much exactly was Feng Ming
involved in?)

479
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,110
(So many truths are still buried away.)

480
00:37:22,710 --> 00:37:24,740
(How can I put Yin's memories behind)

481
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:28,590
(and live only as Feng Yin?)

482
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,470
You... You're Yin?

483
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:45,220
It's been a long time.

484
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,070
You really are Yin.

485
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,700
I knew my Yin wouldn't die.
How could she?

486
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:57,860
Yin isn't dead.

487
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,700
She's still alive.

488
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:01,590
You're still alive.

489
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,700
You're the Phoenix Queen.

490
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:10,820
I was fooled by you.

491
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,460
When I recognized you as my master,

492
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:16,180
I felt guilty about Yin.

493
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,990
You're so bad.

494
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,700
You didn't even tell me you were back.

495
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,660
Am I still your friend?

496
00:38:27,510 --> 00:38:29,150
Of course, you are.

497
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:35,220
I don't know if I could face my friends

498
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,260
and the past as Yin.

499
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,180
Well, do you have an answer now?

500
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,200
Yes.

501
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,780
I got it just now.

502
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,180
I thought a Water Divine Beast's death
was nothing.

503
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:50,910
It's just one life among many.

504
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,700
But what Yin died for
didn't happen after all.

505
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,110
The Three Realms have not become peaceful.

506
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:03,150
I don't want her to die for nothing.

507
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,510
I've never really let go.

508
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,700
So I can't just be Feng Yin.

509
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:17,780
I'm going to finish
what Yin hasn't finished.

510
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,430
It's so reckless of Wutong Island

511
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,660
to have put a newborn phoenix
on the throne.

512
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:30,830
Your Majesty has been practicing hard
for a thousand years,

513
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:35,100
not to mention
His Majesty Lan Feng's life,

514
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,590
to barely be able to get the position of
the Acting Heavenly Empress.

515
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:40,340
And she just slept for a thousand years.

516
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,630
How could she wake up
and take the throne?

517
00:39:44,110 --> 00:39:45,070
Don't worry, Your Majesty.

518
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:47,820
She's just the Queen of the Phoenix Clan.

519
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:50,830
(Shui Min, Fairy)
How can she compare to your position?

520
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:55,950
I won't allow a little girl with no feats
or foundation to overpower me.

521
00:39:57,630 --> 00:40:00,300
Have you done the thing
I asked you to do?

522
00:40:01,110 --> 00:40:03,950
Yes, Your Majesty,
everything has been arranged.

523
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:10,030
All of you are in my inner circle.

524
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:13,990
I have called you here today
on a matter of great importance.

525
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:24,978
It is well known in the Three Realms

526
00:40:25,002 --> 00:40:27,430
that God Yuan Qi has always had a crush
on Her Majesty Hua Shu.

527
00:40:28,110 --> 00:40:33,610
It was only for the sake of His Majesty
Lan Feng that they didn't get married.

528
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:34,820
It's a shame.

529
00:40:35,510 --> 00:40:38,830
Why don't we make it happen

530
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:42,380
at His Godship's birthday banquet
with all the immortal guests present?

531
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:43,760
What do you say?

532
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,830
If their marriage receives
heavenly blessings,

533
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:50,660
all guests will witness the reunion of
Her Majesty and God Yuan Qi,

534
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:53,650
and the Peacock Totem illuminated by
starlight will be shown in the sky

535
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:57,380
when mermaids sing the prophecy of
their blessing of all beings.

536
00:40:57,380 --> 00:41:01,550
I'm sure everyone in the Three Realms
will strongly support this marriage.

537
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,150
Yuan Qi's birthday banquet?

538
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,390
Right.

539
00:41:11,590 --> 00:41:14,910
It's his 1,200-year-old birthday.

540
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,780
Now the Peacock Princess Hua Shu
is in charge of the Heavenly Palace.

541
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,300
She's determined to hold a grand
birthday banquet

542
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,150
to show the immortals' respect
for God Yuan Qi.

543
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:28,990
Each immortal sect has received
the invitation.

544
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:30,590
Hua Shu organized it?

545
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,120
Yes.

546
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:35,700
It's just an inconsequential banquet.

547
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,590
Send anyone you want.

548
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,100
I'm going to the Nether Realm.

549
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:39,940
Yes.

550
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:44,700
The Nether Realm?

551
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,380
(Lustrous Moon)

552
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:50,510
You don't think Feng Yin is Yin,
do you?

553
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,320
You're crazy.

554
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:54,950
One is the Fire Phoenix and
the other is a Water Divine Beast.

555
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,590
Feng Yin went to the Nether Realm.

556
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:20,420
(Cijian Pavilion)

557
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:23,800
Hurry up!

558
00:42:24,110 --> 00:42:24,950
Coming.

559
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,070
Come on, let's go.

560
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,220
Wait for me.

561
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:39,800
Go, go, go!

562
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,660
I didn't know the Nether Realm would be
quite different from what I imagined.

563
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:49,470
Get me and I'll give it to you.

564
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,660
- Run.
- Faster.

565
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:01,100

568
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:19,220
It seems that you three
traveled a long way here.

569
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:21,430
It's the first time you've come
to the Nether Realm, isn't it?

570
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:23,970
How much for the tablets
of your Xiuyan Tower?

571
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:24,950
Give me a price.

572
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:28,940
We want the kind that allows us
to meet with the Nether King the quickest.

573
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,420
Just give us a price. He's rich.

574
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:47,300
You don't look familiar.

575
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,650
It must be your first time here.

576
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:51,110
This place is called Xiuyan Tower.

577
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:55,180
It takes a lot of spiritual ornaments for
a tablet to meet with the Nether King.

578
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,630
The rules have not changed at all.

579
00:44:02,590 --> 00:44:04,180
I wonder if these beads

580
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:09,550
are enough to have a cup of tea with
the master of Xiuyan Tower.

581
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,820
Why do I feel this person's
immortal spirit so familiar?

582
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:32,700
It's the Phoenix Queen of Wutong Island.

583
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:35,470
I'm sorry for the ill manners.

584
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,820
My immortal spirit lodged in
the parasol tree here for many years.

585
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:43,590
You and I go way back.

586
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,260
