Devil God, remember we had a bet?

123
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,300
You said the will of Heaven
couldn't be disobeyed,

124
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,510
and that no one could stop you from
getting out and unifying the Three Realms.

125
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:35,940
But you failed in the end.

126
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,540
You also said Yuan Qi couldn't
avoid his tribulation or change his fate.

127
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:42,390
But when he saved Feng Yin
with his god spirit a thousand years ago,

128
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,750
he already set the stage for a turnaround.

129
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,590
You lost the both bets.

130
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:55,140
I didn't expect that
after your internal core was regathered,

131
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:58,630
you not only recovered your power
but also became more full-fledged.

132
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,000
You came here to mock me on purpose.

133
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,230
Devil God, you are mistaken.

134
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,700
I came this time hoping
that you can honor your bets.

135
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,300
What do you want?

136
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:14,420
I want you to save Yuan Qi.

137
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:26,350
Don't you remember who used
his god power to seal me down here again?

138
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:31,750
The God of Chaos
is a sworn enemy of mine.

139
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:38,110
I can't wait to see him die.
How could I save him?

140
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,110
I know you tend
to leave everything up to fate.

141
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,110
You think devils were born
to go against all beings

142
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,540
and be unaccepted by the entire world.

143
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,900
But you forgot

144
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,390
that devils were also created by
the Ancestral God with the power of chaos.

145
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,350
Since all beings are equal,

146
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,660
devils should also be treated with equality.

147
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,590
You leave all your choices up to fate.

148
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,870
But the facts showed us
that fate can be changed.

149
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,990
One Fire Phoenix dies, another will revive.

150
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:08,270
But Feng Chi sacrificed her own life

151
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,780
for a better future of the Fire Phoenix Clan.

152
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:15,350
Feng Yin was destined
to separate from her lover forever.

153
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:20,180
But after she died, she came back to life
as Yin and continued to be with Yuan Qi.

154
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,420
Although Yuan Qi's Chaos Origin is gone,

155
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:27,470
as long as you are willing to help,
he can still come back.

156
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,300
And it'll prove us once more
that fate can be changed.

157
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,890
It's all about how you choose.

158
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:42,110
Even if Yuan Qi's fate can be changed,
what's in that for me?

159
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:46,590
True Goddess Yi He is also
waiting for your help.

160
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:29,150
Your Majesty, His Godship is gone.

161
00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:32,830
Hong Chou and I need to go back
to the God Realm now.

162
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:36,590
Please take good care. Sorry for your loss.

163
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,580
You are also leaving.

164
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:43,020
Destiny comes and goes.
Everything will come to an end.

165
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:46,500
We'll leave the Three Lower Realms
that His Godship committed his whole life

166
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,340
to protect to you now.

167
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,620

168

00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,580
I will guard them well for him.

Approved.

00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,060
to congratulate you on your enthronement.

181
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:06,020
The envoy of the Demon Realm
traveled a long way here.

182
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,020
Make sure to receive him well.

183
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,900
Yes, Your Majesty.

184
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,500
(Back then, Yin always envied immortals
for their immortality.)

185
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:22,300
(Little did she know
that a life without the beloved one)

186
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,860
(is actually the cruelest punishment
in this world.)

187
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,700
Your Majesty, the envoy of the Nether Realm
invites you to Ziyue Mountain.

188
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,420
He claims himself an old friend of yours.

189
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,100
An old friend?

190
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,620
His name is Xiu Yan.

191
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,740
The regathering of your internal core
had your demigod power recovered.

192
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:58,820
Your effort in the past
70,000 years finally paid off.

193
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,860
Why did you invite me here?

194
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:10,220
Because the only person
who can save Yuan Qi is here.

195
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,140
My old friend,

196
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,500
why don't you take this chance
to change your fate

197
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,700
and regain your freedom?

198
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:35,620
I was born to be the Devil God
against the Three Realms.

199
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,060
The Ancestral God gave me an evil nature.

200
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:47,460
If fate can really be changed,
I don't mind giving it a try.

201
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:52,340
All beings exist following the rule
of mutual promotion and restraint.

202
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,340
Yuan Qi's god spirit scattered.

203
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:59,620
Only the devil origin
can help him reshape his godhood.

204
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,540
Once his godhood is reshaped,

205
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:08,340
True Goddess Yi He can make him come back
to life with the power of chaos.

206
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,940
No wonder True Goddess Yi He
refused to save him.

207
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,100
As it turned out,
only Ming Qi can save him.

208
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:22,780
The Devil God is really willing
to save Yuan Qi?

209
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,300
My old friend.

210
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,860
Though death separated you and Yuan Qi,

211
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,980
you two are still connected somehow.

212
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:47,100
The change of fate that Xiu Yan
talked about suddenly intrigues me.

213
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,340
I don't mind giving it a try.

214
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:56,420
You once spent a life going
through a trial in the Mortal Realm.

215
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
Your spirit scattered,
and you were supposed to vanish.

216
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:06,500
But Yuan Qi transferred a part of his spirit
to you and made you reincarnate.

217
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:13,580
He didn't expect that the part of his spirit
can actually save himself as well.

218
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:57,060
I looked for the entire world,
and I couldn't find you.

219
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,900
I had no idea

220
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,220
that you've been with me for all this time.

Yuan Qi.

235
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:21,260
Yin, don't worry.

236
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,940
This is Yuan Qi's Chaos Origin. It needs to
go to the Spirit Pond for recuperation.

237
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,340
When will he come back?

238
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:37,900
The life and death of all beings
depends on destiny.

239
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,740
In the Soul-suppressing Pagoda,
there's a part of Yuan Qi's power of chaos.

240
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:02,660
If Yuan Qi comes back to life,
the Pagoda will have a reaction.

241
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:08,460
The God of Chaos was born
relying on the spirits of all beings.

242
00:25:09,260 --> 00:25:11,420
If you can take
his power of chaos in the Pagoda

243
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,140
to absorb the spiritual energy of all beings,

244
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,180
it'll help to accelerate
Yuan Qi's reincarnation.

245
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,260
As long as there's a possibility,

246
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:26,020
as long as there's a chance
that he can come back,

247
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,260
I'm willing to do anything
to make it happen.

248
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:52,380
Xiu Yan, I need you to do me a favor.

249
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

250
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,860
Rise, please.

251
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

252
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,220
(I hereby issue my decree)

253
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:53,340
(that from today on, Ao Ge, the Deity
in charge of Life, will succeed to the throne)

254
00:26:53,540 --> 00:26:55,140
(to carry forward the will
of the Ancestral God.)

255
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,060
(The Three Realms are now
in harmony and peace.)

256
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,820
(It's a blessing to us all.)

257
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,171
(Hope all fellow immortals can cherish
the blessings and protect the peace)

258
00:27:06,195 --> 00:27:07,860
(of the Three Realms together.)

259
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,460
(Ao Ge, Heavenly Emperor)

260
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,580
Greetings, Your Majesty.

261
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:34,620
(Xiu Yan, Nether King)

262
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,580
So, this is the Demon Realm.

263
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,540
- I think…
- Shh.

264
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:49,780
Lower your voice, will you?

265
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Don't blame me for not warning you.
The Immortal and Demon Realms don't get along.

266
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:57,180
Your healing power is quite rare.

267
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,980
Watch out that a demon will attack you,
take your internal core, and devour you.

268
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:01,820
Got it?

269
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,940
Just come with me.

270
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,060
Come on.

271
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:05,700
I just went there two days ago.
It's right over there.

272
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,820
- Very close.
- Right over there, right?

273
00:28:06,820 --> 00:28:07,660
Yes. Come on.

274
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,940
There's a lot of good stuff.

275
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,340
- Really?
- Have you heard

276
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,940
that an immortal married
into the rabbit burrow next door?

277
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,420
He's very handsome.

278
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:17,020
It's said that the immortal
used to be a rabbit in Heaven.

279
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,140
He came down for a trip
because he was bored.

280
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,740
He decided to get married here because
he thinks the rabbit burrow is more fun.

281
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,460
Thousands of years later, immortals
and demons finally broke down the barrier.

282
00:28:26,660 --> 00:28:29,380
We can cultivate together again.

283
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:33,260
True. We can practice cultivation
and drink together in the future.

284
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:42,500
(Immortals and demons finally bridged
their differences and got along now.)

285
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,046
(Immortals no longer need
Shape-forming Brush to disguise themselves)

286
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:47,540
(when they come to the Demon Realm.)

287
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,060
This is the harmonious aura
between immortals and demons.

288
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,700
I wish you could come back soon

289
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:37,300
to appreciate this peaceful world yourself.

290
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:40,620
Come and take a look.

291
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:43,460
Cheap floral fabric.

292
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,580
Floral fabric.

293
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,220
Sir, I'll have one.

294
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,660
- Good quality stuff.
- Take it easy.

295
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,660
Take your time.

296
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:53,380
(Time flies in the Mortal Realm,
and a lot has changed.)

297
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:58,620
(The streets and markets we once
visited together are no longer the same.)

298
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:02,220
(But the things we liked)

299
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,220
(Tavern)
(passed down from generation to generation.)

300
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,430
Miss, want some cakes?

301
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:12,780
(I learned a new recipe
for mung bean cakes from a mortal chef.)

302
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,460
(I'm looking forward to your return
so you can be my first taster.)

303
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,060
That's so pretty.

304
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:32,220
(Yin & Gu Jin)

305
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,140
- Brother, you are finally back.
- You are finally back.

306
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,980
This is the spiritual aura of reunion.

307
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:26,980
When can I enjoy the joy like that?

308
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,940
When can I stop being so lonely?

309
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,300
(A thousand years later)

310
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:54,820
Wind Lord, this is my wedding invitation.
I'll get married with the Eagle Queen.

311
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,060
Wait, I should call him Master.

312
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:07,420
Master, I'll get married with the Eagle Queen.
This is my wedding invitation.

313
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,580
I want to invite you to…

314
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:12,420
Maybe we should wait a little longer
before we send out the invitations.

315
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,700
A little longer?

316
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:17,780
But

317
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,100
we'll hold our wedding next month.

318
00:32:20,540 --> 00:32:23,940
We need to give those immortals who are
on a trial enough time to come back.

319
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:26,980
Listen. Sit down.

320
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,180
I mean we should postpone our wedding.

321
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,740
Postpone again?

322
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:34,060
We've postponed it many times.

323
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:37,300
Lian Xi's third child can walk already.

324
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,940
I don't even have one. I feel bad about it.

325
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,220
It's been a thousand years.
Are you still jealous of him?

326
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,540
Grow up already.

327
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,580
I'm not.

328
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:49,100
I'm the Demon King.
Why would I be jealous of Lian Xi?

329
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,660
I was just saying.

330
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,780
Getting married is our private matter.

331
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,020
Why do we have to compare to others?

332
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,300
Come on, don't be upset.

333
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,940
I know you are worried.

334
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:09,740
You are thinking that Yuan Qi
hasn't come back to life yet.

335
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,340
If we get married,
Feng Yin will feel lonelier.

336
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:16,700
But the thing is we don't know
when Yuan Qi can come back.

337
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,980
I can wait,

338
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,060
but your father
is too old to wait any longer.

339
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:25,060
He may not urge you,
but he's urging me every day.

340
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,620
He wants a grandchild.

341
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,980
We should consider his feelings.

342
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:40,940
As our best friend,
Feng Yin will understand

343
00:33:40,940 --> 00:33:44,580
and support us.
She will wish us all the best.

344
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,300
If you feel sorry for Yuan Qi,

345
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:53,140
when he comes back,
we can hold a banquet especially for him.

346
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,220
Come on, my queen.

347
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,220
Alright.

348
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,980
Feng Yin has been keeping
to herself these years.

349
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,500
We can take this chance
to get together with her

350
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:07,500
and have some fun.

351
00:34:08,180 --> 00:34:09,100
You are right, my queen.

352
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,500
I'll send out the invitations now.

353
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:27,500
(Beautiful Spring After the Snow)

354
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,900
So happy for them.

355
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,740
Tell me about it.

356
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,060
The first bow to Heaven and Earth.

357
00:36:46,180 --> 00:36:47,420
Yeah.

358
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,300
The second bow to parents.

359
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:58,980
Rise.

360
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,820
And the third to each other.

361
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,820
Rise.

362
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,900
Ceremony is finished.

363
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:13,420
The Phoenix Queen brought us a jar

364
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,700
of a thousand-year-old
Pear Blossom Brew she made as a gift.

365
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,860
I'll share it with all of you.

366
00:38:18,020 --> 00:38:21,180
But to make it fair,
whoever gets it first can have it.

367
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,220
Guys, make your move.

368
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:24,580
- I want it.
- It's mine.

369
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:26,340
Give me. Give me.

370
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:27,180
Give me.

371
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,860
Give me. Give me.

372
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:29,900
Bring it here. Bring it here.

373
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:30,980
It's mine.

374
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,820
It's mine. It's mine.

375
00:38:32,820 --> 00:38:33,700
Give me.

376
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:35,500
I got it. I got it.

377
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,500
Your Majesty.

378
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,900
You are the Heavenly Matchmaker now,
yet you are still ill-mannered.

379
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:54,980
I should've left you in the Nether Realm.

380
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:04,220
Demon King, Demon Queen,
congratulations.

381
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,700
Fu Chen, it's a happy day.
Why don't you

382
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,460
share the brew with everybody?

383
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:22,580
- No. I won't.
- Don't hog it.

384
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,740
I got it fair and square.

385
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:29,060
Fu Chen, I haven't seen you for long,
and you are still a drunkard.

386
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,460
Guys, let's share the brew.

387
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,500
Yu, come on.

388
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:43,380
Spirit Sword, you are back.

389
00:40:46,180 --> 00:40:47,940
So, Yuan Qi is also back, right?

390
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,460
As for Yuan Qi…

391
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:53,940
I've given you the brew. Just spill it.

392
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,260
I won't tell you.

393
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,940
You want a beating, don't you?

394
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:58,820
Give it to us.

395
00:40:58,890 --> 00:40:59,760
Give me the brew.

396
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:00,820
Give me the brew.

397
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:01,660
Give me.

398
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,580
