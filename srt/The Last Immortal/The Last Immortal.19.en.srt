29
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,940
(Gallant and Formidable)
Bad news! Bad news!

30
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,960
The Heavenly Punishment Officer
is coming to arrest Yin!

31
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,460
Me?

32
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,990
The Energy Protection Arrow exploded
and hurt Lord Zhen Yi's finger bone.

33
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:50,830
What?

34
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,720
You were watching over the Arrow, huh?

35
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,370
And you were the last to touch it
before it was put into the Secret Storeroom.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:57,970
They think it's your responsibility
and will catch you for interrogations.

37
00:01:57,970 --> 00:01:58,510
That's not true.

38
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,070
I checked it before that.
Nothing was wrong with the Arrow.

39
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:02,910
It doesn't matter.

40
00:02:03,070 --> 00:02:04,150
I'll explain it to them.

41
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,040
Yin!

42
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:06,990
(Gallant and Formidable)
It's not time to explain anything.

43
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:07,660
Jin.

44
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:08,920
Yin.

45
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:10,940
We all trust you in this.

46
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:13,670
But the demons are furious
and forcing us to answer to them.

47
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:16,580
If we can't figure out what happened
and they insist on a solution,

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,830
you're very likely
to be used as a scapegoat.

49
00:02:19,190 --> 00:02:20,550
But I didn't do anything.

50
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:21,500
- If I don't explain it now...
- Oh, no.

51
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:22,580
They're breaking in.

52
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,120
You come with me.

53
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,430
Come on. Say no more.

54
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,620
Leave through the back door.

55
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:30,460
- Go.
- Hurry.

56
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,990
Hi, Officer.

57
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,510
The Heavenly Palace is
so glorious and vast.

58
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,830
I really can't find my way.

59
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:48,300
Please walk with me and show me the way.

60
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
But...

61
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,580
I'm in some haste.

62
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,110
It won't take long.

63
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:54,990
Lead the way.

64
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,400
This way, please.

65
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,120
Yin.

66
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,180
What happened
when you delivered the Arrow?

67
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,900
Tell me if anything was unusual.

68
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,510
Or I couldn't vindicate you.

69
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:30,990
You don't suspect me?

70
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:32,460
Don't be silly.

71
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,270
I brought you up.

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:36,510
How can I not know
what kind of girl you are?

73
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,080
What's wrong?

74
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:45,990
Had anyone hurt you before I got you?

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,780
I'm just thinking. Why am I stuck
in this kind of thing

76
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,270
and put you in trouble?

77
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,830
This isn't trouble.

78
00:03:57,590 --> 00:03:58,550
You're under my protection.

79
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,430
Whoever gives you trouble

80
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,460
will be provoking our sect and me.

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,550
If you don't believe it, ask Qing Yi.
He won't let anyone hurt you, either.

82
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,270
Anyway, before we find out the truth,

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,990
you have to glue together with me.

84
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,640
You will be seen unless you wear
the Heaven-shuttling Garment, understand?

85
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,670
Last night in the Secret Storeroom,
I saw a ring-shaped weapon fly out.

86
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:26,310
I thought I saw it wrong.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,340
But considering what happened today,

88
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:30,980
the ring-shaped weapon must be fishy.

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,870
So, who's behind all this?

90
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:38,190
Now, immortals and demons
are at loggerheads.

91
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,830
I think someone is
taking advantage of this thing

92
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,460
to start a fight between us.

93
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:45,900
If this is true,

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,110
we should tell
the Heavenly Palace about it.

95
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,270
We can't.

96
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,270
We don't have any proof.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,980
Our conjecture alone isn't convincing.

98
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,100
Besides, Jiu is a demon.

99
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,740
If we point out what happened last night,

100
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,020
he may be exposed
and get into unnecessary trouble.

101
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:07,750
I prefer to investigate secretly
and catch them off guard.

102
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:10,430
I don't care who's behind this
or what he wants.

103
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,150
Since they've framed Yin,
I won't let them go.

104
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:16,510
The ring-shaped weapon followed us
into the Secret Storeroom.

105
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,100
But Jiu noticed it
before it approached the Arrow.

106
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,340
How could it do anything...

107
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:26,270
Can there be a mole?

108
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,980
That's exactly what I was thinking.

109
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,540
And that's why I hurriedly
took you away from the Hall of Arms.

110
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,340
If you had been caught,
you would be tortured.

111
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,150
Oh, look.

112
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,420
This is a fragment of the Arrow
I found where it exploded.

113
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,150
Yin, check if you can find anything.

114
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,310
Blood-sucking Sand?

115
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:50,830
I didn't use it to make the Arrow.

116
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,420
This is a fake arrow.

117
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,460
The smell... I smelt it before.

118
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,880
- Where?
- Where?

119
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,190
In the last place
I found Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

120
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,470
Let's go, then.

121
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,190
We should go.

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,950
But we can't bet everything on one clue.

123
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,900
Now we know

124
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,190
the Blood-sucking Sand is the key clue.

125
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,800
All the fragments are kept
in the Hall of Wind

126
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,220
for the Wind Lord's inspection.

127
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,510
Jiu, you keep a close eye
on the Hall of Wind

128
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:27,020
and see if anyone suspicious gets in there.

129
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:31,710
Besides, one couldn't fake an arrow
unless he had the drawing.

130
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,320
Yan Shuang,

131
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,870
you should check the list of recent shifts

132
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,750
and investigate anyone who had access
to the drawing and manufacture.

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,310
Yin and I will search for more clues
where the Blood-sucking Sand was found.

134
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:06,460
I had meant to ask the Immortal Realm
for more Blessed Caves.

135
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,980
Unexpectedly, they silenced me
with the Nirvana Wheel.

136
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:13,830
The Wheel is so useless to me.

137
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,580
But if I had rejected
the sacred weapon of the Fox Clan,

138
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:20,310
they may suspect me.

139
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,950
But Master, what do we
need the Blessed Caves for?

140
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:28,710
My devil army is growing bigger
and it's harder to cover the devil energy.

141
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,870
Without suitable places to settle my army,

142
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:35,540
others will find them sooner or later
and I will fail in the end.

143
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,220
Unless I have the barrier-breaking stone
of Ningyun Mountain to cover the devil energy.

144
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,780
But I can't get the Stone

145
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:46,870
until I have the mastership
of Ningyun Mountain

146
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,270
from the Heavenly Palace.

147
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,630
No wonder you took so much trouble.

148
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,750
As our scapegoat,

149
00:07:56,510 --> 00:07:59,190
Yin diverted the investigation direction.

150
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,580
This is a wonderful surprise.

151
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,980
But just in case,

152
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,270
all traces of the fake arrow
must be cleaned up.

153
00:08:08,950 --> 00:08:10,980
But now, the Heavenly Palace
is heavily guarded.

154
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,040
I really can't break in.

155
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,020
Don't worry.

156
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:17,190
Someone else is more anxious than you.

157
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,540
(Weird.)

158
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,180
(There's a strong smell
of the Blood-sucking Sand.)

159
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:40,020
(But why can't I see any of it?)

160
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:44,820
Jin, I found him!

161
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:46,870
Stop running!

162
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,870
Yin!

163
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,480
Gu Jin, Yin.

164
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,350
Wind Lord.

165
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,820
What are you doing here?

166
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,510
Who's that man in black?

167
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,150
For your information,

168
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,870
Yin and I came here for some clues.

169
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,870
That man in black is to blame
for the loss of Lord Zhen Yi's finger bone.

170
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:30,460
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

171
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,440
Your Lordship,

172
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,390
the Blood-sucking Sand is really found
on every piece of the Arrow.

173
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,510
Your Lordship,

174
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,750
because of the Sand,
the fake arrow exploded

175
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:46,790
at the Spiritual Trigram Assembly.

176
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:49,230
But when Yin made the Arrow,
she didn't use this material.

177
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:53,270
Anyone who manufactured
or inspected the Arrow can verify that.

178
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,110
So, Yin is falsely accused.

179
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:59,590
Someone else is behind this.

180
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,070
Your Lordship, hope you can

181
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:04,230
report this to His Majesty soon
and clear Yin's name.

182
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,780
Don't worry.

183
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,870
I will honestly report to His Majesty,

184
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,470
repeal the hunting order on Yin

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:11,390
and vindicate her.

186
00:10:12,510 --> 00:10:14,630
If you hadn't insisted on trusting her,

187
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,700
we would nearly wrong this innocent girl.

188
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,560
By the way,

189
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,590
the man in black
detonated the Sand at short range.

190
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:28,390
He must have been burnt, too.

191
00:10:29,390 --> 00:10:30,380
Give out my order.

192
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,300
Screen out anyone in the Palace
who was burnt.

193
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:36,820
Anyone regardless of his rank.

194
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,700
Thanks to you, Jin.

195
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,270
So, I will give you a huge present.

196
00:11:05,030 --> 00:11:06,590
You don't need to.

197
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,700
Your problem is mine.

198
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,300
This is a very important present.

199
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,990
You lost it a long time ago.

200
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,700
I hope you can get it back.

201
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:20,870
What?

202
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:21,900
Tell me about it.

203
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,630
Not until I find it.

204
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,320
All right.

205
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,060
(There it is.)

206
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,680
(This is great.)

207
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:45,820
(I'm sending Gu Jin a message
and give Yin a surprise.)

208
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:56,350
Feng Ming,

209
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,630
what happened?

210
00:12:58,030 --> 00:12:59,060
When I was patrolling here,

211
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,900
I saw this man doing devil cultivation.

212
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,230
I fought him, then.

213
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,990
Unexpectedly, he scattered
some explosive powder

214
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,590
and I was unfortunately burned.

215
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,990
But luckily, he failed to run away.

216
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,180
It's the Blood-sucking Sand.

217
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,750
Yan Si.

218
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,510
He's the man in black you met, huh?

219
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,270
We were late.

220
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:42,870
Your Ladyship,

221
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,660
His Majesty found out the truth
of the finger bone case.

222
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,130
Knowing a devil cultivator
was behind all this,

223
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,350
the Demon King agreed to let it go.

224
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:54,280
He accepted our precious
compensation offer,

225
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:56,580
250 kilometers of unclaimed territory
and the Nirvana Wheel.

226
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,700
At the command of His Majesty,
we've brought you the Nirvana Wheel.

227
00:14:01,390 --> 00:14:02,230
Thank you.

228
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,280
Leave me.

229
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:13,590
Gu Jin and Yin ruined my plan!

230
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:22,230
Ningyun Mountain isn't
among the unclaimed territory.

231
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:23,780
What about your plan?

232
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,780
Luckily, Hua Shu, the Deity of Fortune,

233
00:14:28,150 --> 00:14:30,870
takes care of the land distribution.

234
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,510
Under such circumstances,

235
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,990
we have to use Hua Mo.

236
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,560
Father,

237
00:14:38,210 --> 00:14:40,990
why was the Arrow case
totally different from what you told me?

238
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,430
Shu, you got me wrong.

239
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:46,390
I thought that was
just a small deal with the Fox Queen.

240
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,270
I didn't know
she even colluded with devils.

241
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:53,470
Demons are rather cunning.

242
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,390
You shouldn't have trusted demons.

243
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,820
If people know we were involved,
we can hardly vindicate ourselves.

244
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,300
Yeah.

245
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:03,100
Luckily, you were clever enough

246
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,470
to remove the scene in the Truth Mirror
with the Peacock Feather Pure Water.

247
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,350
So, in no case can they come after us.

248
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:31,420
Hong Ruo kept her promise, anyway.
She told us the secret of the immortals.

249
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:34,990
It'll help with your application
for the Cloud Lord.

250
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:40,300
Sadly, the female immortal
named Yin survived.

251
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,270
We had meant to kill her in this case.

252
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:45,420
To our surprise, she got away with it.

253
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:50,390
Even if we failed to kill her,
we should give her a lesson.

254
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,510
You said she applied
for claiming Ningyun Mountain, right?

255
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,700
After she hurt my son,
how could she wish for a mountain?

256
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,820
Why don't you give
this mountain to the demons, too?

257
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,860
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

258
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:21,420
Why is Ningyun Mountain
also given to the demons?

259
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,660
According to Princess Hua Shu,

260
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:26,550
there isn't a lot of unclaimed territory
within 250 kilometers in the south.

261
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,990
So, she had to pick some from the north.

262
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,390
The document has been sealed
by both sides and delivered.

263
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,990
Any problem, Your Majesty?

264
00:16:37,150 --> 00:16:37,990
Forget it.

265
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,590
Your Majesty, Yin is here.

266
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:58,990
You don't need to curtsy.

267
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:04,740
Thank you for finding
out the truth in time

268
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:07,530
and resolving the misunderstanding
between immortals and demons.

269
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,980
I never expected

270
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:13,750
an immortal to do devil cultivation.
And the devils dared to stir up trouble

271
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:14,980
and intensify our contradictions.

272
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,350
Your Majesty,

273
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,500
I have something else to tell you.

274
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,980
In the Secret Storeroom,
Jiu found a suspicious ring-shaped weapon.

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,550
The Nirvana Wheel saw it through
and it fled in panic.

276
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,590
When Jiu caught up, it was gone.

277
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,500
Seriously?

278
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,830
It happened in a fleeting instant.

279
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:37,740
Without evidence, we didn't dare to judge.

280
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,350
But considering the fake arrow case,

281
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,870
there must have been some relations.

282
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
The Heavenly Palace is heavily guarded.

283
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,570
Without organization or premeditation,

284
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,500
how could anyone fake the arrow
and replace the real one?

285
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,980
And a ring-shaped weapon from nowhere
ended up in the Secret Storeroom.

286
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,220
Are you saying
there's still a mole of the Devil Realm?

287
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,980
Yin, thanks for reminding me.

288
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,110
I'll immediately have the Palace
thoroughly investigated.

289
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,110
Yin,

290
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,700
I invited you here
because I wanted to apologize.

291
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,180
Because of the devil's trap,
you were falsely accused.

292
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,870
I'm certainly to blame.

293
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:23,260
It doesn't matter.

294
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,070
We found the real killer, anyway.

295
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,590
Don't blame yourself, Your Majesty.

296
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,110
You found out the devil killer

297
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,270
and settled the dispute
between immortals and demons.

298
00:18:31,310 --> 00:18:32,660
A special merit for you.

299
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:36,180
And I'll make you
a fourth-rank Official of Arms.

300
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,630
What else do you want? Tell me.

301
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:43,260
I... I want nothing else.

302
00:18:45,590 --> 00:18:49,940
Your Majesty, please allow me
to claim Ningyun Mountain.

303
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:52,630
Ningyun Mountain?

304
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,660
(Ningyun Mountain)

305
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,350
What?

306
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,660
Ningyun Mountain was given to the demons?

307
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,830
Upon hearing this, I hurried to you.

308
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,110
Yin was summoned by His Majesty.

309
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:12,180
I don't think she's aware yet.

310
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:15,980
I'll go tell her.

311
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,550
(The pear tree on Daze Mountain.)

312
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,460
(Something urgent about Yin.)

313
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:27,870
(Gu Jin, come immediately.)

314
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,740
Three-life Stone?

315
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,150
Something about Yin?

316
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,000
Go check it out.

317
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,870
I'll take care of Yin. Don't worry.

318
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,980
All right. I'll be right back.

319
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:43,390
Sorry, Yu.

320
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,350
I still failed to get Ningyun Mountain.

321
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:52,150
I don't know when I can wake you up.

322
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:57,700
I came here and started
as the lowest official

323
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,150
just to become a fifth-rank official

324
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,870
and claim my own place.

325
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:07,830
I thought it was the fairest rule
in the Heavenly Palace.

326
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,940
But why did they
take away Ningyun Mountain?

327
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,630
Is it because I have a low status

328
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,830
that I can't even protect my home?

329
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,500
Don't be too sad, Yin.

330
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,180
There must be another way out.

331
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,940
Jiu is a demon, right?

332
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:32,150
We can ask him for help.

333
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:34,070
Maybe he can convince the Demon King

334
00:20:34,310 --> 00:20:36,590
to allow us to trade Ningyun Mountain back
with some other treasure.

335
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,350
It's too early to give up.

336
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:41,420
Moreover, I have good news for you.

337
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,390
I'm sure it'll make you happy.

338
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:47,260
I found Gu Jin's affection ties.

339
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:48,670
Really?

340
00:20:48,670 --> 00:20:50,020
You bet.

341
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,430
Gu Jin is going to find
Three-life Stone now.

342
00:20:51,430 --> 00:20:52,460
You should go too.

343
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:55,180
Hurry.

344
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,350
Three-life Stone.

345
00:20:58,550 --> 00:20:59,390
Gu Jin.

346
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:01,350
What's up?

347
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,460
This is a gift from Yin.

348
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:07,720
What gift?

349
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,110
These are your affection ties.

350
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,740
Your affection towards Yin.

351
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,469
Someone removed them

352
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:15,320
with the Memory-erasing Flute
and buried them here.

353
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,740
It took me a long time to find them.

354
00:21:18,750 --> 00:21:20,260
My affection towards Yin?

355
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,663
Actually, Yin already fell in love with you
when you were bound

356
00:21:23,687 --> 00:21:25,390
with the master-servant contract.

357
00:21:25,590 --> 00:21:27,790
Because of that, she was punished
by the contract quite a few times.

358
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,350
Now, please open it. Let me show you
how close you guys used to be.

359
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:53,540
(Gu Jin, Yin)

360
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:54,390
I'll lock it now.

361
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:58,000
Done.

362
00:21:58,140 --> 00:22:00,100
(Gu Jin, Yin)

363
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,260
Gu Jin and Yin.

364
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,040
We are bound together now.

365
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,900
You loved it so much.

366
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,550
I want to give it to you as a betrothal gift.

367
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,150
I'm thinking instead
of the master-servant contract,

368
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:15,940
we can make a marriage contract
so we can be together forever.

369
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:18,430
Yin,

370
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,590
let's go to Yantian Hall tomorrow
to make the contract.

371
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:22,870
I'd love to.

372
00:22:26,270 --> 00:22:27,110
Wait.

373
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,580
Not the master-servant contract.
It should be a marriage contract. Let's do it.

374
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,310
What marriage contract?

375
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:35,660
Marriage contract is not something
to be made casually.

376
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,900
You read too many story books.

377
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:50,030
Who removed your affection ties anyway?

378
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,940
It'd take a lot of effort to do such a thing.

379
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:54,940
Could it be
the two senior brothers of yours?

380
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,590
Well, His Majesty will go back
to the Nether Realm soon.

381
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:03,900
I'm leaving now.

382
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,260
Take your time and think about it.

383
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,460
Please think twice, Your Lordship.

384
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:19,700
Do you know when you answered
for the tribulation under the Heaven Stone

385
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:22,440
to get back the immortal spirit
of the Fire Phoenix,

386
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,240
the tribulation emerged?

387
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,350
And that was Yin.

388
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,630
Donghua predicted that before he left

389
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:31,350
and made the master-servant contract
so that you could avoid the tribulation.

390
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,810
Now, the contract is
unexpectedly terminated.

391
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,910
Your love with Yin

392
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:39,220
will only make the tribulation
more terrifying

393
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:42,070
and put you in more danger.

394
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:10,550
Your Lordship, why do you
want to see me in a hurry?

395
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:18,590
Your Lordship, don't be mad.

396
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,980
I can't watch a tribulation
befall you and do nothing.

397
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:29,070
That's why I took it upon myself
and went a little far.

398
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,420
Aunt, you watched me grow up.

399
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,390
You know my temper
better than anyone else does.

400
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,890
Just because I respect you

401
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:40,960
doesn't mean you can remove
my affection ties in secret

402
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,180
and manipulate my feelings!

403
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:44,840
Even if Yin is my tribulation, so what?

404
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,420
We should be responsible
for our own relationship.

405
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:49,830
No one else has the right
to interfere and meddle in it.

406
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,980
No matter what I do,
it's for your own good.

407
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,150
I knew you'd be angry with me,

408
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,030
but I still had to do it.

409
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:00,590
For my own good?

410
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:04,050
So, are you going to continue to interfere

411
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:05,670
and separate me and Yin?

412
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:07,550
I'm worried that you'd regret it one day.

413
00:25:07,960 --> 00:25:09,390
You may not care about yourself,

414
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,630
but you do care about Daze Mountain.

415
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:13,790
How does it have anything to do
with Daze Mountain?

416
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:17,830
Blessed by your god parents, Daze Mountain
is now more prosperous than ever.

417
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,830
But, anything comes with a price.

418
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:21,980
Donghua predicted

419
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,180
that something would happen
to the master-servant contract,

420
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,980
so he had a backup plan prepared for you.

421
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,550
Although I made a master-servant contract
for Gu Jin and Yin,

422
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:34,940
not everything in the world
will go as we designed.

423
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,830
If the contract fails by accident one day,

424
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,030
there's only one way left.

425
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:46,180
We'll have to link Gu Jin's tribulation
to Daze Mountain,

426
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,590
hoping that the spiritual energy accumulated
for 70,000 years can keep him safe.

427
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:55,740
But, it's really unfair to the rest of you.

428
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,350
What?

429
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,590
Your master-servant contract was severed
by the dragon in the Mortal Realm,

430
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:03,740
so your tribulation is bound to happen.

431
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:06,700
Therefore, your two senior brothers
made the decision

432
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:10,870
that when it comes,
Daze Mountain will fend it off for you.

433
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:14,670
Staying with Yin will harm
not only yourself but also Daze Mountain.

434
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:18,260
In that case, do you still insist
on being with her?

435
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:21,260
Why have my senior brothers
never told me about that?

436
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:25,590
Your Lordship, if you don't believe me,
you can see it for yourself.

437
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:55,790
Bearing Donghua's order,
Xian Zhu and Xian Shan

438
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,550
can't tell you the truth.

439
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,550
But I know you very well.

440
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,030
I think you should know the truth.

441
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:08,660
Otherwise, if that day came,
how could you deal with it?

442
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:12,150
It's not like we'll end Yin's life.

443
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:14,680
We just need you to stop loving her.

444
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,260
It won't do much harm to her anyway.

445
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,150
Which is more important? Your affection,

446
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:21,740
or the lives of all the disciples
of Daze Mountain?

447
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,550
It was my fault

448
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,900
that I wanted to make a decision for you.

449
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,900
And now, I'll let you
make your own decision.

450
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,030
I'm sure

451
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:42,310
you'll do the right thing
given the gravity of the situation.

452
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,590
I've put my soul mark on Yin.

453
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:12,980
Even if she's in danger,
I'll be there to protect her.

454
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,370
We still have the Worry-free Immortal Fruit.

455
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,740
All you need to do right now
is take a good rest.

456
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,420
I will.

457
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,550
I still need to make the contract
with you tomorrow.

458
00:28:39,590 --> 00:28:40,940
It was my fault

459
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,500
that I wanted to make a decision for you.

460
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:48,700
And now, I'll let you
make your own decision.

461
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,630
I'm sure

462
00:28:51,590 --> 00:28:54,980
you'll do the right thing
given the gravity of the situation.

463
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:06,830
This is my gift for you.

464
00:29:08,030 --> 00:29:09,150
Your affection ties.

465
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,630
Do you recall it now?

466
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:22,390
Yes, I do.

467
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,840
Yin,

468
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,500
I was too immature before.

469
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,310
I shouldn't have behaved like that.

470
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:05,180
I guess you know now that I'm a True God.

471
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,710
I should carry forward the will of
the ancestral gods and protect the Three Realms.

472
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:13,030
I can't waste my energy
and time on one person only.

473
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,070
In fact, I had my affection ties removed myself.

474
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:21,150
I didn't expect you'd find them back.
Sorry for the confusion.

475
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,980
I don't want to spend my whole life
waiting for someone like Xian Zhu did.

476
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,660
Love and affection don't matter.

477
00:30:32,590 --> 00:30:34,350
I have more important things to do.

478
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,150
Do you understand?

479
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,790
But you told me

480
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,420
I was also important to you.

481
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:49,630
Yes,

482
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,900
you were.

483
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,500
But it was before, not now.

484
00:30:56,270 --> 00:30:59,940
To me, all lives
in the Three Realms are equal,

485
00:31:00,830 --> 00:31:01,740
including you.

486
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:09,660
Are there any unspeakable reasons?

487
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,900
Or, is it because Lady Hong Chou

488
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:21,980
told you that you and I…

489
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:23,940
It's okay.

490
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,350
Lady Hong Chou is only
the Chief of Qingchi Palace.

491
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:28,740
I am the head of Qingchi Palace.

492
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:30,830

00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,180
(Ningyun Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

544
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,300
As it turned out, Ningyun Mountain

545
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:34,030
has been hiding here over the past
tens of thousands of years.

546
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,340
I heard the rumor about the secret barrier
in Ningyun Mountain.

547
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:59,630
Now that I see it today,
it's indeed spectacular.

548
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,180
Without the barrier stone,

549
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,180
the landform of Ningyun Mountain
wouldn't have been kept intact like this.

550
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,660
After the extinction of Water Divine Beasts,

551
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:13,380
this piece of stone is the only
valuable thing left in the mountain.

552
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,800
Wait.

553
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:26,460
You want to challenge
an expert cultivator of our clan?

554
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,320
Yes.

555
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:28,950
According to your rules,

556
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:32,110
the winner can get the thing that he wants.

557
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:38,220
This is the Cradle Boat,

558
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,300
the only demigod tool in the entire
Three Realms that can nurture the young,

559
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,380
and it's the only one in the whole world.

560
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:46,380
I'll challenge an expert of yours
using this as the prize.

561
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,820
Win or lose, you can get this Cradle Boat.

562
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:51,070
But if I win, I want only one thing.

563
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:56,070
I hope you and the Fox Queen
can give me Ningyun Mountain.

564
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:57,350
Ruo,

565
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,510
it's a no-lose deal.

566
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,470
We have no reason to refuse.

567
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,820
General You, you go.

568
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,610
Ruo, You Tu is a Senior Immortal.

569
00:37:13,610 --> 00:37:15,910
If we send him to fight Junior Immortal Gu Jin,

570
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,150
it's a little unfair even if we win.

571
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:21,700
He's Donghua's favorite disciple.

572
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,180
How do you know he didn't come prepared?

573
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:30,660
Since he wants to challenge us,
let his strength be the final judge.

574
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:36,550
So, my love for you
is just a joke in your eyes, right?

575
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,220
Or, you've never really loved me?

576
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,260
I was wrong about you.

577
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:45,260
I can't protect my own home,

578
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,470
and I don't deserve a True God's love.

579
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:33,150
I didn't expect you could be this powerful.

580
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:35,150
I underestimated you.

581
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:38,350
Stop it, Ruo.

582
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,860
Though he's a Junior Immortal,
he defeated a Senior Immortal of our clan.

583
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,740
According to our rules, he won.

584
00:39:49,550 --> 00:39:52,550
(If I fight Daze Mountain)
(and cause a lockdown,)

585
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,150
(it'd actually affect my plan.)

586
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,430
(I've got the barrier stone anyway.)

587
00:39:59,190 --> 00:40:02,780
(Ningyun Mountain)
(is no use to me anymore.)

588
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:04,950
Fine.

589
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,110
If you want Ningyun Mountain this badly,

590
00:40:09,110 --> 00:40:12,910
I'll let you have it on account of Hong Yi.

591
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:27,780
(Tablet)

592
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,620
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

593
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:46,260
(Tablet)

594
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:50,910
After negotiation, the Demon Clan
has agreed to return Ningyun Mountain.

595
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,990
I'll approve your application

596
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,380
and give the mountain to you
your residence.

597
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:00,070
But, the Fox Queen took the barrier stone.

598
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,180
I hope you don't mind.

599
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,220
I don't.

600
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:06,110
Getting the mountain back
already makes me happy enough.

601
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,910
Thank you, Your Majesty.

602
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:28,940
(Tablet)

603
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,660
Why don't you give it to Yin yourself?

604
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,030
Your Majesty, please keep it a secret for me.

605
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,910
I don't want her to know.

606
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,740
I finally got back to Ningyun Mountain.

607
00:42:02,070 --> 00:42:04,070
But it feels like everything has changed.

608
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,300
Yu will hatch soon.

609
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:17,340
Hope when she grows up,

610
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:21,300
she won't fall for the wrong person

611
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,660
or chase the wrong dream.

612
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:26,820
Yin,

613
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,740
you've always despised
such thing as status discrimination.

614
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,780
How could you say that about yourself?

615
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:36,150
I thought he didn't care about it either,

616
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,700
but as it turned out,

617
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,950
he does.

618
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,030
Gu Jin is such a jerk.

619
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:49,680
Yin, stop drinking.

620
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:52,630
Don't use wine to punish yourself.

621
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,660
He left you, and it's his loss.

622
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,780
That's right, Yin. Drinking will only
make you feel more miserable.

623
00:42:59,230 --> 00:43:01,630
Stop drinking.
Your health is more important.

624
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,180
I'll consider today a closure on the past,

625
00:43:07,670 --> 00:43:11,780
which seems insignificant,
but it cost all the love I had.

626
00:43:15,550 --> 00:43:17,430
But time will heal.

627
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:21,110
Sure. Everything will be fine.

628
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:24,590
Yin, we'll always be there for you.
