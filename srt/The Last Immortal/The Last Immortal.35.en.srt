Go to the Demon Realm and bring
your Phoenix Queen back.

Yu.

31
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:00,790
Come over.

32
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,300
Lady Hong Chou.

33
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,830
You do know who I am.

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,180
You are so happy on
Wutong Island these days.

35
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,230
Have you forgotten your identity?

36
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:21,910
When His Godship proposed to
marry into Wutong Island,

37
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:23,230
why didn't you try to stop him?

38
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,900
It's a good thing that His Godship
marries my sister.

39
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,150
Why should I stop him?

40
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,700
My sister said that Wutong Island
has no cliché.

41
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:35,790
So, as long as His Godship is happy,
I have no objections.

42
00:02:35,790 --> 00:02:36,630
Unbridled!

43
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:40,660
How dare you talk nonsense like this!

44
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,350
(Fengyi Palace)
Follow me back to Qingchi Palace

45
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,430
and reflect on your mistakes.

46
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,340
How mighty Your Ladyship is.

47
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,150
Your hand has reached
my Wutong Island.

48
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,430
Yu belongs to Qingchi Palace.

49
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,390
What's wrong with me
to teach her as the Chief?

50
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:04,300
I recognized Yu as my sister.

51
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:08,110
She is somewhat famous and respected
on this Wutong Island.

52
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,830
Furthermore, Yuan Qi has given
Qingchi Palace to me as a betrothal gift.

53
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,180
I can be considered the true owner
of Qingchi Palace.

54
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:21,180
You, as the Chief, should also
listen to my commands.

55
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,580
I was sent by True Goddess Yi He

56
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,060
to the Immortal Realm
to take care of His Godship.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,020
Besides True Goddess Yi He and His
Godship, who dares to boss me around?

58
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,270
His Godship was raised by me
from childhood.

59
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:35,570
Not to mention Yu, even you

60
00:03:35,570 --> 00:03:39,180
should be treated as I wish
since you married His Godship.

61
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,620
How do you plan to treat me?

62
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,710
Do you want to treat me like
what you did to Yin before?

63
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,710
Throw her into the hurricane of
Wujin Cliff and let her perish on her own,

64
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,340
or remove His Godship's affection ties again?

65
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,110
How could you know these things?

66
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,180
I experienced all these.
How could I not know your methods?

67
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,310
You experienced these?

68
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,150
Are you…

69
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,390
Water Divine Beasts have a short life,
but we are not lowly.

70
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:28,670
Impossible!

71
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,540
Absolutely impossible!

72
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,750
My immortal spirit scattered back then.

73
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:37,580
A portion of my immortal spirit entered
the body of the Water Divine Beast,

74
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:40,340
and awakened the dormant
Water Divine Beast.

75
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,870
You are Yin?

76
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,710
I thought Your Ladyship is
so proud and mighty

77
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:55,900
that you have long forgotten about
the insignificant pawn Yin.

78
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,310
I am Yin.

79
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,350
Hong Chou came to find Feng Yin's trouble?

80
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

81
00:05:10,590 --> 00:05:13,360
Hong Chou is notorious for being
difficult to deal with in the Three Realms.

82
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,390
I'm just afraid that Lady Feng Yin
will be wronged.

83
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,230
According to my understanding
of Feng Yin,

84
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:21,220
no one in the Three Realms can
make her back down except Yuan Qi.

85
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,630
Your Majesty, what you said is true.

86
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,070
But if she is wronged,
wouldn't you feel sorry for her?

87
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,510
The Three Realms have a manner of
treating others based on their positions.

88
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,580
I had already experienced it before,
so it's nothing special.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,780
When I was a Water Divine Beast,
you considered my life insignificant.

90
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,950
Now I have returned, you came to
propose marriage on behalf of Yuan Qi.

91
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,110
This changing face is really ridiculous.

92
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:50,100
It's not like that.

93
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:53,630
I hated Yin and tried to kill her

94
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,710
only because...

95
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,830
Because she would bring
a tribulation to His Godship.

96
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:58,750
So?

97
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,070
Did she have to die
just to keep His Godship alive?

98
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:07,870
In your eyes, can Water Divine Beasts
be abandoned so easily?

99
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:12,950
Lord Donghua and my senior brothers
tried everything they could to protect us.

100
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,510
But you remained supercilious,
thinking you're the noblest.

101
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:20,510
Who are you to judge Yin's life?

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,460
Why can you decide
who lives and who dies?

103
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,750
You thought you saw through everything.

104
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:34,190
Did you see this coming?

105
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,390
You just had your view overshadowed
and you're such a snob.

106
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,780
I thought everything I did was
for the sake of His Godship.

107
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,950
But unexpectedly, it turns out that
I was presumptuous.

108
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,950
Fortunately, the Heavenly Empress is here.

109
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,510
I want to ask Your Majesty,

110
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:15,830
the Divine Envoy of Qingchi Palace
intentionally hurt a Fire Phoenix.

111
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,020
How should she be disposed of?

112
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,070
The God Realm should not interfere
in the affairs of the Three Realms.

113
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:37,420
Not to mention slaughtering
living beings in the Three Realms.

114
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:41,750
You persecuted the Phoenix Queen
under the guise of loyalty.

115
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:49,220
If True Goddess Yi He knows it,
she will expel you from the God Realm.

116
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,780
Expel me from the God Realm?

117
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:59,070
You should be grateful that Feng Yin
is safe and sound this time.

118
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:03,340
If she is willing to forgive you,
you may be exempt from punishment.

119
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,660
I have only knelt in front of
True Goddess Yi He and God Yuan Qi.

120
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:27,870
I consider myself worthy of
the God Realm.

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,630
But I turned out to be self-righteous,
shallow, and narrow-minded.

122
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,150
I am not afraid of being
expelled from the God Realm,

123
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:41,590
because I only cared about
the well-being of His Godship.

124
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:45,350
But today, I know I was totally wrong.

125
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,510
I kneel in front of the Phoenix Queen here,
not asking for forgiveness.

126
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:54,940
I am willing to pay any price
and accept whatever punishment.

127
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,230
Forget it.

128
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,060
Whether you are sincere or hokey,

129
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,180
at least you helped Yuan Qi
take care of Yu.

130
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,840
If you dare to mention your so-called
rules of honor and hierarchy

131
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:29,350
in front of me or bully Yu again,

132
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,150
I will let you know that it's not difficult
to bully others using power.

133
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,870
Your Godship.

134
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,390
I thought you had prejudices against Yin
because you cared too much about me.

135
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,390
But I didn't expect you really
wanted to kill Yin.

136
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,630
I lost my head at that moment
and made a big mistake.

137
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,350
I'm sorry to disappoint Your Godship.

138
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,230
I'm sorry to the Phoenix Queen.

139
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm sorry for betraying the trust of
True Goddess Yi He and Your Godship.

140
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,180
I can forgive you for any other matters,

141
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:24,060
but I'll never forgive you
for what you did to Yin.

142
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,270
The person you're most sorry for
is not me, but Yin.

143
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,160
Chang Que.

144
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:41,270
Bring Hong Chou back to Qingchi Palace
and wait for Phoenix Queen's decision.

145
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,990
If the Phoenix Queen
won't forgive you in the end,

146
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,660
go to the God Realm
and resign from your position.

147
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,590
Your Godship.

148
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,780
Your Godship!

149
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,350
I'm sorry.

150
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,870
I didn't know Yin had suffered
these grievances.

151
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,780
In fact, what Hong Chou did
was all for me.

152
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:44,350
If it triggers any of
your unpleasant memories,

153
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:46,750
you can blame me as you want.

154
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:53,470
It's all in the past.
Don't mention it again.

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:59,350
I didn't expect you are willing to let
Hong Chou grow old in Qingchi Palace.

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,110
She did all this for you.

157
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:06,470
She can't be considered
completely wrong.

158
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:12,990
Let's sleep now. We will go find
the Purple Moon tomorrow.

159
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:36,420
Is there anything unusual about them?

160
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:41,150
They get along the same as
an ordinary couple.

161
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:42,590
They are affectionate.

162
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,900
His Godship loves the Phoenix Queen
very much.

163
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,790
Lady Hong Chou had a conflict
with the Phoenix Queen,

164
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,590
and was confined in Qingchi Palace
for life.

165
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:53,020
Yuan Qi has always respected Hong Chou.

166
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,870
He punished Hong Chou so heavily
just because of a conflict.

167
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,780
This is a bit strange.

168
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,180
You did a great job.
Keep watching them closely.

169
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,900
The reward is abundant.

170
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,150
Thank you, Your Lordship.

171
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:18,660
(Immortal House on Xuan Pond,
the Immortal Realm)

172
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,270
The source of Ruoshui River.

173
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,910
The Ruoshui River is difficult to cross.

174
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:05,700
I didn't expect
there is such a dense mist here.

175
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,520
Ordinary immortals and demons
cannot reach there.

176
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,870
No wonder no one can find traces of
devils in the past thousands of years.

177
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,300
This time, it's all thanks to Hong Yi.

178
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,270
This is the Abyssal Prison?

179
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,200
Don't run around.

180
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,230
As long as we are together, the
Heaven-shuttling Garment can protect us.

181
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:02,960
Let's go.

182
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,710
Be careful.

183
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,110
The concealing barrier
of Ningyun Mountain.

184
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:54,560
The Purple Moon is indeed here.

185
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:58,420
Using the concealing barrier of
Ningyun Mountain here.

186
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,270
How tricky the Devil God Ming Qi is.

187
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,300
I have searched through the Three Realms,

188
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:07,660
from Dawu Mountain in the far west
to the Liyuan Sea in the far south,

189
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,530
even the islands in the North Sea
have been thoroughly investigated,

190
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,780
but I have never found
any trace of the Purple Moon.

191
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:34,270
It won't be long before
the barrier is broken.

192
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,110
There is no need to waste energy.

193
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:42,180
Join me in opening this barrier
and overturning the Three Realms.

194
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:43,870
Isn't it more interesting?

195
00:16:53,910 --> 00:16:56,010
Do you feel the fluctuation
of spiritual power?

196
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:56,940
Yes, I do.

197
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,840
Wait a moment.

198
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:02,610
There is something wrong
with this barrier.

199
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,700
This barrier cannot be broken.

200
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,220
They have connected this barrier
to the barrier of the Abyss.

201
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,820
If we forcefully open this barrier,

202
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:19,110
it is very likely to impact the barrier
of the Abyssal Prison.

203
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,500
It seems that the devils want to
break the Abyss's barrier in this way.

204
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,430
The strange fluctuation of
spiritual power just now

205
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,500
should be some kind of force
colliding with the barrier.

206
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,420
Is it possible that there are
other passages besides this one?

207
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:35,590
It is difficult for immortals and demons
to come to the source of Ruoshui River.

208
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:39,660
It seems that Hua Mo is trying to use
another passage to impact the barrier.

209
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:44,390
It's an urgent task for us to quickly find
another passage and block it.

210
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:45,970
Otherwise, it would be dangerous.

211
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,320
Let's leave here first.

212
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,240
What's wrong?

213
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:19,590
It turns out that Hua Mo had colluded
with devils a thousand years ago.

214
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,220
What happened back then must have
something to do with him,

215
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,940
Lan Feng, Daze Mountain,
and what you have suffered.

216
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,700
I wish I could crush him
into powder right now.

217
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,420
We have found the Purple Moon.

218
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:39,460
As long as we regain control
of the Abyssal Prison,

219
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:45,110
we can settle the problems with
the devils and Hua Mo.

220
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,550
I have come up with a solution.

221
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,630
Perhaps we can use Fu Chen to find
the passage connecting to the Abyss.

222
00:18:55,790 --> 00:18:58,590
This is the spiritual power on the barrier
at the source of Ruoshui River.

223
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,470
You want to do what you did
to sense the Purple Moon,

224
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:06,420
using the spiritual power collected by
the parasol tree leaf to feel the passages?

225
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,000
That's right.

226
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,260
Now we know the fact that
Hua Mo has colluded with devils,

227
00:19:11,590 --> 00:19:15,030
but we don't know whether the Peacock
Clan, even the entire Immortal Realm,

228
00:19:15,030 --> 00:19:16,460
contains his followers.

229
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:20,110
We should not alert him before
finding other passages.

230
00:19:20,590 --> 00:19:25,070
What I'm worried about most now
is Hua Shu.

231
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,150
She came to our wedding.
She should not have become a devil yet.

232
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,550
I hope she won't be too silly.

233
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:34,310
Feng Ge did have contact with Hua Mo.

234
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,700
(Fengyi Palace)

235
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,740
(Feng Ge left Wutong Island to deliver
invitations and candies to Bainiao Island)

236
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:48,820
(Daily Records of Immortal Maids
in Fengyi Palace)

237
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,740
What are you doing?

238
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:56,420
We will sleep together from now on.

239
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,870
Why?

240
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,830
Don't think too much.

241
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:02,090
I am considering the overall situation.

242
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:05,310
You see, we are suspicious
of Feng Ge now.

243
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,940
We need to be more cautious
in our actions.

244
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:09,050
In case she finds out that
we sleep in separate beds,

245
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,900
what we did before will all be in vain.

246
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,420
We'll use the water bowl as a boundary,

247
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,030
one person facing the head of the bed,
and the other facing the foot,

248
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,230
no trespassing.

249
00:20:41,230 --> 00:20:42,500
Can we sleep now?

250
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,830
We can,

251
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:44,870
but I...

252
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:15,630
Why do you have wounds on your back?

253
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,390
I accidentally bumped into
the Primordial Ancient Vine.

254
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,590
It's nothing serious.

255
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,420
I'll help you apply the ointment.

256
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,430
Does it hurt?

257
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,800
No.

258
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:46,870
I'll be gentle.

259
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,070
Honey, you're quite concerned about me.

260
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,420
Don't call me that.

261
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,500
I do this for you
because Chang Que is not here.

262
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:13,030
Why is this ointment not working?

263
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:15,740
Is it truly a stab wound?

264
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,460
Why does it look like a punitive sign
by a magic weapon?

265
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:20,630
- Your wounds…
- Primordial Ancient Vine

266
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,070
has been chosen to smelt
magic weapons since ancient times.

267
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,310
The wounds it causes are like this.

268
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:27,280
But…

269
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:30,630
Honey, you are so gentle.
It doesn't hurt anymore.

270
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:31,870
Let's sleep now.

271
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,220
Why do you come to
Qingchi Palace today?

272
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,940
His Godship is not in the palace.

273
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,870
I don't come for His Godship.

274
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,590
I heard that Your Ladyship
was embarrassed by the Phoenix Queen,

275
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,870
and you were confined in
Qingchi Palace, so I came to visit you.

276
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,350
You have never made any mistakes
in the past thousands of years.

277
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,260
How could His Godship punish you
for such a trivial matter?

278
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:08,460
Could it be that the Phoenix Queen
is causing trouble?

279
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,150
What does Your Highness want to know?

280
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,310
I am not afraid to tell you the truth. It is
because I didn't respect the Phoenix Queen.

281
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,900
I deserve this punishment.

282
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,460
His Godship and the Phoenix Queen
love each other.

283
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:24,630
His Godship is affectionate
toward the Phoenix Queen.

284
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,390
No one can be instigated.

285
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:31,180
I know that you
can't forget about His Godship.

286
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:35,030
I don't want to say much about love,

287
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:41,830
but I want to tell you that
His Godship doesn't like you at all.

288
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:46,350
He loved the Phoenix Queen a thousand
years ago and still loves her now.

289
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,220
I advise you to give up early.

290
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:52,940
Don't end up losing face completely.

291
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:54,790
Farewell.

292
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,940
Farewell.

293
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,870
Hong Chou said that His Godship loved
the Phoenix Queen a thousand years ago

294
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,900
and still loves her now.

295
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:16,460
It's simply nonsense.

296
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,460
Wasn't the one Yuan Qi loved
the Water Divine Beast Yin?

297
00:24:21,830 --> 00:24:22,670
Who is there?

298
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,830
How dare you eavesdrop here?

299
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:32,060
I didn't eavesdrop.

300
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,630
I was just hiding here to calm down.

301
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:36,620
It's you who don't behave yourself and
speak ill of Aunt Hong Chou.

302
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:40,200
You're just a humble beast
favored by His Godship,

303
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,870
how dare you challenge me?

304
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,110
I will take you to Qinglong Platform now

305
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:48,790
and teach you the principles
of respect and hierarchy.

306
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:58,180
Hua Shu, if you want to discuss
hierarchy, why don't you come to me?

307
00:24:58,590 --> 00:25:04,070
By qualification, I am a demigod, you
are just at the peak of senior immortal.

308
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,110
By status, I am the Phoenix Queen,

309
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,980
you are just an Acting Heavenly Empress.

310
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,830
By territory, Qingchi Palace is
the residence of His Godship.

311
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:21,660
Now, His Godship is mine,
so is this Qingchi Palace.

312
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,420
How dare you act recklessly here?

313
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,180
Don't you apologize to me?

314
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,030
You love Qinglong Platform, huh?

315
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,900
Is this where you did evil
for your own selfish desires?

316
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:44,670
A thousand years ago,
you failed to kill me there.

317
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,180
Now, you want to hurt my sister?

318
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:49,630
You really think Water Divine Beasts
are pushovers, huh?

319
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:02,390
So, it's really you.
Yin, the Water Divine Beast!

320
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:06,390
Why? This is unfair.

321
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,550
I'm going to kill you to avenge Lan Feng!

322
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,230
For Lan Feng's sake,
I tolerated you as far as I could!

323
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:26,700
But now, I'm no longer Yin
who showed kindness everywhere.

324
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,740
So, I won't let you run amok anymore.

325
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,220
Hua Shu, having evil ideas isn't horrible.
But you should wake up in time.

326
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:36,090
If you still thwart
the investigation of Yuan Qi and me,

327
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:37,460
I won't show mercy.

328
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:40,350
But let me remind you, by that time,

329
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:42,980
what you lose will not only be
the position of the Heavenly Empress.

330
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:50,670
Your Majesty.

331
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:56,580
(Landscape of Ponds and Mountains)

332
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:59,390
I apologize.

333
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,310
I was eager to protect His Godship
and repeatedly went against his will,

334
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,900
cutting off your fate with His Godship.

335
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,070
It caused His Godship to suffer a lot
and he still cannot sleep soundly now.

336
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,940
This is not what I wanted.

337
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:21,110
There is no need to mention the past.

338
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,740
No. There are some things
that you should know.

339
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:27,390
His Godship has always loved you.

340
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,550
To protect you,
he left a soul mark on you,

341
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,150
preventing me from hurting you.

342
00:27:37,510 --> 00:27:41,110
I had to take away his affection ties
while he was healing.

343
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:47,630
His Godship knew nothing
about these things.

344
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,900
He held the responsibility of his sect
and wanted to protect his beloved one.

345
00:27:55,030 --> 00:27:58,980
I knew His Godship was affectionate
and righteous, but kept pressing him.

346
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:04,940
Bearing Donghua's order, Xian Zhu
and Xian Shan can't tell you the truth.

347
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,590
It's not like we'll end Yin's life.

348
00:28:08,030 --> 00:28:10,030
We just need you to stop loving her.

349
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:11,830
It won't do much harm to her anyway.

350
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,260
Which is more important? Your affection,

351
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:16,830
or the lives of all the disciples
of Daze Mountain?

352
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,390
In fact, I had my affection ties
removed myself.

353
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:26,180
There's no better time
than now to end our relationship.

His Godship loved you deeply,

364
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,000
(Landscape of Ponds and Mountains)
but he dared not implicate Daze Mountain.

365
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,460
He had to destroy his affection ties
to push you away.

366
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,150
Everything he said at that time
was all insincere.

367
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:24,420
He was not like me. He didn't think
Water Divine Beasts are worthless.

Even if I took away his affection ties,

369

he still fell in love with you again.

370
00:29:33,270 --> 00:29:34,830
He wants to spend his whole life
with you.

371
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,980
He was even willing to give up
becoming a god for you.

372
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,220
Even if Yin can't go to the God Realm,

373
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,500
I always have a way to not
return to the God Realm.

374
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:44,700
I don't want this
True God's identity anyway.

375
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,310
If I can't stay with the person I love,

376
00:29:48,510 --> 00:29:52,070
how could I become a God
and protect the people?

377
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,910
When you returned from the Nether Realm,
you were at the point of death.

378
00:29:55,910 --> 00:29:58,900
He used his blood of chaos
to prolong your life.

379
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:05,420
He was afraid that you would refuse
to use this method to prolong your life.

380
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,500
It's not a long-term solution after all.

381
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:12,150
He finally asked for a way to help you
reshape your immortal body.

382
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:15,880
Then he began to search for those rare
immortal materials in the Three Realms,

383
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:17,550
and refine the Spirit-nourishing Elixir
for you.

384
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:27,310
He begged Hua Shu for
the Peacock Feather Crown.

385
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:30,350
So, His Godship felt indebted
to Hua Shu,

386
00:30:30,350 --> 00:30:33,030
gave her the jade seal and
did his best to fulfill her request.

387
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:37,860

His Godship believed that he could
use his Chaos Power

was not Hua Shu, but Feng Yin.
