(Cijian Pavilion)

00:01:58,710 --> 00:01:59,910
What's going on here?

31
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,910
What is that?

32
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,270
Greetings, Your Godship.

33
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,780
The other day, I visited Qingchi Palace,
but you were not there.

34
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,270
Just now, I went there again.

35
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,710
Steward Chang Que said
you were here in the Nether Realm.

36
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:36,020
- So, I...
- What do you want me for?

37
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:44,230
A few days ago, some lords said
they hadn't seen you for a long time.

38
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,460
So, they asked me
to invite you to the Heavenly Palace.

39
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,860
Bring my message to them, then.

40
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,230
I like to be quiet
and don't like to leave my palace.

41
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,970
You don't need
to present yourselves to me every year.

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,340
And you're busy with serious affairs.

43
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,460
We don't need to talk, either.

44
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,430
Your Godship...

45
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,680
Leave me alone.

46
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:06,900
Your Godship.

47
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:12,520
We immortals are all grateful to you

48
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,620
for protecting us
in the Immortal-Demon War.

49
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,900
Why must you be so insensitive?

50
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:20,390
I understand I'm not
important enough to invite you.

51
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:23,830
But all the immortals are inviting you.
Will you still ignore us?

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,020
Just to protect you immortals,

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,020
I personally killed Yin in the Ghost Land.

54
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:32,750
Hasn't it satisfied you enough?

55
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,020
So, you're still obsessed
with that Water Divine Beast.

56
00:03:38,470 --> 00:03:40,750
That year, she colluded with devils
and killed Lan Feng.

57
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,670
The truth hasn't been figured out yet.

58
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,950
You didn't give justice to Lan Feng,
it's fine.

59
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:49,080
But that beast deserved more than death.
You shouldn't have...

60
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:49,920
Enough!

61
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,060
Was Yin related to Lan Feng's death?

62
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,560
Were you immortals in the wrong?

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,830
You've kept silent,
but you know that better than anyone.

64
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,620
If you dare to slander Yin again,

65
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,020
I think I can pick a more
sensible Acting Heavenly Empress.

66
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:15,460
Don't be angry, Your Godship.
I just thought of Lan Feng

67
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,870
and the passion of the moment
made me contradict you.

68
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,460
Please forgive me.

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,300
A thousand years ago on Wutong Island,
I asked you a question.

70
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:34,980
Your Highness, did you just help me out?

71
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,950
You replied...

72
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,580
Just a little favor.
It's not even worth mentioning.

73
00:04:40,390 --> 00:04:43,510
That's how we met each other.

74
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:46,460
How we met each other?

75
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:52,870
Then tell me. Who else was there,
except for Ling Feng?

76
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,720
It happened so many years ago
and it was really dark at that time.

77
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,420
The sun didn't even set.
How could it be dark?

78
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,460
Did you not remember?

79
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,750
Or was it not even you?

80
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:09,120
I... I...

81
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,150
If I hadn't got to know
Feng Yin actually helped me out,

82
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:14,100
I would always believe it was you.

83
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:16,780
I didn't know you had
deceived me for over a thousand years.

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,830
You told so many lies,

85
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,560
making me think I owed you quite a lot.

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,350
When everybody else objected,
I still lent you the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

87
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:28,020
What did you do?
You made it your own weapon.

88
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,310
It was the shield of Daze Mountain.

89
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,780
If it had been there to protect my sect...

90
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,390
I lied to you because I wanted so much
to resolve the crisis of my clan.

91
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,540
It was my fault.

92
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,190
For the sake

93
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,510
that I lent you our sacred item,
the Peacock Feather Crown,

94
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,000
and Lan Feng lent you
the Xuan Pond water...

95
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,340
If you hadn't, for the Wanyi Sacred Fire
you used on Yin,

96
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:01,150
you think I would let you live?

97
00:06:07,630 --> 00:06:10,950
You're still alive
only for Lan Feng's sake.

98
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:12,950
Behave yourself.

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,320
Get lost!

100
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,070
Ao Ge, how dare you hit me?

101
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,980
Without informing anyone,

102
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,720
you broke into the barrier of my realm

103
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,110
and paraded like this.

104
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,460
It's so disrespectful of you.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,020
Forget it. You get lost.

106
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,540
If you do this again, I won't show mercy
even though you're the Acting Heavenly Empress.

107
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,990
Miss, can you give it back to us?

108
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:08,870

So, the last portion

132

turned out to be Yin a thousand years ago.

Lord Xiu Yan, if you hadn't
gathered or nourished my spirit,

134
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,060
I wouldn't be alive now.

136
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,200
I didn't expect you to become
the Phoenix Queen.

137
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,200
This is great.

138
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,390
Do you really not want to
catch up with that guy?

139
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,820

If I catch up with everyone,
it will take me forever.

Now, I'm on Wutong Island,
being carefree as the Phoenix Queen.

144
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:05,230
Why should I recall the bad memories
from the past?

145
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,940
Yin, you...

146
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,180
I'm just here for some catching up.

147
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,150

If it was true, who could steal his sword?

152
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,900
Your Godship, you've been waiting
for quite a long time.

153
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:45,820
But waiting can't give you what you want.

154
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,110
You should go back.

Your Ladyship, he's a True God.
Isn't it inappropriate?

157
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,300
Now that he doesn't leave,

158
00:13:46,550 --> 00:13:50,150
getting wet in the rain
for a while won't be a problem.

159
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:08,820
Master, I can feel your spiritual power
is starting to collapse.

160
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,420
How about go back to Qingchi Palace
and have some rest?

161
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,990
I spent a thousand years
looking and waiting for her.

162
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,060
Finally, I've found her.
I want to talk to her.

00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:19,990

Even though you're the Phoenix Queen,
you can't drink this just as you wish.

179
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,080
I made it for my best friend.
No one else can drink it.

180
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:05,900
For your best friend?

181
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:11,220
A thousand years ago,

182
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:18,310
you gave me the Eagle-eye Stone,

183
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,460
saying I could summon you
even for the wine thing.

184
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:27,100
If you need my help, you can summon me
with this Eagle-eye Stone,

185
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,390
and I'll show up right away.

186
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:32,030
Will you show up
if we summon you with it for a drink?

187
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:41,630
Does it still count now?

188
00:18:43,350 --> 00:18:45,270
This is the Eagle-eye Stone I gave Yin.

189
00:18:45,270 --> 00:18:46,150
How come you...

190
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:11,180
Are you Yin?

191
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:19,630
Yin. Is it really you, Yin?

192
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,660
I'm surely not dreaming, am I?

193
00:19:27,750 --> 00:19:29,350
Where did you go?

194
00:19:43,310 --> 00:19:45,980
I thought I could never see you again.

195
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,460
We looked for you for a long time.
Where have you been?

196
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:03,550
Why are you the Phoenix Queen?

197
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,660
What happened to you?

198
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:08,590
I even failed to recognize you.

199
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,390
We never knew what would happen.

200
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,700
Yin searched hard for Feng Yin.

201
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:24,630
She even exhausted her spiritual power
at the cost of her life

202
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,740
to get Feng Yin's immortal spirit back
from the Nether Realm.

203
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,790
So, she was trying to find herself.

204
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:33,630
Yeah.

205
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:39,660
No one of us ever expected this.

206
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,110
Just now, I saw the wine and the cottage.

207
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,870
And you called me Yin.

208
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:57,830
I felt everything was where it started.

209
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:00,830
Before, Yin was
a low-level Water Divine Beast

210
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,790
and was despised by the immortals.

211
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:08,870
But now, you are
the most honorable Phoenix Queen.

212
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,540
I really want all the immortals
who bullied Yin to know this

213
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,980
and make them cry together.

214
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,790
Before the devils are found,

215
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:20,150
I can't expose my identity too much.

216
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,800
All right.

217
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:26,230
What about Yuan Qi? Does he know?

218
00:21:26,230 --> 00:21:27,260
He does.

219
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,660
You...

220
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,700
We got this straight.

221
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,150
I used to be Yin. But now, I'm Feng Yin.

222
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,430
What's gone is gone.

223
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,000
Feng Yin,

224
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:48,440
Yuan Qi has also been
investigating that case.

225
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:49,280
I know.

226
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,430
But it's his duty, isn't it?

227
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,310
And he's making up
for his arbitrary decision.

228
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:56,310
Actually, I've been thinking.

229
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,870
Is it possible that Yuan Qi had
some reason he didn't tell us?

230
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,550
It's been a thousand years.

231
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,260
I have no more energy
to guess what he was thinking.

232
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:15,840
Just let it go.

233
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:18,560
All right.

234
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,260
Now that you've made up your mind,

235
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,350
I'll say no more about your relationship.

236
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:25,710
Let's go to see Jiu, then.

237
00:22:25,710 --> 00:22:27,830
When he sees you, he'll be so happy.

238
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,180
He made all that wine for you.

239
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,280
Yin.

240
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,040
Yin.

241
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:50,310
Is that really you?

242
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,740
Haven't seen you for a long time,

243
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,560
Jiu.

244
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,830
I've been looking all over for you.

245
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:36,150
Yin,

246
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,660
you must have suffered a lot.

247
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:41,180
I failed to protect you.

248
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:45,430
I'm so glad that you're back.

249
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:47,350
This is great.

250
00:23:50,310 --> 00:23:51,870
I won't lose you ever again.

251
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,870
Jiu,

252
00:23:56,590 --> 00:23:57,870
now I'm Feng Yin.

253
00:24:03,270 --> 00:24:06,590
When I see you're exactly what you were,

254
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:11,700
what I've suffered
in the past thousand years is worthy.

255
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,870
Oh, I have something to ask you.

256
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:26,070
Demon King Lin Sen was injured
by the Wind Lord's sword.

257
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,310
This case isn't clear enough.

258
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,110
Actually, we've made private conclusions.

259
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,150
Yuan Qi is capable in some ways.

260
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:38,230
The devils framed the Wind Lord
for killing Demon King Lin Sen.

261
00:24:38,230 --> 00:24:39,390
Yuan Qi already checked it out.

262
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,260
He did?

263
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:43,310
But the record didn't say that.

264
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:48,670
The Wind Lord insists we shouldn't alert them
before catching the mole of devils.

265
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,150
So, only we know about this.

266
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,180
If you want more information,
why don't you talk to the Wind Lord?

267
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:57,390
That would be better.

268
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,070
When you're back,
you have to rush for the old trouble.

269
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:10,700
Actually, Qing Yi and I reported
to the Heavenly Palace several times

270
00:25:11,590 --> 00:25:13,790
that Jiu was manipulated by the devil.

271
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,030
But we didn't have enough evidence.

272
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,790
Our testimonies
weren't authenticated, either.

273
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,870
So, we failed to help a lot.

274
00:25:22,550 --> 00:25:23,420
Don't feel guilty.

275
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:26,390
I'm back now.

276
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:32,310
A lot of mysteries should be unlocked.

277
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,700
Why is he so weak?

278
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,940
Who in this world could hurt him?

279
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:44,940
The Phoenix Queen. But not really.

280
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,430
She didn't hurt His Godship.
She didn't do anything.

281
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:49,590
But she's Yin.

282
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,390
What did you say?

283
00:25:54,820 --> 00:25:57,350
Yin, whom His Godship
had been looking for,

284
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,460
turned out to be the Phoenix Queen.

285
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,900
His Godship knew the truth
and his heart was broken.

286
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,260
Then he stood on Wutong Island
for ten days until he couldn't hold on.

287
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,950
But the Phoenix Queen
didn't even look at him.

288
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,900
His Godship should have closed-door cultivation
every seven days for spirit stabilization.

289
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:15,660
It was delayed
for such a long time that he collapsed.

290
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,790
Destiny is really hilarious.

291
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:24,150
Looks like she's the only one
who can hurt him.

292
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,800
Yu.

293
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,900
What are you doing here?

294
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:36,760
Master is sick. Badly sick.

295
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,150
I just picked this superior magic herb.

296
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,820
I meant to give it to Feng Yin.

297
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,390
You give it to Yuan Qi, then.

298
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:45,390
I don't think this herb will work.

299
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,660
What do we do, then?

300
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:49,660
What herb does he need? I'll go get some.

301
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,150
He needs Feng Yin.

302
00:26:53,310 --> 00:26:55,980
Can you invite her to Qingchi Palace?

303
00:27:01,110 --> 00:27:02,870
Give this invitation to the Wind Lord.

304
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:05,070
(To Wind Lord)
Do invite him to our island.

305
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,240
Yes.

306
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:17,630
Feng Yin.

307
00:27:23,030 --> 00:27:24,980
I made you some refreshing decoction.

308
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,260
I hear all these days,

309
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,540
you've been sitting here
and reading the documents.

310
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,660
I feel so sorry for you.

311
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,230
So, I made you this superior decoction

312
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:35,550
with the perception of Water Divine Beasts.

313
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,220
I know you care about me the most.

314
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,220
You've been working hard for a long time.

315
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:47,550
When you finish this,
shall I take you somewhere for a walk?

316
00:27:56,160 --> 00:27:59,070
Yu, why did you take me here?

317
00:28:00,510 --> 00:28:02,700
Here we are, anyway. Get in for a minute.

318
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,540
Come on.

319
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:04,840
It's Feng Yin.

320
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:10,550
Chang Que, I... Should I pretend to sleep
or should I go out to get her in?

321
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,390
- Sleep.
- Sleep?

322
00:28:13,790 --> 00:28:16,630
But in this case, I can't see her.

323
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,940
And I can't talk to her.

324
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,150
Then keep awake.

325
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,390
What if she thinks
I'm pretending to be sick

326
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:22,940
and leave immediately?

327
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,500
Feng Yin, come on. Come in here.

328
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:46,420
Feng Yin, Yuan Qi is so sick.

329
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:49,390
He doesn't take the decoction,
but only says your name.

330
00:28:57,590 --> 00:29:00,550
His Godship needs
more recuperation, I think.

331
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,630
I'll take my leave.

332
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,390
Feng Yin.

333
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,560
Thank you

334
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:14,700
for coming to see me.

335
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,180
You get me wrong, Your Godship.
I didn't mean to come.

336
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:22,420
If it weren't for Yu,
I wouldn't come here at all.

337
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,070
But I'm quite curious.

338
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:30,350
You're a True God. Why are you so sick
just after getting wet in the rain?

339
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:32,550
No.

340
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:35,870
Yuan Qi isn't pretending.
He truly feels bad.

341
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,830
I wish Yin could be here.

342
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,220
She's good at healing.

343
00:29:49,550 --> 00:29:53,420
Yu, she's been around you all the time.

344
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,310
Around me?

345
00:29:57,680 --> 00:30:00,420
The Phoenix Queen is Yin.

346
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,460
Feng Yin.

347
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,630
You're really my sister?

348
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,310
Sorry for not telling you before.

349
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,110
I am Yin.

350
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:28,830
Yin, I thought you left me
and would never come back.

351
00:30:30,110 --> 00:30:32,180
I really missed you.

352
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,460
I won't leave you anymore.

353
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,740
I'll always protect you.

354
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,310
Together with Yuan Qi.

355
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:56,870
Since you were gone a thousand years ago,
Yuan Qi has been taking care of me.

356
00:30:57,070 --> 00:30:59,710
He incubated me from the Xuan Lake

357
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:01,550
so that I took a human form.

358
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,660
The Xuan Lake?

359
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,760
Exactly.

360
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:10,220
His Godship destroyed Ningyun Mountain.

361
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:12,460
But he had taken out
the mouth of the spring.

362
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,830
With it, a new mountain could be built.

363
00:31:16,310 --> 00:31:19,420
And Yu managed to take a human form
with the nourishment of the spring.

364
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,940
His Godship wasn't
irrespective of Yin's feelings.

365
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,440
- He...
- Chang Que.

366
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:28,150
Yu,

367
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:31,260
go wait for me out there with Chang Que.

368
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,100
Will you?

369
00:31:34,590 --> 00:31:35,430
Go.

370
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,000
Feng Yin, actually I...

371
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,830
Thank you for the lake thing.

372
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:56,460
Without the lake, Yu couldn't have
come back to me with a human body.

373
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:58,940
It was thoughtful of you, Your Godship.

374
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:05,070
Since I'm here,
I'd like to talk things over with you.

375
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,740
Yin was a history.

376
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:10,420
Whether the playful Gu Jin
in the Forbidden Valley of Daze Mountain

377
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,350
or God Yuan Qi in Qingchi Palace,

378
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,630
you are just a guest
in my life over thousands of years.

379
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,350
What happened a thousand years ago

380
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,700
can't stir up anything in my heart now.

381
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,500
What's done can't be undone.

382
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:35,260
Now, I just want to figure out
the truth of the devils' revolt

383
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:39,390
to propitiate the dead of Daze Mountain.

384
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,110
Time to vindicate Yin, too.

385
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,840
Farewell.

386
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:27,150
Your Highness, the new Lightning Lord is here
to report about the birthday banquet.

387
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:30,000
Get her in.

388
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:46,770
Your Highness, on your instructions,
I've prepared the birthday banquet.

389
00:33:46,770 --> 00:33:50,980
By then, I'll say your Star of Love
fluctuated with God Yuan Qi's.

390
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:53,940
The Cloud Lord will bring out
rosy clouds all over the sky,

391
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,060
to present your boundless beneficence
and you should be the Heavenly Empress.

392
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:00,460
The five of us also arranged
the Peacock Totem along the Heavenly River.

393
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,420
With so many good omens,
God Yuan Qi will be touched.

394
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:07,740
Thank you for your work.

395
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:10,860
Take her away for some rewards.

396
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:13,430
Thank you, Your Highness.

397
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:16,740
Hope you and God Yuan Qi can get married.

398
00:34:26,510 --> 00:34:29,340
Your Highness, everything is ready.

399
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:31,760
But what if God Yuan Qi doesn't come?

400
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:32,990
Do what we're supposed to do!

401
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:38,070
He knew it wasn't me
who helped him out a thousand years ago.

402
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:42,260
Now, he doesn't care about me at all.

403
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:47,820
I have to pretend nothing went wrong
in case someone else sees through it.

404
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:52,110
But Your Highness, there is
no such thing as keeping secrets.

405
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,820
I know I can't keep it for a long time.

406
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,740
There're only a few months before the election
for the Heavenly Emperor or Empress.

407
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,220
But I still have a way to go
before becoming a demigod.

408
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,910
If someone else knows
Yuan Qi fell out with me,

409
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,070
my efforts over the thousand years
will be all wasted.

410
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:24,340
Now, I have to cover this
and think of another way.

411
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,510
The Phoenix Queen has left.
Why didn't you go after her?

412
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,660
Why didn't you explain to her?

413
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,470
If you don't go,
I'll go tell her everything.

414
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:45,430
Then she won't hate you.

415
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,160
Stop.

416
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:49,860
Your Godship...

417
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:54,740
I should take the blame for my mistakes.

418
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,430
Even if I explain it to her,
how will that help?

419
00:35:59,110 --> 00:36:00,340
Will she forgive me?

420
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,030
Considering my current conditions,
I'll be scared if she really forgives me.

421
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:12,180
Besides, she should hate me.

422
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:19,150
I can't make up for what I owe her,
however much I do now.

423
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:25,740
I just want to accompany her
and keep her safe before I'm gone.

424
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:30,740
Whether she forgives me
doesn't really matter.

425
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:39,910
What a surprise.
We looked for Yin for years.

426
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:42,590
She came back as the Phoenix Queen.

427
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,070
But sadly, it's not
that convenient to see her.

428
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:49,590
She's an immortal while I'm a demon.

429
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:51,990
But she isn't that snobbish, anyway.

430
00:36:58,110 --> 00:37:00,660
You've been waiting
thousands of years for him.

431
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:03,780
He never gave you a direct answer.

432
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:10,510
There has been
someone else in his heart.

433
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,380
You know he loves someone else.

434
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:16,470
Why do you still want to wait for him?

435
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,430
Shuang, it's time
to make a decision.

436
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,760
Yan Shuang.

437
00:37:29,510 --> 00:37:30,350
Yan Shuang?

438
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:32,720
Yan Shuang.

439
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:36,910
Yin and Feng Yin feel quite different.

440
00:37:37,150 --> 00:37:39,340
What do you think? Is it good or bad?

441
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:51,820
Hong Yi. I'm going back
to my clan for some business.

442
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:54,380
In three days, I'll see you
in the Pear Blossom Cottage.

443
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,700
I have something
very important to tell you.

444
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,200
What is it? Tell me now.

445
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,110
Come and you'll know.

446
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,340
Promise me you will come.

447
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:09,740
Don't worry. I'm a man of my word.
I won't stand you up.

448
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,220
Where did this come from?

449
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,260
God Yuan Qi and Chang Que
sent it here early this morning.

450
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,690
His Godship is really thoughtful.

451
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,860
Everything he has brought here
is what Her Ladyship favors.

452
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,260
What is God Yuan Qi up to?

453
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,860
He firmly asked to break off the engagement.
After he finally got what he wanted,

454
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,430
he began to fawn on our queen again.

455
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:50,630
"Get Back Together".

456
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,950
Get back together? How?

457
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,780
They didn't even talk too much.

458
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,380
Did he fall in love
with our queen at first sight?

459
00:39:02,630 --> 00:39:05,700
Feng Huan. This is way too ostentatious.

460
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:07,740
Put it away.

461
00:39:24,030 --> 00:39:24,870
Aunt.

462
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:28,110
You're sort of mysterious.
What do you want?

463
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:32,260
Aunt, please do me a favor.

464
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:35,700
Well, let me guess.

465
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:40,860
Feng Yin's tribulation had something
to do with your junior sister Yin.

466
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,910
You knew it?

467
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,820
You insisted on
breaking off the engagement.

468
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:49,820
After seeing Feng Yin a few times,
you deigned so much,

469
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,510
and even got wet in the rain
and gave her a lot of presents.

470
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,740
You changed your attitude so sharply

471
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,740
that every immortal was astonished.

472
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,590
I had to think more about it.

473
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,820
Besides, Feng Yin's return
seems to have something to do with you.

474
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,660
To be honest, Aunt,

475
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,380
Feng Yin was my junior sister
in Daze Mountain,

476
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:10,870
Yin.

477
00:40:13,710 --> 00:40:17,660
You killed her personally?

478
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,030
Actually, this is what really happened.

479
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:30,630
No wonder she always shuts you out.

480
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,380
You hurt her twice.

481
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,700
How could she give her heart to you again?

482
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:40,510
Do you regret it?

483
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,510
When I saw her disappear in front of me,

484
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,860
my heart was broken with extreme grief.

485
00:40:48,550 --> 00:40:52,030
But even if I hugely regretted it
in the past thousand years,

486
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:54,630
I still couldn't do anything
to change what happened that year.

487
00:40:55,150 --> 00:40:56,070
All I can do is hate.

488
00:40:56,630 --> 00:41:00,950
I hate myself
for making the worst choice in a hurry.

489
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:03,260
There's no coming back from that.

490
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:06,190
Letting it go is good for both of you.

491
00:41:06,190 --> 00:41:08,910
Aunt, I take the blame for my mistakes.

492
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,380
But I really can't let go
of my love for her.

493
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,740
In the past thousand years,
she was the only one in my heart.

494
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:17,180
I won't love anyone else.

495
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,360
I... I don't expect her love again.

496
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:24,070
I just want to occasionally accompany her

497
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:29,470
before I have to leave this world.

498
00:41:46,190 --> 00:41:49,510
Taming My Master.

499
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:53,380
Acting cute,

500
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,110
provocation,

501
00:41:57,030 --> 00:41:58,380
and hypnotism.

502
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,590
You said we can't
perform the Moonlight Illusion Formation well,

503
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,980
because I don't have the same mind as you.

504
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:04,510
So this is your mind?

505
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:12,990
Such a unique lotus cart.

506
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,430
And so many story books are in it.

507
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,350
The man who made it
must be very thoughtful.

508
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,150
Just some toys.

509
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,280
Master.

510
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:33,590
Yuan Qi told me
what happened between you.

511
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,590
I didn't expect you
to have experienced that much.

512
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:43,030
Master, just take it as a story.

513
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:44,550
Don't bother about it.

514
00:42:47,630 --> 00:42:49,150
I don't mean to persuade you.

515
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:50,720
Feng Yin,

516
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,340
you have a tough temper.
I don't need to say too much.

517
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:02,300
But if you really miss the right man,

518
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:07,030
you can't get him back,
however much you miss him.

519
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,470
A thousand years have passed

520
00:43:12,510 --> 00:43:15,950
and the love has long gone.

521
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:21,220
But I'm afraid
Yuan Qi won't easily give up.

522
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:26,340
He's just mistaking
his regret for deep love.
