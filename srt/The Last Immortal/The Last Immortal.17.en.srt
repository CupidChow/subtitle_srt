=The Last Immortal=

28
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,980
=Episode 17=

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,070
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly is held
for the peace among the Three Realms.

30
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,550
The leaders of the Immortal, Demon,
and Nether Realms will all be here then.

31
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:53,500
The God Realm will also
send envoys to attend the event,

32
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,330
which rarely happened in the history.

33
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:58,500
We must proceed with caution
and attach great importance to it.

34
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,630
Therefore, I have a suggestion.

35
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:10,580
Do you still remember the finger bone
of Lord Zhen Yi, the progenitor of demons?

36
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,990
Of course we do.

37
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:19,110
It's a holy item of the Demon Realm.

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,270
It somehow ended up
in the Immortal Realm 10,000 years ago.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,690
But, the strong demonic energy it gave off

40
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:27,230
was against the spiritual energy
in the Immortal Realm,

41
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,710
so, the Heavenly Emperor back then
set up an All-inclusive Formation

42
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,620
to keep the finger bone.

43
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,780
I'm thinking even though
we've been protecting it carefully,

44
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:40,020
the finger bone is after all
a holy item of the Demon Realm.

45
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,060
In the recent years, the grudge between
the two realms has become even deeper.

46
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:48,340
If we can give the finger bone back
to the Demon Realm at the Assembly,

47
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,830
it'll be a great gesture
to show our sincerity of ceasefire.

48
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,060
What do you all think?

49
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,230
It is a good idea,

50
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,110
but it's a little difficult to handle.

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,980
The All-inclusive Formation
is in the Secret Storeroom,

52
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,430
the only place in our Immortal Realm
that sustains demonic energy.

53
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,150
If we take the finger bone out,

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,620
I'm afraid it'll be damaged
by the spiritual energy in our realm

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,110
before we could return it to the demons.

56
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,620
That's right. If that happens,

57
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,990
the demons will not forgive us for sure.

58
00:03:18,630 --> 00:03:19,470
True.

59
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:24,270
Then, let's forge an Energy Protection Arrow
to store the finger bone.

60
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,300
I know it'll cost a lot to forge such an arrow.

61
00:03:28,710 --> 00:03:32,990
But it'll benefit the future
of both realms. It'll be worth it.

62
00:03:33,590 --> 00:03:35,760
(Courageous and Fearless)
An order tablet inlaid with gold.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,570
Forging the Energy Protection Arrow
is such an important matter.

64
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,150
They even issued a top-class order tablet.

65
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:47,510
The Hall of Arms and War God Hall
are ordered to forge the Arrow together.

66
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,390
It asks us to work together
with War God Hall.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,060
So, we'll need to go
to War God Hall often, right?

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,240
I guess.

69
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:59,950
Yan Shuang, let me be in charge
of the forging, okay?

70
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,990
Yin, it's the most important task
in the Heavenly Palace.

71
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:04,620
If you are doing this for Jin only,

72
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:07,270
should anything happen,
you'd be in big trouble.

73
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:09,950
I admit I'm doing this for Jin,

74
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,550
but I won't mess it up. I promise.

75
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,780
Okay, go ahead.

76
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:19,900
But, Yin, you've got to find out
how Jin really feels about you.

77
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,070
Don't make yourself get hurt.

78
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,830
These are all reliable immortals.

79
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,020
You did a good job.

80
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,190
How is it going with the forging

81
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,220
of the Energy Protection Arrow?

82
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:36,020
War God Hall
will be in charge of the design.

83
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,710
Since Immortal Gu Jin will see to it in person,
there'll be no problem.

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,190
That's for sure.

85
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,470
The Hall of Arms will also
send a capable official to assist him

86
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,460
with forging the arrow.

87
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:50,870
Yan Shuang is the Acting Head
of the Hall of Arms.

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,870
I guess she will send Yin.

89
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,680
After all, Yin is Gu Jin's junior sister.

90
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:59,100
I think Gu Jin would prefer working with her.

91
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,270
Let's go to War God Hall.

92
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,760
Yes.

93
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,980
Lady Hong Chou.

94
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:16,270
What brings you here?

95
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:19,510
I'm worried that you work too hard,
so I'm here to check on you.

96
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,070
I'm doing fine. Thank you for your concern.

97
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,360
I know that War God Hall is in charge

98
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,870
of the design of the Energy Protection Arrow.

99
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,630
Hua Shu happens to know a lot
about forging immortal weapons.

100
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:37,880
So, I brought her here to help you.

101
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,400
Aunt…

102
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:41,340
I'll leave you to work.

103
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,980
You can discuss it with her.

104
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,630
Since it's an order from Her Ladyship,
we'll have to obey it.

105
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:00,180
(War God Hall)

106
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:03,190
Long time no see.
You are just as broad-minded as always.

107
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,070
It makes me feel even more ashamed.

108
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,780
Let bygones be bygones.

109
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,660
I'm glad we are both fine.

110
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,660
I'm sure you are, but I'm not.

111
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,990
I heard you came to the Heavenly Palace
to assume the post.

112
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,340
Many times I thought about paying you
a visit and apologizing to you,

113
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,710
but I remember you said
you wanted to part ways with me,

114
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,750
so I dared not come to disturb you.

115
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:31,780
Your Highness, let's get down to business.

116
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,220
This is the design draft.

117
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,710
And these are the samples for the material.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,540
Please take a look and see
if anything needs improvement.

119
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:56,150
You didn't design it
based on the old patterns only.

120
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,580
Instead, you added a few new ideas to it.

121
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,780
I'm sure the immortal lords
will be satisfied.

122
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,150
Among all the samples, this is the best.

123
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:21,150
The patterns are engraved on the arrow body
to hold the spiritual energy.

124
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:23,630
It's also my favorite.

125
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,830
The Hall of Arms sent seven or eight samples.

126
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:29,540
Only the sample she made
is the most recognizable one.

127
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,270
She?

128
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,460
The pattern features pear blossom.

129
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:36,220
I can tell right away that it's made by Yin.

130
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,100
She enjoys Pear Blossom Brew,

131
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,510
and she decorates her yard with pear trees.

132
00:07:40,950 --> 00:07:43,420
And now, she even put
pear blossom pattern on the arrow.

133
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,830
She should change her name to pear blossom.

134
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,220
I envy the closeness between you and her.

135
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:53,710
You can recognize her work
from one pear blossom only.

136
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,340
Because all the things she does
are easy to notice.

137
00:07:57,430 --> 00:07:59,340
Lord Donghua taught you both well.

138
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,660
You are both capable and extraordinary.

139
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:05,780
Since the design and the material are decided,

140
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,220
if there's nothing else,

141
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,980
I'll let them get ready
and start to forge it tomorrow.

142
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,300
(War God Hall)

143
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,710
Why is the room sealed by a barrier?

144
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:31,940
(War God Hall)

145
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,110
The Arrow will be forged soon.

146
00:08:40,110 --> 00:08:43,750
I guess the Ministry of Works made a mistake
when they set the barrier for protection.

147
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,940
Anybody out there?

148
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,230
Anybody from the Ministry of Works?

149
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:55,020
How could they make such a careless mistake?

150
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,780
Anyway, the barrier is only set temporarily.

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,590
I think it'll be removed soon.

152
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,110
Let's wait for a while.

153
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,780
Then let's wait.

154
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:33,990
Did you make this armor
for the Spiritual Trigram Assembly?

155
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,990
Yin prepared it for me.

156
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,940
It seems that you haven't tried it on yet.

157
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,300
Since we have nothing to do at the moment,

158
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,750
why don't you try it on?

159
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,020
Maybe later.

160
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,780
If there's a problem, you can let
the Hall of Arms to fix it in time.

161
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,940
I'll put it on myself.

162
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,470
It fits perfectly.

163
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,230
Why can't I unbutton it?

164
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,540
The button is called knot-and-loop.

165
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:35,110
Once buttoned, it won't open easily.
But you need help to unbutton it.

166
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,300
Let me help you.

167
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:45,750
Thank goodness, it's not too late.

168
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:50,060
I bought Jin his favorite mung bean cakes
when passing by the market.

169
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,180
If it's this difficult,
I won't trouble you anymore.

170
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,300
When the barrier is removed,
I'll let someone else help me.

171
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:42,750
Sorry that I'm all thumbs.

172
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,180
It unbuttoned itself.

173
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:54,060
So strange.

174
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,700
Let me help you put it back.

175
00:11:57,030 --> 00:11:59,940
You can let the people
of the Hall of Arms alter it later.

176
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,190
Your Highness, what's wrong?

177
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:19,420
Nothing. Just a small cut.

178
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,630
Do you have medicine?

179
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,510
Here it is. Please apply it yourself.

180
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,510
Thank you, Your Lordship.

181
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,940
Your Lordship, you are young,
capable, and thoughtful.

182
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,940
You are one of the few young talents
in the Heavenly Palace indeed.

183
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:56,420
I wonder which female immortal
will be so lucky

184
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,350
to become your wife.

185
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,870
It'll be a lovely story in the Heavenly Palace.

186
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,780
I'm just a nobody.
A lovely story is an overstatement.

187
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,230
You and His Majesty, however,
are a happy couple in everybody's eyes.

188
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,660
I didn't agree to marry His Majesty.

189
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:17,820
So, "a happy couple"
may only be a false hope after all.

190
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:20,540
Aren't you two about to get married?

191
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:25,630
That day at the birthday banquet,
you were probably just saying,

192
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,900
but I can't get over what you said.

193
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,820
I always feel that I owe you.

194
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:37,180
But after thinking about it,
I found that aside from guilt, I actually…

195
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:40,350
Forget it.

196
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,660
People tend to find out

197
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:46,180
what they really want after they lose it.

198
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:52,060
Jin…

199
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,740
If you act up again,
I'll dip you into a sauce jar.

200
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:02,580
Do you hear me?

201
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,660
Sorry, Your Highness.

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,870
My sword misbehaves a lot lately.

203
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,870
I'll teach it a lesson later.

204
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,820
(War God Hall)

205
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,870
Your Highness, the barrier has been removed.

206
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,700
I'm a little hungry.
I'll go grab something to eat.

207
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:34,280
You may go back now. See you.

208
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
(Secret Storeroom)

209
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:48,780
(Darn it. They almost caught me again.)

210
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,750
(Although I'm the Combat God
of the South Pole,)

211
00:14:51,150 --> 00:14:54,060
(I've been suppressed by Gu Jin,
the War God of Yunling.)

212
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:55,270
(If I go back to Wutong Island,)

213
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:57,270
(I'll be replaced by Feng Yin in the future.)

214
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,110
(There'll be no place for me anymore.)

215
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,390
(No matter how hard it is,
I have to listen to Zhuo Ying)

216
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,470
(and find the God-killing Flower's seed
in the Secret Storeroom,)

217
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,700
(and then plant it in the immortal vein
of Daze Mountain)

218
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:10,110
(to prevent Feng Yin from being revived.)

219
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,990
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly is held
for the peace among the Three Realms.

220
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,270
Master, why are you going?

221
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,940
I'm hiding in Hong Ruo's body right now.

222
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,110
They can't detect my devil energy.

223
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:29,030
It's a good timing for me
to attend the Assembly.

224
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:31,950
Nothing has happened between the Immortal
and the Demon Realms for so long.

225
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,020
It's time to break the peace.

226
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,900
How is it going
with the God-killing Flower's seed?

227
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,150
Feng Ming went
to the Secret Storeroom already.

228
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,230
But it's sealed by a barrier.

229
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:48,150
It can't be opened unless combining
Lan Feng's permission document with Wind Lord's.

230
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,350
But Feng Ming has no access
to the permission documents.

231
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:56,940
Feng Ming is just a low-rank official
in the Heavenly Palace. He's useless.

232
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:00,780
We need someone more powerful to help us.

233
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:03,940
(Infinite Cave, Bainiao Island)

234
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,510
I've cultivated for years,
yet I still can't make any progress.

235
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,870
My damaged immortal spirit
still remains unhealed.

236
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,800
Your Lordship.

237
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:36,870
Who is it?

238
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,180
Someone brought you a gift.

239
00:16:41,630 --> 00:16:42,470
Bring it.

240
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,150
(This is the thumb ring I lost when I
killed the Eagle Elder in the Infinite Cave.)

241
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,870
(That day, when the Eagle Clan
went to check the cave,)

242
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,500
(I thought this thing would be exposed,)

243
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,220
(but someone moved the body in advance.)

244
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:16,180
(Could it be the one
who brought me this gift?)

245
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:41,550
I happened to gain a magic elixir
which can improve your cultivation base.

246
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,980
If you want to level up more,
I'd like to hear from you soon.

247
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:46,660
Hong Ruo.

248
00:17:52,350 --> 00:17:53,900
Hong Ruo of the Fox Clan?

249
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,180
I knew as a wise man, you would come

250
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:14,900
for sure.

251
00:18:16,310 --> 00:18:18,260
You know I can't improve my cultivation base,

252
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,350
so you lured me here with a magic elixir.

253
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:21,980
You went through so much trouble

254
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,180
must be because you need my help.

255
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:30,900
Since you came, it means you also need mine.

256
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:33,740
It's a cooperation.

257
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,390
You are not Hong Ruo.

258
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,390
Then who am I?

259
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,870
The power in the elixir that you gave me

260
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:51,220
is non-Immortal, non-Demon, and non-Nether.

261
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,700
It's not from the Three Realms.

262
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:56,310
And yet, it can exist
against the Law of Heaven and Earth

263
00:18:56,830 --> 00:18:59,070
and improve one's cultivation base effortlessly.

264
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:04,460
Such an evil thing can only
come from the Abyss.

265
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,150
You are a devil.

266
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,030
Even so,

267
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,900
why can't I, Hong Ruo, become a devil?

268
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,460
Hong Ruo fought me once.

269
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,830
She would never meet with me in private.

270
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,870
You are smart indeed.

271
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:34,350
What I want is simple.
I want to rule the Three Realms.

272
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:38,380
If you help me, I can not only teach you
our ways of cultivation

273
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:39,950
to help you improve your strength,

274
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:43,830
but also make your Bainiao Island
a prestigious clan matched by none.

275
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,180
I help you rule the Three Realms,

276
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:51,740
and you can only
make our clan prestigious in return?

277
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:53,660
Then what do you want?

278
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,350
The entire Immortal Realm.

279
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,740
You can rule the Three Realms,

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,830
but the Immortal Realm must be in my control.

281
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:06,070
I appreciate ambitious people like you.

282
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:07,870
No problem.

283
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:12,390
To show my sincerity,
I'll give you a big gift first.

284
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,660
I'll help your daughter Hua Shu
become one of the five Immortal Lords.

285
00:20:17,830 --> 00:20:21,870
You can persuade those top-rank sects?

286
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,110
The older they are,
the more secrets they have.

287
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:35,550
When you have the goods on them,
you can make them do anything.

288
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,030
But, in return,

289
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,310
I want you to convince your daughter
to do something for me.

290
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,180
Deal.

291
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,060
(The Hall of Arms, Heavenly Palace)

292
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:08,870
Give me.

293
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,180
You are a hard worker indeed.

294
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,180
Carry so many at once.

295
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:17,940
But, if you mess the documents up,
it's so not worth it.

296
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,500
(Courageous and Fearless)

297
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,030
You brought mung bean cakes
to War God Hall?

298
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,320
What's wrong?

299
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,950
You saw Hua Shu, so you are upset?

300
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:44,520
You misunderstood.

301
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,180
That day, we were somehow
trapped inside by a barrier.

302
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:51,790
If you don't believe me,
I'll summon the Spirit Sword.

303
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,790
If I'm lying, let it slash me.

304
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:54,630
No need.

305
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,590
You are its master.
It'll do whatever you ask it to do.

306
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,310
How do you know I'm not fond of Hua Shu?

307
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,110
You remembered something?

308
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,500
You never liked her, right?

309
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:18,630
Look.

310
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:22,940
Bamboo dragonfly.

311
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,830
Don't you remember what day it is today?

312
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,180
What day?

313
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:31,030
Come with me.

314
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,750
- It's so beautiful here.
- It is.

315
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,660
Come on.

316
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:34,500
We are here.

317
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:38,350
Why are we here?

318
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:39,830
You'll see.

319
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:41,660
Right here.

320
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,660
Close your eyes.

321
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,390
- No.
- Listen to me.

322
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,420
Let's go check over there.

323
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,840
- Eyes closed?
- Yes.

324
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,190
Are you done yet?

325
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,030
Don't talk.

326
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:00,150
Ready?

327
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,350
Three.

328
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:02,390
Two.

329
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,560
One.

330
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:14,260
Bamboo dragonflies.

331
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,310
So many of them.

332
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:21,310
Happy birthday, Yin.

333
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:27,110
You remember my birthday?

334
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,420
What are you talking about?

335
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,790
I got you out of the eggshell
and brought you up.

336
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:34,630
How can I not remember your birthday?

337
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:37,080
♪Reminiscence and nostalgia♪

338
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:40,040
I miss the old days
when it was easy to take care of you.

339
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,460
Now, you're so quick-witted.

340
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:45,460
Yeah.

341
00:23:46,920 --> 00:23:48,260
I miss the old days, too.

342
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,030
At that time, you didn't forget me.

343
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:55,590
Don't take nonsense. I'd never forget you.

344
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:59,390
But you. Don't forget I brought you up.

345
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:01,550
Do grow up healthily.

346
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:02,660
And when you grow up,

347
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,180
don't let a young man steal you away.

348
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:06,870
You even keep the Log of Desirables.

349
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,540
When you want to get married,

350
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:11,870
have me check the man first.
Did you hear?

351
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,590
Also, I'll mobilize everyone in our sect

352
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:19,390
to hold the grandest wedding for you.

353
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
I don't want that.

354
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,140
Whatever.

355
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,860
I don't want to check the man, either.

356
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,820
I didn't learn to make the bamboo dragonflies
until I read the mortal books for days.

357
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:32,060
And I spent a few more days
making so many of them.

358
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:33,060
Aren't they lovely?

359
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,550
They are.

360
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:39,400
♪Forever♪

361
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:40,820
I'm glad you like them.

362
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,140
(You remember the bamboo dragonfly,)

363
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,740
(but you don't remember
it was your betrothal present for me.)

364
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,300
(The Hall of Arms)

365
00:24:56,300 --> 00:25:00,580
Yin from Daze Mountain
worked very hard in the Hall of Arms.

366
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:03,420
An impartial immortal like her
should be a good model.

367
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:09,540
So, His Majesty made her the supervisor
of the Arsenal of the Hall of Arms.

368
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:11,300
She'll take her post today.

369
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
This is your tablet.

370
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,380
(Arms)
Congratulations.

371
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:28,500
(Arms)

372
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,380
Yin, you made it.

373
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,940
The supervisor of the Arsenal
is a fifth-rank position.

374
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,140
You can claim your own place now.

375
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,940
The application is ready.

376
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,540
I'm going to submit it now.

377
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,140
Ningyun Mountain, here I am.

378
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:55,420
(The Hall of Fortune, Heavenly Palace)

379
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,250
(Yin, the supervisor
of the Arsenal of the Hall of Arms,)

380
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,860
(applies for the ownerless Ningyun Mountain for
private cultivation. Hope it'll be approved.)

381
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:09,900
Yin wants to apply for Ningyun Mountain
as her home.

382
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,860
What are you going to do, Your Highness?

383
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,100
Ningyun Mountain
hasn't appeared for many years

384
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,820
and now it's ownerless.

385
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,580
Maybe someone else
wants this mountain, too.

386
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,420
(Application for Claiming Land)

387
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,540
Your Highness, you have to
review so many files every day

388
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:57,740
and a lot of immortals deliver the files.

389
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,540
It's normal that you overlook some.

390
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,260
Give them to the messengers.

391
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,340
Yes.

392
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,580
Your Highness, His Majesty is here.

393
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:32,900
Greetings, Your Majesty.

394
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,740
You may rise, Shu.

395
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:36,820
This isn't a serious meeting.

396
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:38,460
You don't need to curtsy.

397
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,270
Your Majesty, you're always
strict and impartial.

398
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:44,060
I'll always keep that in mind
and never be insubordinate.

399
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,100
Shu, you're still angry with me.

400
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,420
I don't dare to.

401
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,220
Your Majesty, how may I serve you?

402
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,100
For the Spiritual Trigram Assembly,

403
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,380
heads of all clans
will come to the Heavenly Palace.

404
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,260
We should do the honors
and entertain them

405
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,420
instead of being impolite.

406
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:05,980
I thought it over.
Shu, I think you're the best fit.

407
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:09,260
I don't dare to reject it, Your Majesty.

408
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,300
I'll do my best to take care of this.

409
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:14,740
Shu, do you have to talk like this?

410
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:19,060
Your Majesty, if you have
no more assignments, I'll get going.

411
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,820
Shu...

412
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:36,300
Fine. I'll leave you alone.

413
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,120
Your Highness,

414
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,860
His Majesty loves you.

415
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,180
And you like him, too.

416
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,180
Why are you still angry with him?

417
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,860
I like him, but so what?

418
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:09,380
The prosperity of my clan
matters much more than my happy life.

419
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,660
Lan Feng is stubborn and righteous.

420
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,060
He'll never be partial
to Bainiao Island or me.

421
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,820
In this case,

422
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:21,540
instead of getting entangled,
I would rather make a quick decision

423
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,020
and break up with him.

424
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,900
For my clan,

425
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,340
I guess I need to find a new way out.

426
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:35,740
(I must land Gu Jin
and get some help from the God Realm.)

427
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,820
Hongque,

428
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,920
have you got the ancient books
from Bainiao Island I asked for?

429
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:44,340
I've got you all the books
on the whereabouts of the parasol tree.

430
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,780
Yin, here's the reply to your application.

431
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,700
Thanks.

432
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:02,860
What?

433
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,700
Why the long face?

434
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:14,900
Too many immortals
have applied for claiming land.

435
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:17,180
My application hasn't been approved yet.

436
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,380
I have to wait in line.

437
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:22,500
I don't know how long I'll have to wait.

438
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,420
It doesn't matter.

439
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,860
A good thing takes long pain. Let's wait.

440
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,100
You'll get it.

441
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,020
(The Nether Realm)

442
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,008
(The Spiritual Trigram Assembly
will be held again.)

443
00:30:42,032 --> 00:30:43,480
(We sincerely want to make peace
with your realm.)

444
00:30:43,490 --> 00:30:45,720
(Nether King, you're invited to come
and attend this great event of peace.)

445
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:50,060
(Invitation to the Spiritual Trigram Assembly)

446
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,340
You never like to visit a crowded place.

447
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,500
Why are you leaving
for the Heavenly Palace in advance?

448
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:01,140
Many immortals and demons
are wealthy and respectable.

449
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:07,020
When I'm there, I can trade with them
for more spiritual items.

450
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,380
It takes more days, obviously.

451
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,420
Why are you so stubborn?

452
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:22,340
(When I sneaked to the Heavenly Palace,
I couldn't break into the barrier.)

453
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,900
(This time, I'll follow him in there)

454
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:27,740
(and ask the Heavenly Matchmaker
to tie me up with Ao Ge.)

455
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,740
The Giant Spirit Clan.

456
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,940
They're useless, irritable, and warlike.

457
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,420
Have some mild maids to welcome them.

458
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,500
Yes.

459
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,300
Kunlun Mountain.

460
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:43,140
Their grandmaster is highly respected.

461
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,860
I should welcome him personally.

462
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,780
Nether King Ao Ge.

463
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,860
Your Highness,

464
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,060
the Nether King has a queer temper.

465
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,380
Even the slightest lapse may annoy him.

466
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,140
We shouldn't mess with him.

467
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,260
You want me to serve a guest of honor?

468
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:09,940
Princess Hua Shu is authorized
to take care of the reception thing.

469
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:12,620
She can deploy any official
no higher than fifth rank.

470
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,700
What? Are you going to disobey her?

471
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,780
Now, I'm in charge of the manufacture
of the Energy Protection Arrow.

472
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,660
Everyone here has a job to do.

473
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:23,220
If they're all like you,
we can't deploy anyone, can we?

474
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:24,700
I...

475
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,920
This is the Heavenly Gate Tablet.

476
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,340
The mission is also included.

477
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,900
(Five)
A guest of honor will arrive at five.

478
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,300
Helpers are ready for you.

479
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:36,020
Remember. Without the tablet,
you can't open the Heavenly Gate.

480
00:32:36,180 --> 00:32:37,380
Don't be late.

481
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:39,820
Why aren't you going, then?

482
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:51,940
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

483
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,100
Your Majesty, it's half past three.

484
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,860
The Gate isn't opened yet. Ridiculous.

485
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,940
What are the immortals up to?

486
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,180
(I don't know who is coming.)

487
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,940
(But I'll be there one hour earlier.
I will not be impolite, then.)

488
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,700
Ao Ge, the Nether King,
always hates unpunctual people.

489
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:29,820
We'll see how Yin can
offend the Nether Realm.

490
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:34,540
When she's in trouble,
you can help her out, Your Highness.

491
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:38,580
Then you'll take credit and win honor.

492
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,700
Let's wait and see.

493
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,100
Nether King?

494
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,260
Why did you break in?

495
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,660
You had me waiting for one hour.

496
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:05,700
Is this your way of treating a guest?

497
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,620
What do you mean?

498
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:09,740
His Majesty arrived at three.

499
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:11,620
But no one came when it was nearly five.

500
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,580
Such a deliberate snub.

501
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,580
Are you not respecting us at all?

502
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:15,980
That's not true.

503
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,860
Hongque told me you would come at five.

504
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:19,940
I even came here one hour earlier.

505
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,060
Calm down, Your Majesty.

506
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,860
I'm Hua Shu from Bainiao Island.
Greetings, Your Majesty.

507
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,300
My subordinate failed her job.

508
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,780
Please forgive her, Your Majesty.

509
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:31,900
Hongque...

510
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,100
Yin, what is wrong with you?

511
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,140
I asked you to welcome the Nether King.

512
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,580
Couldn't you even do this right?

513
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,780
That's not true, Your Highness.

514
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:40,540
Hongque told me... She...

515
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:42,060
When you've made a mistake, apologize.

516
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:43,540
Stop finding excuses for yourself.

517
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:44,540
I'm not finding excuses.

518
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:46,980
The Heavenly Gate Tablet says five.

519
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,860
Look.

520
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,220
(Three)

521
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:01,220
Every mission on the tablet is restrained.

522
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,260
It can't be tampered with.

523
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,660
Your Majesty, it was thoughtless of me.

524
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,540
Yin is a fifth-rank official
in the Hall of Arms.

525
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:10,780
I had meant to give her
more job opportunities.

526
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,460
Unexpectedly, she was late.
Sorry, Your Majesty.

527
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,860
You failed your job
and tried hard to deny it.

528
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:19,140
You deserve severe punishment.

529
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,420
Somebody.

530
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,740
Take down the official
who was late for her job.

531
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,990
- Yes, Your Highness.
- Yes, Your Highness.

532
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:24,900
That's not true.

533
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,980
Did I say I would punish her?

534
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:40,220
Whether I should arrive at three or five,
I have the final say.

535
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,020
An ordinary official can't tamper
with a Heavenly Gate Tablet.

536
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:51,060
But with a demigod tool, it'd be simple.

537
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,180
(Five)

538
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,460
Such a simple trick, huh?

539
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,700
Your Highness.

540
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:12,540
It's my fault.

541
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,620
I stole the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
and tampered with the tablet.

542
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:18,620
I'm guilty, Your Highness.
I'm ready for punishment.

543
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,980
Hongque, how dare you!

544
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:24,820
Make amends to His Majesty.

545
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,740
Now that you said so,

546
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,940
I wouldn't say no.

547
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:36,620
Think about how to make amends, then.

548
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,820
Last time, we parted hastily
in the Nether Realm.

549
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,820
I didn't expect to see you again so soon.

550
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,860
Lead the way for me.

551
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,500
Your Majesty, thank you
for helping me out.

552
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
It's not time to say thank you yet.

553
00:37:09,380 --> 00:37:11,380
I'm never a nice person.

554
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:14,940
You're still of use to me, after all.

555
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,020
You don't need to be so honest.

556
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,900
What have you got lately?

557
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,460
Have you found spiritual items

558
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,180
to exchange for the Fire Phoenix's spirit?

559
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,580
We will exchange something
for the two portions of her spirit.

560
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:38,500
But something else has happened lately.

561
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,980
After I handle it,

562
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,460
I'll go find the best spiritual items

563
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:44,380
for the exchange.

564
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,780
The best spiritual items in the world?

565
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,660
You don't need that much trouble.

566
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,980
This is the token
with free access to the Nether Realm.

567
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:01,620
If you make up your mind, come to me.

568
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:05,020
Don't bother.

569
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,580
Your Majesty.

570
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:18,260
Like I said, we won't exchange
Yin's spiritual power for anything.

571
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:20,660
Don't waste your time on her.

572
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,260
I'm not in a hurry.

573
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,660
You'll come to me sooner or later.

574
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:31,340
Remember. You are
always welcome in my realm.

575
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,620
I heard you would come to welcome Ao Ge

576
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,100
and I knew you would talk
about the exchange thing.

577
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:47,140
What?

578
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,820
If I hadn't stopped you,
would you really go?

579
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:52,260
I just thought I could consider it.

580
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,300
Because I wanted to help...

581
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,180
This isn't what you should consider.

582
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,660
Ridiculous.

583
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:22,940
When did you stalk me?

584
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:25,540
I didn't stalk you.

585
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,580
I was hiding in your sleeve
and you just didn't find me.

586
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:33,020
I was asleep and accidentally fell.

587
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:34,380
Or you wouldn't have found me.

588
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:36,740
Don't find excuses.

589
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,620
Your Majesty,

590
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:42,860
I wanted to know
what the Heavenly Palace looked like.

591
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:43,980
So, I came to have a look.

592
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,620
I promise I won't make trouble.

593
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:52,820
How about you have Yin watch over me?

594
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:56,620
Yin, when you watch over me,
I won't make trouble, right?

595
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:00,020
That's right.

596
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,380
Well, Your Majesty,

597
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,180
you don't want to talk
with anyone else, right?

598
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:08,340
When she is around, she can help you.

599
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,820
When you keep silent,
I'll take it as a yes.

600
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:22,340
Yin.

601
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,900
This is great.

602
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,820
I met you as soon as I came here.

603
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,340
Let me see. Are you
already in a relationship?

604
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,420
Yeah. I should put it down
in my record book.

605
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:42,660
Three-life Stone.

606
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,500
Yin is my junior sister.

607
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,460
Stop matching the wrong couple.

608
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:52,100
I...

609
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,220
(War God)
I'm in some haste.

610
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,300
Yin.

611
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,340
Show her around here.

612
00:41:01,620 --> 00:41:02,460
I should go.

613
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:05,620
But I...

614
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:12,300
Why... Why do I think
he's treating you quite differently now?

615
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:22,340
You're saying someone removed
Gu Jin's affection ties?

616
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:26,380
Jiu used a Bewitching Spell
to have tested that.

617
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,100
We're almost sure.

618
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,180
Weird.

619
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,980
Who did that? And why?

620
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,420
Three-life Stone. I want
to ask you a question.

621
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,020
You're in charge of the marriage thing.

622
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:44,380
So, will people around you
have some love delusions,

623
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,860
affected by your spiritual power?

624
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:52,820
Love delusions?

625
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,540
You may think you like someone

626
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,580
and do intimate things involuntarily.

627
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:03,580
But such are just delusions. Is that so?

628
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,940
If I had that power,

629
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,780
I wouldn't be waiting for Ao Ge
for thousands and thousands of years.

630
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:12,860
Love comes from the heart.

631
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,500
No one can control it.

632
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,860
I knew it. What happened that night was true.

633
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,300
Yin, I like you.

634
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:24,220
The master-servant contract is gone.

635
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,980
But can a marriage contract

636
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,140
keep us together forever?

637
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,060
What should we do with Gu Jin now?

638
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:50,940
He can't always live
without affection ties, can he?

639
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,460
The Heavenly Matchmaker.
I'm sure he has a solution.

640
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:55,500
Let's go get him now.
