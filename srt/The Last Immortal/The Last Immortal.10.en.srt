Yin.

30
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,500
Let me show you something great.

31
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,520
How about it?

32
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,750
Do you like it?

33
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,580
It's nice.

34
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,950
I thought you would like it a lot.

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,460
You are upset.

36
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,550
Are you being unhappy

37
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,780
because Gu Jin is about to

38
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,620
marry Hua Shu?

39
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:38,020
Didn't you say

40
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,300
you would let go?

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,500
I'm fine,

42
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
really fine.

43
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,430
I'm feeling

44
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,540
particularly refreshed today.

45
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,460
I'm sure I can search
through ten mountains.

46
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,520
I'm off!

47
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,340
Didn't you hear me?

48
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,580
You were flying aimlessly

49
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,060
and even ended up
in someone's forbidden barrier.

50
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,850
Do you know how dangerous that is?

51
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:14,430
I didn't notice.

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,270
Thanks, Jiu.

53
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,460
If you are not in the mood,

54
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,550
don't force a smile.

55
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,320
Today, let's not look
for Ningyun Mountain.

56
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,270
Come on.

57
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,630
Let me take you to the Demon Realm.

58
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,230
I guarantee you'll be so drunk

59
00:03:30,230 --> 00:03:32,120
that you can't remember
what Gu Jin looks like,

60
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,620
let alone be sad for him.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm not sad for him.

62
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:38,270
Why would I be sad for him?

63
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:00,620
Yan Shuang!

64
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,020
Stop lying on the ground.

65
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,460
Can you stand?

66
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:44,750
Don't... Don't come near me.

67
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:45,870
Did you use that thing on me?

68
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:47,660
Don't look at me.

69
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:48,790
I'm telling you,

70
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,150
I won't fall for your tricks again.

71
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:52,040
My Bewitching Spell is not something

72
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,150
I use casually on anyone.

73
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:56,590
I'm not

74
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:57,790
interested in you.

75
00:04:57,790 --> 00:04:58,630
- Yan Shuang.
- You...

76
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,220
Are you okay?

77
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,070
Those people are from the Peacock Clan.

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,000
But I heard that

79
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,350
the Eagle Clan and the Peacock Clan
have agreed to a ceasefire.

80
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,190
Why are they still...

81
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:10,660
Hua Yan was captured by me once.

82
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,000
He lost face

83
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,460
and wants to regain it.

84
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,670
In the end,

85
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,190
if Gu Jin hadn't given
the Umbrella to Hua Shu,

86
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,840
the situation wouldn't have tilted
towards the Peacock Clan.

87
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,190
And my father wouldn't have lost to Hua Shu,

88
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,390
suffering severe injuries.

89
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,190
You can't say it that way.

90
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:30,340
If it weren't for your Eagle Clan

91
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,630
being too greedy,

92
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:33,100
wanting half of

93
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,190
the Peacock Clan's Blessed Cave

94
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,870
and even severely injuring

95
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:37,910
the Peacock King,

96
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:40,000
Gu Jin wouldn't have felt sympathy

97
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,310
and given the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
to Hua Shu.

98
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,270
That's nonsense.

99
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:46,100
Hua Mo and his daughter
are distorting facts.

100
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,000
Hua Mo's internal injuries

101
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,310
date back to over a hundred years ago

102
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,620
when he lost to my father

103
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,750
during the War of Immortals.

104
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,150
He lost face,

105
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
and somehow, forced cultivation

106
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,870
and injured his own internal core,

107
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,230
making it difficult for him to progress
in his immortal cultivation.

108
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,980
It was not caused by us.

109
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,980
But Hua Shu,

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,830
she severely

111
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:03,340
injured my father in a battle.

112
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:06,590
That's why I went to fetch
the Blue Blood Reishi to heal my father.

113
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:09,430
But everyone in the Immortal Realm says
that you instigated the Peacock Clan

114
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,580
and forced them into war.

115
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,220
That's ridiculous!

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:13,760
Yin,

117
00:06:13,950 --> 00:06:15,430
I just wanted to persuade Bainiao Island

118
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:17,270
to open the barrier of their Infinite Cave

119
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
so that I could search for

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,190
my missing clan members.

121
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,660
They refused

122
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,110
and slandered us,

123
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,160
accusing us of coveting

124
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,740
their Blessed Cave.

125
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:26,620
What a joke.

126
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,460
Yan Shuang,

127
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,020
is what you said all true?

128
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:31,940
If you want to verify its authenticity,

129
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:33,070
come with me to the Eagle Island.

130
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,340
There's plenty of evidence there.

131
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,390
This matter is very important to me.

132
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,220
I'll go with you.

133
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:42,700
- What?
- Yin,

134
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,390
aren't you going
to the Demon Realm with me?

135
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,780
The war is over,

136
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:48,150
and this matter

137
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,460
has nothing to do with us.

138
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,150
I'm afraid that Gu Jin, the big fool,

139
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,870
was used as a pawn

140
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:53,980
and does not even know it.

141
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:03,950
The Peacock King is hosting a banquet
for the guests.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,240
Instead of going there,

143
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,870
you came here to drink alone.

144
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,270
I feel free here.

145
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,710
Besides, the wine on Bainiao Island isn't good.

146
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,510
It's even not as good as

147
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:13,750
the Pear Blossom Brew made by Yin.

148
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:19,190
Why do I keep thinking about that girl?

149
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:23,710
Wait a moment.

150
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,600
Why did you take down

151
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,580
(Guiyue Pavilion)
Her Highness's favorite Magpie Feather Lantern?

152
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,310
It's a rare item found this year

153
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,560
on the Qiqiao Festival

154
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,830
on the Magpie Feather Pathway.

155
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,310
You don't have any discernment at all.

156
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,710
(Magpie Feather Lantern?)

157
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,390
Magpie Feather Lantern,

158
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,510
that man gave her a Magpie Feather Lantern.

159
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,100
I'll confront her!

160
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,160
(Didn't Hua Shu have a pain attack)

161
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,540
(on the Qiqiao Festival?)

162
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,270
(I knew Yin would not lie.)

163
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,110
And later,

164
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,460
Her Highness is going to the pavilion
in the backyard.

165
00:07:55,950 --> 00:07:57,190
The people who came this time

166
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,600
are all admirers of

167
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,440
Her Highness.

168
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,830
Keep your mouth shut

169
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,920
and don't let anyone go there

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,150
to disturb Her Highness.

171
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,590
Understood.

172
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,830
Take it back and hang it up.

173
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,510
Martial Uncle,

174
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,020
you are making me dizzy.

175
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,560
Are you feeling heartbroken

176
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,310
because Princess Hua Shu didn't go
to your appointment on the Qiqiao Festival

177
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:39,200
and instead went to the Magpie Bridge
with someone else?

178
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,870
Or is it because

179
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,440
she claimed to be
in seclusion for healing

180
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,780
to avoid you?

181
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,700
Neither.

182
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,540
It's just...

183
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,700
I just feel a bit uncomfortable.

184
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,110
Back on Wutong Island,

185
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,940
Princess Hua Shu saved me.

186
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,270
I couldn't help but want to

187
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,180
be closer to her.

188
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:02,600
Even though it's been ten years
of my one-sided affection,

189
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,550
I've never

190
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:04,660
pressured her.

191
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:06,510
If she truly has any difficulties,

192
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,300
why can't she tell me openly?

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,000
The romantic books that circulate widely

194
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,300
in the Mortal Realm all claim that

195
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,780
if you fall in love with someone,

196
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:15,720
you'll change your

197
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,750
principles.

198
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:19,180
Some people even
confuse right and wrong.

199
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,270
What does it mean?

200
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,820
Martial Uncle,

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,060
ask yourself

202
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,240
if you would overlook

203
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,540
Princess Hua Shu's deceit and lies

204
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,420
and do something
against your own principles.

205
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,510
If everything is clear

206
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:33,710
and understood,

207
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:34,550
then

208
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,540
it's not love.

209
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:38,680
What is it then?

210
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,910
You admired her because

211
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:42,470
she stood up for you.

212
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,080
That sounds like gratitude.

213
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,060
Gratitude?

214
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,320
Enough of that.

215
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:51,840
In any case,

216
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,820
we came here
for the Peacock King's birthday.

217
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,150
The proposal matter

218
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,390
should be postponed for now.

219
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:00,110
Well, Martial Uncle,

220
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,060
I thought

221
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,320
you were so nervous seeing Lord Hua Mo

222
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,480
that you forgot about the proposal.

223
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,510
So, I have

224
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,510
delivered the engagement letter

225
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:09,710
and gifts for you.

226
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:10,700
What?

227
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:13,220
Look at what you've done!

228
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,080
How could I forget?

229
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,440
I just felt that the proposal

230
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,510
was too rushed.

231
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,350
I can't believe this.

232
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:20,870
I was just trying to fulfill my duty

233
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,510
to avoid being scolded by Master.

234
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,700
What should we do now?

235
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,610
Making a decision in haste like this

236
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:28,260
is irresponsible to Hua Shu.

237
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,320
I'll go

238
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,180
apologize to her

239
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,470
and ask for the gifts back.

240
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,900
Are you bothered by something, Shu?

241
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,990
Lan Feng,

242
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:46,510
actually,

243
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,350
I came to return this to you.

244
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,550
Let's not meet

245
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,780
privately anymore.

246
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,540
Did I do something wrong?

247
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,560
No,

248
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,630
it's me.

249
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,350
That day,

250
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,230
when the Eagle King
held my brother hostage,

251
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,300
I fought desperately against him.

252
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:12,820
In a moment of panic,

253
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,110
I accidentally refined
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

254
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:16,700
This allowed me to defeat the Eagle King.

255
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,420
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella

256
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,630
is the guardian treasure

257
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:23,590
of Daze Mountain.

258
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,540
It's also the difficult situation I face.

259
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,750
Gu Jin came to the island
for my father's birthday

260
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:30,510
and brought the Sparkling Crown
and an engagement letter.

261
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:32,940
My father felt indebted,

262
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,900
so he accepted them.

263
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,060
You mean Gu Jin

264
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,510
also came to propose to you?

265
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,780
Gu Jin did me a great favor,

266
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:42,820
but I...

267
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:44,750
Now,

268
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,310
I can only marry Gu Jin

269
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:49,120
to atone for my mistake.

270
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,960
Shu,

271
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,390
what nonsense are you talking about?

272
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:54,440
If you marry Gu Jin

273
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,870
to repay him and atone for your mistake,

274
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,830
it is not only unfair to you and me,

275
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,110
it's also unfair to Gu Jin.

276
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,020
But I have no other choice.

277
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,960
I can't let my father and Bainiao Island

278
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,510
be disgraced.

279
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,510
- We can't be together in this lifetime.
- Shu,

280
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,270
this isn't the best decision,

281
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,390
and I won't let go because of this.

282
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,390
(My ten years of obsession)

283
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,820
(led to nothing.)

284
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:18,600
(That even caused Yin)

285
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,870
(to suffer grievances.)

286
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,510
(It's truly absurd.)

287
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,380
(Eagle Island, the Immortal Realm)

288
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,510
You've seen the letter of challenge
and war reports.

289
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:32,940
Do you know the truth now?

290
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,870
Yes.

291
00:12:34,270 --> 00:12:35,320
The Peacock Clan concealed

292
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,110
the true reason for starting a war
with the Eagle Clan,

293
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,020
distorting the truth

294
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,110
and falsely accusing the Eagle Clan,

295
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,530
which is truly despicable.

296
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,390
Moreover,

297
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:44,240
Hua Shu has refined
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella

298
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,270
and harmed my father.

299
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,020
Hua Shu refined
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella?

300
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,150
If Hua Shu had not made

301
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:51,840
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
into her own artifact,

302
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,600
how could she use

303
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,940
the Tiangang Energy of it?

304
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,670
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella
was a precious gift

305
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:57,590
from Jin's master.

306
00:12:57,590 --> 00:12:58,510
He just lent it to her.

307
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,150
How could she refine it
into her own divine tool?

308
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,630
Hua Shu is truly outrageous.

309
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:05,180
Gu Jin is kind-hearted,

310
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,020
I can't let him be deceived by her.

311
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,110
I have to think of a way.

312
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,350
He's kind-hearted?

313
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:11,630
I think he is

314
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:12,630
the most vicious man!

315
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:14,870
Even if he's gonna marry Hua Shu,

316
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:16,770
that's a mutual decision.

317
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,820
Everyone is happy.

318
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,820
Gu Jin's going to marry Hua Shu?

319
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,440
Yin,

320
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:29,820
I can accompany you to Bainiao Island

321
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:32,630
and bring back Gu Jin for you.

322
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:36,110
Anyway,

323
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:38,020
it will also benefit our Eagle Clan.

324
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:41,960
Okay.

325
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,390
No time to waste.

326
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:44,730
Let's set out immediately.

327
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:45,570
Let's go.

328
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,660
Early this morning,

329
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,180
Gu Jin sent a letter,

330
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:05,350
stating that the marriage proposal

331
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:06,300
is canceled,

332
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,460
and he won't take back

333
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,750
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

334
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

335
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,230
today is my birthday.

336
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:27,780
The first cup of wine,

337
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,270
I toast to all fellow immortals.

338
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,980
Thank you for coming from far and wide

339
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,510
to celebrate my birthday.

340
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,150
Enjoy.

341
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,660
For the second cup,

342
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,820
I would like to toast to Gu Jin.

343
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:53,820
Many thanks to you

344
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,130
for lending the Sky-shrouding Umbrella,

345
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:57,900
and saving Bainiao Island from crisis.

346
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:09,060
You are welcome, Your Lordship.

347
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,110
Today is your grand birthday banquet,

348
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,950
but I have

349
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,150
a small request.

350
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,020
Just say it.

351
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,320
I want to retrieve

352
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,150
the demigod weapon
I lent to Princess Hua Shu.

353
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,900
The artifact you mentioned is...

354
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,510
I was mischievous when I was little,

355
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,270
and Her Highness once

356
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:36,510
protected me on Wutong Island.

357
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,750
Grateful for her favor,

358
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,140
I lent the Sky-shrouding Umbrella

359
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,120
and the Sparkling Crown

360
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,180
to Her Highness to resist the provocations
of the Eagle Clan.

361
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:45,330
Now that the crisis
on Bainiao Island has passed,

362
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,030
Daze Mountain
has no intention of intervening

363
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:48,350
in the disputes between immortal sects.

364
00:15:48,350 --> 00:15:49,670
So, I want to reclaim

365
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:50,780
the Sparkling Crown early.

366
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,900
Please understand, Your Lordship.

367
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:53,110
You...

368
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:54,870
As for the Sky-shrouding Umbrella,

369
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,600
I heard that Her Highness

370
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,940
lost some immortal power
during the battle with the Eagle King.

371
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,110
Therefore, I gift the umbrella to Her Highness

372
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,470
as a token of gratitude
for her help back then.

373
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:09,870
Your noble character is truly admirable,

374
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,150
and I

375
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,150
am deeply grateful.

376
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:14,590
Come on,

377
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,870
bring the Sparkling Crown.

378
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:26,510
The Sparkling Crown?

379
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:28,390
They are really a great sect,

380
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,590
using a demigod tool to repay a favor.

381
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,230
The generosity is extraordinary.

382
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,500
A few days ago,

383
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,590
when Princess Hua Shu defeated
the Eagle Clan with the Umbrella,

384
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,200
many in the Immortal Realm suspected that

385
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,300
Daze Mountain intentionally favored
the Peacock Clan.

386
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,270
Today, Gu Jin's actions made it clear that

387
00:16:41,550 --> 00:16:42,910
he wants to distinguish himself

388
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:43,870
from Bainiao Island.

389
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,080
Alright,

390
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,300
I'll toast to Gu Jin.

391
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,150
Your Majesty.

392
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,320
Please.

393
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:17,900
Today, I am deeply moved.

394
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:20,940
I have long admired Princess Hua Shu,

395
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,260
but I couldn't do anything for her.

396
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,940
Today, I announce to everyone

397
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,180
my intention to seek marriage.

398
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,630
I hope

399
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:33,390
Princess Hua Shu understands that

400
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,830
regardless of Bainiao Island's response,

401
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,630
my feelings

402
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:40,030
will remain unchanged.

403
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,000
I also

404
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,660
toast Your Majesty.

405
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,510
Your Majesty and Your Highness

406
00:17:52,510 --> 00:17:53,420
are perfect for each other.

407
00:17:53,790 --> 00:17:55,110
If you can unite,

408
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:57,110
it will surely become a beautiful tale.

409
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,350
Thank you for the kind words, Gu Jin.

410
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:03,950
Cheers.

411
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,870
Cheers.

412
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,350
Gu Jin!

413
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:13,590
Gu Jin!

414
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:15,180
Jin!

415
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:17,820
Please undo the Umbrella's barrier

416
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,980
and let us in!

417
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,550
Let me in now!

418
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:31,900
Jin!

419
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:33,300
(Luanque Hall)

420
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:34,940
Yan Shuang?

421
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,030
Gu Jin!

422
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,870
They are my fellow disciple Yin
and spirit fox Jiu

423
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:43,420
from Daze Mountain.

424
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:46,720
Your Highness, please

425
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,660
remove the barrier

426
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,940
and let them get in.

427
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,580
Why has Daze Mountain's
Sky-shrouding Umbrella

428
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,780
turned into

429
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,180
Bainiao Island's barrier?

430
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,240
That's right!

431
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,260
Could it be that this demigod artifact

432
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,070
has been refined
by someone's internal core

433
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,350
and become others' magical tool?

434
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:18,750
Although Daze Mountain is a powerful force
in the Immortal Realm,

435
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:19,590
demigod artifacts

436
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:21,160
are extremely rare

437
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,900
and precious.

438
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:24,110
Everybody knows that

439
00:19:24,110 --> 00:19:25,200
what borrowed should be returned.

440
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,270
The treasure we lent to others

441
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,720
became their treasure in the end.

442
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,910
How can that be?

443
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,070
If we allow that,

444
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,250
who would dare

445
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,500
to lend a helping hand

446
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,880
when others are in trouble in the future?

447
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,720
Yin,

448
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,800
I've already given

449
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,420
the Umbrella to Princess Hua Shu.

450
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,110
It's not that she refused to return it.

451
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,180
From now on,

452
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:44,560
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
and Daze Mountain are unrelated.

453
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,590
It is totally at

454
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:48,070
Bainiao Island's disposal.

455
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:53,070
Are you out of your mind?

456
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,070
You're giving up the artifact
your master gave you

457
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,110
just to propose to Princess Hua Shu?

458
00:19:58,110 --> 00:19:59,430
Martial Aunt, it's not like that.

459
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:00,950
Before you came here,

460
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,160
Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng already

461
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,630
publicly proposed to Princess Hua Shu.

462
00:20:05,510 --> 00:20:06,630
Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng?

463
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,110
What are you waiting for?

464
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:14,740
Go and congratulate him.

465
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,080
Go.

466
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,940
Congratulations to Your Majesty.

467
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,420
Her Highness

468
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,700
is unparalleled in the Three Realms,

469
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:33,430
with both virtue and talent

470
00:20:33,430 --> 00:20:34,660
known throughout the world.

471
00:20:35,270 --> 00:20:36,310
That's great news.

472
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:37,660
So,

473
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,720
I

474
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:41,180
hope Your Majesty and Her Highness

475
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,910
make a perfect match.

476
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,390
Thank you for your kind words.

477
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,480
If Princess Hua Shu

478
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,470
(Luanque Hall)
agrees to my proposal,

479
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,430
I will inform all the fellow immortals.

480
00:20:50,430 --> 00:20:52,500
As for the unintentional mistake
made by Hua Shu,

481
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:53,870
I hope you can

482
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,460
not dwell on it

483
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:57,070
for my sake.

484
00:20:58,030 --> 00:20:59,510
It seems that Bainiao Island

485
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,740
is having three joyful events today.

486
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,630
Your Majesty,

487
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,740
today I want to ask

488
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:07,350
if you could

489
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:09,110
uphold justice for our Eagle Clan.

490
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,480
Yan Shuang,

491
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,010
our two clans
have agreed to a ten-year truce.

492
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,310
As long as your Eagle Clan

493
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:15,230
doesn't invade again,

494
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,220
Bainiao Island will certainly abide by it.

495
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,830
Yet, you've ignored the truce

496
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,150
and come to provoke trouble again!

497
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,000
Our Eagle Clan has been living
deep in the North Sea,

498
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,470
rarely interacting with others.

499
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,720
You probably don't know that

500
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,230
for hundreds of years,

501
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:28,400
our clan has been losing

502
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,310
members with profound spiritual powers.

503
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,750
I've wanted to go to the Heavenly Palace

504
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,070
to plead with Your Majesty,

505
00:21:33,270 --> 00:21:35,180
but my father didn't want
to disturb Your Majesty,

506
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,870
wishing to solve the matter himself.

507
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,390
Today, I happened
to meet Your Majesty here,

508
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,180
so I dared to report it to you.

509
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,640
My father is celebrating his birthday,

510
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,460
(Luanque Hall)
how can you keep causing trouble?

511
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,300
Guards,

512
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:46,630
escort them out!

513
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:47,700
Wait a moment.

514
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,320
Let her finish.

515
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,750
My father and our clansmen

516
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,060
looked for them many times,

517
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,460
but there was no sign of them.

518
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,070
Until a few years ago,
the Second Elder of our clan went missing,

519
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,070
then my father finally found a sign

520
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:08,230
of spiritual power
of our clansmen outside the Infinite Cave.

521
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,430
The Infinite Cave is
the possession of the Peacock Clan.

522
00:22:10,430 --> 00:22:12,070
My father came
to Bainiao Island in person

523
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,240
and asked the Peacock King

524
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,740
for permission for an investigation,

525
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,700
but he was rejected.

526
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:17,910
That's why

527
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,900
my father and the Peacock King
made a war treaty,

528
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,350
agreeing that if our clansmen

529
00:22:21,350 --> 00:22:22,950
can defeat Bainiao Island,

530
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,420
we'd be allowed to enter the cave.

531
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:25,630
Before we knew it,

532
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:27,550
the war has lasted for a hundred years.

533
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,320
Unfortunately,

534
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:31,270
we still ended up being beaten

535
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,790
by Princess Hua Shu's
Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

536
00:22:33,550 --> 00:22:34,550
What?

537
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,160
Didn't you say

538
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,830
the Eagle Clan challenged the Peacock Clan

539
00:22:40,070 --> 00:22:40,960
for taking over

540
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,660
the Blessed Cave at the North Sea?

541
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,770
Our Eagle Clan has always
lived a sequestered life.

542
00:22:46,770 --> 00:22:48,350
What would we need the Blessed Cave for?

543
00:22:48,750 --> 00:22:49,590
Besides,

544
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,270
I brought the war treaty

545
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,460
that the two clans made back then.

546
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:54,830
(War Treaty)

547
00:22:54,830 --> 00:22:55,740
It can prove

548
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:57,590
that I'm telling the truth.

549
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,180
Your Lordship, please allow our clansmen
to enter the cave for an investigation.

550
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:10,640
The Infinite Cave

551
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,220
is the secret area on our Bainiao Island.

552
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,030
It matters to the lifeline of our island.

553
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,380
What if

554
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,740
you go in there

555
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,980
bearing an ulterior motive?

556
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,150
It's a life and death matter.

557
00:23:21,550 --> 00:23:22,660
I'm sure the Eagle King

558
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,720
isn't lying

559
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:24,900
about the Infinite Cave.

560
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,100
Your Lordship,

561
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,220
please open the Infinite Cave.

562
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:30,420
Don't worry.

563
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,830
I'm here.

564
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,900
Nothing will happen to your island.

565
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,820
I will

566
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,180
go in with them then,

567
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,460
and verify the truth.

568
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,630
Fine.

569
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:45,760
Your Majesty,

570
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,220
I believe you'll uphold justice.

571
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,790
Then I'll make an exception and let you

572
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,310
go in the cave for an investigation.

573
00:23:56,270 --> 00:23:57,810
But, it's a one-time deal.

574
00:23:57,810 --> 00:23:58,900
In the future,

575
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,070
don't you Eagle Clan dare

576
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:02,980
step onto our island ever again.

577
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,460
Your Lordship, thank you
for your understanding.

578
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:09,630
Alright,

579
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,420
then I'll go back to my birthday banquet.

580
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:13,390
You may leave now.

581
00:24:14,110 --> 00:24:15,030
Wait.

582
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,940
(Luanque Hall)

583
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,500
Immortal Gu Jin,

584
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,550
what is it?

585
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,420
Your Lordship,

586
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:29,980
after the battle a while ago,

587
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,110
you and the Eagle King

588
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:32,940
agreed on a ten-year truce, right?

589
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,080
That's right.

590
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,980
I suggest you

591
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,030
change it

592
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,110
to a 100-year truce.

593
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,190
What do you say?

594
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:45,310
Immortal Gu Jin, it's a private matter
between the Peacock Clan

595
00:24:45,310 --> 00:24:46,630
and our Eagle Clan.

596
00:24:47,550 --> 00:24:49,790
With all due respect,
it's none of your business

597
00:24:50,270 --> 00:24:52,220
despite the high prestige
of Daze Mountain.

598
00:24:52,830 --> 00:24:53,790
When Princess Hua Shu

599
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:55,790
came to Daze Mountain to borrow
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella,

600
00:24:55,790 --> 00:24:57,960
she never said it was
a private matter between the two clans.

601
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,390
Ten years is too short.

602
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,030
If the two clans

603
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:03,350
fight again after ten years,

604
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,790
the Eagle Clan is no match

605
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:05,900
for the Umbrella for sure.

606
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,500
According to the rules
of our Daze Mountain,

607
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,720
we aren't supposed to get involved
in any fight in the Immortal Realm.

608
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,590
But the Eagle Clan lost

609
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:11,670
because I lent the Umbrella

610
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,110
to Hua Shu.

611
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:15,070
I must be responsible for it.

612
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,310
Your Lordship,

613
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:18,590
please consider it on my account.

614
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:20,900
What if

615
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,460
I say no?

616
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:42,350
If Bainiao Island disagrees
to make it a 100-year truce,

617
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,110
ten years later,

618
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,590
when the two clans fight again,

619
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:47,590
our Daze Mountain will fight side by side

620
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:48,790
with the Eagle Clan.

621
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,870
Gu Jin,

622
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,790
don't be like this.

623
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,790
Our Bainiao Island
doesn't want to make war at all.

624
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,700
No matter it's ten or one hundred years,

625
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:25,680
it makes

626
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,870
no difference to me.

627
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,590
I just don't like it

628
00:26:30,590 --> 00:26:32,160
when someone else

629
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:33,830
makes a decision for me.

630
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,740
The peace of the Immortal Realm
is all that matters.

631
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:42,760
Fine.

632
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:44,550
You got it.

633
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,050
For the next 100 years,

634
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:47,790
the North Sea will remain in peace.

635
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,270
His Majesty and all immortal friends here

636
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,390
will be the witnesses.

637
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,150
I will

638
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,830
keep my promise,

639
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,220
and I won't eat my word.

640
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,790
Your Lordship, please forgive me

641
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,070
if I

642
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,900
offended you just now.

643
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:12,110
Alright,

644
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,220
since everything is settled,

645
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,670
let's go inside and enjoy the banquet.

646
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:17,900
My master has just ascended.

647
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,830
There are a lot of things
to take care of in our mountain.

648
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,180
I won't disturb you anymore.

649
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,070
I'll take my leave now.

650
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,460
Take care.

651
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:27,150
Let's go.

652
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,000
I'm impressed.

653
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,110
You were so cool.

654
00:27:39,590 --> 00:27:41,030
I was just being myself.

655
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:42,790
Thank you for standing up

656
00:27:42,790 --> 00:27:44,230
for our Eagle Clan today.

657
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,240
I'll leave now and report back

658
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,900
to my father before it's too late.

659
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,550
If you need my help,

660
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,350
you can summon me
with this Eagle-eye Stone,

661
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,740
and I'll show up right away.

662
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,000
Will you show up

663
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,630
if we summon you with it for a drink?

664
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,720
You bet.

665
00:27:58,270 --> 00:27:59,110
Jiu,

666
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:00,700
thank you for speaking up for me just now.

667
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,260
I wasn't helping you.

668
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,870
I just couldn't stand

669
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:06,150
their arrogance.

670
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:08,800
You…

671
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,030
You need to report back
to the Eagle King, right?

672
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,520
Go ahead.

673
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,280
Okay.

674
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,030
Why are you shy?

675
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,940
How could I be shy?

676
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,040
Let's go.

677
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,630
Please wait.

678
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,260
Immortal Gu Jin,

679
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,710
Her Highness

680
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,940
wants to talk to you in the pavilion.

681
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,150
Please find a place
and wait for me for a while.

682
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,070
I'll be right back.

683
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,330
If you are unhappy,

684
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:49,820
you should've stopped him from going.

685
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:50,980
I'm not unhappy.

686
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,660
Immortal Gu Jin,

687
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:55,720
please have a seat.

688
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:57,180
No need.

689
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,740
Your Highness, just cut to the chase.

690
00:28:59,070 --> 00:28:59,910
Jin,

691
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,390
when I visited you in Daze Mountain,

692
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:02,790
I didn't lie to you.

693
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,200
My father did get injured

694
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:05,550
when fighting the Eagle King,

695
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:07,070
and his internal core was damaged.

696
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:08,900
If it hadn't been an emergency,

697
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:10,220
- I wouldn't have…
- Your Highness,

698
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,630
I once admired you,

699
00:29:12,630 --> 00:29:13,740
but I'm not stupid.

700
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,270
For some words, it's enough to say it once.

701
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:16,830
Otherwise, it'd only make things worse.

702
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,180
What does that mean?

703
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,190
The Eagle Clan

704
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,750
only wants to go into the Infinite Cave

705
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,710
to investigate the missing cases
of their clansmen.

706
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:24,660
Even though you were defeated
by the Eagle King,

707
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,900
he didn't harm Bainiao Island at all,

708
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,950
right?

709
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,540
If I lose,

710
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,750
all sects in the Immortal Realm

711
00:29:30,750 --> 00:29:31,920
will think our Bainiao Island

712
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,940
is weak and easy to bully,

713
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,820
and they'll all pick on us in the future.

714
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,200
So, to make sure your Bainiao Island

715
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,310
can rule the North Sea,

716
00:29:38,030 --> 00:29:39,270
you took advantage

717
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:40,190
of my kindness

718
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:41,670
and refined the Umbrella on purpose?

719
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:43,150
I didn't do it on purpose.

720
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,630
Our clan was in danger

721
00:29:45,630 --> 00:29:46,700
when fighting the Eagle King.

722
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,110
Otherwise, I wouldn't

723
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:48,980
have refined the Umbrella.

724
00:29:49,270 --> 00:29:50,310
Your Highness,

725
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:52,480
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella

726
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,950
is a demigod weapon.

727
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,180
The outsiders may not know,

728
00:29:55,790 --> 00:29:57,430
but my master has connected the Umbrella

729
00:29:57,430 --> 00:29:59,900
with the secret area of Daze Mountain
in order to protect me.

730
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,180
Even if a demigod wants to refine it,

731
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:04,390
it'd take at least half a month.

732
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,160
There's no way for you to do it

733
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,550
during the brief moment

734
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,630
when you fought

735
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,150
the Eagle King.

736
00:30:10,590 --> 00:30:11,940
Since you know it all,

737
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,960
why did you still give the Umbrella
to me

738
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,260
in front of all immortals?

739
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,350
Why didn't you just call me out?

740
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,400
Because even though you told

741
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,460
a lot of lies,

742
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,830
at least you were truthful about one thing

743
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,240
that the Peacock King's
immortal power was damaged.

744
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,900
As a female immortal,

745
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,440
you had to step up

746
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,880
and take charge of the entire Bainiao Island,

747
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,720
it was not easy.

748
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,940
I didn't take the Umbrella back

749
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:35,260
because at least you didn't lie

750
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:36,940
about that.

751
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
Your Highness,

752
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:40,500
it's my pleasure to know you.

753
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,150
I'll always remember

754
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:43,310
you helped me before.

755
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,660
But from now on,

756
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:45,950
you and I

757
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,390
shall part ways.

758
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,960
I wish you

759
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:51,740
and Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng
a happy marriage.

760
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,660
There's a long way ahead of us.

761
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:54,630
The Three Realms are huge.

762
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,200
I hope you and I

763
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,180
will never cross paths again.

764
00:30:58,400 --> 00:30:59,240
Take care.

765
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,080
Your Highness.

766
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:12,680
I thought that Gu Jin

767
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,010
was being loyal to you.

768
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,150
Even though he knew
you'd marry His Majesty,

769
00:31:16,150 --> 00:31:17,940
he was still willing
to give you the Umbrella.

770
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,160
As long as he still

771
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,430
had feelings for you,

772
00:31:20,430 --> 00:31:21,870
you could always use him in the future.

773
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,460
It's all that Yin's fault.
She messed up everything.

774
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,790
And our Bainiao Island was humiliated

775
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:27,500
in front of all immortals because of her.

776
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,740
That Yin

777
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,790
is quite annoying indeed.

778
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:32,390
Although I don't want him,

779
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,550
I can't let others have him either.

780
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,640
Most of all, I can't let him take

781
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,870
the Eagle Clan's side.

782
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,490
She didn't come to your appointment last night

783
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,070
not because of some unbearable pain,

784
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,380
but because she had an appointment…

785
00:31:53,510 --> 00:31:54,660
She was with someone else.

786
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,740
What do you mean?

787
00:31:57,110 --> 00:31:58,220
Stop acting recklessly.

788
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,540
What do you mean by acting recklessly?

789
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,900
I really saw it.

790
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,350
You don't believe me?

791
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:13,830
(Come to think of it,
my feelings for Hua Shu)

792
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,870
(were more like
an admiration in my childhood.)

793
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,550
(But when it comes to Yin,)

794
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,350
(I'm happy)

795
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,260
(whenever I see her happy,)

796
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:21,980
(and I'm sad)

797
00:32:22,550 --> 00:32:23,660
(whenever she is.)

798
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,350
(What does that mean anyway?)

799
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,320
(Oh, no.)

800
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,500
(I'm sure Jin is still hung up on Hua Shu.)

801
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,790
(With what just happened,)

802
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,180
(we put Hua Shu in a difficult position.)

803
00:32:35,750 --> 00:32:37,460
(He can never win her heart now.)

804
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,000
Jin.

805
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:53,760
Yes?

806
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,150
Sorry.

807
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,630
We caught you off guard

808
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:58,480
when telling you

809
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,710
the truth,

810
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:00,630
and we embarrassed you.

811
00:33:01,590 --> 00:33:02,710
So sorry.

812
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:03,750
What are you talking about?

813
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:05,310
I… I wasn't…

814
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,550
I was the one who sent Yin and Yan Shuang.

815
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:09,390
If you want to blame someone, blame me.

816
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:10,310
Don't say that.

817
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,420
(Are Yin)

818
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,220
(and Jiu…)

819
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,790
Why would I blame you guys?

820
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,350
Look how unhappy you are.

821
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,110
Let me make it up to you.

822
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:26,670
Chen Min told us that there's

823
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,240
a sycamore tree in the Nether Realm.

824
00:33:28,680 --> 00:33:29,700
I know a way

825
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,220
of entering the Nether Realm

826
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,790
without the identity of senior immortal.

827
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,900
What way?

828
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,390
In Chang'an of the Mortal Realm,

829
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:36,310
there's a secret tunnel

830
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,900
that leads directly to the Nether Realm.

831
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:38,790
Although the rule says

832
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,680
immortals aren't allowed
to enter the Mortal Realm,

833
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,960
as long as we don't use any magic skills

834
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,830
to disturb the mortals,

835
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:44,350
we won't be punished by Heaven.

836
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:45,560
Are you serious?

837
00:33:46,590 --> 00:33:47,790
Believe whatever you want.

838
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,540
Anyway, I'm not the one who owes

839
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,500
the Phoenix Queen a life.

840
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,700
It's not a bad idea.

841
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:54,150
We can give it a try.

842
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:56,760
Qing Yi,

843
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,200
you go back first
and tell our senior brothers

844
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,120
about what happened at the banquet.

845
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,220
We'll be back soon.

846
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,870
You won't take me?

847
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,760
Fine.

848
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:21,740
(The Mortal Realm)

849
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,260
(Imperial Palace)

850
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,740
The palace is heavily guarded.

851
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,300
(Imperial Palace)

852
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,630
Do you smell it?

853
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,540
What?

854
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,700
Something stinks.

855
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,870
Take it.

856
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,120
What is it?

857
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:51,390
It's the key

858
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:53,110
to entering the Nether Realm.

859
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,300
What do you mean?

860
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,470
It's cow dung.

861
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:57,680
Come on, take it.

862
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:01,550
One for each.

863
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:18,430
The eyes of the crows

864
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,470
are so spooky.

865
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:21,920
All they see

866
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,180
are people's nightmares.

867
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,430
What do you mean?

868
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,550
The Nether Realm sends the crows
to the Mortal Realm every night

869
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:28,430
to collect the most horrible nightmares.

870
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,510
And then transport them back
with an ox cart

871
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:31,430
and use them as energy.

872
00:35:32,150 --> 00:35:33,510
So, they have a special passage

873
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,070
for commuting between the two realms,

874
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:36,590
which is very secret

875
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,780
and undetectable.

876
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,800
Jiu,

877
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,150
you are so amazing.

878
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,670
You even know something like this.

879
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,630
It's no big deal.

880
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,470
I know a lot of things.

881
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:45,940
If you are interested,

882
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,190
I can tell you later.

883
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,380
Is there more?

884
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,760
It's coming.

885
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,910
I also know a lot.

886
00:35:56,440 --> 00:35:57,470
Hurry.

887
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,380
(Fruit Cakes, The East Market)

888
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:41,700
Shh.

889
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,320
(Oh, no.)

890
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,590
(Yin must)

891
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,340
(have wrong thoughts again,)

892
00:37:10,710 --> 00:37:13,180
(and it triggers
the master-servant contract to punish her.)

893
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,800
Are you alright?

894
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,240
Yin,

895
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,870
we'll go through the barrier soon.

896
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,760
Sit tight.

897
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,300
(Imperial Palace)

898
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:06,340
(The Nether Realm)

899
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:14,870
Jiu,

900
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:16,220
it's a good idea indeed.

901
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,660
But it's too smelly.

902
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,820
There was no

903
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:20,280
a better way to confuse the ox

904
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,300
than using cow dung.

905
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:22,950
Anyway, we are in.

906
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,220
(Cijian Pavilion)

907
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,790
I had no idea

908
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:39,110
the Nether Realm looks like this.

909
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,150
I thought this place

910
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,510
would be dark and creepy.

911
00:38:42,510 --> 00:38:43,350
It's nothing like

912
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:44,860
what I thought.

913
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,030
It's very hard

914
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,220
to enter the Nether Realm.

915
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,510
And the requirements for entering it

916
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:50,000
- are very strict.
- Wait for us.

917
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,620
Rarely could outsiders come to this place
in the past tens of thousands of years.

918
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,470
- So, the rumor is not true.
- Hurry.

919
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:58,510
- Come on.
- Go straight from here, and we'll get

920
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:00,400
(Cijian Pavilion)
to the Palace of the Nether King.

921
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:01,240
Let's go.

922
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,720
Okay.

923
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:08,420
(Zhongling Palace, the Nether Realm)

924
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:23,540
(Zhongling Palace)

925
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,030
The immortal spirit
of Feng Yin is right inside.

926
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:37,380
Please stop, guys.

927
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,910
I'm Gu Jin of Daze Mountain.

928
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:41,860
I'm here to visit the Nether King.

929
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,950
Please report for us.

930
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,820
So, you are Immortal Gu Jin.

931
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,360
Unfortunately,

932
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:47,700
His Majesty won't receive visitors today.

933
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:48,950
He won't?

934
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:52,110
Alright.

935
00:39:52,110 --> 00:39:53,180
Then we'll come back tomorrow.

936
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:55,030
Immortal Gu Jin,

937
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,830
neither will His Majesty
meet visitors tomorrow.

938
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,300
Why not?

939
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:00,150
Are you trying to give us a hard time?

940
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:01,860
Don't get me wrong.

941
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,300
Our Zhongling Palace has its rules.

942
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,450
His Majesty only receives visitors
the first of every month.

943
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,430
I have no right

944
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:09,300
to break the rule that His Majesty made.

945
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,740
The first of every month?

946
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:12,910
Today is the second.

947
00:40:12,910 --> 00:40:14,320
You are asking us
to wait for another month?

948
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,960
If you want to meet
with His Majesty urgently,

949
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,100
it's not that difficult.

950
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,070
But, you need

951
00:40:18,670 --> 00:40:19,740
to go to that place first.

952
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:23,310
As long as you can afford to pay,

953
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:24,260
I assure you that you'll

954
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,030
meet with His Majesty in two days.

955
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,460
(Xiuyan Tower, the Nether Realm)

956
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:56,220
(Xiuyan Tower)

957
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,180
It seems that you three
traveled a long way here.

958
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,590
It's the first time you've come
to the Nether Realm, isn't it?

959
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,630
Let me ask you.

960
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,340
How much for the tablets

961
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,340
of your Xiuyan Tower?

962
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,260
Give me a price.

963
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:19,740
We want the kind that allows us
to meet with the Nether King the quickest.

964
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,150
Just give us a price.

965
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:23,220
He's rich.

966
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:25,760
Please.

967
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,400
First-class tablet

968
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,110
costs 1,000 golds
or a 1000-year-old spiritual item.

969
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,380
Second-class tablet costs

970
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,510
(Second-class tablet)
500 golds or a 500-year-old spiritual item)

971
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,910
Third-class tablet costs

972
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,700
300 golds or a 300-year-old spiritual item.

973
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,430
After purchasing the tablet,

974
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:45,660
you can get a number from me
according to the class of your tablet.

975
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,300
There are only these three kinds?

976
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,110
Mister, please don't lie to us.

977
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,960
The guard of Zhongling Palace

978
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:52,990
told us

979
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,990
that we could meet
with the Nether King in two days.

980
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,880
Are there really these three kinds only?

981
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,830
Miss,

982
00:41:57,830 --> 00:41:58,910
you are right.

983
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:01,880
We do have

984
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,860
a special-class tablet,

985
00:42:03,030 --> 00:42:04,310
with which,

986
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:07,260
you can enter Zhongling Palace
and meet with His Majesty immediately.

987
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:09,220
But, only the master of the tower

988
00:42:09,590 --> 00:42:10,700
has that tablet,

989
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:13,070
and he's the only one
who gets to name a price for it.

990
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:14,230
Over the past 3,000 years,

991
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:15,710
we only issued two

992
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:16,660
special-class tablets.

993
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,860
One was traded with the internal cores
of ten 10,000-year-old nine-headed snakes,

994
00:42:20,150 --> 00:42:22,180
and the other was traded
with a 10,000-year-old sycamore tree.

995
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:24,470
They are all very rare treasures.

996
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,220
(A 10,000-year-old sycamore tree?)

997
00:42:26,590 --> 00:42:28,820
(There's really a sycamore tree
in Zhongling Palace)

998
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,660
Where's the master of the tower?

999
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,340
We have plenty of money.

1000
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,990
Just bring us the special-class tablet.

1001
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,820
We don't even have

1002
00:42:40,550 --> 00:42:42,260
100 golds.

1003
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,780
Then why were you bluffing?

1004
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:49,950
I…

1005
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,150
I didn't know it'd be this expensive.

1006
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,550
The tower master is truly impressive.

1007
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,510
If you really have the tablet

1008
00:42:56,510 --> 00:42:58,380
that allows us to enter
Zhongling Palace at any time,

1009
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,150
you could be considered
an uncrowned king in the Nether Realm.

1010
00:43:01,670 --> 00:43:02,950
Since we are here,

1011
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:05,630
why don't you name a price

1012
00:43:05,840 --> 00:43:06,910
for the special-class tablet?

1013
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,950
Donghua's disciple indeed.

1014
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,820
You've got balls

1015
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,070
to say that.

1016
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,300
Are you here to ask me for a favor

1017
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,510
