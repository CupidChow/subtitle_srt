29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,400
Yin,

30
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:42,350
are you okay?

31
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:43,710
I'm fine.

32
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:45,990
The master-servant contract acted up,

33
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,100
so you fainted.

34
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,060
It acted up

35
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,220
because you were thinking
of something against the contract.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,320
Yin,

37
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,240
let me ask you,

38
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,830
and you must be honest with me.

39
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:57,740
Were you trying to hurt Gu Jin?

40
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,120
Of course not.

41
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:00,860
How could I hurt him?

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:01,910
Then,

43
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,380
do you have feelings for him?

44
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,460
How could that be possible?

45
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,960
Impossible.

46
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:14,950
Then, take good care of yourself.

47
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,550
Qing Yi,

48
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,400
Jiu,

49
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,620
look after her.

50
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,310
Yes.

51
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:25,590
Qing Yi,

52
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,790
go and make some

53
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:28,780
chicken soup for Yin.

54
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,300
Well,

55
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,570
if everything is fine, you can go back.

56
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:36,580
I'm going to sleep.

57
00:02:39,710 --> 00:02:41,230
Today is the Qiqiao Festival,

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,900
and the guests came for the trial

59
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,580
all went to the Heavenly River to celebrate.

60
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,840
Why don't we

61
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,460
go to the Heavenly River together,

62
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,740
take a walk, and relax a bit?

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
You're really not going?

64
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:01,430
Alright,

65
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,230
then rest well.

66
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:04,990
I'm leaving.

67
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:11,430
(Could it be that)

68
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,150
(Yin really likes Gu Jin?)

69
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,680
(Why do you always)

70
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:28,900
(think about Gu Jin?)

71
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,510
(If someone finds out,)

72
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:32,710
(it could be embarrassing.)

73
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:35,150
(Think about it.)

74
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,300
(Gu Jin is just a loser.)

75
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,270
(He has achieved nothing.)

76
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,830
(What's good about him?)

77
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,110
(Even if he is serious...)

78
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,150
(When he's focused on something,)

79
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,750
(he seems to be somewhat)

80
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:46,710
(handsome.)

81
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,230
(No, no.)

82
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,000
(He pulls you to him)

83
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:51,840
(whenever he wants to.)

84
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,020
(That's quite outrageous.)

85
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,920
(But)

86
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,620
(he fought hard to win the trial,)

87
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:59,180
(and saved your life.)

88
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,080
(It seems like no one has ever)

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,430
(been this good to you.)

90
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,460
Stop, stop, stop!

91
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,990
I can't keep thinking about him.

92
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,780
I need to find a way to forget about him.

93
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:11,460
I'll go out for a walk.

94
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,940
(Heavenly River, Heavenly Palace)

95
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:18,670
It's so beautiful.

96
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,750
Yeah.

97
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,100
It's like a dream.

98
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,140
- Have you made a wish?
- Yes.

99
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,500
Shall we make a wish on the river lantern?

100
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:26,230
That star is so bright.

101
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,540
Yeah, look, there are many bright ones.

102
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,540
Look, that one is flying so high.

103
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,670
And that one.

104
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,920
They all say...

105
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,350
- Wait for me.
- Mine is the best-looking.

106
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:37,790
I also think yours is the best-looking.

107
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,630
Of course.

108
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:39,510
Come on, be careful.

109
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:46,820
Let's go.

110
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,020
How about that? Pretty, right?

111
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,080
Really beautiful.

112
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:52,430
(I should find a place)

113
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,310
(with fewer people.)

114
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,310
Although this place is secluded,

115
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,870
the scenery is exceptionally beautiful.

116
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:13,830
I often think that

117
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,780
if there is someone special in my heart,

118
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,950
I must bring her here.

119
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,460
Your Majesty, you're so romantic.

120
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:41,540
(Hua Shu?)

121
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,390
(Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng?)

122
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,100
(What about Jin?)

123
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:05,580
Cherish the one in front of you.

124
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,510
This is what I am thinking right now,

125
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,400
I hope that

126
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,510
this is also what you are thinking.

127
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,520
Hua Shu,

128
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,440
don't worry.

129
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,310
Until you make up your mind,

130
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:27,870
I won't force you

131
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,150
to make any response.

132
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,870
I'll wait patiently

133
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,030
until

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,540
you can accept me officially.

135
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,380
Don't you know

136
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,830
about what I'm thinking?

137
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,420
Over the past two hundred years,

138
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,270
these star sparkles have always encouraged me,

139
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,720
just like when you

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,750
whispered tenderly to me back then.

141
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,190
Every time I think about it,

142
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,030
I feel lucky

143
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,630
to have met you at that time.

144
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,310
But now,

145
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:03,460
I only hope that the war will end soon.

146
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,020
Then,

147
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,420
we can talk about our future.

148
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,200
Hua Shu,

149
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,370
I will try my best to expedite

150
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:16,870
the peace talks between the two clans.

151
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,000
By the way,

152
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,140
today,

153
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,580
I've prepared a gift for you.

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,390
Just wait here for a moment.

155
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,070
Why are you here?

156
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:50,950
Shouldn't I be asking you that?

157
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,340
Why are you here?

158
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:55,430
You left Jin aside
and are now having a secret meeting

159
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,470
with Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng.

160
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,310
What are you doing?

161
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,230
A mere low-level immortal servant like you

162
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:00,630
dares to meddle in my affairs?

163
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,510
If you have no interest in him,

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,460
you should make it clear to him,

165
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,310
rather than hurting his heart.

166
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,620
Look at your

167
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,630
ambiguous behavior,

168
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,060
playing both sides,

169
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:13,980
what's the point?

170
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Yeah?

171
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:17,240
So you will have the chance

172
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,870
to win the heart of your master?

173
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:21,510
Does Gu Jin know that his lowly immortal servant

174
00:08:21,510 --> 00:08:22,950
has developed improper thoughts about him?

175
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,730
That can only happen in your dreams.

176
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:25,870
How ridiculous.

177
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,460
I got it.

178
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,000
Are you afraid that Jin will take back
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella he lent you,

179
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,270
so you're not telling him your true feelings?

180
00:08:37,790 --> 00:08:39,420
You are so selfish.

181
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,020
I will go and tell him now.

182
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:55,240
Using sweet words and

183
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,430
feigned affection to sow discord,

184
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:58,150
that's not a good habit.

185
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:11,470
You came here to enjoy the festival,

186
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,820
only seeing the beautiful scenery
of the Heavenly River.

187
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,900
You never saw anything else.

188
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,990
When you return to the Magpie Feather Pathway,

189
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,900
you'll forget about

190
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,750
meeting me here.

191
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,840
Hua Shu.

192
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,590
Go now.

193
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,110
Who was that girl just now?

194
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,780
She just asked for directions.

195
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,350
This is for you.

196
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,680
Is it pretty?

197
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,590
It's beautiful.

198
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,160
They say that

199
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:32,600
if you write your wishes on this lantern,

200
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,780
they will come true.

201
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,990
Really?

202
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,230
Are you okay?

203
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,960
(Wait a minute,)

204
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,630
(I think I forgot something important.)

205
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:49,870
(It's...)

206
00:12:29,030 --> 00:12:30,540
Your Highness, be careful.

207
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,840
Jin.

208
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,300
Your Highness,

209
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:37,470
you're here.

210
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:38,560
Jin,

211
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,700
last night I suddenly had a bout of pain.

212
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,780
I'm sorry for keeping you waiting.

213
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,060
Are you feeling better now?

214
00:12:44,270 --> 00:12:45,540
After taking the medicine, it's fine.

215
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,020
I've come to apologize.

216
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,590
Today, I'm willing to share a drink with you.

217
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,300
It's okay.

218
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,750
We can do that after you recover.

219
00:12:56,630 --> 00:12:57,470
However,

220
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:58,940
I want to know,

221
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,440
what am I in your heart?

222
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,660
You're just a big fool!

223
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:05,840
Yin.

224
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,510
Don't speak now.

225
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,900
She didn't come to your appointment last night

226
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,900
not because of some unbearable pain,

227
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,220
but because she had an appointment…

228
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,780
She was with someone else.

229
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,180
What do you mean?

230
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,230
Miss Yin,

231
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:25,240
I don't know whose words

232
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,110
you've listened to.

233
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,390
I also don't know who I met with.

234
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,390
Please clarify.

235
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,150
Do you really want me to say it

236
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,590
and make everyone feel embarrassed?

237
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,120
Do you mean that

238
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,060
you can't provide a name?

239
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:37,180
(Did I drink too much last night?)

240
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,960
(Why do I only remember)

241
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,230
(some blurry fragments?)

242
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,510
(Who was she with)

243
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,610
(last night?)

244
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:44,450
Yin!

245
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,330
Miss Yin,

246
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,350
Her Highness had a difficult night,
enduring pain.

247
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:51,350
You can't just ruin her reputation
with baseless accusations.

248
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,110
If you can't provide evidence,

249
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:55,270
you should apologize to Her Highness
immediately.

250
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:57,420
I really saw it,

251
00:13:58,840 --> 00:13:59,680
but I...

252
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,840
I don't know how I offended you,

253
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:03,150
Miss Yin.

254
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,550
You insist on

255
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:06,430
accusing me without any evidence.

256
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:08,510
And I don't want my reputation to be ruined.

257
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,950
Miss Yin,

258
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,540
do you dare to take a heart-reflecting oath?

259
00:14:14,030 --> 00:14:15,140
Place your hand here.

260
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,500
This oath will reflect your heart.

261
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,200
You only need to describe the situation

262
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,150
when you saw me.

263
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,350
If you dare fabricate anything,

264
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:23,350
you will suffer the torment
of scorching your heart.

265
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,040
Yin!

266
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,750
Your Highness.

267
00:14:27,870 --> 00:14:29,360
How can you casually use

268
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,270
the heart-reflecting oath?

269
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,540
Stop acting recklessly, Yin.

270
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,070
What do you mean by acting recklessly?

271
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:35,390
I really saw it.

272
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:38,700
You don't believe me?

273
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,060
- Fine, if you don't believe me...
- I...

274
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,940
It's my fault!

275
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:47,700
I shouldn't have come!

276
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,560
Yin!

277
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,040
Yin!

278
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,630
Yin!

279
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,440
Your Highness,

280
00:14:57,910 --> 00:14:59,750
Yin may have mistaken somebody for you,

281
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,270
but in such matters,

282
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,700
she has never lied.

283
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:10,720
Your Highness, you've used
Memory-erasure Trick to erase

284
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,020
Yin's memories of seeing you last night.

285
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,720
Due to her low spiritual power,

286
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,990
she'll never recall it.

287
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,700
You don't need to worry.

288
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:20,060
She's just a little immortal beast,

289
00:15:20,910 --> 00:15:22,350
but Gu Jin seems to be very protective of her.

290
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,420
I feel that

291
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,940
Yin could become troublesome.

292
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,020
Didn't you say that

293
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,830
if not for the Sky-shrouding Umbrella,

294
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,870
Gu Jin is not worth worrying about?

295
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,510
Moreover,

296
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:38,180
you've successfully won over His Majesty.

297
00:15:38,510 --> 00:15:40,390
He ordered the deft fairies

298
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:42,230
to craft this phoenix necklace for you.

299
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,440
He has put in

300
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,060
a lot of effort for you.

301
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,060
Unfortunately,

302
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:50,200
he refuses to show any favoritism

303
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,630
to my Peacock Clan.

304
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,540
He's a ruler

305
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,900
who adheres strictly to justice.

306
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,420
We have been in a stalemate
with the Eagle Clan for too long.

307
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,150
If we don't end the war quickly,

308
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:09,350
there may be endless trouble.

309
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:27,180
Your Highness, it's a battlefield report
from Bainiao Island.

310
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:33,014
(Prince Hua Yan raided the Eagle Camp
and was captured.)

311
00:16:33,038 --> 00:16:34,300
(Figure out how to rescue him now!)

312
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,390
That foolish Hua Yan!

313
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:40,820
His Highness?

314
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,230
As I suggested before,

315
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,700
unless we have sufficient reinforcements,

316
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:45,960
we should maintain the stalemate

317
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,060
with the Eagle Clan.

318
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,870
But he

319
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:50,510
acted recklessly and raided the Eagle Camp,

320
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:52,230
only to be captured by the Eagle King.

321
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:53,270
Now the entire North Sea

322
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:55,270
is laughing at our Peacock Clan.

323
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,180
It seems that we have no choice

324
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:58,240
but to let the Eagle Clan

325
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,270
dictate the terms.

326
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:08,350
The Eagle Clan initiated the provocation.

327
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,500
Our Bainiao Island has no reason to retreat.

328
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:13,790
But with the divine weapon

329
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,870
provided by Gu Jin,

330
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:16,700
you should have become invincible

331
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,430
and scared away the Eagle Clan

332
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:19,630
with your power.

333
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:23,790
It's a demigod weapon.

334
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:25,030
With my current cultivation base,

335
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,550
I cannot unleash its full power.

336
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,260
Unless...

337
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,030
After I find Ningyun Mountain,

338
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,070
I will leave Gu Jin

339
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,940
immediately!

340
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:52,070
Is Ningyun Mountain so hard to find?

341
00:17:52,310 --> 00:17:53,500
There's still no trace?

342
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,220
Ningyun Mountain

343
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:58,310
has its own hiding barrier.

344
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,150
It could be concealed

345
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:03,220
in any mountain, river, or dense forest.

346
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:06,870
Every day, I send spiritual power

347
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:08,070
to my sister,

348
00:18:09,110 --> 00:18:11,590
but she shows no response.

349
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,220
Therefore, I'm thinking,

350
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:15,870
if I

351
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,710
want my sister to transform,

352
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:21,030
I must find

353
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:23,180
the Xuan Lake on Ningyun Mountain.

354
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,490
Next time, I'll accompany you in the search.

355
00:18:25,510 --> 00:18:28,390
Our Fox Clan is the best at treasure hunting.

356
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,070
Let's stop drinking.

357
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:35,640
Time to rest.

358
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
No way.

359
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,260
We agreed not to return until we were drunk.

360
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:41,040
Show me your cup.

361
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:46,910
Haven't you noticed?

362
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:48,900
Today's wine is special.

363
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,460
It's the Pear Blossom Brew

364
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,500
specially made by me.

365
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:57,940
Ten years ago, I first met you,

366
00:18:58,550 --> 00:18:59,920
and I've been thinking of you

367
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,030
ever since.

368
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,470
I want to tell you something

369
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,570
that I've been keeping from you

370
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:04,410
for ten years.

371
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,390
I like you.

372
00:19:12,010 --> 00:19:12,850
Yin.

373
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,150
I just wanted to help him,

374
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:28,220
but now...

375
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:33,980
We agreed that

376
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,630
we would drink heartily
without thinking about anything else.

377
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:38,150
Come on,

378
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:39,590
let's drink.

379
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:40,950
Cheers.

380
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:54,790
By the way, Jiu,

381
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:57,310
your injuries are healed now,

382
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,030
aren't you going back to the Fox Clan?

383
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:08,350
The Fox Clan is my home,

384
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,220
but it doesn't feel like home.

385
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,550
My parents are no longer there.

386
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:14,150
There's only

387
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,980
a person I don't like.

388
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,310
Why do you dislike your aunt

389
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:18,460
so much?

390
00:20:22,070 --> 00:20:22,910
I don't know.

391
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:25,180
Perhaps it's because

392
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,870
seeing her reminds me of

393
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,260
the bloodbath

394
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,220
in Jingyou Mountain.

395
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:32,550
The more she tries to make amends,

396
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,150
the more I want to escape.

397
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,350
But it doesn't matter.

398
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,500
Once I find Ningyun Mountain,

399
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:44,550
I'll set aside a large piece of land for you.

400
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,420
You can stay wherever you want.

401
00:20:46,790 --> 00:20:48,350
It's okay if you don't go back.

402
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,870
Anyway, you can do whatever you want.

403
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,720
Yin,

404
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,390
I used to say I wanted you

405
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,740
to cultivate with me
like we do in the Fox Clan,

406
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:07,990
but I don't think like that anymore.

407
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,310
Now, I just want to be

408
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,870
the person hidden in your heart.

409
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:16,840
You...

410
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:20,480
Yin!

411
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:24,870
The master-servant contract again!

412
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,110
Jiu, what did you say?

413
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,030
Why did you change into

414
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,220
Jin's appearance?

415
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,830
Change back now.

416
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:43,790
I don't want to see him at all now.

417
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,660
What did Jiu say to you?

418
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,550
Today, I didn't doubt you.

419
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,700
I know you the best.

420
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,550
Still, you've been wronged.

421
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,740
I apologize to you.

422
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,070
Who would like to have a stupid master like you?

423
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:06,840
You fool.

424
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,030
I'll just drink.

425
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,240
Yin.

426
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:25,040
Look at you.

427
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:26,700
You've shown your true form.

428
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,550
You haven't told me what Jiu said yet.

429
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,060
Don't listen to his nonsense.

430
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,900
Do you hear me?

431
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,800
Jin!

432
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,350
- Hua Shu?
- Hua Shu?

433
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,310
Magpie Feather Lantern,

434
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,020
that man gave her a Magpie Feather Lantern.

435
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,480
- You've shown your true form.
- I'll confront her!

436
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,790
You can't let anybody see you.

437
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:55,110
- I'll hide you up first.
- I...

438
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,270
(Leisure and Carefree)

439
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,980
Jin, are you in?

440
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:03,500
Hide here for now.

441
00:23:03,790 --> 00:23:05,070
- Don't make a sound.
- No way.

442
00:23:06,830 --> 00:23:08,550
Take her to me!

443
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,790
I want to confront her.

444
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:19,910
Jin.

445
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:20,870
Your Highness.

446
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,740
What's up so late?

447
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,590
Something urgent happened in my clan.

448
00:23:24,750 --> 00:23:26,630
I have to go back tomorrow morning.

449
00:23:26,830 --> 00:23:27,940
I'm here to bid farewell.

450
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,240
And there's something

451
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:32,260
- I want to...
- Let me out!

452
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,220
What did you say, Your Highness?

453
00:23:42,030 --> 00:23:43,790
I'm going back home tomorrow morning.

454
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:44,910
In such a hurry?

455
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,340
Has your injury recovered?

456
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,500
I'm all right now.

457
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,590
Hua Shu.

458
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,320
Magpie Feather Lamp...

459
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:56,230
You've got another visitor?

460
00:23:56,230 --> 00:23:58,310
No. Not a visitor.

461
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,720
Just a drunken cat

462
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:01,220
broke into my room.

463
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,100
It jumped around

464
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,230
and messed about.

465
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:05,070
Now,

466
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,590
I just won't invite you in.

467
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:09,350
Oh, I remember.

468
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:11,110
I remember!

469
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:13,350
Magpie Feather Lamp!

470
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,390
Your Highness,

471
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,400
I have to get back

472
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,740
and take care of it.

473
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,700
You get some rest early.

474
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,520
Yin.

475
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:32,260
Are you hurt?

476
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,460
(Spiritual energy wafts here)

477
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:57,390
(and forms a barrier.)

478
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,150
(It must be the immortal vein
of Daze Mountain.)

479
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:11,980
(After searching for days,)

480
00:25:12,270 --> 00:25:13,830
(I've finally found it.)

481
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:17,260
(But the Sky-shrouding Umbrella
is way too powerful.)

482
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:19,350
(How can I get in?)

483
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,590
Who's there?

484
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,550
Martial Uncle Xian Zhu?

485
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:40,180
When did you get back?

486
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,580
I haven't seen you for two days.

487
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,420
So, you've been searching for the book
for two years in the Mortal Realm?

488
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,670
I...

489
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:47,420
I indeed spent some time.

490
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,150
But don't tell others about it.

491
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,760
But Martial Uncle,

492
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,660
what are you doing here

493
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:55,940
in the middle of the night?

494
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,790
I'm patrolling the Forbidden Valley.

495
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,700
A lot of people have come recently.

496
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,390
We can't let anyone get close.

497
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,290
I'll patrol around, then.

498
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,130
No need.

499
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,630
I'm done inspecting.

500
00:26:05,830 --> 00:26:07,110
You go back for some rest.

501
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:19,420
(Yantian Hall, Library, Garden,
Qiyue Hall, Heaven Gate, Forbidden Valley)

502
00:26:20,350 --> 00:26:22,070
The barrier outside isn't damaged.

503
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,980
The immortal vein is safe.

504
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,110
Now,

505
00:26:26,350 --> 00:26:27,420
what I'm concerned about most

506
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,070
is Jin.

507
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,520
The tribulation's getting closer?

508
00:26:40,270 --> 00:26:41,350
I divined it.

509
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,260
If Jin falls in love with Yin,

510
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,700
he'll immediately
activate the tribulation.

511
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,750
Why would Jin

512
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,590
fall in love with Yin?

513
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,400
He's been adoring Hua Shu, hasn't he?

514
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,870
They're still too young.

515
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:56,870
Maybe they haven't realized their love.

516
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,700
Or maybe they're stuck in love.

517
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,460
It can never be explained.

518
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,150
But when they can hardly
control their feelings,

519
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,870
that'd be too late.

520
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:08,310
The tribulation

521
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,150
will be a death call.

522
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,240
What if

523
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,180
Jin marries Hua Shu?

524
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,300
Think it over.

525
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,020
You and I

526
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,580
should think it over.

527
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,180
Father!

528
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,740
Help me, Father!

529
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,580
Father!

530
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:38,140
Yan Qiu,

531
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,820
you're going too far!

532
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:41,940
Hua Mo,

533
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,220
you had one month.

534
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,060
Today,

535
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,660
you have to give me

536
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,500
a reply!

537
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:53,380
If you still keep silent,

538
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,980
I will turn him back
to what he really is,

539
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,180
pluck the feather off his bottom,

540
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,700
and destroy his core

541
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,340
when our armies

542
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:01,540
are watching.

543
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,740
Father!

544
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:04,220
Give them what they want!

545
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
Father!

546
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:11,580
Father, give them what they want!

547
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:12,420
Wait!

548
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,460
Want to bully us?

549
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,700
Who do you think you are?

550
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:38,180
(Gu Jin's Sky-shrouding Umbrella?)

551
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:40,220
Start the formation!

552
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,100
Defense!

553
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:42,000
Aye!

554
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:48,820
Hua Shu has become a senior immortal?

555
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,740
Father.

556
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:27,420
(She's so powerful.)

557
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,460
(Has she refined
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella?)

558
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:41,220
Father.

559
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,460
Stop!

560
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,260
We give in.

561
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,340
(Capitulation)

562
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,100
Then, others can't see

563
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:02,140
that you were hurt

564
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:03,420
by the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

565
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:04,980
No one will see you through.

566
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,180
Now that you've located

567
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,460
the immortal vein of Daze Mountain,

568
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,940
all you need to do

569
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,700
is to put it in the vein.

570
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,220
Don't open it.

571
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,060
The thing inside it

572
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,940
will grow where it falls,

573
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,340
absorb spiritual power,

574
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,780
and engulf everything.

575
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,620
Don't let it chew you up.

576
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,300
Hurry up.

577
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,140
Gu Jin has become a junior immortal.

578
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,260
When he gathers up
the immortal spirit of the Fire Phoenix

579
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,380
and the Phoenix Queen returns,

580
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,540
you'll never have the chance again.

581
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,580
The Sky-shrouding Umbrella

582
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:46,980
was lent to the peacocks.

583
00:31:47,180 --> 00:31:49,460
But its barrier is still protecting
Daze Mountain.

584
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:50,820
I can't even break

585
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,740
into the immortal vein.

586
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:52,580
Don't worry.

587
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,500
The barrier of the Umbrella

588
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:55,900
has been disappearing.

589
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:58,140
Maybe someone is secretly refining

590
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,300
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

591
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,500
God helps me.

592
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,020
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

593
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,420
Hua Shu became a senior immortal,

594
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,300
defeated the Eagle King
with the Umbrella you lent her

595
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:12,500
and got famous overnight.

596
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,580
Bainiao Island won a great victory.

597
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:15,460
Now,

598
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:16,740
the Eagle Clan and the Peacock Clan

599
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:18,620
are making peace after the ceasefire.

600
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,060
Daze Mountain

601
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:22,220
never interfered
with what happens inside other clans.

602
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:24,300
I lent the Umbrella to her willfully.

603
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:25,820
Sorry for the trouble.

604
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,380
It doesn't matter.

605
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,860
After you marry Hua Shu,

606
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,500
her clan and our sect will be relatives
by marriage.

607
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:33,420
It's all right to help them.

608
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,340
Who would marry Hua Shu?

609
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,020
Hua Shu and I...

610
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:38,780
We haven't got to that point, Xian Zhu.

611
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,780
You're both single

612
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,820
and you like her.

613
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:44,100
We'll definitely support you.

614
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:45,460
But Xian Zhu,

615
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,780
I... I think...

616
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,300
I haven't finished gathering up
Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

617
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:50,740
I don't plan to do anything

618
00:32:50,860 --> 00:32:52,500
before I finish this mission.

619
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:54,020
Gathering up her immortal spirit

620
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:54,860
is very important.

621
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,540
But the marriage thing is imminent, too.

622
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:59,020
The day after tomorrow, the Peacock King
will hold his birthday banquet

623
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:00,900
to entertain immortals
from famous immortal sects.

624
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:02,580
We've received the invitation.

625
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:04,300
Rumor goes that the Peacock King

626
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:05,740
holds the banquet

627
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,620
to pick a son-in-law.

628
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,140
I hear many immortals will go
and propose to Hua Shu

629
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:10,700
with their best treasures.

630
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:12,780
If another young immortal gets her,

631
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:13,900
you'll have to regret it

632
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:14,900
and cry somewhere.

633
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,380
Xian Zhu.

634
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:24,420
What's this?

635
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,940
Before Master ascended,

636
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:27,940
he also gave some treasures
to Xian Shan and me.

637
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,780
This is the Sparkling Crown.

638
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,340
I'm giving it to you.

639
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,340
It's a demigod tool.

640
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:35,260
Propose to Hua Shu with it,

641
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,220
and you won't be ashamed.

642
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,500
Think about what it looks like
on your beloved woman's head.

643
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,380
You can't wait to put it on her, right?

644
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:52,700
No, no.

645
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,580
I still think

646
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,500
this is too abrupt.

647
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,660
Besides, Yin is

648
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,620
still angry with me.

649
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,060
We haven't found Ningyun Mountain yet.

650
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,500
- I keep thinking...
- Jin.

651
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:05,260
Don't you always adore Hua Shu

652
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,100
and want to make her

653
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,180
your wife?

654
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,820
You can't be a fickle man

655
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,260
or remain unfaithful.

656
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:11,260
Everyone in the Three Realms

657
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:12,820
knows that you lent the Umbrella

658
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,140
to Hua Shu.

659
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:16,100
If you hesitate now,

660
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,700
others will gossip about Hua Shu.

661
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:20,900
Jin, men like us

662
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,580
must be determined
to defend our beloved one

663
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,380
even if we have big-picture thinking.

664
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:34,380
I've prepared a letter of engagement

665
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:36,020
as the chief of our sect.

666
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:37,980
Qing Yi will get the carriage ready.

667
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,540
You're going to Bainiao Island

668
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,940
with the letter and the crown

669
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,460
to get engaged as soon as possible.

670
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,940
Martial Uncle.

671
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,930
Are you ready?

672
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:09,970
Why are you staggering here?

673
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:12,340
Are you going to take Yin with you

674
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,500
or are you going to say goodbye to her?

675
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:15,180
Don't nag.

676
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,580
I'm thinking

677
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:18,620
if anything is missed.

678
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,380
Birthday and betrothal presents,

679
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,620
I've prepared everything for you
and put them in the carriage.

680
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,030
Martial Uncle, all you need to do

681
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,600
is get on the carriage.

682
00:35:25,780 --> 00:35:27,250
Then our trip to Bainiao Island

683
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,170
will be perfect.

684
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:30,540
But if you keep procrastinating
instead of leaving,

685
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:31,700
- we will...
- Don't rush me.

686
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,580
Wait for me.

687
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:41,180
Qing Yi.

688
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,500
Where is he going

689
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:45,420
in such a hurry?

690
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,540
Martial Aunt, didn't you hear?

691
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,060
Martial Uncle is going to Bainiao Island
and propose to Princess Hua Shu.

692
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:51,940
Propose?

693
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,260
He'll marry Hua Shu?

694
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:58,460
What's wrong, Martial Aunt?

695
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,060
You look rather pale.

696
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,060
Do you...

697
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,380
Do you not want him to go?

698
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,940
How... How's that possible?

699
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:11,740
- I just...
- Yin.

700
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:15,500
You're back.

701
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,420
- I...
- I know.

702
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,700
You're going to propose to Hua Shu.

703
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,820
Qing Yi told me about it.

704
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:23,820
If you have to go,

705
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,060
stop dawdling.

706
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,060
Yeah. You always

707
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,580
love to dawdle.

708
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,820
If you're late,

709
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,340
another young immortal

710
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:32,300
will get Princess Hua Shu.

711
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:33,220
You know what?

712
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,860
You've always adored her.

713
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,740
So, take this opportunity

714
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,300
and do the best you can.

715
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:41,620
Today,

716
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,740
I don't feel very well.

717
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,020
So, I'm not going with you

718
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:45,260
in case I make trouble.

719
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,020
You should go.

720
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,740
I'm going back to my room.

721
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:51,140
Yin...

722
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,900
(Qihe Mount. It's very dangerous.
Don't go there until I'm back.)

723
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,060
(Shijin Brook)

724
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,180
Menghui Valley.

725
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,300
It's remote with dense forests.

726
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,140
Ningyun Mountain may be there.

727
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:53,940
Qiyuan Mountain.

728
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,060
It's at the end of Hefeng Mount.

729
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,760
It has a weird landform
where people easily get lost.

730
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,820
Demons can't even approach.

731
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,340
When I'm back, we can go there together.

732
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,740
Qihe Mount. It's very dangerous.

733
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,660
Don't go there until I'm back.

734
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:31,580
(Bainiao Island, the Immortal Realm)

735
00:38:50,860 --> 00:38:51,940
I'm Gu Jin from Daze Mountain.

736
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:53,180
I'm here for your king's birthday

737
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:54,540
on behalf of our chief.

738
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,460
His Lordship has told me.

739
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,420
When guests from Daze Mountain come,

740
00:38:58,420 --> 00:39:00,020
I shall welcome them personally.

741
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,070
Elder Gu Jin,

742
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:01,980
come in, please.

743
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,620
Greetings, Your Lordship.

744
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:16,820
Gu Jin,

745
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,940
warmly welcome.

746
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,740
Thank you

747
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,540
for lending the Umbrella to my daughter

748
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,380
so that we survived a disaster.

749
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,420
It's such a big favor

750
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,220
and I'll always remember that.

751
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,380
Some presents for you.

752
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,700
Your Lordship,

753
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,420
I helped Princess Hua Shu

754
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,820
because she was a friend of mine.

755
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,780
Such presents are too valuable

756
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:42,900
for me to accept.

757
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,740
Please take them back.

758
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,900
That's right.

759
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,980
You and my daughter are good friends.

760
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:51,140
I shouldn't have

761
00:39:51,460 --> 00:39:52,460
humiliated your feelings

762
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,500
for her.

763
00:39:58,420 --> 00:39:59,260
By the way,

764
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:02,060
Hua Shu fought
the Eagle King some days ago.

765
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:03,460
How's she now?

766
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,780
Thank you for your concern.

767
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,540
During the fight against Yan Qiu,

768
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,780
she lost some power.

769
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,140
Now, she's having
closed-door cultivation.

770
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:13,060
I'm afraid she won't come out

771
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,140
until the banquet day.

772
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,100
Martial Uncle.

773
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,540
Your Lordship,

774
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,140
I'm not only here

775
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,580
for your birthday

776
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:25,340
but also have something to tell you.

777
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,780
Go ahead.

778
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,540
You must be aware

779
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:30,540
that the Sky-shrouding Umbrella

780
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,220
has been our protection tool

781
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,740
that keeps Daze Mountain safe.

782
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,380
Now, your crisis

783
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:36,260
has been over.

784
00:40:36,860 --> 00:40:39,100
I want to get the Umbrella back.

785
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:44,460
Gu Jin,

786
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,660
we should of course

787
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,220
give the Umbrella back to you.

788
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,580
But my daughter is keeping it.

789
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,060
How about this?

790
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,460
After she comes out,

791
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,100
I'll ask her to give it to you, all right?

792
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:57,140
I guess I have to wait, then.

793
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,020
Lord Hua Mo.

794
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:02,420
(Guiyue Pavilion)

795
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:03,580
What's up?

796
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:06,180
Your Lordship, Martial Uncle Gu Jin
fell in love with Princess Hua Shu

797
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,700
since they first met on Wutong Island.

798
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,280
And he hasn't changed his feelings so far.

799
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,540
Now, he came here

800
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:12,220
to propose to Her Highness.

801
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,220
However,

802
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,380
he was so excited

803
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:16,020
that he didn't know how to start it.

804
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:17,860
Here's the letter of engagement

805
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:18,980
and the betrothal present

806
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,300
our chief prepared for him.

807
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:21,260
The Sparkling Crown.

808
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,340
Your Lordship, please marry Her Highness

809
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,580
to Martial Uncle Gu Jin.

810
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:26,660
He's very benevolent

811
00:41:26,660 --> 00:41:28,180
and he'll always protect her.

812
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,060
The Sparkling Crown?

813
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:41,420
This is

814
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,300
a demigod tool.

815
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:45,180
However valuable it is,

816
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,740
you shouldn't have accepted it.

817
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,220
I just accepted the present.

818
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,980
I didn't promise anything, though.

819
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,180
Besides,

820
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:54,260
I couldn't just reject them.

821
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,700
Shu,

822
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,500
Gu Jin came here

823
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,740
to get back the Umbrella.

824
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,460
If he knows

825
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,460
that you refined it,

826
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,300
I don't think

827
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,500
he'll let us go.

828
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:09,540
He's getting it back so soon?

829
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,860
Daze Mountain is a tycoon
in the Immortal Realm.

830
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,940
If they ask us

831
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:17,300
for an explanation,

832
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,260
no other immortal sects

833
00:42:19,260 --> 00:42:21,100
will be on our side.

834
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,060
So, I'm thinking

835
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:25,420
if I marry you

836
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,460
to Gu Jin,

837
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,540
they will not

838
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,780
hold us responsible.

839
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,900
Besides, Gu Jin

840
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,420
has strong immortal potential.

841
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,100
He's a rough diamond.

842
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,340
Xian Shan thinks highly of him, too.

843
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:39,900
So, he's very likely to inherit

844
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,380
the sect of Daze Mountain.

845
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:43,460
I know Gu Jin very well.

846
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,540
Indeed, he has strong immortal potential.

847
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:49,260
But he's way too disengaged

848
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,540
and he doesn't rush

849
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,860
to become a senior immortal.

850
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,220
Besides,

851
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,380
Daze Mountain always remains neutral.

852
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,140
They will not help us

853
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:58,300
to develop Bainiao Island

854
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,900
or gain leverage over the Phoenix Clan.

855
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,900
So, you are

856
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,380
only optimistic about Lan Feng?

857
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:05,300
It won't be long before Lan Feng

858
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
becomes the Heavenly Emperor.

859
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:08,900
Then I'll be the Heavenly Empress.

860
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,220
Even the Phoenix Clan will have to

861
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:12,380
show respect for us.

862
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:14,020
We're both immortal birds.

863
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,880
But why must we revere
the phoenix as our king or queen

864
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,900
ever since we're born?

865
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:19,340
It's a bad life

866
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,580
I never want my clansmen
to experience anymore.

867
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,740
Father,

868
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,900
my husband

869
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:28,020
has to be the Heavenly Emperor,

870
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:29,380
master of the Heavenly Palace.

871
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,100
Yin.

872
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:44,860
