=Episode 8=

29
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,480
Martial Uncle Xian Zhu,
why did you suddenly borrow so many books

30
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:49,660
from the South Heaven Cave?

31
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,740
Books! The books!

32
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,740
This is where the strong wind circulates.

33
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:10,450
The books must have fallen
to the Mortal Realm.

34
00:02:10,450 --> 00:02:11,710
You go back to Daze Mountain first.

35
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,460
I'll get a permission
for going to the Mortal Realm

36
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,670
and retrieve the books.

37
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,980
Martial Uncle Xian Zhu,

38
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,860
be careful!

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:22,500
(Mortal Realm)

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,960
Don't run!

41
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,430
Stop!

42
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:31,470
Stop!

43
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,990
Where are you going?

44
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,310
Let's go!

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,840
Miss,

46
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,800
are you okay?

47
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,820
(Wan Yue)

48
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:21,950
Your clothes are torn.

49
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,710
Let me mend it for you.

50
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,450
No need.

51
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:28,020
I can mend it with immortal power.

52
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:29,990
My method is different.

53
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:30,830
Let me do it.

54
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,660
Wait a moment.

55
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,670
I'll get some needle and thread.

56
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,710
Miss Wan Yue.

57
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,030
Look.

58
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:27,870
This embroidery.

59
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:30,220
I really like it.

60
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,820
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

61
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:41,150
Martial Uncle!

62
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:43,240
I need your help! It's urgent!

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,080
What's going on?

64
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:47,110
The Heavenly Palace's messenger
brought rewards for the Trial Assembly

65
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,320
and needs someone to sign for them.

66
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:50,220
You call this urgent?

67
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,920
I was just about to leave for the Guanxin Valley
for closed-door cultivation,

68
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,710
waiting for the ascent.

69
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:54,870
Find someone else to do it.

70
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,980
Martial Uncle,

71
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,230
Master is busy with the sect affairs
and doesn't have time.

72
00:04:58,230 --> 00:04:59,660
Martial Uncle Xian Zhu hasn't returned.

73
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,900
It'll only take a little while.

74
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,790
Martial Uncle,

75
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,630
please help me out.

76
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,950
- But my luggage...
- Come on, let's go.

77
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,750
Only in this kind of situation,

78
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,390
I can remember that I am an elder
of Daze Mountain.

79
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,070
This time, the first prize

80
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,220
is the newly formed Yin Fire Yang Ice.

81
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,590
That's why the messenger said

82
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,310
it must be personally received by an elder.

83
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:24,390
Yin Fire Yang Ice?

84
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,860
Our foxes' cores are special.

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:27,950
It's extremely Yin fire.

86
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,750
Ordinary herbs

87
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,030
are ineffective.

88
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,340
Only Yin Fire Yang Ice
has miraculous effects.

89
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,950
If we can find a piece,

90
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:36,510
I don't have to consume
Yin's immortal power then.

91
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:38,510
(With Yin Fire Yang Ice,)

92
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,680
(Yin no longer needs to)

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,260
(consume her internal core every day)

94
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,420
(to heal Jiu.)

95
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,810
How can the Yin Fire Yang Ice
be obtained?

96
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,740
Naturally, by winning

97
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,900
the Trial Assembly.

98
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,350
Jin.

99
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,750
What are you doing here?

100
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,040
Why haven't you gone

101
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,140
into seclusion for cultivation?

102
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,220
The Thunder Tribulation is approaching.

103
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,300
Xian Zhu left these elixirs
before leaving.

104
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,390
If you find it difficult to endure

105
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:09,790
during the Thunder Tribulation,

106
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:11,150
take a couple of them,

107
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:12,460
they can help you.

108
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,980
How could I not make it through

109
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,540
a mere Thunder Tribulation?

110
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,270
Thank Xian Zhu for me.

111
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:25,750
I don't know why you're always happy.

112
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,230
Let me tell you,

113
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:28,710
the Trial Assembly is about to begin.

114
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,270
Pay attention to your demeanor.

115
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,870
You don't look decent this way.

116
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,390
So what?

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,990
I'm mainly worried that

118
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,870
people from Bainiao Island
will despise you.

119
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:42,400
Why?

120
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,600
After I marry Hua Shu,
there will be a few days each year

121
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,120
when I have to accompany her
back to her family.

122
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,190
In our Daze Mountain,

123
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:48,810
you can be casual and carefree,

124
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,230
but if you go to Bainiao Island

125
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,150
and are looked down upon,

126
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:52,630
I'll have to stand up for you.

127
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,980
You also need to change your temper.

128
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,950
Alright, you will go with me
to Bainiao Island.

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,620
I won't go to Bainiao Island with you!

130
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,060
Why should I
go to Bainiao Island with you?

131
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,610
I'll stay in Daze Mountain,

132
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:02,900
and sleep in!

133
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,310
Focus on your cultivation!

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,950
You are really angry?

135
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,540
I was just joking.

136
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:18,540
Thank Xian Zhu for me.

137
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,640
No!

138
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,300
(Wutong Island, the Immortal Realm)

139
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,020
Feng Ming,

140
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,350
you've been coming here
to take care of the ancient tree

141
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:49,030
every night for many years, haven't you?

142
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,870
Yes, Elder,

143
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,190
it has been a hundred years.

144
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,170
The ancient sycamore tree

145
00:07:54,170 --> 00:07:55,390
nurtures our Phoenix Clan.

146
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,960
I just

147
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,100
want to contribute
to the entire Phoenix Clan,

148
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:00,900
leading Wutong Island

149
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,120
to prosperity for generations.

150
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:03,960
You

151
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,510
want to become the Phoenix King?

152
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:08,230
According to the rules,

153
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:09,240
the throne of the Phoenix Clan

154
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:10,380
should be passed on to Feng Yin.

155
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,560
But now, Feng Yin's immortal spirit

156
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,590
has already dissipated,

157
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:13,710
her life and death are unknown.

158
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,150
If Feng Yin doesn't wake up
for thousands of years,

159
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:19,710
our Phoenix Clan

160
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,710
will be without a leader for that long?

161
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,580
News has come from Daze Mountain

162
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,000
that Gu Jin has found four portions

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,220
of Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

164
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,660
Sooner or later, she will return.

165
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:31,870
Feng Ming,

166
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,630
your efforts for the Phoenix Clan

167
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,020
are indeed well-intentioned.

168
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,670
However, the Fire Phoenix

169
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:38,750
is the first heir to the throne,

170
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,990
that's an unbreakable ancestral rule.

171
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,510
Just wait patiently for Feng Yin's return.

172
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,110
(I've been in seclusion for ten years,)

173
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:51,400
(breaking through the great formation
on Wutong Island.)

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
(I consider myself)

175
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:54,350
(the most outstanding disciple
of the Phoenix Clan.)

176
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:55,780
(The throne)

177
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,470
(should rightfully be mine.)

178
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,350
The rules of the Phoenix Clan
are really fusty,

179
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,350
leaving such a capable person unused

180
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,840
and insisting on waiting for

181
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,350
someone who is
practically a lifeless shell.

182
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,590
How dare you come here?

183
00:09:19,150 --> 00:09:20,650
If the Phoenix Clan finds out

184
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,700
that I'm colluding with you...

185
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:22,870
Rest assured,

186
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,790
I used the secret way you told me

187
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,870
to get through the barrier.

188
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,270
Nobody will find out.

189
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,690
Where is the Fire Phoenix Jade?

190
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,560
Has it been destroyed?

191
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,060
The Fire Phoenix Jade contains

192
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,440
a prohibition formed by

193
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:34,630
the immortal veins of Daze Mountain.

194
00:09:34,960 --> 00:09:36,940
I can't enter the forbidden area
of Daze Mountain

195
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,350
to explore the veins.

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,150
This is the Star-Seeking Compass.

197
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,390
With this tool,

198
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,470
you can find the location of the veins.

199
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,600
You plotted against me and failed.

200
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:52,630
Why do you think

201
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:54,060
I will still believe you?

202
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,960
Perhaps

203
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:57,660
you've already revealed your true colors.

204
00:09:58,150 --> 00:09:59,240
Once Gu Jin gathers

205
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,470
all Feng Yin's immortal spirit,

206
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:03,750
you may never have another chance.

207
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,660
My master said that

208
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,110
Daze Mountain's trial assembly

209
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,820
is a great opportunity for you.

210
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,560
You are a demon,

211
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,020
but I cannot see through
your true identity.

212
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,940
Who is your master behind you?

213
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,020
You don't need to know these things.

214
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:23,420
Just understand that

215
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:26,990
we all want the Fire Phoenix Jade
to be destroyed.

216
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:29,750
If we succeed in our cooperation,

217
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,820
it will be beneficial for both sides.

218
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,390
Think about it.

219
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,990
This is your last chance.

220
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:53,940
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

221
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:13,470
Your Majesty.

222
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:19,470
Your Majesty,

223
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,620
here is the list of participants for this year's
Trial Assembly.

224
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:22,510
Please take a look.

225
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,020
Qing Yi,

226
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,660
did you see Jin?

227
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,150
No, I didn't.

228
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,940
The list of participants
for the Trial Assembly is here.

229
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,350
Everyone whose names are called,

230
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,990
please come to receive
your immortal artifact.

231
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,900
Wanyi Mountain, Ling Feng.

232
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,420
Kunlun Mountain, Lian Yue.

233
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,350
Leize Mountain, Lei Che.

234
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,940
Wutong Island, Feng Ming.

235
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,110
(Yantian Hall)
Yihua Island, Jun Yu.

236
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,110
Daze Mountain,

237
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,350
Gu Jin.

238
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,230
What...

239
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:14,110
Your Majesty,

240
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,230
Gu Jin

241
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:16,990
could be a mistake.

242
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,390
Is there a problem?

243
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,780
No problem!

244
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,350
No problem!

245
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:27,700
I am present!

246
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:28,750
What are you doing?

247
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,870
You might meet the Thunder Tribulation!

248
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:32,110
Are you crazy?

249
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,660
He won't participate!

250
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,070
I will!

251
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:36,230
- Don't go.
- Why not?

252
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:39,200
Practical experience
is beneficial for ascent.

253
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,390
Honestly,

254
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,150
what are you up to? Tell me.

255
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:43,940
- Nothing, nothing at all.
- You...

256
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:19,750
Hua Shu is here.

257
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,630
I arrived late.

258
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:30,110
I ask Your Majesty,

259
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,310
Master Xian Shan,

260
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,780
and all immortals for forgiveness.

261
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,780
(So he came for Hua Shu.)

262
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:51,420
You are injured, Princess Hua Shu.

263
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:52,540
If you didn't come,

264
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:54,020
it would be reasonable.

265
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,960
As the Salary-Managing Heavenly Official,

266
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,590
I should fulfill my duties faithfully.

267
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,270
How could I delay the selection

268
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,590
because of personal reasons?

269
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,590
If that's all,

270
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,700
let's begin.

271
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,080
Alright.

272
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,990
Just wait for me to come back.

273
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,280
I...

274
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:17,990
This Trial Assembly

275
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:21,020
is for selecting war-managing positions
for the Heavenly Palace.

276
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,590
I hope all of you

277
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:24,150
will compete for the positions

278
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,900
with your full efforts.

279
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,590
Yes.

280
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,960
Wow. That is...

281
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:45,700
This is a thunderbird
from the Heaven Realm.

282
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,890
All of you need to use
your immortal artifacts

283
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,120
to collect a strand of

284
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:51,590
purple lightning from it.

285
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:54,150
The first two immortals
who successfully collect it

286
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,380
will be the winners.

287
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,110
Please remember that

288
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,940
this is only a competition.

289
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:01,470
Never harm each other

290
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:02,900
and ruin the harmony.

291
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,870
If there is any life-threatening danger,

292
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,660
immediately stop the competition.

293
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,110
The Trial Assembly

294
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:10,300
begins.

295
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,800
Jun Yu,

296
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,710
are you alright?

297
00:15:44,630 --> 00:15:45,950
Catching the thunderbird is difficult,

298
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:46,920
but catching you

299
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:48,350
is a piece of cake.

300
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:49,870
You even want to win?

301
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,110
In your dreams!

302
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:40,630
Your Highness, are you okay?

303
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,180
Thank you, Jin.

304
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:52,870
I'll wait to see you win.

305
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:08,590
Hua Shu.

306
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:14,180
Did it affect
your internal injuries just now?

307
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,110
Thanks for your concern, Your Majesty.

308
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:17,950
I'm fine.

309
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:19,550
If you don't take

310
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,070
your injuries seriously now,

311
00:17:21,510 --> 00:17:23,500
they might lead to
hidden ailments in the future.

312
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,220
The crisis on Bainiao Island is urgent,

313
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,720
I don't have the energy
to care about my injuries.

314
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:29,350
I've already sent mediators to intervene

315
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,380
in the war between the Peacock Clan
and the Eagle Clan.

316
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:32,720
It's just that both clans

317
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,870
refused to cease the war,

318
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:35,870
resulting in the current tragic situation.

319
00:17:37,030 --> 00:17:37,870
I have issued an order,

320
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,660
I'll give you a month.

321
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,830
If both clans still refuse to stop the war,

322
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,070
I will hold the two
clan leaders accountable

323
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,260
according to the laws
of the Heavenly Palace.

324
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,590
This is also for the sake
of Bainiao Island.

325
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,590
At least the Peacock Clan

326
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,900
wouldn't be harmed fundamentally.

327
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:55,420
Thank you, Your Majesty.

328
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,260
I overstepped.

329
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,900
Please forgive me.

330
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,310
Ling Feng, you only need to use the hypnosis
spell to collect the purple lightning.

331
00:18:39,310 --> 00:18:40,460
There's no need to harm it.

332
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,870
Feng Ming, take your hypocrisy back!

333
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,860
- You alright?
- I'm fine.

334
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,700
Thank you, Gu Jin.

335
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,190
Gu Jin,

336
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,660
the thunderbird is curious.

337
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,550
Let's use Lin Powder

338
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,620
to attract it,

339
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,180
then use the hypnosis spell to catch it

340
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:00,910
and collect the purple lightning.

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,040
Okay.

342
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:04,240
He got it.

343
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,110
Quite impressive.

344
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:33,630
What should he do?

345
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,470
How should he escape?

346
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,620
Oh no.

347
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,670
Are you kidding me?

348
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,840
Thunder Tribulation!

349
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,030
Why is there a thunder tribulation?

350
00:21:50,550 --> 00:21:51,390
It's Gu Jin.

351
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:52,790
Gu Jin is about to ascend.

352
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:33,110
Yin, what are you doing here?

353
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,150
No time for that.

354
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:36,820
Set up a formation
to block the heavenly thunder.

355
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,900
Get back down there now.

356
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,060
With your current spiritual power,

357
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:40,550
a single thunderbolt can easily kill you.

358
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:41,630
Set up the formation!

359
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,590
(Yin, as Jin's)

360
00:23:03,590 --> 00:23:04,950
(immortal beast,)

361
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,700

I'm fine.

390
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:37,590
- Martial Uncle! Martial Uncle!
- Gu Jin!

391
00:24:37,590 --> 00:24:38,880
Good thing you're okay.

392
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,220
It was really scary just now.

393
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,870
Congratulations, Gu Jin, on successfully

394
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:43,420
ascending to junior immortal.

395
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,240
Gu Jin,

396
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,390
your ascension during the trial

397
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:49,870
is truly admirable,

398
00:24:50,070 --> 00:24:51,150
displaying exceptional

399
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:52,430
mental fortitude.

400
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,830
Thank you, Your Majesty.

401
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,790
Gu Jin's Thunder Tribulation was so powerful.

402
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,830
It knocked me unconscious.

403
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,230
The Trial Assembly

404
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:06,220
has come to an end.

405
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,230
Feng Ming

406
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,900
was the first to collect the purple lightning,

407
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:11,240
and Gu Jin

408
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,460
performed even better
by capturing the thunderbird.

409
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,420
They're about to enter the Heavenly Palace
for official duties.

410
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,150
Any objections from the other immortals?

411
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,950
Congratulations, Gu Jin.

412
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:24,310
Congratulations, Feng Ming.

413
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:25,870
Feng Ming, Gu Jin,

414
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,260
you two can now choose your positions.

415
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,660
Capturing the thunderbird

416
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:31,670
was no easy feat.

417
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,260
So Gu Jin should choose first.

418
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,350
Congratulations, Immortal Gu Jin.

419
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,190
You can choose a position

420
00:25:40,190 --> 00:25:41,590
between the Combat God of the South Pole

421
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,900
and the War God of Yunling.

422
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,630
I choose neither.

423
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,740
I came

424
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,110
just to win the trial.

425
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,350
- Martial Uncle.
- Jin.

426
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:01,430
- Martial Uncle.
- Martial Uncle.

427
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,270
Jin.

428
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,920
Yin, can't you be gentle?

429
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,030
It really hurts.

430
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:32,980
Even the heavenly thunder couldn't kill you.

431
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:34,980
A bandage would hurt you that bad?

432
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:38,670
I'm hungry.

433
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:40,350
I want some food.

434
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:42,960
What's this? Food?

435
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:44,650
Change fresh dressing for yourself later.

436
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:46,260
Then what about food?

437
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,730
I don't have time to find food for you.

438
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:48,570
Go find it

439
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,870
yourself.

440
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:52,150
Come back.

441
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:56,030
What are you busy with?

442
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,590
Looking after me is the most

443
00:26:57,590 --> 00:26:58,900
important thing right now, isn't it?

444
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,190
Don't try to control me

445
00:27:00,190 --> 00:27:01,550
with the master-servant contract.

446
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,580
I want to look at flowers, grass, and the sun.

447
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,870
I don't have time to look after you.

448
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,110
What are you doing?

449
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,390
I'm your master.

450
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,990
My injury requires bed rest.

451
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,830
How could you leave me unattended?
Don't you have any conscience?

452
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:17,670
No.

453
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,590
My conscience

454
00:27:20,270 --> 00:27:21,420
was already gone

455
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:23,070
when you were blinded

456
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:24,070
and smitten by a beauty.

457
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:24,980
All gone.

458
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,400
Going through a Thunder Tribulation
could be extremely dangerous.

459
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,420
Why didn't you tell us you were going
to the Trial Assembly?

460
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,920
Besides, you grabbed that thunderbird

461
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,950
and wouldn't let go

462
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:35,950
because you wanted to impress Hua Shu.

463
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:36,790
Was that necessary?

464
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:37,910
If you were really

465
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,350
- struck by the thunder…
- Take it.

466
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:40,350
What is it?

467
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,630
Yin Fire Yang Ice,

468
00:27:43,070 --> 00:27:44,420
the prize of the Trial Assembly.

469
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,430
Jiu said

470
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,630
with this,

471
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:50,070
you don't have to consume your own
spiritual power to heal him anymore.

472
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:54,950
So… So…

473
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,030
So, you participated in the Assembly

474
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,900
in order to get this?

475
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,000
Or what?

476
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:01,230
I have plenty of opportunities

477
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,030
to impress Princess Hua Shu.

478
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,740
But you are my personal servant.

479
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:07,550
You almost died for healing

480
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,830
that stupid fox.

481
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,720
Alright,

482
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,630
now you can go appreciate the flowers
and the sun.

483
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:15,630
I'm going to take a rest.

484
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:18,150
I wonder

485
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,220
if Princess Hua Shu saw me

486
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,630
when I was successfully ascended.

487
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,830
As it turned out,

488
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:51,740
he tried that hard

489
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:54,830
to help me.

490
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:13,420
Yin,

491
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,830
Jin is very nice to you.

492
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,160
How could you

493
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,460
be so petty?

494
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,180
He likes Hua Shu.

495
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,790
So what?

496
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,830
You shouldn't be upset about it.

497
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:30,740
Then

498
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:34,500
should I help him as well?

499
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,980
I'll help him win Hua Shu's heart.

500
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,700
(Inaction)

501
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,700
Go make the soup.

502
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:47,740
Put more pork liver in it.

503
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,740
Or,

504
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,150
you can put yours in it.

505
00:29:56,830 --> 00:29:57,670
No.

506
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:58,870
Jiu.

507
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:00,840
Jiu.

508
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,590
I wasn't bullying Qing Yi.

509
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Listen,

510
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,590
I'm here to ask you something.

511
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,110
Ask me something?

512
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:09,900
How to chase a girl?

513
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,000
Chase

514
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,080
a girl?

515
00:30:12,270 --> 00:30:13,110
You?

516
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,320
Not me.

517
00:30:14,330 --> 00:30:15,720
Why would I chase a girl?

518
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,100
I want to help Gu Jin.

519
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,840
Help him chase Hua Shu.

520
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,980
Gu Jin.

521
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:26,180
That's easy.

522
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,900
I can teach him the Bewitching Spell
of our Fox Clan.

523
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:31,260
I want to help him chase a girl he likes,

524
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,900
not trick a girl.

525
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:33,740
Besides,

526
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:35,630
the Bewitching Spell can't last forever.

527
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,150
Then let him give the Bainiao Island

528
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:38,420
several carriages of spiritual items.

529
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,110
Daze Mountain is wealthy anyway.

530
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:41,870
No, that's not gonna work.

531
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:45,220
Hua Shu is an immortal princess,
not a slave.

532
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:47,500
She wouldn't be impressed by those things.

533
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:48,550
Moreover,

534
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,460
true love can't be bought.

535
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:51,660
Give me another idea.

536
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,230
Go straight to the point.

537
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,400
Let Gu Jin restrain Hua Shu.

538
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,790
Do you know how to chase a girl or not?

539
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,350
All the ideas you gave me

540
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,550
are bad.

541
00:31:03,550 --> 00:31:04,390
Of course…

542
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,830
- Of course, he doesn't know.
- Before…

543
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:07,390
I'm afraid

544
00:31:07,810 --> 00:31:09,940
Jiu has never even held a girl's hand.

545
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:15,660
You know everything, don't you?

546
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,280
Qing Yi,

547
00:31:17,510 --> 00:31:19,270
- you should mind your own business.
- I…

548
00:31:19,270 --> 00:31:20,740
Have you done cooking?

549
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,030
Forget it. What a waste of time.

550
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,310
I thought since you foxes
can cast Bewitching Spells,

551
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,630
you must have a lot of ideas
for wooing a girl.

552
00:31:30,110 --> 00:31:31,110
Looks like

553
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,700
I can't help Jin after all.

554
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:34,110
Hold on.

555
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,150
If you want to help Martial Uncle Gu Jin,

556
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,460
I do have an idea.

557
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,960
When I was in the mortal world,

558
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:39,830
I read a story book

559
00:31:39,830 --> 00:31:41,590
about a scholar

560
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:42,880
spending three years

561
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:44,420
growing a grove of peach blossoms.

562
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:46,700
When the petals started to fall,

563
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:50,680
he invited the girl he liked to the grove
and confessed his love for her,

564
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:52,790
then the two got married.

565
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:56,570
It's such a good

566
00:31:56,570 --> 00:31:57,700
and unique idea.

567
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,630
So, are you going to let Gu Jin

568
00:32:00,630 --> 00:32:01,870
grow peach blossoms
in Daze Mountain?

569
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:05,310
There's a pear tree
by the hut in the Forbidden Valley.

570
00:32:05,510 --> 00:32:07,230
It may look like an ordinary pear tree,

571
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:09,420
but actually it's Chiluo,
a very rare pear tree species.

572
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,350
Chiluo?

573
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:12,110
But it looks just like

574
00:32:12,110 --> 00:32:13,900
an ordinary pear tree to me.

575
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,670
You don't understand.

576
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,920
The Chiluo flowers won't show

577
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:18,740
unless you nurture it
with immortal power for 20 hours.

578
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,110
Rarely do people care

579
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,070
to spend that long

580
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,260
for nurturing a tree.

581
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,980
Tomorrow is the Qiqiao Festival,

582
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:27,390
and it's such an original idea.

583
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,390
Good. I'm going.

584
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,260
Confess my love for her
under the Chiluo tree on the Qiqiao Festival.

585
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:37,830
What a good idea.

586
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,670
Anyway,

587
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:42,230
I've told you what to do.

588
00:32:42,230 --> 00:32:43,920
It's all up to you now whether or not

589
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:45,220
you are able to ask Hua Shu out.

590
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,260
But just so you know,

591
00:32:49,590 --> 00:32:50,510
if she rejects you

592
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,740
when you ask her out,

593
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:53,700
it'll be your own wishful thinking only,

594
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,160
and it can be very embarrassing.

595
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,000
I don't think so.

596
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,070
I'm going.

597
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,390
I'll go ask her out right now.

598
00:32:58,390 --> 00:32:59,550
Actually, this idea

599
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,500
isn't that good.

600
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,050
I think you should give it another thought.

601
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,890
It's perfect.

602
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,040
Thank you, Yin.

603
00:33:04,350 --> 00:33:05,190
I'm leaving.

604
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:47,900
(Young Hua Shu)

605
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,980
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

606
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:54,180
(Young Lan Feng)
Who are you?

607
00:33:54,350 --> 00:33:55,700
Why are you crying here?

608
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,550
You don't recognize me either?

609
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,480
I'm Princess Hua Shu

610
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,630
of the Bainiao Island.

611
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,630
Should I know you?

612
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,160
Sure,

613
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:12,280
all you can see

614
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,740
is Princess Chen Min,

615
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,790
who's like the light of the sun and the moon,

616
00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,430
outshining me who's insignificant like stars.

617
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:19,510
I'm much more beautiful than her,

618
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:22,140
but she was born to be above me

619
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:24,630
because she's the daughter
of the Heavenly King.

620
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:26,630
One day,

621
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:27,990
I'll let all of you see

622
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,350
that our Peacock Clan

623
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:30,740
is not a second-class immortal clan,

624
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:32,690
and as the princess of the Peacock Clan,

625
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,070
I'm not a foil for anybody.

626
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:46,180
What's this?

627
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,700
When I passed by the Venus today,

628
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,260
it shined so brightly,

629
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,110
so I collected some sparkles of the star.

630
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,260
Look at them.

631
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:57,230
Although they aren't as bright
as the sunlight and the moonlight,

632
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,630
they do flash beautifully in their own way.

633
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,740
No one can outshine your beauty.

634
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,340
(The sparkles of the star
from 200 years ago.)

635
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,550
(I can't believe she's been
carrying them with her.)

636
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:33,760
Your Highness,

637
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,220
Immortal Gu Jin is here.

638
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,160
Gu Jin?

639
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:43,380
I see. You may leave now.

640
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:01,950
Jin,

641
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,180
how's your injury?

642
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,750
It's fine.

643
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:09,030
Your Highness,

644
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:10,790
tomorrow is the Qiqiao Festival.

645
00:36:10,790 --> 00:36:13,300
I'm here to ask
if you'll be available tomorrow.

646
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,660
There's a rare Chiluo tree

647
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:18,590
in the Forbidden Valley
of our Daze Mountain.

648
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,340
So, I'm thinking…

649
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,990
If you don't have time,

650
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,510
it's okay. Then…

651
00:36:26,510 --> 00:36:27,740
Since you are inviting me,

652
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,970
of course I have time.

653
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:31,940
Good.

654
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,220
Then I'll wait for you
in the Forbidden Valley tomorrow.

655
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:35,620
See you then.

656
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,340
See you.

657
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:51,180
Your Highness, I thought

658
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,660
you weren't fond of Gu Jin.

659
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,100
He asked you out on the Qiqiao Festival,

660
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,340
apparently, he wants to go after you.

661
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:56,820
Why did you agree to see him?

662
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:00,780
Gu Jin's cultivation base is so-so,

663
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:03,020
but his origin is quite mysterious.

664
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,060
He shattered the immortal spirit
of the young Fire Phoenix,

665
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:06,540
yet he could still get away with it.

666
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,380
I'm afraid he's got
someone powerful to back him up.

667
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,860
Besides, he has
the Sky-shrouding Umbrella.

668
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:14,660
The more days I keep him around,

669
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,660
the longer I can use the Umbrella.

670
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:18,940
Then what about

671
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,300
Heavenly Emperor Lan Feng?

672
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:23,740
Lan Feng

673
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,700
is an upright and fair-minded man.

674
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:27,940
He's not as easy to manipulate as Gu Jin.

675
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,980
Although he's been at the peak level

676
00:37:29,980 --> 00:37:31,180
of the Senior Immortal for years

677
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,980
and hasn't ascended as a god yet,

678
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:34,940
he's after all the Acting Heavenly Emperor,

679
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,500
whom no one can outpower

680
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,580
throughout the entire world.

681
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,020
I'm just not sure

682
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,700
if the pouch of star sparkles
I dropped on purpose would work.

683
00:37:47,460 --> 00:37:49,500
Your Highness, you are brilliant indeed.

684
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:51,180
I think it worked already.

685
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:57,980
Greetings, Your Majesty.

686
00:37:58,540 --> 00:38:00,140
I found an item that belongs to you,

687
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,380
so I came to return it.

688
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:04,580
I…

689
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:06,260
I dropped it by accident.

690
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,940
Sorry for the trouble.

691
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,620
I didn't expect

692
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,060
that you'd been carrying it

693
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,300
with you for all these years.

694
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,180
I first met you 200 years ago.

695
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,220
Back then,

696
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,420
I was still

697
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,900
an ignorant little girl.

698
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,660
It was kind of embarrassing.

699
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,060
I wish you could forget that.

700
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,540
Hua Shu,

701
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,540
tomorrow is the Qiqiao Festival.

702
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,820
May I invite you

703
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,660
to appreciate the view
on the bridge of magpies with me?

704
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,340
Actually, ever since
I met you 200 years ago,

705
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,380
I've been

706
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,020
thinking of you.

707
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:58,020
Your Majesty, please let me think about it.

708
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,620
Sure.

709
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,860
I'll wait for you.

710
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:17,780
It's been a whole night,

711
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,260
the Chiluo flowers still haven't shown.

712
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,340
Maybe you should take a break.

713
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,980
In case your immortal power runs out
before you could make the flowers show.

714
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,540
It'll harm your body.

715
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,420
Today is the Qiqiao Festival.

716
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,060
I invited Hua Shu

717
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:31,540
to be here to appreciate the flowers.

718
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,500
How can I make her disappointed?

719
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:44,940
You take a break.

720
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,020
Let me try.

721
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,860
Forget about it.

722
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:49,980
With your weak immortal power,

723
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,420
it's not gonna work.

724
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,140
It's working?

725
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:12,980
Let's do it together.

726
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,260
Try again.

727
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,460
Come on.

728
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,780
It really worked.

729
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:00,460
You've got your flowers.

730
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,660
Now we can go back and take a rest.

731
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,660
Hold it.

732
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:06,300
Do me another favor.

733
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,380
Come here.

734
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:09,660
- Why?
- Sit down.

735
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:17,300
Since I'm going to confess
my love for her under the tree,

736
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:21,220
I came up with some lines,
and I'd like to hear your opinions.

737
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,740
Ten years ago,

738
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,100
I first met you,

739
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:36,060
and I've been thinking of you

740
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,180
ever since.

741
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,260
Every time I see you,

742
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:42,380
I want to look at you more.

743
00:41:43,060 --> 00:41:44,740
Every time I hear people talk about you,

744
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,940
I want to hear more.

745
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,020
Today is the Qiqiao Festival.

746
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,660
I want to tell you something

747
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,740
that I've been keeping from you

748
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:52,020
for ten years.

749
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:56,220
I like you.

750
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,820
What do you think?

751
00:42:05,700 --> 00:42:06,860
I thought about it for a long time.

752
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,460
I had no idea what else to say.

753
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:10,260
But I think it'd work.

754
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:11,620
Yin.

755
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,340
Yin.

756
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:15,700
Tell me what you think.

757
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,020
I don't feel well.

758
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:19,780
I'm not worthy… I… I…

759
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:22,060
Figure it out yourself.

760
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,140
I have to go.

761
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:24,260
What are you talking about?

762
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:26,660
You are stumbling.

763
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,020
So weird.

764
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:42,140
Martial Aunt.

765
00:42:42,940 --> 00:42:44,140
Martial Aunt, what's wrong?

766
00:42:44,140 --> 00:42:45,220
Are you feeling unwell?

767
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,500
Martial Aunt.

768
00:42:47,900 --> 00:42:48,740
Martial Aunt.

769
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,580
Martial Aunt,

770
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:03,940
you finally woke up.

771
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:09,900
Yin,

772
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,820
are you okay?

773
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,660
I'm fine.

774
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,300
The master-servant contract acted up,

775
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:15,700
so you fainted.

776
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,460
It acted up

777
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:19,780
because you were thinking
of something against the contract.

778
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,540
Yin,

779
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:22,460
let me ask you,

780
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:24,100
and you must be honest with me.

781
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,140
Were you trying to hurt Gu Jin?

782
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:27,660
Of course not.

783
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,500
How could I hurt him?

784
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,340
Then

785
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,660
do you have feelings for him?
