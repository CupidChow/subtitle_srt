But Jin is risking
his own life for saving you.

Yuan Qi.

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,990
You put the entire Daze Mountain
in danger for one person.

39
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,060
Is it worth it?

40
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,240
Devil God Ming Qi.

41
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:09,110
Since you are here,
why don't you show yourself?

00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,550
The power of chaos is formidable indeed.

43
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:19,810
Unfortunately, your spirit of True God
hasn't formed. There's no point keeping you.

44
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,660
What a pity.

45
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:54,340
Who are you?

46
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:05,150
I'll kill you.

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Qing Yi.

48
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,420
How can I die in your hands?

Jiu.

00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,950
One day when you come to your senses,

51
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,100
will you remember me?

52
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,540
Or, you've always been an evil demon?

53
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,190
I've been wrong about you.

54
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:49,780
Yan Shuang.

55
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,420
Run. Get out of here.

56
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:24,870
I can't control it for long.

57
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,150
Take Qing Yi and leave.

58
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:38,350
Jiu.

59
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,830
Run!

60
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,190
I said, run!

61
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,710
Now!

62
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,230
Fox demon,

63
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,590
give up and surrender.

64
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,280
(Oh, no.)

65
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,390
(Half of my devil energy
is still in Hong Yi's body.)

66
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,660
Fox Queen Hong Ruo.

67
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:43,820
How dare you immortals
hurt my nephew? Let him go.

68
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:48,590
Looks like you did work together
to frame Daze Mountain.

69
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,630
You evil, ruthless demons.

70
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,630
Today, you must pay for what you did.

71
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,510
Fellow immortals, set up the formation.

72
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:26,060
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

73
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:39,470
These bunch of evil demons.

74
00:10:42,550 --> 00:10:43,470
It's gone.

75
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,470
Daze Mountain is gone.

76
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Wind Lord,

77
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,990
the immortal vein of Daze Mountain has…

78
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:59,660
Why is the protection formation
still there?

79
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,580
The protection formation is formed
by the spirits of the deceased immortals.

80
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,970
The spirits are
the vital roots of the immortals.

81
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,590
As long as the spirits are still there,

82
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,750
they can go into the cycle of life
and be reincarnated.

83
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:18,660
However, if the spirits don't want
to enter the Nether Realm,

84
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:23,470
they'll scatter and vanish in three days.

85
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:27,630
To protect their sect, all the
fellow immortals of Daze Mountain

86
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,630
have given up on the opportunity
of reincarnation.

87
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,270
Mu Yue, please send someone to inform

88
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,390
our immortal friends

89
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,820
to bid farewell to Daze Mountain.

90
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:46,870
Yes.

91
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:51,590
Also, alert them to the tragedy happened
to Daze Mountain so they can

92
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,270
raise their guard in case
the demons launch another attack.

93
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,350
Yin is back to life.

94
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:52,580
The Spirit-nourishing Elixir helped her
reach the peak level of Junior Immortal.

95
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,840
Her lifespan has been extended.

96
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,940
Jin, you made it.

97
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:42,870
I thought I died.

98
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:47,180
You wouldn't.

99
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:52,940
I told you that you'd be fine.

100
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,820
Immortals wouldn't die so easily.

101
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:00,630
Trust me.

102
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,540
I trust you.

103
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:36,150
The Heavenly Emperor Bell.

104
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,710
Jin.

105
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,700
The restraint
of the Fire Phoenix Jade is gone.

106
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,060
Something happened to Daze Mountain.

107
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,900
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

108
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:27,980
(Yantian Hall)

109
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,390
Senior brothers.

110
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,180
Senior brothers.

111
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,830
We sensed someone was breaking
through to godship in Daze Mountain.

112
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:51,660
It dawned on us
that we might be fooled by Hong Yi.

113
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,900
So, we all rushed here for a check.

114
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:56,420
Little did we thought

115
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:01,830
that on our way here, we ran into Hong Yi,
and saw him try to kill Yan Shuang and Qing Yi.

116
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:09,550
The ten of us worked an Immortal Net
together and finally suppressed him.

117
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:16,390
But when we got here,
it was already too late.

118
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,070
Chief Xian Shan,

119
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,830
Lord Xian Zhu,

120
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:25,590
and the rest of the disciples

121
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,660
were already dead.

122
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,790
When we got here,

123
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,420
that fox demon was about
to kill Yan Shuang and Qing Yi.

124
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,140
Hadn't we got here in time,

125
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,420
the two would've long been killed.

126
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,220
Even so, they are badly injured
and still in a coma.

127
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,420
It's not possible.

128
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:51,030
I told you that Nine-tailed Fox was suspicious.

129
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,030
He couldn't have broken through to demigod

130
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,980
if he only had the power of a junior immortal.

131
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,390
He's the one who snuck into
the Heavenly Palace and murdered Lan Feng.

132
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,790
He hid his true strength
and fooled everybody.

133
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:03,500
But none of you believed me,
and you insisted on protecting him.

134
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,870

ended up like this.

00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,520
Where are Yan Shuang

186
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,830
and Qing Yi?

187
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,260
How about them?

188
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,390
Your Godship,

189
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,110
this fox demon murdered Lan Feng
and slaughtered the entire Daze Mountain.

190
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,630
His monstrous crime is not to be forgiven.

191
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:01,590
Please uphold justice
and execute this fox demon

192
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:03,590
to avenge our Immortal Realm.

193
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:04,870
Your Godship…

194
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,700
What happened

195
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,260
to Daze Mountain?

196
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:12,660
I… I don't know.

197
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:14,310
I really don't know.

198
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,460
I don't remember anything.

199
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,630
But I didn't murder Lan Feng,
neither did I attack Daze Mountain.

200
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,280
Gu Jin,

201
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:25,910
Yin,

202
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,240
please trust me.

203
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,320
How dare you?

204
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,710
There is no Gu Jin,

205
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,790
only His Godship Yuan Qi.

206
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:37,110
Don't you try to use
your friendship to defend yourself.

207
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:40,700
This is what the Truth Mirror recorded.

208
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,660
Let's see how you'll explain that.

209
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:30,670
I…

210
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:34,590
No.

211
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,240
No.

212
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,150
It's not like that.

213
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,260
It wasn't me.

214
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,260
I was possessed by a devil.

215
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,260
I couldn't control myself.

216
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,700
I'd never hurt Qing Yi and Yan Shuang.

217
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,350
How can I die in your hands?

218
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:01,830
Jiu.

219
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:11,630
You've always been an evil demon.

220
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:18,390
How could that be?

221
00:31:25,310 --> 00:31:26,940
The Truth Mirror is a pure spiritual item,

222
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:28,903
which can only be used for a brief moment

223
00:31:28,927 --> 00:31:31,260
after being nourished continuously
by spiritual power.

224
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,180
Through the Truth Mirror, we all
heard clearly what Yan Shuang said.

225
00:31:36,030 --> 00:31:38,870
This fox demon is responsible for everything.

226
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:43,150
You think you can get away with it
on the excuse of being possessed by a devil?

227
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,310
That is ridiculous.

228
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:46,840
Exactly.

229
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:50,420
The barrier in the Abyss has been intact.

230
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,900
How could a devil get out of it?

231
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:53,220
Even if a devil escaped,

232
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,310
how could the Half-god Demon Dragon
that guards the Abyss not notice?

233
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:58,630
That's right.

234
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:03,790
Even if the devil wants to take control
of someone, it must be a Nine-tailed Fox.

235
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:07,150
And in the Three Realms, besides you,

236
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,420
only your aunt Hong Ruo is a Nine-tailed Fox.

237
00:32:10,070 --> 00:32:12,700
Are you telling us that she is a devil?

238
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,330
The fox demon is rampant
and invaded our Immortal Realm.

239
00:32:16,330 --> 00:32:17,550
He must be executed.

240
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,420
It's obvious that the demons
are plotting against us immortals.

241
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:21,980
We must let them pay.

242
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:29,870
Kill this fox demon.

243
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,180
Your Godship, please give your order.

244
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,790
Your Godship, please give your order.

245
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:51,180
If I hadn't left Daze Mountain,
I could've stopped all this from happening.

246
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:03,870
Your Godship,

247
00:33:04,590 --> 00:33:07,500
what this fox demon did is unforgivable.
He must be executed.

248
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,460
Your Godship, please
uphold justice for the immortals.

249
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:15,220
Jin.

250
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,110
Your Godship.

251
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:26,940
Your… Your Godship.

252
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,790
This thing is not yet clear.

253
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,940
Why don't we make a decision
after Qing Yi and Yan Shuang wake up?

254
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,660
Put Hong Yi in the Immortal-locking Tower.

255
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:45,390
In a few days,

256
00:33:49,030 --> 00:33:50,660
he'll be punished by Heavenly Thunder.

257
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,740
After all,

258
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:03,390
Daze Mountain was destroyed by him.

259
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,550
You were captured by the Immortal Net
when you went after Yan Shuang and Qing Yi.

260
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:18,630
If you were telling the truth,
the devil should still be in your body.

261
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,990
Your Godship,

262
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:25,780
even though the Heavenly Thunder
can expel devil spirits,

263
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:28,070
if there's no devil,

264
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,910
the one who's struck by the thunder
would also vanish.

265
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,150
So what?

266
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,220
If you told the truth,

267
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,430
the Thunder will force the devil
out of your body

268
00:34:40,430 --> 00:34:42,300
without harming you,

269
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,550
and that'll prove your innocence.

270
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,260
But, Hong Yi,

271
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:52,220
if there's no devil
in your body as you claimed,

272
00:34:57,590 --> 00:34:59,550
you'll have to pay for what you did.

273
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,820
(Hall of Arms)

274
00:35:21,510 --> 00:35:26,180
His Godship asked me
to set up a magic formation to treat them.

275
00:35:26,630 --> 00:35:29,300
But, their spiritual cores are damaged.

276
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:32,110
It'll take a few days before they can recover.

277
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:35,430
His Godship asks you
to stay here and take care of them.

278
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,110
He wants to be alone.

279
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:25,100
(Disciple Roll)

280
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:50,220
Martial Aunt, tomorrow you'll
go down the mountain with Martial Uncle.

281
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,950
Take this Shape-forming Brush.

282
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,840
You know Martial Uncle isn't that capable.

283
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,630
It'll be helpful if you are in trouble.

284
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,800
Yin, this is a Qiankun Pouch I made.

285
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,550
It'll be of help.

286
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,700
And this 1,000-year-old ginseng
can cure all diseases.

287
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,120
Take it.

288
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,650
Martial Aunt, this is my gift for you.

289
00:37:09,650 --> 00:37:10,540
And mine.

290
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,800
Martial Aunt, this is mine.

291
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:14,070
This is mine. This is mine.

292
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:15,760
And mine. This is mine.

293
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:16,910
Take it, Martial Aunt.

294
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:27,860
(Senior brothers, did we make a mistake?)

295
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,860
(The Demon Realm)

296
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:36,550
What?

297
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:41,740
Gu Jin of Daze Mountain
is the son of Yi He and Di Juan?

298
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:43,840
(It's bad.)

299
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,590
(If he finds out the devil energy I left in
Hong Yi's body, it'll be more troublesome.)

300
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,780
True God Yuan Qi's god power
has been awakened.

301
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:51,990
He's a True God,

302
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:54,990
so he'll treat all immortals and demons
equally and find out the truth.

303
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,260
We should stay put
and figure out what to do next.

304
00:37:59,030 --> 00:37:59,870
No way.

305
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,990
Daze Mountain is the sect
where True God Yuan Qi belongs.

306
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,910
It'll only put Hong Yi
in a more dangerous situation.

307
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,070
We must get Hong Yi out of there.

308
00:38:07,550 --> 00:38:10,510
Otherwise, I'm afraid he'll be killed.

309
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,860
Her Highness is right.

310
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,820
We must save Prince Hong Yi's life

311
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,110
even if a True God stands in our way.

312
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:17,470
Let's go.

313
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:26,700
(War God Hall)

314
00:38:34,710 --> 00:38:35,590
Spirit Sword.

315
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,430
Master doesn't want to see you.

316
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,240
Then…

317
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,630
Then how has he been doing?

318
00:39:19,630 --> 00:39:20,660
Your Godship.

319
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,280
Please… go back.

320
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,150
Please help me give this to him.

321
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,060
(War God Hall)

322
00:41:03,510 --> 00:41:07,660
Everybody is gone.

323
00:41:08,110 --> 00:41:09,220
Xian Shan once said

324
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:15,380
Donghua predicted that Daze Mountain
would protect you from a tragedy.

325
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,660
But I never thought it'd become like this.

326
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,150
I'll leave

327
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,300
(Tablet)
our sect to you.

328
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,300
(Tablet)

329
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:45,910
Jin, whatever decision
you make in any case,

330
00:41:46,150 --> 00:41:48,860
we will always support you.

331
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:52,510
Do whatever you want without concern.

332
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,110
So, my senior brother
knew this would happen,

333
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,340
yet he still chose to support my decisions.

334
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:06,180
It's my fault. I should've noticed it earlier.

335
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:12,910
Hadn't been
for Daze Mountain's protection,

336
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:18,030
I wouldn't have become who I am.

337
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:19,950
Your Godship,

338
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,780
your power has been awakened for two days.

339
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:25,300
The gate of the God Realm is opened already.

340
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,990
According to the Ancestral God's rules,

341
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,860
you need to return
to the God Realm in three days.

342
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:34,740
I still have things to do. I can't go back.
