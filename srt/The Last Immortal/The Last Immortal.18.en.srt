Jin.

The Sleeping Bug I refined never failed.

32
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,550
You are amazing, Jiu.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,020
The Heavenly Matchmaker asked us
to use this gourd to collect Jin's dreams,

34
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,390
where we can find his affection ties
from his old memories about love.

35
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,960
Got it.

36
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:15,980
Let's go. Come on.

37
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:18,990
My head hurts.

38
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,340
What are you guys doing here?

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,670
I'm passing by.

40
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,460
I came to fetch a book.

41
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,230
I'm here for a tour.

42
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,460
Why are you…

43
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,800
Yin,

44
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,710
why are you holding a gourd
above your head?

45
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,830
They said I looked good in this way.

46
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,430
Well,

47
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:52,860
not really.

48
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,300
Why were they all here?

49
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,430
And acting so weird.

50
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,110
They must be keeping
something from me.

51
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,990
Go to Bainiao Island right now
and report to His Lordship

52
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:07,360
that Princess Hua Shu went to the dangerous
secret area of the Inferno Sea alone

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,990
to look for the parasol tree
for Immortal Gu Jin.

54
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,080
Let him send help to…

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,920
Hongque,

56
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:13,230
what did you say?

57
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,870
Your Lordship,

58
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,960
you…

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,580
Actually…

60
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,630
Actually, Her Highness knew
you were looking for the parasol tree,

61
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,710
so she's been keeping an eye on it.

62
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:29,750
A few days ago, she finally found a clue
from an ancient book in our clan.

63
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,870
But the secret area
of the Inferno Sea is too dangerous.

64
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,200
I was going to stop her from going,

65
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:37,580
but it's my fault
that I sent the wrong message

66
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,550
and made Yin late
for welcoming the Nether King.

67
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:44,870
But, Her Highness took
full responsibility for it

68
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,780
and wanted to make up
for the mistake whatsoever,

69
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,420
so she went to the secret area alone.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,710
Hua Shu really feels guilty
about Yin's matter?

71
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:57,030
Yes.

72
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,560
(Fine.)

73
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:03,020
(After all, she took the risk
to help me look for the parasol tree.)

74
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,630
(I can't sit back and do nothing.)

75
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,580
I'll go find her.

76
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:15,580
(Secret Area of the Inferno Sea)

77
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:29,540
(There really is a parasol tree.)

78
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,760
Immortal spirit.

79
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,150
This is

80
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,420
the tinder vine
that'd spit fire when in danger.

81
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,070
Your Highness.

82
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:02,710
(Oh, no. It's blood-sucking sand,)

83
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,420
(the fieriest flame spiritual stone.)

84
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,520
Run.

85
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,150
Are you okay?

86
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,230
Sorry, Jin.

87
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,220
I just wanted to help you find
Feng Yin's immortal spirit.

88
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,510
I didn't expect the tinder vine
could be this powerful.

89
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,390
(He's a True God indeed.)

90
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:05,780
(His power improved rapidly
in such a short time.)

91
00:08:12,830 --> 00:08:14,780
(Impart Wisdom to Offspring)
You bunch of bullies. Let me go.

92
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,110
Let me go.

93
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,270
Let go of me.

94
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,400
Do you hear me?

95
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:20,310
No matter what, I will not kiss…

96
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,580
Today, whether you want

97
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:31,270
or not, it's not up to you.

98
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,060
That's enough.

99
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,150
Is that how Jin thinks of me?

100
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:52,350
Yin, good for you.

101
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,060
You threw yourself right at him.

102
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,270
Gu Jin is such a narcissist.

103
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:09,820
What happened

104
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:11,900
to the gourd?

105
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,200
I've sensed that
the dreamer's affection ties

106
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,660
(The Heavenly Matchmaker)
haven't been destroyed yet.

107
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,770
But usually,

108
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,470
my spellworking could've summoned
the affection ties back right away.

109
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:27,900
So, what should we do now?

110
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,300
If I'm right,

111
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,540
his affection ties are sealed
by some sort of powerful force.

112
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,940
We need to find
his affection ties back as soon

113
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:39,150
as possible.

114
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,300
If it's too late,

115
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,540
he may develop affections
towards someone else,

116
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:46,510
and the old affection ties
can never be restored.

117
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:47,860
Where can we find them then?

118
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:51,020
The Three Realms are huge.
We don't know where to start.

119
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,180
I don't know either,

120
00:09:53,630 --> 00:09:57,500
but throughout the world, there are very few
tools that can remove affection ties.

121
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,300
Among them, the Memory-erasing Flute
of Daze Mountain works the best.

122
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,940
Daze Mountain?

123
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:06,800
Sir,

124
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,180
are you sure it's Daze Mountain?

125
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,510
Daze Mountain?

126
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,510
Isn't that the sect that Yin
and Gu Jin belong to?

127
00:10:17,870 --> 00:10:18,750
Then there's no question

128
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,510
that someone removed Gu Jin's affection ties
with the Memory-erasing Flute.

129
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,990
So, my senior brothers
are all aware of it.

130
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:28,110
They don't want me
to be with Gu Jin either.

131
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,040
Yin,

132
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,590
it doesn't matter
whether they know or not.

133
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,660
What matters is that we have a clue now.

134
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,590
Yin,

135
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,560
don't worry.

136
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,080
I'll go to Daze Mountain right now
and help you find Gu Jin's affection ties back.

137
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:48,870
He'll be your lover again in no time.

138
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:53,580
(Heavenly Palace, the Immortal Realm)

139
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,540
Your Highness, have a good rest.

140
00:10:59,150 --> 00:10:59,990
I'll leave now.

141
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,020
Thank you, Jin. Take care.

142
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,060
Your Highness. Your Highness.

143
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,310
Your Lordship, I'll go get some medicine.

144
00:11:11,310 --> 00:11:13,230
Could you please watch
Her Highness for a while?

145
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:14,590
Go ahead.

146
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:15,710
I'll be here.

147
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:17,990
Thank you, Your Lordship.

148
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:31,820
Sorry, Jin.

149
00:11:32,910 --> 00:11:33,990
Instead of helping you,

150
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:37,020
I caused you trouble.

151
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,020
Your Highness,
you got hurt for helping me.

152
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,180
How could you cause me trouble?

153
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,390
Your Highness, you are badly injured.
Why are you being so hard on yourself?

154
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,420
I've got used to a small injury like this.

155
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,390
You know what, Jin?

156
00:11:59,390 --> 00:12:02,470
Actually, I envy Yin a lot

157
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,350
that she has a senior brother
like you to protect her.

158
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,270
Unlike her,

159
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:10,020
my father is old,

160
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:13,060
and my brother is incapable.

161
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,660
I had to learn to be independent
since I was little.

162
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:21,510
I know I did a lot of selfish things
for Bainiao Island.

163
00:12:21,910 --> 00:12:23,390
You have every right
to be angry with me.

164
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,320
- But…
- Your Highness,

165
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,230
I've told you,
it's all water under the bridge.

166
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,820
Let's not talk about that anymore.

167
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,160
Jin,

168
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:42,020
you must hate people like me, don't you?

169
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:44,630
If I had a choice,

170
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:48,870
I'd rather be innocent
and carefree like Yin is,

171
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,820
doing whatever I want to do

172
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:53,350
and going after the one I love.

173
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,150
Your Highness, you should
relax and be who you are.

174
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:00,110
Yin doesn't have
my protection all the time.

175
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:03,060
Instead, a lot of times,
she's the one who helps me.

176
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,150
I see that you are tired. I'll leave now.

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,230
Your Highness, rest well.

178
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:23,470
(I didn't expect it'd be this hard
to win Gu Jin's heart back.)

179
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,420
(It's not as easy
to manipulate him as before.)

180
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:39,820
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

181
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,970
We need to find
his affection ties back as soon

182
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,180
as possible.

183
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,150
If it's too late,

184
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,510
he may develop affections
towards someone else,

185
00:13:47,790 --> 00:13:52,020
and the old affection ties
can never be restored.

186
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:57,340
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

187
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,990
Yin, when will you go back
to Daze Mountain to get the Flute?

188
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,540
I need more time to think about it.

189
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,100
You've been wanting to help Gu Jin
find his affection ties back.

190
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,940
And now, you finally have a clue.

191
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:36,470
Why are you hesitating?

192
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,110
Because I feel like I'm the only one
who wants this relationship to happen.

193
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,230
I don't have my senior brothers' support.

194
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,230
I'm afraid they wouldn't
give me the Flute.

195
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,630
But, who you love
should be your own decision.

196
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,630
Does it matter whether or not
you have their support?

197
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:06,590
If you are destined
to get hurt from this relationship,

198
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,060
will you regret it?

199
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,110
I won't.

200
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,510
Then there you go.

201
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,350
You should follow your heart then.

202
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:21,230
Perhaps, because of what happened
between Wan Yue and Xian Zhu,

203
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,300
my senior brothers don't want Jin
to go through the same.

204
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:29,780
Who would know
what will happen in the future?

205
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:32,430
Besides, it's up to Gu Jin

206
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,630
what he wants to experience

207
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:35,630
and what he doesn't.

208
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,780
The others have no right
to make a decision for him.

209
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:41,750
Even so, they still
wouldn't give me the Flute.

210
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,300
Three-life Stone will figure out a way.

211
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,540
Think about it,

212
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,710
she can go into anywhere
in the Three Realms to match people up.

213
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,510
You think Daze Mountain can stop her?

214
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:57,900
Stop worrying.

215
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,860
(Entrance, Daze Mountain)

216
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:40,820
(Clouds Form over Mountains)

217
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,160
Your Lordship.

218
00:16:51,870 --> 00:16:52,820
Immortal Gu Jin.

219
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:56,110
I heard you've been
taking care of my daughter. Thank you.

220
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,320
Don't.

221
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,990
She got hurt for helping me.

222
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,320
I should look after her.

223
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:02,920
Your Lordship.

224
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,700
Your Lordship, the Energy Protection Arrow
has been forged successfully.

225
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,760
Good.

226
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,630
Then I'll take my leave.

227
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,760
Alright.

228
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,590
Let's go.

229
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:37,950
Leave us.

230
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,800
Yes.

231
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:57,630
Gu Jin humiliated you on Bainiao Island.

232
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,390
Why are you trying to draw him over?

233
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,870
It's not guaranteed that I can become
one of the five Immortal Lords.

234
00:18:03,790 --> 00:18:05,310
It's better to be fully prepared.

235
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:08,870
Shu,

236
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,500
I have an idea,

237
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:16,390
but I need you to do one thing.

238
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:26,670
This arrow contains
mighty spiritual power.

239
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:29,740
I'm sure it can protect
the finger bone of Lord Zhen Yi.

240
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:35,350
Later, I'll personally escort the Arrow
into the Secret Storeroom.

241
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:37,800
Yan Shuang,

242
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:38,910
Yin,

243
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,260
you two forged the Arrow.

244
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:42,030
You can go with me.

245
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,560
Yes.

246
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:56,630
This arrow looks exactly
like the Energy Protection Arrow.

247
00:18:56,630 --> 00:18:58,910
Before the display
of the finger bone of Lord Zhen Yi,

248
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:03,110
the Energy Protection Arrow
will be kept in the Secret Storeroom.

249
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:06,390
You want to replace the Arrow
with this one?

250
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:07,480
That's right.

251
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:10,330
But it takes the permission document
to open the Secret Storeroom.

252
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:13,390
Lan Feng and Wind Lord each hold half.

253
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:17,310
It's easy to get the half
that Wind Lord has,

254
00:19:17,550 --> 00:19:20,700
but it's quite difficult
to sneak in Lan Feng's Lingyu Hall.

255
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:25,900
So, I need you to think of a way
to get the half that Lan Feng has.

256
00:19:26,110 --> 00:19:28,030
Open the Secret Storeroom
and replace the Arrow.

257
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:29,870
Wind Lord,

258
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,940
Lingyu Hall and the Hall of Wind should each
hold half of the permission document.

259
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:36,500
The gate of the Secret Storeroom can't
be opened until the two halves combined.

260
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:37,500
Yes, Your Majesty.

261
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,700
Our Hall of Wind is taking
the night shift tonight.

262
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:45,030
I'll ask someone from the Hall of Wind
to take the half of the document

263
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,150
and go there with you.

264
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:48,390
Alright.

265
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:52,230
The finger bone of Lord Zhen Yi
is a holy item of the Demon Realm.

266
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,410
It matters to the peace
between the immortals and the demons.

267
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,350
We can't make a reckless move.

268
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,460
To tell you the truth, it's actually
Hong Ruo who asked me to do it.

269
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,310
She's got the goods on the immortals.

270
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,500
As long as we help her do this,

271
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,150
she'll help you become
one of the five Immortal Lords.

272
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,870
But, why does the Fox Queen want
to destroy the holy item of the Demon Realm?

273
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:17,790
(I can't tell Shu she wants
to steal the God-killing Flower's seed.)

274
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:22,220
(Otherwise, with her personality,
she wouldn't agree to do it.)

275
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,390
Shu,

276
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:28,220
the Nirvana Wheel, the magic weapon
of the former Fox King,

277
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,390
is locked in the Secret Storeroom
of the Heavenly Palace.

278
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:34,790
Compared to the finger bone of Lord Zhen Yi,
they want the Nirvana Wheel more.

279
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,150
Hong Ruo wants to use the fake arrow

280
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,220
to trick the Immortal Realm
into feeling guilty,

281
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:43,070
so they can get the Nirvana Wheel back.

282
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,110
But our Bainiao Island
is a prestigious sect in the Immortal Realm.

283
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,310
How can we do things for the Demon Realm?

284
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,660
Shu,

285
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,590
we both know the situation
of our Bainiao Island.

286
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,550
This is the only choice
for our sect to be empowered again.

287
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,790
Once you get the position,

288
00:20:58,110 --> 00:21:01,070
we'll no longer need the support
of the South Sea.

289
00:21:10,350 --> 00:21:12,150
Even if the Demon Realm
gets the Nirvana Wheel back,

290
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,630
it won't do the Immortal Realm any harm.

291
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,590
Why don't we just do her this favor?

292
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,180
Father, what you said makes sense.

293
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,590
But, I can't do this thing myself.

294
00:21:28,350 --> 00:21:30,940
It's easy to leave traces
and expose myself.

295
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,900
Father.

296
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:43,540
(Secret Storeroom)

297
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:49,700
Greetings, Your Majesty.
I'm Jiu of the Hall of Wind.

298
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,660
Wind Lord asks me to go
to the Secret Storeroom with you.

299
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,820
(Secret Storeroom)

300
00:22:08,310 --> 00:22:09,310
Greetings, Your Majesty.

301
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:10,870
According to the rules,

302
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,390
we need to check the items
that'll be stored in the Storeroom.

303
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,520
Yin.

304
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,830
There's no problem with the Arrow.
Please, Your Majesty.

305
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:29,670
Thanks.

306
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,390
(His Majesty is here.)

307
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,870
(How is Jiu supposed
to find the Nirvana Wheel?

308
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:02,420
(The Hall of Arms)

309
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,620
(The Hall of Arms)

310
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:33,580
(The Hall of Arms)

311
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:40,940
Your Majesty,

312
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,380
the spirit of Thunder Lord's
old weapon Flame Blade

313
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,900
suddenly woke up. It flew out of the Arsenal

314
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,700
and had a fight with his new sword.

315
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,670
Thunder Lord went to subdue the two,

316
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,740
but the Flame Blade
turned around and stabbed him.

317
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:53,950
How did that happen?

318
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,030
The Blade stabbed through his chest.
His life is in danger right now.

319
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:01,150
The immortal physician said only the water
of the Xuan Pond you have can save his life.

320
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,900
Your Majesty, please go rescue him.

321
00:24:13,750 --> 00:24:18,790
Yin, I'll leave the Arrow to you and Jiu.
Please lock it in the Storeroom.

322
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:19,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

323
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:24,180
Feng Ming, stay here with Yin.
Help them guard this place.

324
00:24:24,350 --> 00:24:25,190
Yes.

325
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,110
Yan Shuang.

326
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:28,740
You are in charge of the Hall of Arms.

327
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:31,660
Come with me to deal
with the Flame Blade incident.

328
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,040
Yes.

329
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,000
Yin.

330
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:37,830
The Secret Storeroom is a restricted place.

331
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:40,220
Remember to keep the permission document
well after you come out.

332
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:41,630
Report back to me once it's done.

333
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:42,900
I will.

334
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,560
Let's go.

335
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,940
See you, Your Majesty.

336
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,720
Yin, Jiu,

337
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,590
my duty is to guard the Secret Storeroom
and I do not have the right to enter.

338
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,790
So I will wait for you outside the door.

339
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,840
Thank you.

340
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,040
Let's go.

341
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,590
This Secret Storeroom is huge.

342
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:49,550
Where do you think
the Nirvana Wheel might be?

343
00:25:50,310 --> 00:25:51,150
It won't be easy to find.

344
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:52,240
Let's go.

345
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,660
Found it.

346
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,500
This is the Nirvana Wheel?

347
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,320
Yes,

348
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:15,390
it's a powerful weapon
that belonged to my father.

349
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,180
Only a nine-tailed fox can wield it.

350
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,940
However, after my father's death in battle,
it was locked here,

351
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:23,150
becoming ownerless.

352
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,390
Since that's the case,
you should take it back

353
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:29,140
It should have been
passed down to you anyway.

354
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,070
It's not time for that yet.

355
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,390
We entered the Secret Storeroom together.

356
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,030
If they discover something missing,

357
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,220
I would at most leave the Immortal Realm.

358
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,940
But you might face problems.

359
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,030
One day, I will rightfully
reclaim the Nirvana Wheel.

360
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,000
Is everything okay?

361
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:52,950
Yes.

362
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:00,870
The God-killing Flower's seed!

363
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:16,350
Has it recognized you as its master?

364
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,870
What's wrong?

365
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,720
Jiu!

366
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,500
(Secret Storeroom)

367
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:45,350
Jiu!

368
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,320
Elder Feng Ming,

369
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,400
did you see anything
suspicious flying out?

370
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,770
No, I didn't.

371
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:53,610
No?

372
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:56,070
I only saw Jiu rushing out in a hurry.

373
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,150
(What did Jiu see?)

374
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,150
Aunt, why are you here?

375
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,630
I should be asking you that.

376
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,740
I came for the Spiritual Trigram Assembly.

377
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:20,460
Why are you here?

378
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,940
I'll explain later.

379
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:25,260
I seemed to have seen the demonic wheel
that led me to Ziyue Mountain.

380
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,860
It looks a lot like the Nirvana Wheel.

381
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:27,950
Have you seen it, Aunt?

382
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:28,790
No.

383
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,390
I came from this route,

384
00:28:30,830 --> 00:28:33,150
and there was nothing else except you.

385
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,390
You roam around
the Immortal Realm all the time,

386
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,150
and now you're even
in the Heavenly Palace.

387
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,500
Do you still know your identity?

388
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,550
I'm just here
to find my father's Nirvana Wheel.

389
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:47,020
I saw a ring-shaped weapon
that looked very similar to it just now.

390
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,460
The Nirvana Wheel is a sacred item of
the Fox Clan, unique in the world.

391
00:28:50,010 --> 00:28:52,150
How can there be a weapon similar to that?

392
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,790
You've been in the Immortal Realm for
too long, affected by immoral power,

393
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:57,590
and even experiencing hallucinations.

394
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,570
It's time for you
to return to Jingyou Mountain.

395
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,590
I cannot go back yet.

396
00:29:01,550 --> 00:29:04,420
Aunt, you suspect that Elder Hong Mei's
death is related to the Immortal Realm,

397
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,350
but I investigated it
and I don't think that's true.

398
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,570
I just need some time to confirm the details.

399
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,430
There's no need
to investigate this matter further.

400
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:14,250
If it's not the Immortal Realm,
then who else could it be?

401
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:15,390
Do you think they would

402
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:18,260
leave behind any clues
for you to discover so easily?

403
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,590
If you don't return soon,
I'll expose your identity.

404
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,460
Let's see if the Heavenly Palace
will still welcome you

405
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,230
when they know who you really are.

406
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:28,070
No,

407
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,980
if they find out that I'm a demon,

408
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:32,390
it will implicate Gu Jin and Yin.

409
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:36,190
Enough.

410
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:37,790
I've explained the pros and cons.

411
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:39,700
You can make your own choice.

412
00:30:07,160 --> 00:30:08,640
(Secret Storeroom)
Jiu,

413
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
did you find anything?

414
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,630
Maybe I made a mistake.

415
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,310
But the Nirvana Wheel
did act weirdly just now.

416
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:17,660
But I

417
00:30:19,310 --> 00:30:20,590
just met Hong Ruo, the Fox Queen,

418
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,500
and she didn't notice anything unusual.

419
00:30:24,310 --> 00:30:26,940
I've been outside the door,
didn't notice anything strange.

420
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,790
Besides, the Secret Storeroom
is heavily guarded,

421
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,500
surrounded by soldiers.

422
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,730
If there were anything unusual,
we would have seen it.

423
00:30:33,730 --> 00:30:34,870
Just be cautious.

424
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,000
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly
is approaching,

425
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,150
we must beware of anyone
with ulterior motives causing trouble.

426
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,100
Don't worry.

427
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,350
I'll send more guards to watch over it.

428
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,958
The Spiritual Trigram Assembly was established

429
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:49,870
by our ancestors for the harmony
of the Three Realms.

430
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,900
It should take place every century,

431
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,350
but due to the conflicts between
the Immortal and Demon Realms,

432
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:57,660
it had been suspended for hundreds of years.

433
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,940
Today, we've come together again

434
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,310
to express the sincerity of the Immortal Realm,

435
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:06,280
hoping to resolve the conflicts with the Demon
and Nether Realms,

436
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:10,740
promoting peace for generations to come.

437
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:45,940
I know that Lord Zhen Yi is the supreme
sage of the Demon Realm,

438
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,980
and today, we'll return this finger bone
to the Demon Realm

439
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,740
as a gesture of goodwill.

440
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:58,700
If Your Majesty is willing
to return the finger bone,

441
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:01,220
our Demon Realm
will reciprocate with gratitude.

442
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,720
Okay.

443
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:09,590
From now on, as long as the Immortal Realm
doesn't actively invade us,

444
00:32:10,030 --> 00:32:13,940
our Demon Realm will never engage in
armed conflicts with the Immortal Realm.

445
00:32:15,590 --> 00:32:17,310
This is the joint will of the Three Realms.

446
00:32:17,550 --> 00:32:20,180
I, Lan Feng, propose a toast
to the Demon King.

447
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,070
This is your sincerity?

448
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,430
Your Immortal Realm has gone too far!

449
00:33:00,430 --> 00:33:02,740
Demon King, this is by no means
the intention of the Immortal Realm.

450
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,700
There must be something suspicious.

451
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,540
Suspicious?

452
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,900
I think the most suspicious thing is the arrow.

453
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,040
Lan Feng,

454
00:33:09,550 --> 00:33:11,150
are you intentionally
staging a show here

455
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:15,320
to humiliate us demons
in front of the Three Realms?

456
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:18,760
Your Majesty,

457
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,630
the details of this matter are not clear yet.

458
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,590
We need to investigate
before making a judgment.

459
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:26,550
If someone is intentionally trying to provoke
a conflict between immortals and demons,

460
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:28,150
then falling into their trap would be unwise.

461
00:33:29,550 --> 00:33:30,390
Exactly.

462
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,180
We cannot draw conclusions at this moment.

463
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:36,110
No matter what, the Immortal Realm must
provide an explanation today.

464
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,150
This concerns the relationship between
the Immortal and Demon Realms.

465
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:40,960
I must investigate thoroughly.

466
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,150
Yan Shuang,

467
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,980
your Hall of Arms was responsible
for casting the Arrow.

468
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:47,740
What do you have to say?

469
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,520
Your Majesty,

470
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,670
when the Energy Protection Arrow
was sent into the Secret Storeroom,

471
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,420
it underwent strict inspection
and had no issues.

472
00:33:55,110 --> 00:33:58,150
Could it be that someone tampered with it
after it entered the Secret Storeroom?

473
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:00,430
Your Highness,

474
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,310
are you suspecting our Hall of Arms?

475
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:10,430
Your Majesty,

476
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,030
yesterday, before sending the Arrow
into the Secret Storeroom,

477
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:16,740
Yan Shuang and you left together.

478
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,340
I was ordered to guard
outside the Secret Storeroom.

479
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:25,240
The last ones who entered the Secret Storeroom
were Yin and Jiu from the Hall of Wind.

480
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:31,840
Your Majesty,

481
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:34,630
I heard that there is a treasure in the
Heavenly Palace called the Truth Mirror,

482
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:37,630
which can trace everything that happened in the
Immortal Realm within the past 24 hours.

483
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,590
Why not bring it out
and investigate the truth?

484
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,150
Fetch the Truth Mirror.

485
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,380
How could this be?

486
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,700
The Mirror is not working
at this critical moment.

487
00:35:16,150 --> 00:35:18,110
It's too coincidental.

488
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,280
Your Majesty,

489
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,990
Jiu was sent by me
to deliver the permission document.

490
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:26,660
I believe he couldn't possibly
have sabotaged the Arrow.

491
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:31,340
In this case, the female immortal Yin
is undoubtedly the culprit.

492
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:38,660
Your Majesty, the Truth Mirror
was stored in Lingyu Hall,

493
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,150
and heavily guarded.

494
00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:41,670
With Yin's immortal power,

495
00:35:41,670 --> 00:35:45,180
how could she sabotage both the Arrow
and the Mirror in one night?

496
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,990
I think there must be someone else
behind all this.

497
00:35:48,510 --> 00:35:49,860
Please investigate further, Your Majesty.

498
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,320
Enough!

499
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,820
Do you think blame-shifting

500
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,220
can protect the true culprit?

501
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:01,320
You think you can deceive us like this?

502
00:36:01,670 --> 00:36:02,950
Demon King, please be patient.

503
00:36:03,510 --> 00:36:05,390
We have no intention of covering up.

504
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:07,500
We will give the Demon Realm
an explanation.

505
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:10,660
How can your Immortal Realm
uphold justice for our Demon Realm?

506
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,510
The God Envoy has arrived!

507
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:27,950
Your Ladyship.

508
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,350
I have heard the details on my way here.

509
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:32,950
Allow me to ask a question.

510
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:36,550
Why did Lan Feng and Yan Shuang leave

511
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,030
during the escort
of the Energy Protection Arrow?

512
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,510
That day, the normally dormant
Flame Blade suddenly became agitated

513
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,380
and severely injured Thunder Lord,

514
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,340
forcing me to leave.

515
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,510
And who was responsible for guarding

516
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:54,510
Flame Blade?

517
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,340
The Hall of Arms.

518
00:36:58,670 --> 00:37:01,740
I'm asking the specific person in charge.

519
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:08,660
It was Yin.

520
00:37:09,510 --> 00:37:13,690
Yin forged and placed the Arrow into
the Secret Storeroom.

521
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,430
His Majesty had to leave midway because she,

522
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:19,950
who was supposed to watch over
the Flame Blade, failed in her duty.

523
00:37:21,230 --> 00:37:24,950
From the looks of it, Yin seems to be
involved in some way.

524
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:25,860
Lady Hong Chou.

525
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,070
The spiritual energy on the Arrow
is abundant.

526
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,070
Yin is merely a small immortal beast.

527
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:31,870
If she really wanted
to tamper with the arrow,

528
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:33,820
she would have been
harmed by its spiritual energy.

529
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,260
Yin was my fellow disciple
from Daze Mountain.

530
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:38,260
I know her character the best.

531
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,790
I vouch for her
in the name of Daze Mountain

532
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:42,910
that she could not
have tampered with the Arrow.

533
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,660
Regardless of the purpose,

534
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,260
anyone daring to have ill intentions towards
our Demon Realm's holy item

535
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:53,300
will not be tolerated by me.

536
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,910
Your Ladyship, please testify for us.

537
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,950
If the Immortal Realm cannot provide
an explanation to the Demon Realm,

538
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:04,030
my million-strong demon army
will march to the Ghost Land

539
00:38:04,230 --> 00:38:06,820
and attack the Heavenly Palace for justice.

540
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,910
Since the Immortal Realm has destroyed
our holy item,

541
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,180
they should compensate us.

542
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,510
Let us take control of
the unclaimed territory

543
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,430
south of the Ghost Land, 500 kilometers
in radius, as a settlement.

544
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:31,470
I am willing to gift 250 kilometers
of territory south of the Ghost Land

545
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:34,340
to the Demon Realm
to compensate for the damage.

546
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:37,820
(A radius of 250 kilometers?)

547
00:38:38,670 --> 00:38:40,550
(This way, Ningyun Mountain
won't be in it.)

548
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:43,780
If the Immortal Realm wants
our Demon Realm to stop pursuing,

549
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,110
you should show more sincerity.

550
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:52,150
What if I add the Fox Clan's holy item,
the Nirvana Wheel?

551
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,680
What?

552
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:01,340
Fox Queen, you are even willing
to give up your holy item?

553
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:04,780
Your so-called sincerity
turns out to be bargaining.

554
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,950
Since the Immortal Realm is shameless,
further discussion is pointless.

555
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:12,860
If you cannot provide a satisfactory explanation
within tomorrow,

556
00:39:13,510 --> 00:39:15,910
we will see you in the Ghost Land.

557
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,940
(Gallant and Formidable)
Bad news! Bad news!

558
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,340
The Heavenly Punishment Officer
is coming to arrest Yin!

559
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,180
Me?

560
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:34,590
The Energy Protection Arrow exploded
and hurt Lord Zhen Yi's finger bone.

561
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:35,550
The Demon Realm is furious.

562
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,860
