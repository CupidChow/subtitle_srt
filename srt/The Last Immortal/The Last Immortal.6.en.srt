29
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,150
You've obtained the immortal spirit.

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,680
You can leave now.

31
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:43,910
Mr. Wu Gui,

32
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:46,630
there's something we'd like to trouble you with.

33
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:48,860
You are a demigod of the Immortal Realm, right?

34
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,630
Can you help us break
the master-servant contract?

35
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:12,430
Sorry,

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:13,860
but I can't help.

37
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,800
Why?

38
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,020
This contract contains
vigorous immortal power.

39
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,740
On the Daze Mountain,

40
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:22,900
only Donghua was able to make it.

41
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:26,590
Indeed.

42
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:28,080
Master made the contract for us

43
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,110
before his ascent.

44
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,270
Donghua made it

45
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,220
to protect you, actually.

46
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,060
Protect us?

47
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,860
Before, we really needed to be protected.

48
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:41,060
But now,

49
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,860
that is truly not necessary.

50
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:45,510
It's not as simple as you think it is.

51
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:47,180
What do you mean?

52
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,270
Yin.

53
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,710
Mr. Wu Gui, if you don't want to explain,

54
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:52,800
it's all right.

55
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,670
Anyway, when we gather up
Feng Yin's immortal spirit,

56
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,180
the contract will be terminated.

57
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,550
Someday sooner or later.

58
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,230
Thank you, Mr. Wu Gui.

59
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,800
We should go.

60
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,640
Let's go.

61
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,240
Come on.

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,390
Yuan Qi...

63
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,860
Why didn't you ask me to heal you?

64
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,830
Are you getting any better?

65
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:50,860
Just minor injuries.

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,110
I'll take care of them.

67
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,950
Let me help you.

68
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Don't bother.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
You should go back.

70
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,710
Why are you staring at me?

71
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:04,740
What? You're shy?

72
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:06,590
Turn around.

73
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,110
You're no longer a baby.

74
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,950
Why are you still unashamed?

75
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,020
I'm here to tell you.

76
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:22,750
I forgive you.

77
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,710
I've thought about it.

78
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,270
It's not that you can't do anything right.

79
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,070
At some crucial moments,

80
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,510
you were really helpful.

81
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,310
And I promise you.

82
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,310
I will no longer treat you in the way

83
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,150
I tame a master.

84
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,830
So...

85
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,710
You're my friend now.

86
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:45,110
Wait!

87
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:52,870
There's something

88
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,100
I want to explain to you.

89
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,680
I helped Hua Shu

90
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,630
because she once helped me

91
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:04,150
and I adored her.

92
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,660
But it wasn't the reason
why I lent her the Umbrella

93
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:10,310
against my master's will.

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Among young peacocks,

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,380
there isn't a top talent.

96
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:16,830
The Peacock King couldn't
protect his clan all alone.

97
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
I helped her

98
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,740
because she cared about his father.

99
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,070
I didn't want her to lose her father

100
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,760
like I did.

101
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,630
Your father...

102
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:40,540
Before, my family encountered a disaster.

103
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:43,070
My father chose to face it alone.

104
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,310
He left my mother and me,

105
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,340
going through it alone.

106
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,790
In the end,

107
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,950
my mother and I didn't even
see him before he died.

108
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,950
Your father was

109
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,900
a very righteous man.

110
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,630
He was a hero, indeed.

111
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,150
He saved a lot of people.

112
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,980
Logically speaking,

113
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,310
I can understand him.

114
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:21,420
But I find

115
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,750
when someone shoulders

116
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,190
more responsibility,

117
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:29,860
he's less likely

118
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:31,100
to live the way he wants.

119
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,750
Just like Feng Chi.

120
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:37,310
She couldn't live for herself.

121
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,750
Then live your own life

122
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,190
easily and freely.

123
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,070
You have your sect.

124
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,510
And me.

125
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,070
Just be yourself.

126
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,460
Be yourself and be happy.

127
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,440
Right.

128
00:07:02,430 --> 00:07:03,950
You're right, Yin.

129
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,340
I love everything on the Daze Mountain.

130
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,580
I want to always stay together

131
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:11,070
with everybody.

132
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,670
Including you.

133
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,100
Me?

134
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:18,350
Of course.

135
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,710
Even though

136
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:23,390
you're not an official disciple
of my master yet,

137
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,360
at least your name has been

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,310
on our Shanmen Volume.

139
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:37,900
You know it.

140
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,190
Beasts like us have short lives.

141
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:42,630
But I'll try my best
to live as long as I can.

142
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:44,310
Then I can

143
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,220
stay longer with you

144
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,900
and other senior brothers

145
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:50,710
on the Daze Mountain.

146
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:56,340
All right. Rest assured.

147
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:59,750
When our contract is terminated,

148
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:01,980
I'll go traveling around the world

149
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,750

00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,900
in the Demon Realm.

192
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:03,150
The Demon Realm is just a name.

193
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,780
Even if it's a world of demons,

194
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,150
there also exists

195
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,350
a lot of beautiful things.

196
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,420
Not all the demons are evil.

197
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,110
And not all the immortals are good.

198
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:15,630
We should judge everyone

199
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,230
according to his heart

200
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,820
instead of his clan.

201
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,590
This time, I met the Fox Queen Hong Ruo,

202
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:25,590
Hong Yi, and Three-headed Fire Dragon.

203
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,780
Then I know

204
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,390
demons aren't

205
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,720
as wicked or vicious

206
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,780
as they're described

207
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,420
in our immortal books.

208
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,350
They're very nice, actually.

209
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,160
By the way,

210
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,020
tomorrow,

211
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,780
I'll take you to the Demon Market.

212
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,660
Demon Market?

213
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,430
Aren't we going to Guixu Mountain?

214
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,390
We are.

215
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,790
Now, Guixu Mountain is under the protection
of Princess Chen Min,

216
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,200
daughter of the late Heavenly Emperor.

217
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,390
Before we go,
we'll prepare a big gift for her.

218
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,550
In the Demon Market
is the biggest gambling house

219
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:55,480
of the Demon Realm.

220
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,020
The stake for tomorrow's wager

221
00:11:57,390 --> 00:11:58,320
is the clan emblem

222
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,230
of Princess Chen Min's family.

223
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:02,360
It was lost

224
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,110
during the Immortal-Demon War.

225
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,590
Then, it went around and around

226
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,390
and ended up in the Demon Realm.

227
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:08,780
Oh, I see.

228
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,390
As long as we get the clan emblem

229
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,900
and give it to Princess Chen Min,

230
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,480
she'll be happy.

231
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,320
Right?

232
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,540
Clever girl.

233
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:21,440
Look.

234
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,160
Did you see that?

235
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,540
What is that?

236
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,020
Meteor.

237
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:28,230
There's a saying in the mortal world.

238
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:29,360
If you make wishes

239
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,780
when you see the meteor,

240
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,990
your wishes will come true.

241
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:35,700
Well, I wish

242
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:37,200
we could win the wager

243
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,020
and get the clan emblem
in the gambling house tomorrow.

244
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:43,630
And...

245
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,560
Go on.

246
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:47,870
I wish we could gather up

247
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,940
Feng Yin's immortal spirit soon
and terminate the contract.

248
00:12:50,150 --> 00:12:52,420
I also wish I could find Ningyun Mountain

249
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,230
and breed my little sister.

250
00:12:54,790 --> 00:12:56,080
Then our clan

251
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:57,510
will be saved.

252
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,040
I also wish...

253
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:04,940
It's gone?

254
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,000
But I have many more wishes to make.

255
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:07,840
Wait a moment.

256
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,200
Here it comes.

257
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:11,920
I wish

258
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,110
my senior brothers on the Daze Mountain

259
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,660
to be very happy,
including Xian Shan and Xian Zhu,

260
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,540
and Qing Yi, and everybody else.

261
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,390
I wish...

262
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,660
I wish Jin would never be

263
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,700
as sad as he was just now.

264
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:01,960
Get out!

265
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,060
(Gambling House, the Demon Realm)
Go out! Out!

266
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:06,550
Talk nicely.

267
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:07,900
Why are you so rude?

268
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:10,230
How dare you gamble

269
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:11,900
with a toy sword?

270
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,940
You call this magic weapon a toy sword?

271
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,940
Without enough gambling funds,

272
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,300
you can't get in.

273
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,140
Leave!

274
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,320
You...

275
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,420
How ignorant!

276
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,230
That's not true.

277
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:31,830
Considering your current power,

278
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:33,700
no one can tell this is a magic weapon.

279
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:34,960
Look.

280
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,040
The blade is so short.

281
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,020
It's not even as long as the handle.

282
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,070
Miss,

283
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,240
Mr. Jiu

284
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,470
invited you over.

285
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:49,870
Mr. Jiu?

286
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,060
Who's Mr. Jiu?

287
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:52,430
We're new here.

288
00:15:52,430 --> 00:15:53,540
We don't know a Mr. Jiu.

289
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,470
We won't bother him, then.

290
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,350
Where are you hurrying to?

291
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,390
Hong Yi?

292
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:04,870
Hong Yi?

293
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,350
He's the little fox?

294
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,110
You were nowhere to be seen
after we entered the Jingyou Valley.

295
00:16:09,390 --> 00:16:11,020
Actually, you stalked us

296
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,700
and knew we would come here, right?

297
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,200
Yin,

298
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:16,060
it's been days. Did you miss me?

299
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,700
What are you talking about?

300
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,900
You just met once.

301
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,750
And on the Ziyue Mountain,
you left without telling us.

302
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:22,900
We're not that familiar.

303
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,030
Don't be so rude to him.

304
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:27,020
He isn't a bad man.

305
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,420
We didn't only meet once.

306
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,680
Yin and I

307
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,420
spent one night together.

308
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:34,270
What are you talking about, bad fox?

309
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,720
Yin, from now on,

310
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,180
call me by my nickname Jiu.

311
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,200
It sounds intimate.

312
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:43,390
And others won't notice

313
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,390
who I really am.

314
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:45,750
Jiu?

315
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,590
Jiu.

316
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,700
Following such a useless immortal

317
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,780
will do you no good.

318
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,470
I prepared a pleasure boat ahead.

319
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,060
How about we go river sightseeing?

320
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,990
A fox, indeed.

321
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,820
Your tail comes off so soon.

322
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,980
A fox like me has a tail and it's normal.

323
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,500
But look at you.

324
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,160
You claim you're a master

325
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,220
and you never leave her alone.

326
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,110
Enough. Say no more.

327
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,480
Jiu,

328
00:17:12,550 --> 00:17:14,820
Jin and I have something important to do.

329
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:16,110
So, I can't go with you.

330
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:17,150
What is it?

331
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,590
You're familiar
with the Demon Realm, right?

332
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,550
Can you get us

333
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:26,740
into this gambling house?

334
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,760
Gambling house?

335
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,230
(With this man around,)

336
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,700
(I can't take Yin away.)

337
00:17:35,110 --> 00:17:36,660
(See how I'll trap you here.)

338
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,800
It's not hard.

339
00:17:40,790 --> 00:17:41,630
Come with me.

340
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,720
Go.

341
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,350
Mr. Jiu, thank you for coming.

342
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,200
Welcome.

343
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,980
I forgot to take my gambling fund.

344
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,040
However,

345
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
you have your rules.

346
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,870
Immortal?

347
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:02,350
Exactly.

348
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:04,310
This is the immortal slave I caught.

349
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:05,870
- Jiu...
- Today,

350
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,390
he'll be my gambling fund.

351
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,080
What did you say?

352
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:11,430
Come in, please.

353
00:18:12,350 --> 00:18:13,590
Yin, let's go.

354
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:15,590
Hong Yi!

355
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,420
Mr. Jiu, come this way.

356
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,310
Bet! Bet!

357
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,390
Bet! Bet!

358
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:36,550
I must win back what I lost!

359
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,630
Yin, be seated.

360
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,550
Who asked you to sit?

361
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,830
A slave should stand around.

362
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:13,260
Mr. Jiu, a moment, please.

363
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,390
I'm going to get you some snacks.

364
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,350
Jiu,

365
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,220
did you have a relapse?

366
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:22,420
Actually, these days,

367
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:25,030
my core injury frequently relapsed.

368
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,460
I don't know what to do.

369
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:28,350
So, your demon power is unstable again.

370
00:19:28,550 --> 00:19:29,390
Let me help you.

371
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,480
Yin.

372
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:33,900
Didn't I tell you?

373
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,160
Your way of healing

374
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,110
will burn your own core

375
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:37,750
- and damage your lifespan.
- But...

376
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:39,070
It will hurt Yin's life?

377
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,830
Ladies and gentlemen,

378
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,550
look over here.

379
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,590
Now,

380
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:49,630
we'll start today's gamble.

381
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:50,910
This is

382
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:52,720
the first stake

383
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,940
of today's gamble.

384
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:58,260
The clan emblem of Chen Hui,

385
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,220
the late Heavenly Emperor.

386
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,070
Seriously?

387
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,030
Chen Hui, the late Heavenly Emperor...

388
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,780
That was the most glorious clan
in the Immortal Realm.

389
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:08,420
But now, even their clan emblem
is a stake.

390
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,000
Because the late Heavenly Empress Bai Zhi

391
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,070
started the Immortal-Demon War
for her own selfish desires.

392
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,150
True Goddess Yi He punished her

393
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,660
and then her family broke up.

394
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:17,980
So sad for Princess Chen Min.

395
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,740
She's alive all alone

396
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,740
and has been guarding
Guixu Mountain for over 200 years.

397
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,790
That's too bad.

398
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,070
Did you get in here

399
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,940
for this clan emblem?

400
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:30,740
What do you need it for?

401
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,310
- For...
- None of your business.

402
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:36,190
Ladies and gentlemen,

403
00:20:36,590 --> 00:20:37,910
if you're interested,

404
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:39,460
come up and gamble.

405
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,790
If you win,

406
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,900
the clan emblem is yours.

407
00:20:45,030 --> 00:20:46,060
What do you say?

408
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,180
Who wants to play?

409
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,660
Don't you go?

410
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm in.

411
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:03,570
What's he doing up here?

412
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,410
Yeah.

413
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:06,200
Why is an immortal slave here?

414
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:07,150
I'll gamble.

415
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,830
How dare an immortal slave gamble?

416
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:16,670
Umm...

417
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,350
Sorry, everybody.

418
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:19,840
I...

419
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,870
- I'll do it for someone else.
- For someone else?

420
00:21:21,870 --> 00:21:23,070
How could he do that?

421
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,110
Is that even allowable?

422
00:21:26,110 --> 00:21:27,070
He's right.

423
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,110
For this gamble,

424
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:31,630
the immortal slave

425
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,500
will be my gambling fund.

426
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,320
You...

427
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,320
All right.

428
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:46,100
(To Win and Succeed)

429
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,910
(Three-eyed Tiger, Queen of Gambling)
What's she doing here?

430
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,270
Yeah. Why is she here?

431
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:50,110
This is atrocious.

432
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,110
She's never lost before.

433
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,460
Three-eyed Tiger,

434
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,790
a relative of the Demon King

435
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:00,870
and the Queen of Gambling.

436
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,700
Every time she sees

437
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,460
a handsome young man like you,

438
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,830
she usually gambles personally.

439
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:07,250
And from what I hear,

440
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,580
she's never lost before.

441
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,420
What's wrong with you?

442
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,870
Why did you bet me, then?

443
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:12,670
Wish you good luck.

444
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:16,700
For this round,

445
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,500
I'll do the chips in person.

446
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,350
Since you're new here,

447
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:35,500
I won't bully you.

448
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,070
Let's play something simple.

449
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:39,790
Roll the dice and see who scores more points.

450
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:41,310
One-off game.

451
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,350
What do you say?

452
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,430
You got it.

453
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,900
I'm very good

454
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,630
at the dice game.

455
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:12,700
The queen of gambling indeed.

456
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,620
(Banker)

457
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,590
Can he beat her?

458
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,820
He's just a slave.

459
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:02,420
How can he beat the queen of gambling?

460
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,900
Here we go. Let's see.

461
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,720
Triple six.

462
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,980
Triple six, very nice.

463
00:24:10,050 --> 00:24:10,910
He's got lucky.

464
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,760
I'm impressed.

465
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,390
No one can beat me.

466
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,220
Triple eight.

467
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,270
Triple eight?

468
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:26,490
Triple eight? Triple eight?

469
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:28,420
I told you he'd lose.

470
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:29,790
There's a side with eight?

471
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,000
I won.

472
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:39,560
Take him.

473
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,030
I lost. He's yours.

474
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:44,870
No.

475
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,560
Yin,

476
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:49,220
I thought you hated him, right?

477
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Isn't it nice

478
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,240
if he's taken away from you?

479
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,160
No matter what, he's my senior brother.

480
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,500
How can I let them take him?

481
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,350
You can't take him.

482
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:56,190
Wait.

483
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,630
I wanna do another round.

484
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,270
What are you

485
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,180
going to bet?

486
00:25:02,070 --> 00:25:02,910
I…

487
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,790
I'll bet you my master.

488
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:13,110
To tell you the truth,

489
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,110
my master

490
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,700
has long taken a shine to you.

491
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,150
But he's too shy and reserved

492
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,070
to express his feelings.

493
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,030
That's why he sent me

494
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,870
to help him catch your attention.

495
00:25:28,110 --> 00:25:28,950
He…

496
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,310
He's talking nonsense.

497
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:31,150
See?

498
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,110
He's shy.

499
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:36,660
So, this young master is into me?

500
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,350
Young master?

501
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,510
He's actually

502
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,150
Hong Yi, the nephew

503
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,030
of the Fox Queen.

504
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,900
My master told me

505
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:53,050
that he saw you once in the Third Heaven

506
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,390
when he was little,

507
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,550
and he's been thinking of you

508
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,180
ever since.

509
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,430
One more word, I'll…

510
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,270
Jiu,

511
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,430
this thing

512
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:02,980
is very important to us.

513
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:03,820
So…

514
00:26:04,110 --> 00:26:05,940
So, could you help us get it?

515
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,520
Please.

516
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:13,430
Yes.

517
00:26:14,550 --> 00:26:16,790
I saw you once when I was little.

518
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:18,590
So,

519
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,900
you've been thinking of me,

520
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,660
yet you never told me.

521
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:26,390
How about this?

522
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,260
If you have a drink with me

523
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:30,500
and tell me about your childhood,

524
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,980
I'll give this thing to you for free.

525
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:35,630
And I won't take

526
00:26:35,630 --> 00:26:36,630
your slave from you.

527
00:26:37,310 --> 00:26:39,070
I'm sure we'll meet again in the future.

528
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,310
What do you say?

529
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:42,630
Deal.

530
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:43,470
Shut up.

531
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:51,840
Alright.

532
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:53,420
You wanna have a drink, right?

533
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:54,870
Come on,

534
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:57,490
let's have a drink in my room.

535
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,330
Move.

536
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:00,390
I can walk myself.

537
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,030
Good luck.

538
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:17,320
Ladies and gentlemen,

539
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:19,680
it's time to reveal

540
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,740
the second item,

541
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,960
Blue Blood Reishi,

542
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,390
a spiritual herb that grows

543
00:27:25,550 --> 00:27:26,940
every 100,000 years only.

544
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,980
It's a treasure.

545
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,070
A treasure indeed.

546
00:27:30,830 --> 00:27:31,680
It's the Blue Blood Reishi

547
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,900
that Princess Hua Shu is looking for.

548
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:35,180
Blue Blood Reishi is hard
to find throughout all Three Realms.

549
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:36,860
I heard a few days ago,

550
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,870
a Blue Blood Reishi

551
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,260
was just destroyed in the Second Heaven.

552
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,630
So, this one here

553
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,260
should be the only one left

554
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,460
in the entire world.

555
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,840
Guys,

556
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,630
who would like to play for it?

557
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:47,940
I will.

558
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
Again?

559
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:05,630
Supremacy.

560
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:07,520
Supremacy.

561
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,240
Thank you.

562
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:10,390
Thank you.

563
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:13,310
The Blue Blood Reishi is mine now.

564
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:14,630
It belongs to him now?

565
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,500
Give me the Reishi.

566
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,590
Yan Shuang. You again.

567
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,520
Jin.

568
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,570
You were quite tough last time.

569
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,130
Now what? You are nothing
without the Umbrella.

570
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,240
Catch it.

571
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:05,900
Jin.

572
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,350
Yin, run.

573
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,030
Another helper.

574
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,000
Jin.

575
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,400
- Don't worry.
- If you want him alive,

576
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:35,740
hand over the Reishi.

577
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:38,900
Yin, don't listen to her.

578
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:41,420
I… I'm the Elder of the Daze Mountain.

579
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:44,790
If you hurt me, the friendship
between the Daze Mountain

580
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,930
and the Eagle Clan will be over.

581
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:47,460
Screw you, Elder of the Daze Mountain.

582
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,000
Unlike the Peacock Clan, our Eagle Clan

583
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,110
never bows to other sects.

584
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,350
You…

585
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,030
My patience is running out.

586
00:29:53,350 --> 00:29:54,350
Hold it.

587
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,040
I'll give it to you.

588
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:57,790
But you must keep your word and let him go.

589
00:29:58,310 --> 00:29:59,150
Yin.

590
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,670
Yin,

591
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,480
give it to me.

592
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:06,480
Trust me.

593
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,550
I can give you the Reishi,

594
00:30:15,750 --> 00:30:17,550
on one condition, though.

595
00:30:17,750 --> 00:30:18,910
Make no mistake.

596
00:30:18,910 --> 00:30:20,200
I have a hostage in my hand.

597
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,850
You are in no position to negotiate.

598
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,110
Don't you want to hear it first?

599
00:30:23,750 --> 00:30:24,590
Fox.

600
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:29,310
Don't come over, fox.

601
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,070
I'll do

602
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:54,310
whatever

603
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:56,550
you want.

604
00:30:58,110 --> 00:30:58,950
Let him go.

605
00:31:02,350 --> 00:31:03,190
Go.

606
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:06,240
Jin.

607
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:09,390
- Are you okay?
- Are you alright?

608
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,590
So embarrassing. You got abducted in public.

609
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,180
And you mentioned Daze Mountain.

610
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:14,510
I told you to cultivate harder,

611
00:31:14,510 --> 00:31:15,950
but you never listened to me.

612
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,480
We should leave, now.

613
00:31:21,530 --> 00:31:23,200
It's the first time
I've casted a Bewitching Spell.

614
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,310
I'm not sure how long it'll last.

615
00:31:25,110 --> 00:31:26,790
But we can't leave her alone here.

616
00:31:26,790 --> 00:31:27,900
It's too dangerous.

617
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:32,790
Kill her. Kill her.

618
00:31:32,790 --> 00:31:34,030
Let's bring her with us.

619
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,910
We can take her back to the Immortal Realm

620
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:38,070
after we are done business
in the Guixu Mountain.

621
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:39,460
So troublesome.

622
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:41,730
Kill her!

623
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:42,630
Stop yelling.

624
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:44,670
I'll take

625
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,220
this female immortal with me.

626
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,000
Back off.

627
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,190
- Let's go.
- Come on.

628
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:03,870
They are leaving?

629
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,740
Just let her leave like this?

630
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:14,520
Master,

631
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,310
Gu Jin is taking the clan emblem

632
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:17,710
to the Guixu Mountain right now.

633
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,080
Show yourselves.

634
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:27,470
Greetings, Master.

635
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,070
Congratulations on breaking out
of the Abyssal Prison.

636
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,550
From now on,

637
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,180
you are no longer demons.

638
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:35,660
Instead,

639
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,150
you are devils.

640
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,220
We'd like to follow you, even to death.

641
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:41,720
Zhuo Ying,

642
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,150
you are in charge.

643
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,350
Help me get the Fire Phoenix Jade back.

644
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:46,670
Aye.

645
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,080
But,

646
00:32:48,550 --> 00:32:49,980
I do have one question.

647
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:51,590
Why can the Fire Phoenix Jade

648
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:53,590
open the Abyssal Prison?

649
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:55,710
The Abyssal Prison

650
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:57,500
was set up at the very beginning of the Chaos.

651
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,110
The god spirit of True God sealed inside

652
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,660
has long started to weaken.

653
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,240
70,000 years ago,

654
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,790
it already got shaky once.

655
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:07,260
A senior immortal

656
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,960
thus sacrificed his own primordial spirit

657
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,420
to have the gap of the barrier fixed.

658
00:33:11,110 --> 00:33:12,920
But that spot is still the weakest spot

659
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,790
of the seal.

660
00:33:15,110 --> 00:33:16,000
As long as we can get

661
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,500
a portion of the True God's spirit,

662
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,980
we can break the gap.

663
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,790
But the True God's spirit…

664
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,070
There's a portion of True God's spirit
inside the body

665
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,350
of the Three-headed Fire Dragon
that guards the Abyssal Prison.

666
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,350
Once we get the Fire Phoenix Jade,

667
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,110
we can soon

668
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,870
bring all devils back to the Nine Regions

669
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,110
and take over the Three Realms.

670
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,320
Got it.

671
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,740
What are you waiting for? Go.

672
00:33:41,030 --> 00:33:41,870
Aye.

673
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,110
It's been 200 years.

674
00:33:47,920 --> 00:33:50,390
Time for me to reconnect with my old friend.

675
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,820
(Xuanjing Palace, Third Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

676
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,720
Ruo,

677
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:28,130
in the future, your business is also mine.

678
00:34:28,130 --> 00:34:29,510
No matter what you want to do,

679
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,660
I'll spare no effort to help you.

680
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,070
I refined this with my heart bone.

681
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:40,630
In our Tiger Clan,

682
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,510
heart bone matters to us the most,

683
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,700
and it's also my weakest spot.

684
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:48,180
Presenting it to you

685
00:34:48,630 --> 00:34:50,740
means I'm willing to entrust you with my life.

686
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,950
I'd love to spend the rest of my life

687
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,030
with you, and with you only.

688
00:35:02,420 --> 00:35:03,780
(Lin Mo, the Second Prince of the Tiger Clan)

689
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:05,590
(I've suffered for several hundred years,)

690
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,700
(and I was so looking forward to seeing you,)

691
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:10,050
(but all you can think about is someone else.)

692
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:11,230
(Back then, you told me)

693
00:35:11,230 --> 00:35:12,340
(you'd leave Hong Ruo)

694
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:14,590
(for me.)

695
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,200
Qing Lin.

696
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,240
Lin Mo,

697
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,180
my demon core shattered already.

698
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,070
I don't have much time left.

699
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,180
But I'm not afraid of death.

700
00:35:34,190 --> 00:35:37,630
You know how I feel about you.

701
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:40,260
Even if I only have a few days left,

702
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,780
marrying you is still my one

703
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:46,180
and only wish.

704
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,780
Qing Lin, don't worry.

705
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,510
I will find a way to save you.

706
00:35:50,590 --> 00:35:51,860
And I will be with you

707
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,550
for as long as you live.

708
00:35:58,630 --> 00:35:59,510
Ruo,

709
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,030
do you still blame me?

710
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,990
Since you've chosen to be with Qing Lin,

711
00:36:06,590 --> 00:36:08,860
there's nothing left between us.

712
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:11,110
Just consider all my effort

713
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:13,950
my own wishful thinking.

714
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,590
We are over.

715
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:36,950
I wish you well.

716
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:43,990
Don't go.

717
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,220
(Jingyou Valley, Second Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

718
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:00,960
Your Highness, I'm surprised
to see you find time

719
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,050
to enjoy some tea today.

720
00:37:02,050 --> 00:37:03,000
I just suddenly realized

721
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,030
there was some good tea.

722
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,070
It's been there for long.

723
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:18,340
You recalled that you had some good tea.

724
00:37:19,150 --> 00:37:20,180
What about a certain person?

725
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,120
What do you mean?

726
00:37:24,590 --> 00:37:25,820
Actually,

727
00:37:26,070 --> 00:37:27,660
we all witnessed

728
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,470
how deeply Lin Mo

729
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,030
cared about you

730
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,910
for all these years.

731
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,470
The incident

732
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,110
wasn't entirely Lin Mo's fault.

733
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,030
It was destiny that tricked you two.

734
00:37:39,550 --> 00:37:40,390
Who

735
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,260
wasn't part of it anyway?

736
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,470
Qing Lin,

737
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,260
you are fine.

738
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:58,150
And you became a devil.

739
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:00,070
So, the damage of your internal core

740
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:02,260
and your fatal injury were all a lie.

741
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,300
You've long fallen into the devil path.

742
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,110
And you used a fake demon core
to fake your injury

743
00:38:08,550 --> 00:38:10,220
and make Lin Mo feel guilty.

744
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,340
The three of us grew up together.

745
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,260
Why did he choose you?

746
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,510
We are both Nine-tailed Foxes.

747
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,260
Why are you the Princess of the Fox Clan?

748
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,180
Lin Mo married me too,

749
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,110
but all he thinks about is you,

750
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,470
and he even cries out your name

751
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,910
in his sleep. Why?

752
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:30,220
If I can't have him,

753
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:32,990
neither can you.

754
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:33,990
Qing Lin,

755
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:36,110
are you out of your mind?

756
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:38,990
You and Lin Mo are so in love,

757
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,480
but still, you are parted easily

758
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,860
by my "death".

759
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,820
As long as he remembers me and thinks

760
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,510
of my good for the rest of his life,

761
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,700
he'll never get back to you.

762
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,780
By the way,

763
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,950
at this very moment as we are talking,

764
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,110
your brother and sister-in-law

765
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:58,740
have already been killed by the immortals.

766
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,760
We demons are partially responsible

767
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,950
for that too.

768
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,280
Hong Ruo,

769
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:06,590
you lost completely.

770
00:39:14,550 --> 00:39:15,470
Qing Lin.

771
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,070
True Goddess Yi He?

772
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,950
You've fallen into the devil path,

773
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:22,260
and you killed your own kind.
You are not to be forgiven.

774
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,150
You'll be sent to the Abyssal Prison
and punished with excruciating pain.

775
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:27,160
No!

776
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:28,820
No!

777
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,600
Ruo.

778
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,070
Don't come over!

779
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,300
It's been so long.

780
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:45,780
You also said

781
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,860
that you wouldn't blame Lin Mo anymore.

782
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:52,950
Why don't you

783
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,840
stop treating him

784
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,380
so coldly?

785
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,260
The good tea is enjoyable,

786
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,820
but a true heart is more precious.

787
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,380
Let's go with the flow.

788
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,120
We'll see

789
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:14,550
when he comes here in the future.

790
00:40:27,580 --> 00:40:29,580
(Guixu Mountain)

791
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,590
Although Yin said you could come with us,

792
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,590
we do have something important to do,

793
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:47,990
and we can't let you follow us around.

794
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,110
You think I like to follow you around?

795
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,400
I know it's hard to let go

796
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,300
of certain things.

797
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:57,910
But, you should

798
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,510
let bygones be bygones.

799
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:03,340
Don't always think about them.

800
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:05,950
We are leaving.

801
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,030
Stay here and wait for us.

802
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:12,990
You sure you aren't coming?

803
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,120
Fine.

804
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,910
(You think you can stop me)

805
00:41:25,910 --> 00:41:27,180
(with a lame trick like this?)

806
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,820
(You should've asked me first)

807
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,430
(if I'd like to play along.)

808
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,820
(Inside the Qiankun Pouch)

809
00:41:43,590 --> 00:41:45,460
You darn fox.

810
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:46,700
Watch your mouth, you stupid eagle.

811
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,340
Wanna fight?

812
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,150
Let go of me.

813
00:41:55,550 --> 00:41:56,390
What's wrong?

814
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:02,780
Stop talking. Be quiet.

815
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,470
Help!

816
00:42:05,670 --> 00:42:06,820
I said, be quiet.

817
00:42:10,630 --> 00:42:11,990
I'll kill you.

818
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:25,990
How despicable of you.

819
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,590
You were trying to bewitch me again.

820
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,830
Let me out if you dare.

821
00:42:28,830 --> 00:42:30,300
Once I'm out, I'll…

822
00:42:37,110 --> 00:42:38,550
How dare you poke my eyes?

823
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,180
You think I can't control you?

824
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,160
Yin,

825
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,630
can you sense the sycamore tree

826
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:44,470
this time?

827
00:42:44,670 --> 00:42:45,510
Try it.

828
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,240
It really worked.

829
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,180
Who are you? How dare you
