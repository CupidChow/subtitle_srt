Donghua's disciple indeed.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,070
You've got balls to say that.

32
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,070
(Xiu Yan)
Are you here to ask me for a favor

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,020
or to challenge me?

34
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,660
This is not your Immortal Realm.

35
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,940
We have our rules in the Nether Realm.

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,150
Even if it's your master,
he must abide by them,

37
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:10,740
let alone you.

38
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,430
Greetings, Lord Xiu Yan.
I'm Gu Jin from Daze Mountain.

39
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,060
I have some acquaintance
with your master.

40
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,230
You're right to show me some respect.

41
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,150
(His internal core is so damaged,)

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,020
(a common immortal with that
would have perished.)

43
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:49,390
(Yet, he looks perfectly normal.)

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,950
(It's truly strange.)

45
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,020
(Who exactly is this Lord Xiu Yan?)

46
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,830
(I'm afraid his spiritual power
is close to that of a demigod.)

47
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,830
(Such a figure actually has never
gained fame in the Three Realms.)

48
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:25,340
Girl, I'm pretty interested in you.

49
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,830
Would you like to stay
in the Nether Realm?

50
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,430
If you agree,

51
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,990
I'll ensure you live for thousands of years,
enjoying a lifetime of blessings.

52
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,670
Yin, what are you doing?

53
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:05,390
Oh no, Yin is transferring
spiritual power to him.

54
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,840
Don't.

55
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,710
If you forcibly interrupt now,
it might harm Yin's life.

56
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,710
Yin!

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,640
He...

58
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,630
He returned the spiritual power to me.

59
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,020
Girl, I appreciate your kindness,
but I cannot accept something for nothing.

60
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:39,340
Such a precious thing
should be used elsewhere.

61
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:42,350
Don't even think about it.

62
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,710
We won't trade her for a tablet.

63
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:46,510
I didn't mean that.

64
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,750
I'm simply interested in this girl.

65
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,440
How about this?

66
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,510
I have a tricky task
that I can assign to you.

67
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,780
Our Nether Realm's Three-life Stone
was lost in the Mortal Realm.

68
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,540
If you can retrieve it,

69
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:04,980
you can come here and exchange it
for a special-class tablet.

70
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,020
But if you fail to find it,

71
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,870
I don't want to see you again
in the Nether Realm.

72
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,870
Three-life Stone?

73
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:20,750
Do you have any clues?

74
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:27,070
The Mortal Realm is so vast.
How can we find it without clues?

75
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,370
That's right.

76
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:30,070
If you're not willing to answer,
that's fine.

77
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,710
You must have your reasons.

78
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,200
Rest assured,

79
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,230
we will bring back the Three-life Stone.

80
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,550
- The Mortal Realm is too vast...
- Where can we find it?

81
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:40,950
It's not safe here. Let's go.

82
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,750
Listen to me. Let's leave first.

83
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:43,590
Alright.

84
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,440
Let's go.

85
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:20,180
(Xiuyan Tower
A Grain in the Ocean)

86
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,070
Xiu Yan, why did you let them go?

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,390
I've searched the Three Realms for so long
and never found a Water Divine Beast.

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,420
Today, she came to us willingly.

89
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,980
Why did you do that?

90
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:46,190
My internal core has been broken
for thousands of years.

91
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,900
It's not something a mere
Water Divine Beast can repair.

92
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,110
Ao Ge,

93
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:02,070
keeping me by your side is already
going against Heaven.

94
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:04,510
Don't try to take
someone else's spiritual power.

95
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:08,020
Taking a Water Divine Beast's spiritual power
means shortening its lifespan.

96
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:13,460
If you do that just to save me,
it wouldn't be fair.

97
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:15,460
Stop forcing it.

98
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:20,390
Just let me dissipate.

99
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,310
This Water Divine Beast is the only way
to nourish your internal core.

100
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,710
I let them go
according to your wish today,

101
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,540
but as long as they need Feng Yin's
immortal spirit, they will come back.

102
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:31,870
At that time, you must not interfere.

103
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,460
(Imperial City, the Mortal Realm)

104
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:43,500
(East Market)

105
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:51,270
In such a vast Mortal Realm,
where can we find the Stone?

106
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:55,830
I could tell that Xiu Yan
wasn't sincerely helping us,

107
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,390
but luckily, I was prepared.

108
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,150
This is some spiritual power from
the Stone I collected in the Nether Realm.

109
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,020
It's in the south.

110
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,150
Jin,

111
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:25,580
your little brain
is finally becoming smarter.

112
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,270
Don't be disrespectful.

113
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:28,870
What do you mean becoming smarter?

114
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,220
I've always been smart.

115
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,350
- Let's go.
- Yin.

116
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,390
Look at this.

117
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,230
Jiu!

118
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,110
Yin.

119
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,060
A carriage!

120
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:57,060
It's exactly like the ones in the storybook.

121
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,750
I've always wanted to ride one.

122
00:08:58,910 --> 00:08:59,750
Get in!

123
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:05,780
Be careful.

124
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,440
You,

125
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:13,990
lead the horse.

126
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:17,990
Why should I lead the horse?

127
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:20,470
Just because I bought it.

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,670
According to the rules
of the Mortal Realm,

129
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,870
whoever pays is in charge.

130
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,920
Carter!

131
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,820
Why did the carriage stop?

132
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,150
Was the ride comfortable, Young Master?

133
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,100
The spiritual power I collected
from the Nether Realm was too little.

134
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:04,180
It could only guide us here.

135
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,270
But the Three-life Stone should be nearby.

136
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:20,180
This place looks nothing like
a location with the Three-life Stone.

137
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,780
Yin, see if you can summon Yan Shuang
with the Eagle-eye Stone.

138
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:34,320
Here she comes.

139
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,750
Yan Shuang,
this Eagle-eye Stone really works.

140
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:44,300
I'm just handling some matters
for my father in the Mortal Realm.

141
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
I didn't expect you
to use the Eagle-eye Stone so soon.

142
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,300
You mentioned going to
the Infinite Cave for exploration.

143
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,590
Did you find anything?

144
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,180
There was nothing in the Infinite Cave.

145
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,300
Let's not talk about it.

146
00:10:57,670 --> 00:10:59,060
Have you encountered any trouble?

147
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,780
We want you to help us
find the Three-life Stone.

148
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:08,510
Three-life Stone?

149
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,340
- Found it.
- How is it?

150
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:37,230
The Three-life Stone
is trapped in a formation

151
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:40,630
by a water dragon demon
in the river valley ahead.

152
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:43,390
Let's go take a look.

153
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:50,540
Dragon God, you bless the people,
and your merits are boundless.

154
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,540
I offer my daughter willingly to you

155
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,990
and hope that you can
grant us a great weather.

156
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,110
Dragon God,

157
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:06,990
I, Xiu, will fulfill my promise tomorrow
and marry you.

158
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:10,820
I ask for your blessing,
please ensure good harvests

159
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,750
for the villagers
and protect them from floods.

160
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,420
Dragon God bless us.

161
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,230
Dragon God bless us.

162
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,660
(Ferry Crossing)
- Dragon God bless us.

163
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:31,110
You all have performed very well,

164
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,310
and I, as a God,
will not linger here for long.

165
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:36,780
As long as you fulfill your promises tomorrow,
I won't trouble you further.

166
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,420
But if anything goes wrong,
what I want won't be just you.

167
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,190
This water dragon demon
is trying to seize the girl.

168
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,300
We need to get rid of this demon.

169
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:46,560
Wait a moment.

170
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,310
Given the strength of this barrier, the demon
must have cultivated for thousands of years.

171
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:52,470
We can't use immortal spells
or demonic techniques right now.

172
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:53,940
It might be too powerful for us.

173
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,870
Within this formation, there seems to be
a Nine-Dragon Absorption Lamp.

174
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,590
The combined power of the Stone
and this lamp is formidable,

175
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,430
making this demon
almost as strong as a demigod.

176
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,270
A demigod?

177
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,540
No wonder the barrier is so powerful.

178
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,280
Let's wait

179
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,230
until the demon opens the barrier tomorrow,
attempting to take the girl away.

180
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:16,820
I'll wear the Heaven-shuttling Garment,
find the barrier and deactivate it.

181
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:17,900
Then, you can come in.

182
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:20,870
We can use the Five Elements Formation
to kill it and retrieve the Three-life Stone.

183
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:23,180
As for using immortal spells,

184
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,110
I'll go to the God of Soil and register.
It might work.

185
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:26,950
Alright,

186
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,660
let me disguise as Xiu to lure it out.

187
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,470
No, Yin,

188
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,720
your spiritual power is the weakest. I'll do it.

189
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,540
Precisely because
my spiritual power is the weakest,

190
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:40,420
I won't be easily seen through.

191
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,470
Alright, let's do it then.

192
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:45,230
Don't worry. I'll protect you.

193
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:48,660
Dragon God.

194
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:50,110
Dragon God.

195
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,540
We are here to offer you the sacrifice.

196
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,150
Please accept our offerings.

197
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:43,870
Yin.

198
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,700
Are you okay?

199
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,920
Where is that water dragon demon?

200
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,540
He went to fetch wine
and hasn't returned yet.

201
00:14:57,870 --> 00:14:59,900
What about the Three-life Stone?
Did you find its whereabouts?

202
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,590
I searched around but didn't find it.

203
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:13,900
The dragon head sculpture here
seems particularly conspicuous.

204
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:16,150
Maybe turning into a dragon is his dream.

205
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,420
It's not that simple.

206
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,020
Nine-Dragon Absorption Lamp.

207
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:51,230
This is likely the core of the formation.

208
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:54,180
Breaking the core should break the barrier
and allow us to obtain the Stone.

209
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,740
(Water Dragon Demon)

210
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:27,230
I've long heard about
the extraordinary power of the Dragon God.

211
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,420
Seeing you is indeed more impressive
than hearing about you.

212
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,750
You are young but your words are sweet.

213
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,470
Aren't you afraid of marrying me?

214
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:53,590
Being able to marry an immortal,
I'm overjoyed.

215
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:02,390
Let's have a toast to that.

216
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:17,630
Dragon God,

217
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:19,150
please.

218
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,000
Yin!

219
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:53,500
You stupid loach! Let me out!

220
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,150
This thing is draining
my spiritual power.

221
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:57,870
(Three-life Stone?)

222
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:02,070
Do you think I can't see through you,
a low-level immortal?

223
00:18:02,550 --> 00:18:05,630
Over thousands of years, I've fought
countless demon hunters

224
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,240
in my quest to master the dragon
transformation technique.

225
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,870
You even dared to intrude into my cave
with such petty power.

226
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:12,960
How ridiculous.

227
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,180
You, a water dragon demon, should rely on
cultivation to ascend to divinity.

228
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,220
Why do you insist on challenging fate
and becoming a dragon?

229
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:23,030
If you fail the tribulation,
won't you regret it?

230
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:25,940
It seems you know quite a bit.

231
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,560
Water dragons,

232
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,660
since ancient times, have always been
inferior to dragons.

233
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:37,660
No matter how hard we try, we can't
overcome the barrier of blood lineage.

234
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,900
I want to become a dragon.

235
00:18:40,790 --> 00:18:44,220
I want the God Realm
to acknowledge my existence.

236
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,900
But you harm innocent humans
in pursuit of dragonhood,

237
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,740
the God Realm won't accept you.

238
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,630
It's better to repent now and rely on
cultivation to ascend to godhood.

239
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:56,070
I can't wait any longer!

240
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,590
You're actually a Water Divine Beast.

241
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,830
This is truly heaven-sent.

242
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:29,700
With your internal core,

243
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,660
I'll have an additional chance
on the day of tribulation.

244
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:04,590
Yin.

245
00:21:05,030 --> 00:21:05,870
Yin!

246
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:23,110
Yin!

247
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,150
You...

248
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,390
I'm going to kill you.

249
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,560
Today, I'll use your spiritual power
to help me ascend.

How are you?

268
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm fine.

269
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:23,670
What about you?

270
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:25,590
I'm okay.

271
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:39,350
Yin,

272
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,830
just now, I failed to sense you
with the master-servant contract.

273
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:47,180
It might be because of the formation.

274
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:49,240
No,

275
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:53,550
the master-servant contract
seems to be lifted.

276
00:26:57,830 --> 00:26:58,670
Let me try.

277
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,550
It seems really gone.

278
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,110
I'll try again.

279
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,900
Don't bother.

280
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,220
It's really lifted.

281
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:14,030
I can sense it.

282
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:15,760
Why?

283
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,520
Because...

284
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,500
- Because...
- Yin.

285
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,320
Yan Shuang.

286
00:27:27,790 --> 00:27:28,630
Are you okay?

287
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,480
Jiu, both Jin and I are fine.

288
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,320
Yin.

289
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,220
I already said I'm fine.

290
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:37,900
I was so worried.

291
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:43,830
Oh no, the Three-life Stone!

292
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,460
I found it and it's intact.

293
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,630
By the way, Yin,

294
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:56,760
what did you want to tell me just now?
Because of what?

295
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,940
You are injured.

296
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,260
Why didn't you tell me just now?

297
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:16,910
Does it still hurt?

298
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:19,870
Alright.

299
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,790
It's getting light.
Let's go back to the inn and rest.

300
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,080
Come on, Yin.

301
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,350
I'll ride the cloud and take you.

302
00:28:26,750 --> 00:28:27,590
But...

303
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:32,150
I have a surprise to tell you.

304
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,820
(Jingyou Valley, Second Heaven,
the Demon Realm)

305
00:28:56,440 --> 00:29:00,000
I'm free today and a friend gave me
Snow Mountain Tea.

306
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:03,350
I wonder if you
would like to share a cup.

307
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,760
I'm waiting for you in Jingyou Valley.

308
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:06,310
(Even Jingyou Valley's abundant demon energy
can't suppress the God-killing Flower.)

309
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:09,740
(This thing is truly terrifying.)

310
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,420
Reveal your identity!

311
00:30:47,790 --> 00:30:50,390
Qing Lin, it's really you.

312
00:30:52,590 --> 00:30:55,830
This Abyssal Prison was created by the
Ancestral God. How did you get out?

313
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:58,830
I have to thank
your precious nephew for that.

314
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,420
If it weren't for him, I would have had
to expend more effort.

315
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:04,740
Hong Yi?

316
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:14,220
So you lured Hong Yi into Abyssal Prison
and then left by attaching yourself to him?

317
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,560
Wait a minute.

318
00:31:17,350 --> 00:31:20,630
The God-killing Flower
is to seize Hong Yi's body.

319
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:21,800
Right.

320
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,640
Two hundred years have passed,
and you are pretty smart now.

321
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,390
Don't try to do anything to Hong Yi!

322
00:31:37,350 --> 00:31:38,190
Qing Lin,

323
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:41,870
after two hundred years,
you are still doing evil!

324
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,790
The reappearance of the God-killing Flower
will inevitably lead to more killings.

325
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,790
Our personal grievances are small

326
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,550
compared to the safety of the Three Realms.

327
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:52,310
If you want revenge,

328
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,870
today can be the end of our grievances.

329
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,940
Don't stir up trouble and bring disaster
to our fellow clansmen.

330
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:02,460
Since you all despise me so much,

331
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,220
I'll let the Three Realms fall
into the devilic path with me.

332
00:32:12,590 --> 00:32:16,030
Our grievances
won't be resolved so easily.

333
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:19,790
With this body of yours, which is

334
00:32:20,750 --> 00:32:23,660
more powerful than that little fox's,

335
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,180
I'll gradually destroy everything you love.

336
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:28,350
You're delusional.

337
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,590
In both the Immortal and Demon Realms,
there are many transcendent immortals

338
00:32:34,070 --> 00:32:35,870
who will soon discover the traces of devils.

339
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,180
And Lin Mo won't be deceived by you.

340
00:32:42,110 --> 00:32:43,420
You overestimate yourselves.

341
00:32:44,310 --> 00:32:48,940
As for Lin Mo, you can't even see whether
he is deceived or not.

342
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,940
Perhaps he will be happier
knowing it is me.

343
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:02,790
You won't succeed.

344
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,500
We Fox Clan members are born noble,
and even in death, we remain so.

345
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,700
Even if I destroy this body,

346
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,740
I won't let
your despicable methods succeed.

347
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,480
Despicable?

348
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:35,460
In the Three Realms,
only the weak are despicable.

349
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,680
Ruo!

350
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,640
Ruo!

351
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,510
Ruo!

352
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,220
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

353
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,580
(Yantian Hall)

354
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,430
Chief,

355
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,510
why is the spiritual power of the Soul
Suppressing Pagoda decreasing so rapidly?

356
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,030
The spiritual power of the Pagoda is crucial
for nourishing Feng Yin's body,

357
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:31,070
but Wutong Island is powerless
in this matter.

358
00:34:31,550 --> 00:34:35,070
That's why I want to seek help from you
on behalf of the entire Wutong Island.

359
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:39,340
In my opinion, it seems that the spiritual power
of the Pagoda is depleting.

360
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,310
I will let my disciple, who is skilled in
machinery, take a look.

361
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,030
Thank you very much.

362
00:35:03,150 --> 00:35:06,990
What brings you here to the forbidden area
of Daze Mountain at this late hour?

363
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,470
Master Xian Zhu,

364
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,700
I've been troubled by the matter
of the Pagoda and couldn't sleep.

365
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:16,910
So, I came out to get some fresh air
and happened to pass by this place.

366
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,470
But the back mountain
is far from the guest rooms.

367
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,120
I didn't want to disturb
everyone's meditation,

368
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,280
so I deliberately chose a quiet place.

369
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,510
I didn't expect this to be the forbidden area
of Daze Mountain.

370
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:30,110
It's my fault.

371
00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:38,910
The Spiritual Fire Bead has been replaced,
and the Pagoda has been restored.

372
00:35:39,190 --> 00:35:40,180
You can rest assured now.

373
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:45,950
Thank you.

374
00:35:47,190 --> 00:35:48,150
I'll take my leave now.

375
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,630
Tiangang Energy is gone.

376
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:10,510
No wonder Feng Ming could approach
the Immortal Veins.

377
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:14,900
(Mortal Realm)

378
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,060
(Log of Desirables)

379
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,008
(Gu Jin, Advantages: His master is Lord Donghua,
good physique.)

380
00:36:20,032 --> 00:36:21,980
(Disadvantages: Too many, can't write them all.)

381
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,220
It's great not having
a master-servant contract.

382
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,550
No one can control me anymore.

383
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,630
What are you thinking about?
You're so absorbed in your thoughts.

384
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:53,590
Why did you enter the room
without knocking?

385
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,950
I... I did knock several times,
but you just didn't hear it.

386
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,590
Why is your face so red?

387
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:03,030
Is it because of
the master-servant contract?

388
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,870
No,

389
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,530
it has been lifted.

390
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,700
I won't be restricted by it anymore.

391
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,640
It's lifted?

392
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,910
Is it because of
the water dragon demon's formation?

393
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,350
That's great.

394
00:37:17,710 --> 00:37:20,060
Finally, you don't have to continue
being used by Gu Jin

395
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:21,590
to search for the immortal spirit.

396
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:25,630
Tomorrow, we'll bid him farewell
and set out to find Ningyun Mountain.

397
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,780
Tomorrow?

398
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,070
Since we have a lead,
we should act promptly.

399
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:34,490
Guess what I found
in the water dragon demon's cave?

400
00:37:36,630 --> 00:37:37,510
What is it?

401
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:38,590
Open it and take a look.

402
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,860
It's the soil from Ningyun Mountain!

403
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,340
Yes,

404
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:52,950
I read about it
in the ancient texts at Daze Mountain.

405
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,700
The soil of Ningyun Mountain, infused
with the essence of Spirit Spring,

406
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,150
contains the unique healing spiritual power
of Water Divine Beasts.

407
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,780
The same healing spiritual power
you used to treat me before.

408
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,150
I recognized it right away.

409
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,070
If we can extract the distinctive components
of the five elements from it,

410
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,470
we can quickly determine the location
of Ningyun Mountain.

411
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:13,630
However, the water dragon demon also
harbored the soil.

412
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,910
Maybe, it was also eyeing
Ningyun Mountain.

413
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,910
There might be many people in the
Three Realms coveting this treasure.

414
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,740
So, we need to act quickly.

415
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,940
Once we find Ningyun Mountain,

416
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:26,380
we can build our immortal residence there.

417
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:28,430
Then you will have a home.

418
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,590
I will have a home?

419
00:38:32,550 --> 00:38:33,390
Thank you.

420
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,630
Let's settle on that then.

421
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,510
Tomorrow, we'll say goodbye to Gu Jin.

422
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:39,860
I promised to help him find
the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit.

423
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,320
I should keep my promise.

424
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,110
You had no choice but to agree
because of the master-servant contract.

425
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,830
In the Abyssal Prison,

426
00:38:46,830 --> 00:38:50,380
you said you wanted to break
the contract and regain freedom.

427
00:38:50,590 --> 00:38:52,510
(So, Yin is eager to leave me.)

428
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,950
(She just wants to go with Jiu
to find Ningyun Mountain.)

429
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,240
Jin!

430
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:02,630
Today is the day we bid farewell.

431
00:39:06,110 --> 00:39:09,630
Yin, come out for a moment.
I want to talk to you.

432
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:17,140
(Hustle and Bustle)

433
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:21,220
The master-servant contract is gone,
and you're so happy

434
00:39:21,590 --> 00:39:22,550
and so eager to leave?

435
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,660
Of course I am happy that it is lifted.

436
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,220
But, I promised Master that I'd find
the Fire Phoenix's immortal spirit with you.

437
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,720
So...

438
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,180
So it's just because of
your promise to Master?

439
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,120
No need for that.

440
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,950
Since the master-servant contract is lifted,
promises no longer hold.

441
00:39:42,670 --> 00:39:45,180
If you go alone, it could be dangerous.

442
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,070
Besides, I...

443
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:55,470
(If Jin knew my thoughts, would he be
even less willing to let me stay?)

444
00:39:56,230 --> 00:39:57,070
You what?

445
00:39:58,590 --> 00:39:59,950
I am your junior sister,

446
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,150
after all.

447
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,510
I would look selfish if I leave you alone.

448
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,780
(Junior sister?)

449
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,910
(So I am no different from Xian Shan
and Xian Zhu to her.)

450
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,150
(I knew that she valued Jiu
more than me.)

451
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:16,470
Don't bother.

452
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:20,260
If I encounter any danger,
the senior brothers will protect me.

453
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,030
You can leave.
Tomorrow, I won't see you off.

454
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,430
(He must see me as a burden.)

455
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:34,430
(As soon as the contract is lifted,
he's in a hurry to get rid of me.)

456
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,150
I don't need you to see me off.

457
00:40:41,510 --> 00:40:42,950
Take care.

458
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:44,950
Alright.

459
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:25,860
(Hustle and Bustle)

460
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:30,820
(Daze Mountain, the Immortal Realm)

461
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:34,740
That's what happened
during the birthday banquet.

462
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,470
So the Heaven-shrouding Umbrella
was refined by Hua Shu.

463
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,340
No wonder Tiangang Energy no longer
protects our Daze Mountain.

464
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,780
With things at this point,
Martial Uncle couldn't do anything.

465
00:41:45,230 --> 00:41:48,990
To save Hua Shu's face, he could only say
he gave her the Umbrella as a gift,

466
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:51,630
consider it repaying her favor.

467
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,990
It seems they are not
destined to be together.

468
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,660
Xian Shan, considering the current situation,

469
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,950
we can only light the Nine-star Lamp to
rebuild the mountain protection formation.

470
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:07,340
This requires the joint effort of both of us,
and it will take 49 days.

471
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:08,860
There's no time to waste.

472
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:13,630
Tomorrow, we'll do it in Yantian Hall.

473
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,780
(Nine-star Lamp?)

474
00:42:23,510 --> 00:42:25,860
(That is an even more powerful weapon
than the Umbrella.)

475
00:42:26,630 --> 00:42:27,740
(Once the Nine-star Lamp is lit,)

476
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:29,980
(getting close to the immortal veins
will be impossible.)

477
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:31,780
(I must not let them succeed.)

478
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,430
Martial Uncle Xian Zhu,
when did you return?

479
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,840
I haven't seen you for two days.

480
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,980
You've been looking for books in the
Mortal Realm for two years?

481
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,820
Well, I did spend some time on it.

482
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:44,550
Don't tell this to outsiders.

483
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:12,660
(Autumn Ripples)

484
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:23,700
For the next 49 days, I won't be
able to come and see you.

485
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,700
You must take care of yourself.

486
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:28,180
Don't get out of this spatial barrier.

487
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,110
Otherwise, if the patrolling immortals
find out, it will be disastrous.

488
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,280
Understood.

489
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:37,380
You work so hard every day,
and still have to worry about me.

490
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:48,220
It's a pity that I'm a mortal,
and you're an immortal.

491
00:43:48,740 --> 00:43:52,860
I can't openly be with you
and take care of you.

492
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:55,980
I'm not worthy of you.

493
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:04,100
No, it's me who made you suffer.

494
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,660
After saving you that day,

495
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,860
I should have let go immediately
and waited for you to live your life,

496
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,740
and regain freedom.

497
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,820
But I made a mistake and you can only
hide here now.

498
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,380
I'm lucky to have you.

499
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:22,500
Freedom without you
won't bring me any happiness.

500
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:43,340
(Secretly hiding a mortal woman whose lifespan
has ended in the Immortal Realm.)

501
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:45,990
(Surely, this will not be tolerated by
the Heavenly Palace.)

502
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:50,340
(This can be used as an opportunity
to eliminate Xian Zhu.)

503
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,060
(I'm afraid you won't have a chance
to light the Nine-star Lamp.)
