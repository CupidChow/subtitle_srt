Didn't you say you wouldn't be scared

534
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,540
[(???) I wouldn't be scared]

535
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,980
[Dong Xuanxian said that he would not be scared]

536
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,460
[Awkward]

537
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,020
That's it

538
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,140
[Put your hand in again]

539
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,260
[There is really something!]

540
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,160
There is something

541
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:20,060
-What's there - What's there?

542
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,590
Have a sound

543
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,220
There is something, there is something

544
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:23,020
[There is a metal sound far away]

545
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,580
Be careful not to drop something

546
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:24,730
What is it

547
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:31,660
[The thing inside the door is]

548
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,820
[key!]

549
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:32,880
Is there any

550
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,420
It's the key

551
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,220
- Have and have - Key

552
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:34,930
It's the key

553
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,940
It's the key to the door

554
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:40,660
[Get the key]

555
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,140
Something

556
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,380
[The key to Zhenjiu's door]

557
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:43,070
this

558
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,820
[Dong Xuan is OK~ Oh! OK]

559
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:46,850
Wait and wait

560
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:48,420
[Try opening the door now]

561
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,100
[Is it that simple to wait?]

562
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:50,490
Is it okay

563
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:51,160
Will it be that simple

564
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:54,020
[Bingjae, is this right?]

565
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:56,410
Yes, after inserting the key and turning it

566
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:58,220
[For the time being, please give me a careful idea]

567
00:13:56,410 --> 00:13:58,030
It may also be a trap falling

568
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,680
But I still want to open it

569
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,500
[And there is also a movement that wants to open the door]

570
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,020
[Can't give up on being obsessed with the door...]

571
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:09,500
I can grab it after it is broken

572
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,860
[Try to put your hands in...]

573
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,700
[What else is there in the door?!]

574
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,650
What

575
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:26,060
[What's wrong with Bingzai... What's wrong with Brother?]

576
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:30,410
I see there is something like gold nuggets here

577
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:30,660
[Dong Hyun has something like gold nuggets]

578
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:34,460
[The first hand sways when you put something like gold nuggets on the iron window?]

579
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:35,500
I just touched it

580
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,820
[Did Zhenjiu say that he can't be greedy for that?]

581
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,580
[Bingjae seems to be warning!]

582
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:43,420
[The neck of a person who seeks wrong things will be cut off]

583
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,660
[Baoxian wants to get gold nuggets through this small hole]

584
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:48,180
[Did Baekhyun’s iron window fall?]

585
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,660
I should have the key, but I still want the gold nuggets

586
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:54,220
[The tomb robber who was greedy for gold nuggets behind the door and was cut off his neck?]

587
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,800
Then I can't take it out and it turns out like this

588
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,620
[Dong Xuan, that means this cannot be opened...?]

589
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,660
[What clues are there here in Zhenjiu?]

590
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,980
[oh!]

591
00:15:01,690 --> 00:15:02,540
Is there anything

592
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,700
[footprint!]

593
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,410
foot

594
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:05,820
etc.

595
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:08,510
Is this footprint useful?

596
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:09,180
[What is the meaning of this footprint]

597
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:12,340
[Can you see what Zhenjiu stands here to see?]

598
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:15,540
[Stand on footprints and look up]

599
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,660
[Only see the iron window]

600
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:22,340
[Baodhyun, I think it is better to get the iron window down and see]

601
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,790
Slowly

602
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,140
[Did Zhenjiu cut it off?] [Oh, wait and pause!]

603
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,300
[Dong Xuan I think it opens...]

604
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,260
[Although Dong Xuan wants to open the door and take a look]

605
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:29,960
[Do you want to open it first and check it out?]

606
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,810
this

607
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,460
[Geng Piao Drinks Leaf (?)...] [Note: Slip error]

608
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,330
The healing is facing here

609
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:35,140
[Hidal with outward facing]

610
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:34,370
This is how it opens

611
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,100
Drive to this side

612
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,900
[The door will not be opened after the iron window of Gengpolao comes down]

613
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,130
yes

614
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,980
[Unlock the iron window and cannot open the door]

615
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:41,300
Go out

616
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,960
If Heye is going toward this side, he will drive here

617
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,860
[If you want to open the door, you can't put down the iron window]

618
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:44,690
outrageous

619
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,500
[To open the door with a key]

620
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,620
[Or put down the iron window]

621
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:54,620
[What do you think of Bingjae?]

622
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,670
Am I

623
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,460
[Captain Liu!]

624
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,370
I

625
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
[What is the choice of Captain Liu from Brain?]

626
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,520
Do you want to open it?

627
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:01,330
We'll move to another space

628
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,820
[Bingjae who is in trouble]

629
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:02,980
[Although Brother Hao Tong has been saying it all the time]

630
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:05,140
[Bingzai wants to think about the intention of the questioner]

631
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:07,740
[The intention of the person who built this grave]

632
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:14,380
[The owner of the tomb, King Xiaoshou]

633
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:19,580
[As if you are alerting the intruders to enter the space]

634
00:16:19,930 --> 00:16:22,050
Warning information

635
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,020
[There are also warnings from the tomb owners here]

636
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:24,050
Even the neck will be cut off

637
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:26,860
[When Byung-jae was considering the intention of the person who built this grave]

638
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,500
[Bingjae, I don't think I can't walk on the door that is too conspicuous]

639
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,620
After hearing Hao Tong's words, Zhen Jiu's words

640
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,260
[The reasoning of Hao Tong and Zhen Jiu that came to mind]

641
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:34,660
Combined the feeling

642
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,650
Can you see anything standing here

643
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:41,180
[Is this the door]

644
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:38,580
-Is this the door - Door door

645
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:40,830
- It's the door - the door

646
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,180
[Stand on footprints and look at the words written on the wall?]

647
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:03,100
[Dong Xuan will try opening the door first?]

648
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,990
I think it's right

649
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,060
Then let's go in and take a look

650
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:06,540
[At this time, most people's opinions are open]

651
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:05,050
Let's go

652
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:06,140
-Open first - Try opening

653
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,720
If we open the door and pass by

654
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,060
[Before the door is opened]

655
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,329
It's over

656
00:17:08,329 --> 00:17:10,119
Turn it around

657
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,940
[Don't open it first if not!]

658
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:11,210
Don't open it, don't open it

659
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:12,760
What's wrong

660
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,260
[Bingjae who stopped first]

661
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:13,490
What's wrong

662
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,319
Is there anything

663
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,460
[The color painted there is different]

664
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,619
[Bingzai is like a tic-tac sign (#)]

665
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:20,589
That's right

666
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,300
[If you look carefully at the iron window]

667
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:25,480
This is so gray here

668
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,300
Yes, the word "Ah" is different

669
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:28,420
[Only some of the colors are different!]

670
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:30,300
This way

671
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:30,780
[I saw it after listening]

672
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,650
-And the Chinese characters next to them are doors- That's right

673
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,140
[Bingzai and the Chinese characters next to it are the door]

674
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,780
[Bingjae, I think I'll take that down]

675
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,740
[Bingjae may be open]

676
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:39,060
Meaning of opening

677
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:40,620
[Middle of the door]

678
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,420
[If you lower the iron window?]

679
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,330
- So it may be lowered to open instead - lowered to open

680
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,740
[Reducing the iron window may be a way to open the door]

681
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:50,760
Maybe the door can be opened

682
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,130
Turned open

683
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,740
[It's open!]

684
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:54,120
- Then let's try it down-try

685
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,300
[It is worthy of being the logical reasoning of Yuanzu's think tank]

686
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:55,070
I think it's right to drop

687
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,110
I think it's right to drop

688
00:17:56,990 --> 00:17:58,110
I think

689
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,660
[Bing-jae lowered the door, for example]

690
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:03,140
[Peongjae might have something to go up?]

691
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,180
[Geng Piao we can probably climb up the iron window]

692
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,450
yes

693
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,210
That's right, right

694
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:12,660
[You have to close the door to open the real door?!]

695
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:07,060
Step on

696
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:09,580
Down and go inside

697
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,420
[Baodhyun, cut this off first]

698
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:16,620
[Try to lower after Zhenjiu cut it down?]

699
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,640
Try it down all at once

700
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,500
[Geng Piao slowly lowered while holding on]

701
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,610
- Come together - That's right

702
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,700
That's right, right, right

703
00:18:23,230 --> 00:18:24,060
It's down

704
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,780
-Yeah-down

705
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:27,900
[Everyone reached an agreement to decide to cut the rope]

706
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:26,530
How heavy is it

707
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:27,310
Cut off

708
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:28,380
Cut it first

709

-Hold it - What would it feel like

710
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,180
OK OK OK

711
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,700
alright

712
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,580
Cut open

713
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:37,640
Cut open
