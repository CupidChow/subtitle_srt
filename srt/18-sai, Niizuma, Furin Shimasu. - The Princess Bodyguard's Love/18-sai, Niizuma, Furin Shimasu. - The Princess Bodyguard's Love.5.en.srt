1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:08,320
This place... looks like the
park we used to go to, Kou.

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,400
What are you planning, Haruka?

3
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:21,890
Of course I'm here for the Princess.

4
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,430
Right, Princess?

5
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,690
I remembered that

6
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:47,800
we had a huge Nandina tree in the garden.

7
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:54,360
In winter, it bears bright red berries,

8
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,810
and a lot of them fall on the snow...

9
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,040
it's like blood...

10
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,200
I'll never forget it... Kou...

11
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,340
Well then, I'll be around here.

12
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,930
Until we meet again, Princess,
and next time, let's talk about Kou's old times.

13
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:48,680
He kissed my hand...

14
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,770
- You stay away from that bastard.
- What?

15
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:58,300
He'll try to get close to you in that way,
but don't ever get involved!

16
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,500
- Answer me.
- Yes...

17
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:14,200
I'm the only one you like, okay?

18
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,830
Is this... Huh?

19
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,010
Is he trying to avoid losing me to Mr. Tsukise?

20
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,140
Kou!

21
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:31,230
The only one I love is you, Kou.

22
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:50,020
My body is... hot...

23
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,890
You told me we'd take it slow.

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,230
Get used to it.
There's much more to come.

25
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,940
Hey, Meika, wake up.

26
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,590
I have an early morning
meeting today, so I'll head out first.

27
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:30,230
I made you breakfast. Make sure to eat it.

28
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,610
Yes...

29
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:39,530
I know it's sudden, but can you come
with me on the business trip next week?

30
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:40,730
Huh?

31
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,840
It seems they know you from when you were little,

32
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,020
so if you're with me,
the contract might go more smoothly.

33
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,730
I think we'll be staying there overnight.

34
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,760
Overnight...

35
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,890
Could this be my chance?!

36
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:02,480
Okay, Meika?

37
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:05,530
Of course it's definitely a yes.

38
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,570
I'll take care of the hotel arrangements.

39
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:10,010
You go on ahead and get to work.

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,220
Well, I'm going.

41
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,360
Have a good day.

42
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:29,740
We work during the day,
but at night it's just us two,

43
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:32,150
and I think

44
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:34,710
that's better than the usual routine, right?

45
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:42,350
Just imagining it makes my heart race...

46
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,370
ECOTV Presents

47
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,440
18 YEARS OLD,

48
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,440
NEW

49
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,440
WIFE,

50
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,440
WILL HAVE

51
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:47,440
AN AFFAIR。

52
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:50,370
The Princess Bodyguard's Love

53
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,090
- Welcome.
- We have a reservation under Yamada.

54
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,050
Yes, we've been expecting you.

55
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,260
Yamada?

56
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,710
I made a reservation
without using Sanjo's name.

57
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:05,680
The contract went smoothly,
and you did a great job.

58
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,700
Let's take a good rest after this.

59
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:09,730
Yeah.

60
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:15,150
In a place out of Sanjo's reach,
just us two,

61
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:19,010
this will definitely make Kou feel good...

62
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:20,870
Right this way, please.

63
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:24,450
This way please.

64
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:27,780
I heard it's hard to get a reservation at this ryokan.

65
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:32,220
Oh... and Tom discretely
stayed here one time.

66
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:33,560
Tom...

67
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,010
Welcome, Princess.

68
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,350
And since today is such a special occasion,

69
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:49,450
our entire staff is committed to ensuring your evening together is a memorable one.

70
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,010
Wha...

71
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:57,170
To start, please indulge in our top-notch
spa to pamper your beautiful bodies.

72
00:05:57,170 --> 00:06:00,980
- Okay...
- And to boost your energy,

73
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:05,520
we have prepared a special
turtle dinner for the evening.

74
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,320
- What?!
- Huh?!

75
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:10,040
And of course, we have
some live blood as well.

76
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,980
Live blood...?

77
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes, and of course, the room
is designed to welcome you.

78
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:30,180
Whose bright idea was this hospitality?

79
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,450
It is from Mr. Amane Sanjo.

80
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:40,810
He said that he hope the night of your
union will be a grand one.

81
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,230
Amane?

82
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:45,540
If you can do it in that situation, then do it.

83
00:06:47,370 --> 00:06:49,010
How did he know?

84
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:53,940
That guy is a Sanjo,
through and through.

85
00:06:55,910 --> 00:07:00,680
My ideals are crumbling with a sound.

86
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:07,310
Let's go for a walk for now.
Looks like we're close to the beach.

87
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,390
Yeah.

88
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:15,710
Wow, it's so beautiful!
The beach is so lovely, isn't it?

89
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,880
You and I have been
here before, haven't we?

90
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,480
Despite being cold at the time,
you kept splashing water on me...

91
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:24,220
Did I?

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,740
Hey, Meika.

93
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,680
Do you know that ocean
breeze tastes like salt?

94
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:34,610
Really?

95
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,070
You did, didn't you?

96
00:07:41,410 --> 00:07:43,520
What? Are you getting back at me for that?

97
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,280
Oh, you do remember.

98
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:49,210
Hey, stop it.

99
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:51,450
What are you, a kid?

100
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,610
That's rich, coming from a real kid.

101
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,460
Kou has a smile like this...

102
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,640
totally different from when he's a bodyguard.

103
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,530
What's with that look?

104
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,480
Though it's cute.

105
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:40,150
My body is telling me it wants Kou.

106
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:01,240
You seem tired today.

107
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,510
You've been on the beach for too long.
And ate too much food.

108
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,840
That goes for you too.

109
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:13,770
But I enjoyed it.

110
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,980
We were like a normal lovebirds...

111
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:34,250
Kou... give me just a finger,
I want to hold it.

112
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,380
Kou...

113
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:06,520
Nothing more than that.

114
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,720
I'm a man.

115
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:28,120
It's okay. Be a man.

116
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:57,620
Are you really sure?

117
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,090
I am...

118
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,480
- You don't want to...
- No!

119
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,820
I want to know what's next.

120
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:48,150
I want to know the Kou that I don't know.

121
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,470
Kou...

122
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,530
I love you.

123
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:11,520
I really love you.

124
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,960
I... love you too.

125
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,200
My mind, my body,
everything is filled with Kou.

126
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:41,740
All of it overflowing with Kou...

127
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:50,070
So this is what it feels like to be
close to the person you love...

128
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,650
Good morning, Princess.

129
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,610
It appears that everything
went smoothly last night,

130
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:05,180
so I offer my sincere congratulations.

131
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,150
Uh... thank you?

132
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:14,550
What is this?
It looks like I'm being punished.

133
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:18,090
Well, I'll leave you to it, enjoy.

134
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,200
Shall we eat?

135
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:32,610
Yeah, it looks delicious. Let's eat!

136
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:43,050
I'm happy... but I'm still nervous...

137
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,040
What?

138
00:13:53,230 --> 00:13:56,750
Blushing all by yourself.
What's got you so excited?

139
00:13:57,350 --> 00:13:58,560
Huh...

140
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:02,500
- It's about last night, right?
- No...

141
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,150
I--I mean, I can't help it.

142
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,570
It's my first time.

143
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,490
What's with the calm expression?

144
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:21,560
I'm over the moon, too.

145
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,800
You're blushing too.

146
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,730
Shut up.

147
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,610
I've never seen you look like that.

148
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,540
Of course, I can't have this
look when I was your bodyguard.

149
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,820
Then from now on, let me see more of it.

150
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:44,010
Hey... careful...

151
00:14:44,010 --> 00:14:46,050
- You've done it.
- Oh, wait a minute.

152
00:14:49,390 --> 00:14:51,340
I'm sure from now on

153
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:54,690
we'll see each other
in ways we don't know yet...

154
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,620
Let's eat.

155
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,530
Ever since Kou and I did it,

156
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:11,190
I've been feeling that way
no matter what I do...

157
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:14,520
Sir, thanks for the other day.

158
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:26,890
The feeling of Kou's skin on mine
has stayed with me ever since.

159
00:15:29,700 --> 00:15:32,390
Sir, I have the quotation.

160
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:34,130
Thank you.

161
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,810
I want those hands touching me,

162
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:44,660
I want my face buried in Kou's body.

163
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,180
Oh, welcome home.
You're home earl-- What?

164
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:08,030
Wait a minute.
What's gotten into you?

165
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,130
You've been...

166
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,540
looking at me sexually all day.
What're you talking about?

167
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,560
Huh?

168
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:22,770
But you see,

169
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,640
I've been thinking about
something even more erotic.

170
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,650
- Did you know that?
- What?

171
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,970
What is this?

172
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,370
It's not like any kiss I've ever had.

173
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,360
It's driving me crazy...

174
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,820
You know, I'm trying to be patient,

175
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,690
but if I really want to,

176
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,310
I want to hold you so tight,

177
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:08,930
and tear you apart.

178
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,710
But I still won't.

179
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:32,390
You're new at this,
so I won't go all in...

180
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,420
Kou... it's so sweet...

181
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:48,660
He was thinking about that.

182
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:58,630
From now on, I'll take my time.
And experience all of my firsts with Kou.

183
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,550
- Excuse us.
- Thank you.

184
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:07,580
- Thank you, Princess.
- It's okay.

185
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,490
I'm glad that everyone is happy.

186
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,790
Princess, is that scary-looking
guy not here today?

187
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,420
- You mean Kou?
- Yeah.

188
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:19,800
He has work today and couldn't make it.

189
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:22,130
Oh, is that so?

190
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:25,950
Such a shame that Kou isn't here.

191
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,620
Mr. Tsukise...

192
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,720
Hello, Princess.

193
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,950
He'll try to get close to you in that way,
but don't ever get involved!

194
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:48,460
Kou was so cute like them.

195
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,540
Huh?

196
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,210
I have some old pictures of him.
Wanna see it?

197
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,130
Is he pulling my leg?

198
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:02,260
Kou used to be really cute.

199
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:08,060
I think I remember the girl
Kou liked was in here...

200
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:13,650
No, no, no! It's just a photo.
The past is the past!

201
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:23,690
What? Is this Kou?
He's so young! So small!

202
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:26,920
It was around the time
he came to the facility.

203
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:32,820
Oh, yeah, the one next to him is me.
He's, like, 17.

204
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:35,720
Oh...

205
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:38,850
The Kou from the past I never knew.

206
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:46,380
He has done a lot of things I don't know,
in places unknown to me.

207
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:50,790
- Oh, yeah, the girl Kou liked--
- Hey...

208
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,550
That's enough.

209
00:19:57,950 --> 00:20:02,640
About the facility, about his friends,

210
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,700
about the people he loved...

211
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:12,320
I want to hear it carefully...
from Kou's mouth.

212
00:20:15,430 --> 00:20:19,090
I know it's an important part of Kou...

213
00:20:21,780 --> 00:20:24,460
Thanks for the photos.

214
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,630
Now if you'll excuse me.

215
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,880
Kou is one lucky guy.

216
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm jealous...

217
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,820
There will be no second time.

218
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:51,540
Well, well, well.
The knight has arrived.

219
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,080
Meika.

220
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,670
Kou...

221
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,730
Don't ever come any closer to Meika.

222
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:05,060
I want to have everything that's yours.

223
00:21:06,210 --> 00:21:12,470
If you don't like it,
you'll have to kill me, Kou.

224
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:20,460
If you don't want to get killed, lay low, Haruka.

225
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:27,070
Let's go home, Meika.

226
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,690
I might just do it.

227
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,640
You love your wife way too much.

228
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:42,130
I told you to stay away from Haruka...

229
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,260
I'm sorry... but he said he'd show
me some of old photos of you.

230
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:49,400
Don't get so worked up over just my photos.

231
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,560
If it's a photo of someone you loved,
I'd want to see it!

232
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,650
Don't tell me it's just photos!

233
00:21:53,950 --> 00:21:57,380
Kou, you're just an old man
who doesn't understand love!

234
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:07,380
Theme song: WEST. - "Beautiful"

235
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:00,640
What did you say?

236
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:33,700
I mean, it's you who
doesn't understand love...

237
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,520
We're finally gonna see each other, Kou.

238
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:14,980
NEXT EPISODE

239
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:03,260
- Yuri.
- Was she the person you loved?

240
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:07,140
- It was a long time ago.
- Why does Kou have a past...

241
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:11,060
You can't help it if it's the
husband you love so much.

242
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,030
Want to give it a try?
