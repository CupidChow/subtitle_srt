1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:07,170
- How long are you gonna be mad?
- I'm not mad.

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,550
- What part?
- It's normal.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:16,130
18 years old, newlywed, currently in a little argument with my husband, Kou!

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:19,760
You know, just because
you saw a picture of my exes--

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,430
When you were single, right?!
Just how many girlfriends did you have?

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,130
Why are you even bringing it up now?

7
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:34,930
Because Ms. Mayumi showed
me an old picture of you...

8
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:38,390
So I'm not sure if the strategy

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,050
you taught me was successful or not.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,970
Well, that's fine as it is, isn't it?

11
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:48,970
After all, every couple has their own pace.

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,530
I see.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,470
Oh, I found an interesting
photo the other day.

14
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,340
Huh?

15
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,400
It's a picture of Kou when
he was in college. Want to see it?

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:01,790
I do!

17
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,530
- This here is Kou...
- What? So cute...

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,600
- This one is me.
- Yeah.

19
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,860
And this one is Kou's next girlfriend,

20
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,050
and this here is his next next girlfriend.

21
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,410
I unexpectedly found out
about your ex-girlfriends...

22
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:26,690
Mayumi...

23
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:30,800
I had no idea you were a womanizer!

24
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,700
The way you say it...

25
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,060
Kou, please go home now.

26
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:37,390
I'll be fine shopping on
my own after this!

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:42,220
Yes, yes...

28
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,470
Kou...

29
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:53,730
Oh, street piano.

30
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:59,730
- Oh, it's just a kid.
- Normally, someone who's good would play it.

31
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:03,470
- No, maybe they arranged it that way.
- Oh, I see.

32
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:08,350
Good, good. Play it again.
Okay, Ta-kun.

33
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,800
Hey kid, wanna play with me?

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,800
What?! Amane?

35
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:26,090
You play it as it is,
and let's have fun with it.

36
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,310
Yeah!

37
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,680
Here we go. Ready...

38
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:36,890
Yeah, yeah, you're good.

39
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,330
Wow, wow, yeah, yeah. Just like that.

40
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,710
Where'd you learn that? You're so good.

41
00:02:58,090 --> 00:03:00,840
Amane Sanjo, my cousin who
is a year younger than me.

42
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:04,780
He's supposed to be living in Vienna
now because of his parent's job...

43
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,910
- Yay!
- That was fun!

44
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,300
You had fun? That's good.
You and me both.

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,610
- Thank you so much!
- My pleasure.

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:21,030
- Meika!
- Amane!

47
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:24,150
- It's been awhile. A year, right?
- What're you doing here? From Vienna?

48
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:28,400
Oh, yeah, it's just a school vacation,
and there's something on my mind.

49
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,370
Oh, I see.
Oh, wanna come hang out at my place?

50
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,600
Yeah, I was thinking of going there now.

51
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,300
Oh, really? Perfect timing.

52
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,910
- Then let's go.
- Yeah.

53
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,430
- I'm home.
- Welcome home.

54
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:49,420
I ran into Amane earlier.

55
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,110
It's been a long time, Kou.

56
00:03:59,150 --> 00:04:01,130
Yes, it's been a while.

57
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,870
I heard you two got married.
Congrats.

58
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,610
Thanks.

59
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:13,820
Why did you marry Kou,
whom you don't like?

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,680
Huh?

61
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,950
This is a fake marriage, right?

62
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,010
W-What are you talking about...

63
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,030
You two weren't dating before I left.

64
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,700
Meika, you were talking crap
about Kou to me.

65
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:40,510
Annoying, bothersome, old,
stupid old man! Remember?

66
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,560
What? I thought you were being
forced to marry some rich guy.

67
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,150
So you asked Kou who
always does what you say?

68
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,840
He's perceptive...

69
00:04:58,330 --> 00:05:03,070
In that case, why didn't you just tell me?

70
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,370
Leave Kou and marry me, Meika.

71
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:28,390
Sadly, this isn't a fake marriage,
and this is what we are now...

72
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:31,990
You...

73
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:36,590
You're starting to talk down to me, huh?

74
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,930
What?

75
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:49,710
Kissing alone doesn't make
you a married couple.

76
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,670
I mean, kissing is easy, right?

77
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:57,250
Judging from Meika's reaction,
I'd say you two only got as far as kissing.

78
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:03,300
You still haven't gone all the way yet?
It's a fake marriage after all.

79
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,850
You...

80
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,910
Plenty of room for me to be her husband.

81
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,660
Remember that.

82
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:18,760
I don't just dislike you,
I absolutely hate you.

83
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:26,370
That's why I've always hated that guy.

84
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,630
Amane...

85
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:38,180
ECOTV Presents

86
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,250
18 YEARS OLD,

87
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,250
NEW

88
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,250
WIFE,

89
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,250
WILL HAVE

90
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:35,250
AN AFFAIR。

91
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,180
The Princess Bodyguard's Love

92
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,620
- I'll take this to the division chief.
- Thank you.

93
00:06:49,630 --> 00:06:52,200
- Wow, what a handsome boy.
- He's sparkling.

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,150
- He's like a prince.
- So cool.

95
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:58,120
- He's tall.
- So cool!

96
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,930
- Meika, come hang out with me.
- Amane...

97
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,150
Let's have lunch with Grandpa,
just us three, just the family.

98
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,600
Oh, but...

99
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:19,170
It's all right, right?
I've got Chairman's permission.

100
00:07:29,950 --> 00:07:34,090
Got a lot of time on your hands,
Mr. Amane Sanjo.

101
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,200
Yeah, it must be hard for you.

102
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:44,010
You had to work like a cart horse to
gain recognition from the Sanjo family.

103
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:51,370
Money, position, honor...
compared to you, who has nothing.

104
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,090
I possess far more things.

105
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:58,890
To protect Meika, the princess of Sanjo,

106
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:01,480
you better have plenty of weapons, right?

107
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:06,810
I'm the only one who can protect Meika.

108
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:16,370
So? You have dinner with
the bank president today,

109
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:18,670
and then another meeting, right?

110
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,190
As for me, I'm going on a date with Meika.

111
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:27,230
You even know my schedule...

112
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,320
Don't worry about us,
just focus on your job.

113
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:36,190
Bye.

114
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:43,270
"Protect," huh...

115
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,990
Been a while since we
walked together like this.

116
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:52,530
Hey Amane, what about
dinner with Grandpa?

117
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:54,460
Before that, let's go on a date, just us two.

118
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:57,690
- I've got Kou's permission.
- But...

119
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:03,140
I haven't been in Japan in a while.
I wanna have fun. Is that a problem?

120
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,530
Guess I've got no choice.

121
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:09,350
Yay!

122
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,990
He's always been so adorable
when asking for something...

123
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,870
Meika, what do you think of me?

124
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:22,720
Huh?

125
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,100
You've gotten so cool...

126
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,870
What about loving me?

127
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,710
Lo... What?!

128
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:44,370
I love you. As a cousin.

129
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:51,780
When I heard overseas that you
married Kou, I almost lost my mind.

130
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:54,360
Amane...

131
00:09:57,850 --> 00:10:03,870
Please, please fall in love with me, Meika.

132
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,760
Sanjo

133
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,970
I'm home...

134
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,690
You're home late.

135
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:30,330
Well, Amane completely messed up my SP.

136
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,890
Did he do something to you?

137
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,460
He... didn't.

138
00:10:41,690 --> 00:10:43,360
There was a pause.

139
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:47,870
Nothing...
nothing happen.

140
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:51,110
Oh...

141
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,270
Nothing really happened.

142
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,810
I know.

143
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:25,010
That guy, despite everything,
is a well-brought-up prince.

144
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,460
He just tried to hit on you at the right time.

145
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:32,590
Huh? How did you know?

146
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:36,860
I've been keeping an eye on the
two of you since you were little.

147
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:41,910
He's no match for you.

148
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:49,420
But you were a little worried, right? Right?

149
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:57,310
Yes, I am.

150
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:08,530
Oh, sorry, Amane, but it's still these hands.

151
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:13,930
Kou's... big, warm hands.

152
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,760
That's it.

153
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,360
We'll end right there.

154
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,750
What... Kou...

155
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,010
Any more than that is not good.

156
00:12:30,230 --> 00:12:32,650
Still, I want you to touch me...

157
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,420
You dummy...

158
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:52,960
I get excited when my hair brushes
against my face and neck,

159
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,530
because that's the place
I haven't been kissed yet...

160
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:02,430
W-Wait a minute.
Stop...

161
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:12,400
I'm sorry, I'm still...
not emotionally ready...

162
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,940
Yes, I know.

163
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:26,110
I mean, I almost rushed into it,
that was close...

164
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,970
It's too sudden.

165
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:34,100
I thought it wasn't the situation you wanted.

166
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,850
Ah... as you suspected.

167
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:43,950
Well, we should do this only
when you're emotionally ready.

168
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,100
I'll go and get the bath ready.

169
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,850
Oh, yeah...

170
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:09,360
Meika... where is she?

171
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:17,100
Prince of Sanjo, do you have
business with the company again?

172
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,990
Amane.

173
00:14:27,530 --> 00:14:31,070
Would you like to grab a quick bite with me?

174
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:39,930
My wife was in your care the other day.

175
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,060
"My wife"...

176
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,880
Kou, you've really risen through the
ranks since you were her bodyguard.

177
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,470
I'm not going to comment
on your current position,

178
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,780
but as the husband of Sanjo's Princess,
you're not fit for it.

179
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:02,130
You have no real status or power.

180
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:09,720
You're just an excellent,
ordinary salaryman.

181
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,860
How could a man like
that protect the princess?

182
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:25,790
Amane, you know,
you really have everything.

183
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:31,150
Money, position,

184
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:36,270
honor, education,

185
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:41,120
and that pretty face.

186
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:49,190
Oh, and those beautiful
fingers for the piano...

187
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,840
What are you doing?

188
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,670
You have too many things
that you want to protect.

189
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:07,620
I don't have anything to protect.
All I have to protect is Meika...

190
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:16,930
This body and these thoughts
are only for Meika.

191
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:28,450
Well, being reckless does have its advantages when push comes to shove, right?

192
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,530
Well, I'm going to make my rounds.

193
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,400
Bye.

194
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,370
Kou is still not here.

195
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,070
Meika.

196
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,270
Amane! You startled me.

197
00:16:57,530 --> 00:17:00,100
- You're not going home yet?
- Ah, yeah.

198
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,490
I'm waiting for Kou to
return from his rounds.

199
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:09,230
Listen, Amane...

200
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:13,730
Right now... you...

201
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:17,840
you must hate me, right?

202
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:26,510
But first, you should have felt
the same way about Kou.

203
00:17:27,930 --> 00:17:28,970
Look...

204
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:30,760
Do you really love Kou?

205
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:38,270
You see, you're new to love...

206
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:43,050
Kou is used to it, and he's sneaky...

207
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,520
Don't you think you're
just falling for his tricks?

208
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:55,990
Meika, if the fake marriage
had been with me,

209
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,230
the result would have been the same...

210
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:01,720
don't you think?

211
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,070
Even if these hands were not Kou,

212
00:18:09,970 --> 00:18:12,500
it would have been fine if they were Amane's...

213
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,070
You're right... maybe...

214
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:28,210
But I'm sure I wouldn't have
fallen in love with you

215
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,990
the way I fell in love with Kou.

216
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:41,460
It's true that I...
haven't done it yet with Kou,

217
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,790
but...

218
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:52,870
I still... want him to hold me.

219
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:56,070
I don't want to hear that.

220
00:18:57,530 --> 00:18:59,150
Amane...

221
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:08,770
I'm completely in love with Kou.

222
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:16,790
So I'm sorry.

223
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:27,280
So, are you now convinced, Mr. Amane?

224
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:37,070
Theme song: WEST. - "Beautiful"

225
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,080
All right, I got it.

226
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:49,200
Meika, be good to Kou.

227
00:19:50,730 --> 00:19:56,060
Kou, please take care of Meika.

228
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,380
Yeah.

229
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:04,690
Protect the princess of Sanjo
until I come to claim her properly.

230
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:05,970
You got that?

231
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:12,110
Meika, see you soon.
Let's go on a date again.

232
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:19,730
Seriously, that's the kind of guy he is.

233
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:27,200
- This is the one you asked for.
- Thank you.

234
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,930
Excuse me.

235
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:57,490
I see...

236
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:06,570
Are you really that into Kou Fujimiya,
Princess of Sanjo?

237
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,410
Hey!

238
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:14,250
Come on, everyone,
keep it coming.

239
00:21:19,990 --> 00:21:23,260
Oh, can you bring the next one
in the back over there, too?

240
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:27,600
- Meika, we'll take care of it, you just...
- It's okay. We don't have much time.

241
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:35,540
The Sanjo donates
to an orphanage every year.

242
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,250
Did you grow up in an orphanage?

243
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,930
- Yes.
- When was it? Which facility?

244
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:49,890
You never cared about such things before...

245
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,470
Can you blame me?

246
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,240
Since 12 until I was 18.

247
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,430
About six years.

248
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:03,930
- Thank you, Princess!
- Thank you!

249
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:06,850
Yes, you're welcome.
Have a lot of fun.

250
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:07,950
Yeah!

251
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:15,810
Oh, so this is the Princess of Sanjo.

252
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:19,630
This is Mr. Tsukise, the managing director
of a company in the next city over,

253
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:21,190
he donates to us every year...

254
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,210
Oh, I see.

255
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:28,250
I'm sorry for introducing myself late.
I am Haruka Tsukise.

256
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,010
A pleasure to make your acquaintance...

257
00:22:35,790 --> 00:22:36,960
This place...

258
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:39,990
looks like the park we used to go to...

259
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:41,910
Kou.

260
00:22:43,370 --> 00:22:45,920
What? Kou, you know him?

261
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,920
What are you planning, Haruka?

262
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:14,980
NEXT EPISODE

263
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,460
I think we'll be staying there overnight.

264
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:03,410
Overnight...

265
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:06,130
In a place out of
Sanjo's reach, just us two,

266
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:09,850
I bet this will make Kou feel really good...

267
00:23:09,850 --> 00:23:13,180
I want to know what's next.
I want to know the Kou I didn't know.

268
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:14,710
Are you really sure?
