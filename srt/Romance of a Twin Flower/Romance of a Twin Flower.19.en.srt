00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,240
Mr. Yuan,

4
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,800
you were considerate enough

5
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,130
to book the stall in advance.

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,290
If we booked it today,

7
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,160
we would have failed.

8
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:51,770
Don't

9
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,880
praise me.

10
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,440
You're more confident now, aren't you?

11
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:55,690
And I didn't expect

12
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:57,360
all Feiwan Face Cream

13
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,930
was sold out

14
00:01:57,930 --> 00:01:59,080
in just half an hour.

15
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,210
Listen,

16
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:01,080
it'll be more smooth

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,160
once you open the shop tomorrow.

18
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:03,490
Okay.

19
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,880
I want to play there.

20
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,640
I've already heard

21
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,810
about the Lantern Festival of Haifang,

22
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,810
and it's indeed

23
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:20,370
bustling.

24
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,640
It's said

25
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,640
adherents

26
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,760
will go to Lantern Garden

27
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,200
to light lanterns for their loved ones.

28
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,570
Miss, take a look.

29
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,370
- Miss.
- It's very lively.

30
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:36,680
- Buy it if you like.
- Let's take a look.

31
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:37,720
I'll go first.

32
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,850
I sewed up your wound today.

33
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:39,480
One bead for me.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,320
I applied medicine for you today.

35
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:41,010
One bead for me.

36
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:41,480
I...

37
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:43,010
These two things

38
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,250
are the same thing.

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,130
I also hid your injury from others.

40
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:48,850
I'll let you put two beads in the box

41
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:50,090
for these three things.

42
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,810
Do you like it?

43
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:55,850
I'll buy it for you.

44
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,040
Madam, how much is it?

45
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:58,600
I'll buy it.

46
00:02:59,030 --> 00:02:59,810
No need.

47
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,410
I'm just taking a look.

48
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:02,810
Thank you.

49
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,250
You don't want it?

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,760
Let's go.

51
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,320
Please have a look, Miss.

52
00:03:06,410 --> 00:03:07,690
Come on. Take a look, everyone.

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,640
(You haven't got married,)

54
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,250
(nor are you Nie Sangyu,)

55
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,640
(so I don't need to think
too much about everything.)

56
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,130
Five pence a banquet.
It's very beautiful.

57
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,760
(Tonight is the best chance.)

58
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,970
They're very fresh.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,810
Yes, I just picked them today.

60
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,570
Take a look.

61
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,410
Buy one if you like.

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:23,160
No.

63
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:24,970
Buy one.

64
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:26,090
Ms. Nie,

65
00:03:28,090 --> 00:03:29,040
I do have a gift

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,760
for you.

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:31,920
What is it?

68
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,440
Here is the money.

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,600
Give me a banquet of
the most beautiful flowers.

70
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:37,370
Here. It's the most beautiful one.

71
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:37,880
Thank you.

72
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:40,760
Ms. Nie,

73
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,370
it's the Lantern Festival today.

74
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,090
We've known each other

75
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:46,370
for a long time,

76
00:03:48,410 --> 00:03:49,290
and actually...

77
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,130
No, Mr. Yuan.

78
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,370
I can't accept it.

79
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,410
Take it back.

80
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,370
You...

81
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:13,850
You don't...

82
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,570
I'm just kidding.

83
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,690
We're friends, aren't we?

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,100
It's not funny at all.

85
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,340
You freaked me out.

86
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,580
You're very smart,

87
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,260
but couldn't you tell

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:29,900
that I was joking?

89
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,660
Let's go.

90
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,940
My god.

91
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:37,060
Take it back.

92
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:40,060
I won't ask for the money back.

93
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,740
Ms. Nie.

94
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:43,820
Ms. Nie.

95
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,260
I want to take you

96
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:47,260
to another place.

97
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,180
Where is it?

98
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:50,820
Let's go.

99
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,260
Well,

100
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,060
my shop is going to open tomorrow,

101
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,940
so I should go back now.

102
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,860
Have fun.

103
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,260
Ning Yuxuan?

104
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,300
Why are you here?

105
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,740
Mr. Ning.

106
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:15,060
Why are you here?

107
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,060
My shop will open tomorrow,

108
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,020
so I came here

109
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,060
to sell the Feiwan Face Cream for a test.

110
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:18,620
How about you?

111
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:19,300
I...

112
00:05:20,260 --> 00:05:23,940
I'm just hanging out.

113
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,940
Since we happened to meet each other,

114
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:27,940
why don't we go together?

115
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,820
We don't seem to be
in the same direction.

116
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,260
I'm taking Ms. Nie

117
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:32,380
to put lanterns in the river
to make wishes.

118
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,180
What a coincidence.

119
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,620
We're totally in the same direction.

120
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,020
Let's go to make wishes.

121
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:39,820
Thank you, sir.

122
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,380
Thank you, sir.

123
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,180
Goodbye.

124
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:41,580
Let's go.

125
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,380
Lanterns for making wishes.

126
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,740
Take a look.

127
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,820
Lanterns for making wishes.

128
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:46,380
Miss,

129
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
do you want a lantern for making wishes?

130
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,140
Yes, I want one.

131
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:48,500
Okay.

132
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,580
All lanterns are here.

133
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,380
Select one you like.

134
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,620
I want this one.

135
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:53,820
Miss,

136
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,140
this is a lantern for making wishes.

137
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:56,620
The wish maker should write the name

138
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,740
and put it into the lantern,

139
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,180
then her wishes will come true.

140
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,300
Take it.

141
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,180
(Gui)

142
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,540
(Gui Bai)

143
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,500
Are you sure not to put one?

144
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,380
Fine.

145
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,380
Give him the money.

146
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,180
Sir, five pence.

147
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,580
Thank you. Goodbye.

148
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:20,820
Do you know

149
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,420
that it's my first time
spending Shangsi Festival?

150
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,180
I left my home at a young age,

151
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,380
and at every festival,

152
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,500
I would either be alone

153
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,500
or have a performance.

154
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,260
I always bring

155
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,620
liveliness and happiness to others,

156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,820
but the happiness doesn't

157
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,820
belong to me at all.

158
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,180
However, it's different now.

159
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:43,180
I...

160
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,740
I have you with me this time.

161
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:58,740
How about you?

162
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,260
Are you happy today?

163
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:09,940
I...

164
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,940
I've never spent any festival.

165
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,940
Could you

166
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,500
not be so boring?

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,820
It's a festival today,

168
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,740
but you have a long face

169
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:30,380
at such a romantic night.

170
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,140
I'll accompany you
to spend the festival,

171
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,260
so smile for me.

172
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,860
I don't know how.

173
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,740
Still keeping serious?

174
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,620
You look handsome when smiling.

175
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,260
Everyone.

176
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,140
Everyone,

177
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,780
today is the Lantern Festival,

178
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:35,500
and we'd like to add to the fun.

179
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:37,620
Get lanterns by
playing ring throwing game.

180
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,860
Ten pence for three rings.

181
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,740
Ten pence for three rings.

182
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:42,740
Who

183
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,660
wants to try?

184
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,660
- Sir, I want to try.
- Me.

185
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,500
Please come here.

186
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:49,140
Please come here.

187
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,020
Come on.

188
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:53,380
- Sir.
- Please.

189
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,860
Okay, thank you.

190
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,620
Here are yours.

191
00:09:56,620 --> 00:09:58,020
Miss, here are yours.

192
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,380
Thank you.

193
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:58,780
Let me do it.

194
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,540
Come on.

195
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,340
Misters, please.

196
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:03,100
Mr. Yuan,

197
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,980
do you also want

198
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,740
the biggest one?

199
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,140
Of course.

200
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,500
You're alone,

201
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,140
so who do you want to make wishes for?

202
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,380
That's my private thing,

203
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,660
so forgive me for not telling you.

204
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,140
But

205
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,740
you married two ladies,

206
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,340
so which one do you want

207
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,020
to light this lantern for?

208
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,500
That's my private thing

209
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:29,780
and has nothing to do with you.

210
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,380
Please.

211
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:34,740
Don't be shocked.

212
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,380
Come on.

213
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:46,900
Mr. Yuan.

214
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,620
Thank you for letting me win.

215
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,660
It doesn't matter.

216
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,260
Hold on.

217
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,460
It's okay.

218
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:01,220
It's okay.

219
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:01,900
Mr. Ning,

220
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,660
don't learn from me.

221
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:05,660
Go on.

222
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,260
It was close.

223
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,140
I did it on purpose.

224
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,140
I did it on purpose.

225
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,260
I'll get it this time.

226
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,140
I'm sure.

227
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:31,540
It's...

228
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,220
Everyone,

229
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,140
let's

230
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,980
applaud to cheer for the two misters.

231
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,620
Come on.

232
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,540
It doesn't matter.

233
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,220
It's the last ring.

234
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,260
It's the last ring.

235
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,620
Your Ladyship,

236
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,020
something happened. It's on fire.

237
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,500
Your Ladyship.

238
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,220
What's wrong?

239
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,260
The storage is on fire.

240
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:04,980
What?

241
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,020
Where are the materials?

242
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,020
They are inside it.

243
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:07,620
Oh, no.

244
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,220
Make way.

245
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:11,100
Make way.

246
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:14,020
Do...

247
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:16,380
Do you want to
make wishes with a lantern

248
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,980
for your loved one?

249
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,260
I'm loyal to His Lordship,

250
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,220
but

251
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,020
yes.

252
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,100
Gui Bai,

253
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,740
then

254
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,980
let's...

255
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,140
Mr. Gui,

256
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,980
something happened.

257
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:55,620
What is it?

258
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,140
Haoxue Cosmetics is on fire.

259
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:58,620
Haoxue Cosmetics is on fire?

260
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,380
Keep guarding.

261
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,140
Protect the people.

262
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:19,500
Put out the fire now.

263
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,620
Hurry up.

264
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,140
Put out the fire!

265
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:24,860
Dear.

266
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:25,860
Move.

267
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:49,620
Your Lordship.

268
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:51,620
Your Lordship,

269
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:52,260
keep away from the fire.

270
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,620
Put out the fire now.

271
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:04,980
Dear!

272
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,540
- Stop.
- Let me in.

273
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,340
Let me in.

274
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:18,780
No.

275
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,740
Let me in.

276
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,260
No.

277
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:21,500
- Let me in.
- Listen.

278
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:22,780
I'm here.

279
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:23,780
Leave everything to me.

280
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:24,900

(since childhood,)

306
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:24,500
(and all I want is to light a lantern)

307
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,380
(with him.)

308
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,500
(Why do you treat me like this?)

309
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
Tanxiang,

310
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:36,620
do it.

311
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:48,180
(Magistrate's Residence)

312
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,660
You're awake.

313
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:05,500
Do you feel better?

314
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,020
Why am I here?

315
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,660
You fainted just now.

316
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,260
Don't move.

317
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:10,660
Put out the fire.

318
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,180
Don't worry.

319
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:12,300
It has been put out

320
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,300
and didn't affect the surroundings.

321
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,100
It was put out?

322
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,220
Here.

323
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,740
The ginger soup was just cooked,

324
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,570
and it's still hot now.

325
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,780
Drink it.

326
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:22,580
Don't you think

327
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,520
the fire was strange?

328
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:32,820
Muxu said

329
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,460
she found a burnt lantern

330
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,020
in the storage's right backyard,

331
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,500
so it seemed to be an incident

332
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,740
in others' opinions.

333
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,870
A burnt lantern?

334
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
Do you think it's an incident?

335
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,100
I think we can regard it

336
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,220
as an incident.

337
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,180
It seems we have the same thought.

338
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:00,900
But I'm still worried.

339
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,820
I'm afraid the troublemaker
has another plan.

340
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:04,660
No matter what plans they have,

341
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,700
let's make preparations

342
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:08,340
and catch them.

343
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,060
Sorry.

344
00:18:16,810 --> 00:18:17,930
It's my fault.

345
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,550
I know you're afraid of fire,

346
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,620
but I still asked you to put it out.

347
00:18:21,290 --> 00:18:21,780
How...

348
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:27,180
How do you know I'm afraid of fire?

349
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,100
When the kitchen

350
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,500
was on fire,

351
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:33,580
I saw you

352
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,520
fainted in the bath bucket,

353
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:36,740
and I thought

354
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,740
your reaction

355
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,020
was related to fire

356
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,940
at that time.

357
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,020
Was it you

358
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,830
that saved me at that time?

359
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,130
Of course.

360
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:49,530
I've told you that before.

361
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,540
Thank you

362
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,020
for saving me.

363
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,820
Why do you look at me in this way?

364
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,540
Do you want a red bead again?

365
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,980
No.

366
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,500
I want to ask you a question.

367
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:12,520
Okay, go ahead.

368
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:16,260
Why are you afraid of fire that much?

369
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,220
I...

370
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:28,100
Fine.

371
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:29,260
After all, you saved me,

372
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,140
and I saved you.

373
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,380
We're even.

374
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,740
In fact, I've changed a lot

375
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,660
after you came into my life.

376
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:48,940
I also didn't expect

377
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,180
that I would go to put out the fire.

378
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:51,900
It's you

379
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,980
that make me change.

380
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,220
I've never felt it

381
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,580
from others.

382
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,140
Thank you.

383
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,380
Don't let Nie Sangyu

384
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,660
hear these words.

385
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,980
Otherwise, she'll come back
to punch you.

386
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,700
Nie Sangyu

387
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
has died.

388
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,420
What?

389
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,700
(To Your Lordship)

390
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,980
I searched for

391
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,700
the First Lady's whereabouts
under your order,

392
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,820
and after searching along
the river for over half a month,

393
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:34,620
I finally found a clue

394
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:35,580
in a farmer's house at the riverside.

395
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,180
The farmer saw a female corpse

396
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:39,460
floated to the side from the middle,

397
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,180
so he set up a grave
for her out of kindness.

398
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,980
After opening the grave
and having an autopsy,

399
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:43,980
I found the corpse

400
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,620
had the same clothing
as the First Lady's.

401
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:46,900
And I found

402
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:48,500
a jade pendant of
right moon as the proof.

403
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,660
Nie Sangyu and I

404
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,500
shouldn't have gotten married.

405
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,180
She was determined

406
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,940
to marry me,

407
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:07,340
and I thought

408
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,660
even if we didn't love each other,

409
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,820
at least we could treat each other well

410
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,700
for our whole lives.

411
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:13,820
However,

412
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:16,980
it turned out...

413
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,100
She was pitiful.

414
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,420
No matter what,

415
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,860
it's my fault.

416
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,660
Since I was five,

417
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,340
I have closed

418
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,140
my heart to everyone.

419
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,460
I've done many bad things

420
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:39,820
whether to her

421
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:42,860
or to you.

422
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,180
I...

423
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,900
I don't want to be like this anymore.

424
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,020
I...

425
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,380
I think it shouldn't be too late.

426
00:22:08,420 --> 00:22:09,220
What?

427
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:10,940
Go and clean yourself.

428
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:12,380
Change into a piece of clean clothing.

429
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,740
Miss Shui.

430
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,220
The wound's scope is big,

431
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,380
so you may have scars.

432
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,100
Don't get them wet during these days.

433
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,220
Okay.

434
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:32,260
Sorry.

435
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,140
I made you hurt.

436
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:37,940
I'll do it gently.

437
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:39,620
It's fine.

438
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,740
You've done well enough.

439
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,460
Gui Bai,

440
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,580
why did such a thing happen

441
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,180
when Haoxue Cosmetics

442
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,260
was just about

443
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,460
to reopen?

444
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,420
Although it was easy

445
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:56,140
to cause fire at the Lantern Festival,

446
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,820
why was it so coincident?

447
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,660
Why us?

448
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,420
It's my fault.

449
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:08,220
It must be.

450
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,380
If I could have gone back early,

451
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:11,980
it wouldn't

452
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
have happened.

453
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,140
Don't be guilty, Miss Shui.

454
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
I promise

455
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:19,660
to help His Lordship

456
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,940
find out the truth of the fire.

457
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:23,580
Please trust me.

458
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,420
I swear to give you a result.

459
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,180
However,

460
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:30,980
if you meet

461
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,180
this kind of dangerous thing again,

462
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,580
leave it to me.

463
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,260
Don't get yourself injured again.

464
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,500
I didn't think about it
carefully back then.

465
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:50,420
I just

466
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:53,420
wanted to reduce losses.

467
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,500
After all,

468
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:56,860
we all devoted

469
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,260
to Haoxue Cosmetics.

470
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,700
As long as I can do something for it,

471
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:05,180
it's worth it

472
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:06,220
even if my arm gets hurt
or no one wants to marry me.

473
00:24:06,220 --> 00:24:06,820
I do.

474
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,860
I'm...

475
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:27,980
I'm willing

476
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:29,420
to go to all excellent physicians

477
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,700
to cure

478
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:31,900
your arm.

479
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,820
What if they can't cure it?

480
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,380
Then...

481
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:39,940
Then I'll be your arms

482
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:41,460
and under your order

483
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,700
for my whole life.

484
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,500
How about Mr. Ning?

485
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,100
I'll also serve His Lordship

486
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,420
for my whole life.

487
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,180
If I want you to make a choice

488
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,340
between me and him,

489
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,500
who will you choose?

490
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,100
I'll choose...

491
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:07,100
His Lordship.

492
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,860
Nerd.

493
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,860
Ji Man,

494
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:20,220
I...

495
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,900
I want to put this lantern for you.

496
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,180
It was

497
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,740
my fault.

498
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,180
I shouldn't have kept the truth from you.

499
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:40,500
From now on,

500
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,420
I won't keep any secrets from you.

501
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,420

I'm fine.

You lied again.

526
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,020
You said you wouldn't lie to me.

It's the last time.

528
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,020
The last time.

529
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,380
It better be.

530
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:58,940

539
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,260

540
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,460

to deliver the letter to
Bingyan as soon as possible.

00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,700
Yes, Miss Qian.

00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:19,660
Miss.

560
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:20,860
- Everyone.
- Come in and take a look.

561
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:21,580
We have a new discount

562
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,180
and new products.

563
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,940

No.

00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:30,500
Bah.

00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:33,580
Miss Xue,

569
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,140
I've almost become dumb,

570
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:36,900
but no customers enter our shop.

571
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:38,660
Never mind. Go in.

572
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,180
We'll have a way.

573
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,140
We reopened the shop

574
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,460
and have a big discount,

575
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,180
so there should be

576
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,620
lots of customers.

577
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,180
Miss Shui.

578
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:53,220
Where is my lady?

579
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,380
She went to the backyard to prepare.

580
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,660
Miss Shui,

581
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,900
the moment I thought Haoxue Cosmetics

582
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,380
was about to open again,

583
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,420
I was so excited
that I didn't sleep last night.

584
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,020
I was agloat

585
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:08,500
and wanted to work well,

586
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:09,220
but

587
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,180
why are there

588
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,460
no customers?

589
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,940
Calm down.

590
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:14,940
Those ladies

591
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,820
can't know everything in time.

592
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,460
When the news is spread,

593
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,620
I'm sure you'll be busy.

594
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,700
Calm down.

595
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:23,420
Go on with your work.

596
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:28,460
Muxu.

597
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,660
- How is it?
- How is it?

598
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:32,420
Have you informed all ladies

599
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
of the reopening of Haoxue Cosmetics?

600
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,820
Yes.

601
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,860
Miss Huang of Sea Trade Guild,

602
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,740
Miss Xia and Miss Xie
of Jinxuan Pavilion,

603
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,860
and Miss Qiu.

604
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,660
I've met them all.

605
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,340
What did they say?

606
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:46,340
They said they would come here
after finishing their work of this period,

607
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:47,660
but I don't think

608
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,940
they will.

609
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,420
Never mind.

610
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,580
We can't shut everyone's mouth.

611
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,260
I just didn't expect

612
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,420
those ladies

613
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,100
would believe the rumors.

614
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:03,100
Sorry to let you feel wronged, Muxu.

615
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,380
Thank you.

616
00:32:06,860 --> 00:32:07,420
By the way,

617
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:09,260
the fire burnt

618
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:10,660
half of the materials,

619
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,700
so we must

620
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,700
raise money as soon as possible

621
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:13,940
to buy the next materials.

622
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,140
It doesn't matter.

623
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,220
Let's wait for some time.

624
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,900
There must be a way.

625
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,380
Be patient.

626
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,500
Go. Let's go on with our work.

627
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,260
Go.

628
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,460
Miss Wen,

629
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:38,220
no customers

630
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,860
(Haoxue Cosmetics)
go to Haoxue Cosmetics today, either.

631
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,740
It works.

632
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,740
It's working better

633
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,980
than my imagination.

634
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:46,940
She's not powerful enough

635
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:49,340
to be a businesswoman in Haifang.

636
00:32:50,660 --> 00:32:51,220
Miss Wen,

637
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,940
you're very far-sighted.

638
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,420
After

639
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,940
Lianxiang's matter happened,

640
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:56,900
the maids

641
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,340
think it's a shame to use
Haoxue Cosmetics' products,

642
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,660
and the ladies

643
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:02,100
naturally don't dare to use them,

644
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,180
even if

645
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,700
they rarely hang out.

646
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,140
We can't take it carelessly now.

647
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,420
When all women in Haifang

648
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,420
think it's a shame

649
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,940
to use Haoxue Cosmetics' products,

650
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,700
this shop

651
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,100
will go bankrupt.

652
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,940
Someone is here.

653
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,980
His Lordship.

654
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,620
Why are you all

655
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,740
look upset?

656
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:57,220
Your Lordship,

657
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,660
Gui Bai said

658
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,180
he would be my arms,

659
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
and I have something to deal with today,

660
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,340
so I need him for a while.

661
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,140
Go.

662
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:04,420
Let's go.

663
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:13,780
What's wrong?

664
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:15,060
Do you have an idea?

665
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,260
Most materials are burnt,

666
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,500
and no customers come to my shop,

667
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,940
so I only have to

668
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,940
reduce the price.

669
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,060
However, the cost is very high,

670
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:31,140
so if I really reduce the price,

671
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,220
my shop will go bankrupt.

672
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:39,580
Since there are no customers,

673
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:41,820
let's go out

674
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,700
to check

675
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,500
other shops' situations.

676
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,020
No.

677
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:46,820
Let's go.

678
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:48,260
Even if you stay in Haoxue Cosmetics,

679
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,420
no customers will come,

680
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:50,940
so you might as well go out

681
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,500
to see how others run their businesses.

682
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:53,900
I've checked them.

683
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,060
Across from Zuixiang Restaurant,

684
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:56,420
which is the most famous
restaurant on this street,

685
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:57,220
is

686
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,060
Fanjin Garment Shop.

687
00:34:58,220 --> 00:34:59,380
It has the best hand-made clothes.

688
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:00,700
This Liang's Apothecary

689
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:01,580
sells ginseng the best,

690
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,860
and it's limited.

691
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,300
Besides...

692
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,940
You've made many efforts.

693
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:05,700
Let's go.

694
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,940
Sir, a pot of tea.

695
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:08,860
Please come in.

696
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,260
Sit down.

697
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,940
Enjoy yourselves.

698
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,540
Sir,

699
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:28,420
what tea leaves are they?

700
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:29,740
It tastes unique.

701
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:30,500
Miss,

702
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,340
it's not made of tea leaves.

703
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,420
It's Gynostemma.

704
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,900
Its color won't fade

705
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:35,820
after being brewed for
four or six times.

706
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,340
Gynostemma is regarded
as Southern Ginseng,

707
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,900
but it's cheaper than the real one.

708
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,420
You have a good taste

709
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,380
to open your stall

710
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,700
across from the shop

711
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,220
that is the most famous for its ginseng.

712
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
No wonder your business is booming.

713
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,900
Of course.

714
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:49,860
Rich people

715
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:51,620
will buy real ginseng

716
00:35:51,820 --> 00:35:53,060
while poor people

717
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:54,020
have to choose Gynostemma,

718
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,500
whose function is similar to ginseng's,

719
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,620
to replace it.

720
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,980
Enjoy yourselves.

721
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:03,980
Right.

722
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,340
There aren't only celebrities in Haifang

723
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,740
but also ordinary people.

724
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,620
If they

725
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,860
can't afford the Feiwan Face Cream,

726
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,780
they may look for

727
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,540
substitutes that have similar functions.

728
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,220
If you only target at celebrities,

729
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,020
the market is very small and risky.

730
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,700
And only when you can bring benefit

731
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:26,540
to ordinary people

732
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:28,420
will they

733
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:30,420
come to your shop constantly.

734
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,420
In the past,

735
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,980
I only focused on

736
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,580
finding the best shop

737
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,900
while ignoring this problem.

738
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,860
Sang Shen said

739
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,700
the reason why I made
the Scar Recovering Cream

740
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:44,070
was for sailors

741
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:45,340
who got sunburnt.

742
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,740
Therefore,

743
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:48,890
I shouldn't

744
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,940
forget my original aim.

745
00:36:50,380 --> 00:36:51,190
I should offer

746
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,300
all ordinary people

747
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:53,620
with products

748
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,260
they are satisfied with

749
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,700
and like.

750
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:57,420
Am I right?

751
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,260
Yes.

752
00:36:58,980 --> 00:36:59,980
Sometimes,

753
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,740
you just go too fast,

754
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,220
and it isn't bad

755
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,500
to have a stop occasionally

756
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,900
to reflect on yourself.

757
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:18,860
Put them there.

758
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,020
It's enough.

759
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:21,980
You don't need to bring more.

760
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,220
Miss Shui,

761
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,140
what else can I do for you?

762
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,420
Nothing.

763
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,580
Just stand there.

764
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:31,780
Okay.

765
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,540
Gui Bai,

766
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:35,780
why do I live

767
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,340
such a difficult life?

768
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:39,140
After I left home

769
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:40,460
and worked in Shuiyan House,

770
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:41,820
I had to

771
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,380
be obedient to men every day.

772
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:44,620
Now,

773
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,050
I have my own business,

774
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:47,820
and Mrs. Ning trusts me very much,

775
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:49,580
which causes me to think

776
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:51,060
I can change my life.

777
00:37:52,410 --> 00:37:53,460
But I didn't expect

778
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:56,170
Haoxue Cosmetics to be like this

779
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,980
after reopening for several days.

780
00:37:58,140 --> 00:37:58,940
Miss Shui.

781
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,420
Don't look down on yourself.

782
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,420
It's because you're here

783
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,460
that the shop's furnishing

784
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,700
looks much better than the others'.

785
00:38:10,090 --> 00:38:11,780
It just reopened today,

786
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:13,730
and not too many people know that.

787
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm sure

788
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,550
it'll be better and better
in the future.

789
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:22,420
I hope so.

790
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,260
No matter what,

791
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,100
I won't give up.

792
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:28,260
No matter the business is good or not,

793
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,640
the shop needs to

794
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,760
be decorated.

795
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,260
With these flowers added,

796
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:32,900
more customers

797
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,100
will be attracted there.

798
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:36,650
I promised

799
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:37,900
to be your arms,

800
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,990
so I'll do it.

801
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,380
Your...

802
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,190
Your injury.

803
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:44,990
It's okay.

804
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,860
It's much better after
the medicine was applied to it.

805
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:50,940
Just watch me.

806
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:55,380
I'll teach you.

807
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:58,100
Cut it first.

808
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,900
Cut on the bias. Yes.

809
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,580
Match a flower

810
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,980
with a lighter color to it.

811
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:05,860
It looks

812
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:06,980
more beautiful now.

813
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,660
(Formula of the face cream)

814
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,300
Add 50 maces more.

815
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,740
How is it, sir?

816
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:47,940
Madam,

817
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,540
we have Bletilla Striata Powder, beeswax,

818
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:49,980
and Delphinium delavayi Franch

819
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,940
that you want,

820
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,860
but are you sure

821
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,150
you really need that much?

822
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:54,900
Here is the thing.

823
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,710
I'm researching

824
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:56,620
on a new product's formula,

825
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,380
so

826
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,660
I'm not sure

827
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,190
how much I need for each of these.

828
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,700
How about

829
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:03,860
adding 100 maces more for each of them?

830
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:04,740
Okay?

831
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,540
Okay.

832
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:09,460
Take out the money.

833
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:09,940
Okay.

834
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,140
This apothecary has all of them.

835
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,060
Great.

836
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,380
You need to pay

837
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:14,700
25 taels.

838
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,420
Sorry?

839
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,060
25 taels.

840
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,340
How could it be?

841
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:19,940
I think you must make a mistake.

842
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,020
Count the price again.

843
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,100
I didn't make a mistake.

844
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:22,580
Listen.

845
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
200 maces of Bletilla Striata Powder

846
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:24,740
costs eight taels.

847
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,020
Eight taels?

848
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:26,540
Yes.

849
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,140
200 maces of beeswax costs 14 taels.

850
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:29,580
200 maces of Delphinium delavayi Franch
costs three taels,

851
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,740
so it costs 25 taels in total.

852
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,500
It's right.

853
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,420
It can't be that expensive.

854
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:35,020
No.

855
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,740
I helped Her Ladyship

856
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:36,980
to buy beeswax five days ago,

857
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:37,980
and 50 maces of beeswax

858
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,740
cost only one tael.

859
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:39,340
Yes.

860
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:40,260
Why is the price more than a double now?

861
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:41,540
It was the price five days ago.

862
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:43,100
And it changes now.

863
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,540
Well...

864
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:46,380
No.

865
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,140
No, sir.

866
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:48,780
Well,

867
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,420
listen.

868
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:49,980
Although

869
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,700
we're creating a new product,

870
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:52,420
I promise to buy materials

871
00:40:52,540 --> 00:40:53,900
from you

872
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:54,740
after I make it

873
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,700
and sell it well.

874
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,940
Please give me a preferential price.

875
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:57,940
- Yes.
- Okay?

876
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:58,500
Please give us a preferential price.

877
00:40:58,700 --> 00:40:59,620
I'd like to,

878
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,940
but I can't.

879
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,900
I don't care what

880
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:02,860
you buy my medicine for.

881
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:03,780
I'm not responsible

882
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:04,980
for the price in Haifang.

883
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:05,940
If you need them,

884
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,340
pay me 25 taels.

885
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:08,260
If you can't afford them,

886
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,340
I can't help it.

887
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,220
You look down on us, don't you?

888
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:11,820
Don't you know

889
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,500
how rich our lady is?

890
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:13,220
Yes.

891
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:13,860
We're rich.

892
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:14,620
Forget it.

893
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,700
Sir,

894
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:16,620
we'll check other shops.

895
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,220
Thank you.

896
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,300
Just do it.

897
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:19,380
I don't think

898
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:20,020
you can buy them

899
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,220
with a cheaper price.

900
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,940
I can buy your shop

901
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:23,940
with 25 taels.

902
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:24,580
Yes.

903
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:24,980
Never mind.

904
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:25,700
Let's go.

905
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:27,940
He actually wants 25 taels.

906
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,620
Give way for us.

907
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:32,020
My Lady.

908
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:32,820
You're back.

909
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,620
Yes.

910
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,060
How is it?

911
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:34,300
My Lady,

912
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,980
the Bletilla Striata Powder
and beeswax...

913
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,140
Alright.

914
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:37,900
Drink some water, and slow down.

915
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,540
Let me say it first.

916
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,380
Let me say it first.

917
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,620
The prices of Bletilla
Striata Powder and beeswax

918
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,940
are the same

919
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,060
as the apothecary's we just went to.

920
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,420
It seems they have made an agreement.

921
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,020
Yes.

922
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,900
Besides,

923
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:47,980
the prices of Symphytum officinale
and Delphinium delavayi Franch

924
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:48,620
almost tripled

925
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,220
than before.

926
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,580
Yes.

927
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,900
And so is the western street.

928
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,380
Really?

929
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,420
Why?

930
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:58,260
The price of Bletilla Striata Powder

931
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,620
is the same as pearl powder's.

932
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:00,540
I've asked the shop owners,

933
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,580
and they said

934
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:02,260
the price

935
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,580
is decided by the guild.

936
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,220
There is a storm on the sea,

937
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,270
and it's hard to transport
medicine from outside,

938
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:06,900
so

939
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:08,100
they have to raise the price.

940
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,360
They raise the price

941
00:42:10,510 --> 00:42:11,740
because of the storm?

942
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:12,940
My Lady,

943
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
should we buy them or not?

944
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:19,340
Even if we don't use them
in making cream,

945
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:19,940
we have to use them

946
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:20,820
to treat Ning Yuxuan.

947
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,420
However,

948
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:24,420
the price is very high here.

949
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:30,020
Perhaps there is another way.

950
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:32,580
Let's go.

951
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,940
My Lady.

952
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:36,540
How is it?

953
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,380
(Guo's Apothecary)

954
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:38,300
My Lady.

955
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:38,780
How is it?

956
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:39,460
Surely enough,

957
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,420
two maces of Licorice Powder
costs only 15 pence.

958
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,540
I said

959
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:43,940
this apothecary's price
is cheaper than the others'.

960
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,380
Great.

961
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:49,420
Sir,

962
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,080
something happened.

963
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:53,700
Move.

964
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,340
Close the shop.

965
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:54,540
Okay.

966
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:54,940
Close the shop.

967
00:42:55,060 --> 00:42:55,540
Leave.

968
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,380
- Hurry up.
- Leave, everyone.

969
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:57,220
We're closing today.

970
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,140
We're closing today.

971
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:58,740
We won't sell herbs today.

972
00:42:58,740 --> 00:42:59,840
(Closed)
I'm sorry.

973
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:00,620
- We won't sell herbs today.
- No?

974
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,340
Why, sir?

975
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,300
Sir,

976
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:03,540
we're still in queues,

977
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:04,220
and why do you close the apothecary?

978
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:04,900
Yes.

979
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,580
You all know

980
00:43:05,580 --> 00:43:07,380
the herbs' price in Haifang rose.

981
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,420
The reason why I sell them
with a cheap price

982
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:09,780
is for poor people's good,

983
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,420
but the guild knows that,

984
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:12,420
and they're going to

985
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:13,820
close down my apothecary.

986
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,740
Please understand me.

987
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:16,420
Please leave.

988
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:18,900
- Sir.
- Sir.

989
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,540
- Sir.
- Please sell more.

990
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,100
Sir,

991
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:22,020
my daughter is seriously ill.

992
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,420
I beg you, sir.

993
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,260
What about our materials?

994
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,300
What about those poor people?

995
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:27,540
Mother.

996
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,140
My child is seriously ill, sir.

997
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,820
I beg you.

998
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,420
I really can't afford

999
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,700
other shops' herbs, sir.

1000
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,780
Sir.

1001
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:35,180
Muxu.

1002
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,300
Please, sir.

1003
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,260
How many taels do we have now?

1004
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:38,300
Here they are.

1005
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,540
Sir.

1006
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,120
- Madam.
- What should I do?

1007
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:45,270
Take these taels.

1008
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,540
They should be enough
to buy the herbs for your child.

1009
00:43:47,340 --> 00:43:48,340
Get up now.

1010
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:49,020
Thank you.

1011
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,020
You're so kind.

1012
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:52,500
I can save my child. Come on.

1013
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:53,460
Thank this lady.

1014
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,100
Thank you.

1015
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,460
Don't delay time. Go.

1016
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,780
You're so generous.

1017
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,260
But My Lady,

1018
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,940
how about the materials?

1019
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,300
Compared to us,

1020
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:06,100
these people

1021
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:06,860
who can't buy the herbs they want

1022
00:44:06,940 --> 00:44:08,140
are the really worried ones.

1023
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:10,340
I have to think about a way.

1024
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,300
How dare the Sea Trade Guild

1025
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,620
use the excuse of

1026
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,520
the difficult transportation?

1027
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:17,380
Yes.

1028
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:21,780
Transportation?

1029
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:24,300
