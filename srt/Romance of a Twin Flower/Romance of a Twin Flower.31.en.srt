=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,440
It's so satisfying to

4
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,440
watch them getting mad

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,720
but not being able to do anything to me.

6
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,640
I have never let

7
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,390
Nie Sangyu suffer before.

8
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:55,000
The more depressed she is now,

9
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,230
the happier I am.

10
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,590
I will definitely not let

11
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,110
her and Ning Yuxuan have an easy time.

12
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,280
I will make them repay me

13
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:02,750
for the pain

14
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:03,950
they have caused me.

15
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,350
That's all?

16
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,470
I got you out of jail

17
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,790
and gave you a new identity

18
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,560
to make them pay back double.

19
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:19,720
Remember to live up to the trust in you

20
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,870
from His Highness and me.

21
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,160
It is my luck

22
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,120
to have your help.

23
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,120
I will never forget that

24
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,470
you saved me

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,560
when I was at my worst.

26
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,750
In a few days,

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,630
you will leave for Haifang.

28
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,520
How are things going?

29
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,590
Your Highness.

30
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,590
I have two strings to my bow.

31
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:52,840
One,

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
continue to recommend

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,240
the firm we support

34
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,630
to win the first place
in the Imperial Supplier Contest.

35
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,960
Two,

36
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,030
disrupt the order of
the Imperial Supplier Contest

37
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:02,870
and let Ning Yuxuan

38
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,190
be accused of incompetent governance.

39
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:05,520
In this way,

40
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,790
even if the Shipping Department

41
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:07,960
can proceed smoothly,

42
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,910
the position in charge

43
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
will never be his.

44
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,720
Which firm are you going to recommend?

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm still thinking about it.

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,910
I've gotten in touch with most of them.

47
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,400
These well-known firms

48
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,680
either seek profit

49
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,120
or

50
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:22,680
power.

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
These people are mercenary,

52
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,350
and of course they are unreliable.

53
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,310
I thought about it for you.

54
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,030
Instead of pinning your hopes

55
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,960
on them,

56
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,630
it is better to prop up

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,070
someone completely on our own side.

58
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,120
Someone on our own side?

59
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,120
I have a younger sister

60
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,560
who married far away to the frontier
in the early years

61
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,440
and had little contact with me.

62
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:47,750
A few days ago, I heard that

63
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,590
her daughter Princess Ruyue

64
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,310
disappeared in a sandstorm

65
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,190
and hasn't been found yet.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,400
I'm afraid she's dead.

67
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,470
Princess Ruyue

68
00:03:58,470 --> 00:03:59,870
was born in the frontier.

69
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,590
I never met her.

70
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,560
Now I feel it a pity.

71
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:08,870
After all, she has the title of princess.

72
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,440
If she marries into a powerful family
in the future,

73
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,030
she can be of use to me.

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:17,030
Your Highness, do you mean

75
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,960
to find someone
to replace the princess

76
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,470
and be a member of us

77
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:22,520
to participate
in the Imperial Supplier Contest?

78
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,590
The key is

79
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,160
(Methods of the Sima)
who can replace her.

80
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:35,350
I

81
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,080
do have

82
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,880
a perfect candidate.

83
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,760
Ning Yuxuan

84
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:52,280
treated you so badly.

85
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,280
You know him?

86
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:03,670
Did His Lordship ask you to save me?

87
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,640
Save you?

88
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,640
You are still fantasizing about him.

89
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,160
No wonder

90
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,200
you've fallen to where you are now.

91
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:13,990
Wen Wan.

92
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:15,670
You don't know me.

93
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,960
My name is Ling Jianxing.

94
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,230
You are Mr. Ling.

95
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,640
I saved you.

96
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,430
Otherwise,

97
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:28,550
you would have died of illness
in prison.

98
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,280
So...

99
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,550
Do you understand

100
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:34,110
why I saved you?

101
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:38,550
Thank you.

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,200
Thank you for saving me.

103
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,880
So what do you want me to do?

104
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,760
When you were in such a situation,

105
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,400
did Ning Yuxuan ever

106
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,590
say a word for you?

107
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,400
Did he ever have

108
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,030
any affection for you?

109
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:55,840
He has no affection for me at all.

110
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,230
I ended up like this

111
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,200
because of him and that vicious woman.

112
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:07,030
And

113
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,200
even if I did anything wrong,

114
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,550
they forced me to do so.

115
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,880
I'll give you two options.

116
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:19,280
Listen to me

117
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,520
and work for me.

118
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,720
I promise.

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,720
I promise you will live a life

120
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,720
with more dignity than before.

121
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,200
And Tanxiang, the maid

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,080
who was escorted to the capital with you.

123
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:29,960
I will also

124
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,590
find a new way out for her.

125
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,640
I can do it.

126
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,520
But

127
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,430
if you still have

128
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,790
a little affection for Ning Yuxuan,

129
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
and you are unwilling

130
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,790
to do anything against him,

131
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,880
take it as if I never came.

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,550
I'll have someone

133
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:48,640
send you back to jail right away.

134
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,350
No. No. No.

135
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:51,520
Mr. Ling.

136
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:52,910
Mr. Ling, don't go.

137
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,430
I can make it.

138
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:55,430
I can definitely make it.

139
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:57,550
Please trust me.

140
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,470
If you want to deal with Ning Yuxuan,

141
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:00,400
I would do anything

142
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,430
for you.

143
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:04,320
Since you saved my life,

144
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,280
I will definitely not let Ning Yuxuan

145
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,720
and that vicious woman
have an easy time.

146
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,550
And

147
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,230
I've lived with them

148
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,640
for so long.

149
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,840
I will tell you everything

150
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,880
you want to know.

151
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:23,760
Not for me,

152
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,160
but for us.

153
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,320
Get well soon.

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,640
Soon

155
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,590
you will meet

156
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,910
Ning Yuxuan again.

157
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,550
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

158
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,350
Thank you, Mr. Ling.

159
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,550
Greetings to Your Highness.

160
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,230
She is about the same age

161
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:16,400
as Ruyue.

162
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,990
And she's good in bearing.

163
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:23,230
This girl's name is Wen Wan.

164
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:24,550
She will become

165
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,030
your powerful weapon.

166
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,990
With the help of the princess status,

167
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,080
winning the first place
in the Imperial Supplier Contest

168
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,030
will be a piece of cake.

169
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,760
In the future, she will be in charge

170
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:34,670
of Haifang's trade,

171
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:37,830
and Haifang will still belong
to Your Highness.

172
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,600
I wonder

173
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,790
why can Miss Wen

174
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,790
be worthy of the title of princess.

175
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,360
I have been proficient in lyre-playing,
chess, calligraphy and painting since childhood,

176
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
and my demeanor

177
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,240
will never show my slip.

178
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,950
I am from a family of merchants,

179
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,430
and I have been influenced

180
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,400
by the way of doing business
since I was a child.

181
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,910
I must be more suitable

182
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,880
to run Haifang's business
than ordinary women.

183
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,550
I am the person

184
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,910
who knows Ning Yuxuan best,

185
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,950
and I know enough about

186
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,480
Nie Sangyu, the vicious woman.

187
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,480
Once you know yourself
and the enemy,

188
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:20,640
you will win with one blow.

189
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:26,790
What's more,

190
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,120
I have a blood feud
with the Ning family.

191
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,070
I will never give up
until I take revenge.

192
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,880
I am willing to swear with my life

193
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,670
that I will never let Your Highness down.

194
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,360
Enough.

195
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,670
Take

196
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,000
the conferment document.

197
00:09:58,190 --> 00:09:59,310
Thank His Highness.

198
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,830
Greetings to Uncle.

199
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:06,190
I will do my best

200
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,950
to win the Imperial Supplier Contest.

201
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,760
Hold on.

202
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:12,540
(Conferment Document)

203
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,070
Don't be in a hurry to call me Uncle.

204
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:22,310
Call me that

205
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,480
when you become the chairwoman.

206
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,600
I've never

207
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,950
seen you before.

208
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:35,480
And you.

209
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,240
Take it.

210
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:42,140
(Conferment Document)

211
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:55,400
I came from an ordinary family.

212
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:57,310
After I married Ning Yuxuan,

213
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:58,790
I was just a concubine.

214
00:10:58,790 --> 00:10:59,670
I didn't expect

215
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,070
to be favored by you

216
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:02,430
and His Highness now.

217
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,310
What I should do

218
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,640
when I return to Haifang this time

219
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,400
is all at your command.

220
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,790
Here is the regulation
of this competition.

221
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:15,160
Simply put, three steps in total.

222
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:17,360
The primary competition
is about skills.

223
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,360
(Notice of Imperial Supplier Contest to All Firms)
All firms

224
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,670
compete with

225
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,400
their best products.

226
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,360
The secondary competition

227
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:24,430
is about production capabilities.

228
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:25,790
Hand over the specified goods

229
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:27,000
within the specified time

230
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,520
to prove that your productivity

231
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:30,280
as an imperial supplier.

232
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,640
The final challenge is creativity.

233
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:34,240
The one with the highest score

234
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,710
after all selections wins.

235
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,710
At the same time,

236
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,830
the Emperor will appoint

237
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,480
the chairman of
the Sea Trade Guild of Haifang.

238
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,360
Mr. Ling, don't worry.

239
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,280
I will definitely not lose to
Haoxue Cosmetics

240
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:51,240
in the selection of balsam.

241
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,480
Do not underestimate the enemies.

242
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,910
In addition to Haoxue Cosmetics,

243
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:56,950
there are many firms

244
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,640
from other places participating.

245
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,000
I will try to

246
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,070
draw in

247
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,120
as many firms as possible.

248
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,400
Whether it is balsamic cosmetics

249
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,830
or tea and medicine,

250
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,790
we need people on our side.

251
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:11,240
Buy so many stores at once

252
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,070
for our own use.

253
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:14,030
Mr. Ling, you're so generous.

254
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,550
But

255
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,950
Ning Yuxuan wouldn't notice it,
would he?

256
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,830
Ning Yuxuan?

257
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,640
He's probably overwhelmed right now.

258
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,950
Don't you know?

259
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:33,000
Ning Yuxuan and Nie Sangyu

260
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,240
have been at odds recently.

261
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:36,640
Nie Sangyu has already moved out.

262
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,000
I've sent someone to
keep an eye on them.

263
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
At this moment,

264
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,910
rumors of emotional discord

265
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,670
should be very detrimental

266
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:49,000
to Ning Yuxuan's reputation.

267
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,760
You're addressing him

268
00:12:57,030 --> 00:12:59,360
without an honorific title now.

269
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,310
I am a princess.

270
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,360
Ning Yuxuan

271
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,600
is just a petty official.

272
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,480
What I call him is justified.

273
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:17,380
(Notice of Imperial Supplier Contest
to All Firms)

274
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Everyone.

275
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,030
All guests who

276
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:19,790
come to Haoxue Cosmetics today

277
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,880
will be given a flower,

278
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,950
no matter how much they spend.

279
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,240
So today

280
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,520
you may have to work harder.

281
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:26,640
At the end of the month,
I will give everyone a wage increase.

282
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,550
- Great!
- Great!

283
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:29,880
Even if we don't get a raise,

284
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,000
we'll work hard.

285
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:31,710
Right?

286
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,160
- Yes.
- Yes, exactly.

287
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,190
We agreed to

288
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,430
deal with the enemy together.

289
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,240
No matter what trick she uses,

290
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,190
we can solve it.

291
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,240
So we have to be on guard

292
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,280
to ensure the smooth operation

293
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,280
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

294
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,550
Also,

295
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:44,520
never let her approach

296
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,880
any items and ingredients.

297
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:47,030
Don't worry, My Lady.

298
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:47,950
I've got a few

299
00:13:47,950 --> 00:13:48,790
reliable workers

300
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,070
to watch over the warehouse.

301
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:50,760
Your Ladyship.

302
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:51,240
I think

303
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,190
another security guard

304
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:53,030
should be hired to watch the lobby.

305
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:53,550
Okay.

306
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,400
You are so thoughtful.

307
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:56,830
It's always right

308
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,760
to be careful.

309
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,190
Okay, let's get to work.

310
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:01,550
- Yes.
- Okay.

311
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:02,310
Let's go.

312
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:08,480
Welcome.

313
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,860

Buy anything to get a free flower.

314
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,480
Let's take a look.

315
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,160

Take your time.

I want all of them.

Have a try.

I will come back, Qingqing.

Sir, spare me.

Sir.

352
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,830
Sir, spare me.

353
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,190
I'll give you whatever you want.

354
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,400
Sir, please spare me.

355
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,070
Say it.

356
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:52,710
Why were you

357
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:53,830
pestering Miss Shui

358
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:54,640
from Haoxue Cosmetics just now?

359
00:15:54,790 --> 00:15:56,430
I didn't pester her.

360
00:15:56,430 --> 00:15:58,120
I knew Qingqing.

361
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,240
Qingqing?

362
00:15:59,310 --> 00:15:59,880
Yes.

363
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,240
Why do you call her that?

364
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,790
Sir, spare me.

365
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,310
Sir.

366
00:16:09,710 --> 00:16:10,950
Sir, it's my fault.

- I promise.
- Piss off.

373
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:20,910
Don't let me see you again.

Okay.

375
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,030
I am leaving.

00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,550
How do you know, Your Lordship?

384
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,480
I was also followed this morning

385
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:01,830
when I went out.

386
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,550
I walked around the street

387
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:04,230
and came back.

388
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:05,950
Maybe the spies

389
00:17:06,360 --> 00:17:07,470
are still nearby.

390
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:10,160
How dare someone

391
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
follow you two?

392
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:13,560
I'm going to catch them now.

393
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,160
Come back.

394
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,990
It should be that Ling Jianxing

395
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:20,800
or Wen Wan

396
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:22,750
told that

397
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,040
we are at odds with each other,

398
00:17:24,270 --> 00:17:25,360
so they sent spies.

399
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,270
What are you going to do about it?

400
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,470
Since they want to see,

401
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,510
let's show them.

402
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:39,640
Dad.

403
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:50,320
Why is he here?

404
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,430
Mr. Ning said that

405
00:17:52,430 --> 00:17:53,430
spies have been following you

406
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,800
for the past few days.

407
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,320
I'm afraid

408
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,560
someone is looking into

409
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,800
your discord.

410
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,400
Spies?

411
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,710
Recently I also found out

412
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,270
about some men in black
snooping on the road.

413
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,670
I will figure it out.

414
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,360
The Transport Commissioner
of the Imperial Supplier Contest this time

415
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,430
is Ling Jianxing.

416
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,190
He has always been

417
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:14,160
at odds with me in court.

418
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:16,880
And somehow,

419
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,710
Wen Wan also returned to Haifang

420
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:21,080
and became a princess.

421
00:18:22,190 --> 00:18:23,400
You mean

422
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,320
the spies were sent by Ling Jianxing?

423
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:25,950
Yes.

424
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,950
Ji Man has the title of the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate.

425
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,470
If the Emperor finds out that

426
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,600
we are not in harmony,

427
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,240
it will be a felony for both me and her.

428
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,670
So I'm here

429
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,080
with the hope that

430
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,640
we can put on a play.

431
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:53,160
Let her stay at the Magistrate's Residence

432
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,640
for a few days.

433
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:05,510
I don't think it's necessary

434
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,270
to go back to the Magistrate's Residence.

435
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,670
After all...

436
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,710
After all, I've left there.

437
00:19:10,710 --> 00:19:11,640
It's weird for me to go back.

438
00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,040
After the Imperial Supplier Contest,

439
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,990
I promise to stay away from Ji Man.

440
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,470
It happened out of a sudden.

441
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:26,800
Everyone.

442
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,840
Please think about it.

443
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:43,400
In this case,

444
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,600
for Man's safety,

445
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,880
I agree with you

446
00:19:46,990 --> 00:19:48,400
to take her back to
the Magistrate's Residence temporarily.

447
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:49,270
Dad...

448
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,160
Man.

449
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
I know what to do.

450
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,800
It's just

451
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:53,710
you can't

452
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,190
control her for the rest of her life

453
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:56,910
with her status as second-rank lady
with imperial mandate.

454
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,640
Sir, you are right.

455
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,400
After the Imperial Supplier Contest,

456
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,560
you have to

457
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,640
announce Nie Sangyu's death.

458
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:13,910
Only in this way

459
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,400
can Man get rid of all these completely.

460
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,270
Okay.

461
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,640
I will do what Mr. Ji said.

462
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:27,880
Sang Shen, Muxu.

463
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:29,510
Pack up the luggage for Man.

464
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:31,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

465
00:20:35,670 --> 00:20:36,430
Ning Yuxuan.

466
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:37,840
Since we are acting

467
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,560
for outsiders,

468
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,430
I hope we can

469
00:20:46,270 --> 00:20:47,800
keep a good balance between us.

470
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,080
I also hope

471
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,360
you don't interfere with me too much.

472
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,560
Okay.

473
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,430
I won't do this.

474
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:00,360
Mr. Ji.

475
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,230
Chief Yuan.

476
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:08,710
Miss Ji.

477
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:14,360
I...

478
00:21:17,670 --> 00:21:18,840
I'll wait for you outside.

479
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:31,950
Be careful

480
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:33,190
after you return to
the Magistrate's Residence.

481
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,840
I know, Dad.

482
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,190
Princess Ruyue has been busy
these few days

483
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,510
decorating the shop,

484
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:46,270
selecting workers

485
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,160
and socializing with the bosses
of various firms.

486
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:51,160
Didn't she go to see Ning Yuxuan?

487
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,190
Not a single time.

488
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:55,950
She does have a sense of propriety.

489
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,840
I chose the right person.

490
00:21:59,230 --> 00:21:59,800
Also,

491
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:00,800
Nie Sangyu

492
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,190
did live in Ship Guihai before.

493
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,230
But last night

494
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,360
Ning Yuxuan went to Ship Guihai

495
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,080
with a gift

496
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,430
and took her back
to the Magistrate's Residence.

497
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,270
The spies said that

498
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:10,190
Ning Yuxuan seemed to

499
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:10,880
have offended Nie Sangyu

500
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:12,120
because of love affairs.

501
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:13,190
But last night

502
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:14,270
the two made peace.

503
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,990
Sir.

504
00:22:17,430 --> 00:22:18,750
Shall we continue to keep an eye on him?

505
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,190
If Ning Yuxuan keeps being disloyal

506
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
and makes her wife want to divorce him,

507
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,710
as soon as the scandal is spread,

508
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,670
I will immediately inform against him.

509
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,430
Yes.

510
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,910
Take a look.

511
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:36,560
Thank you

512
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,670
for acting with me on the street.

513
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,710
They are in front of us.

514
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:58,800
Sugar-coated haws.

515
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,840
Darling.

516
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:00,800
Look.

517
00:23:00,950 --> 00:23:01,710
The Imperial Supplier Contest

518
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:03,120
drove the competition in the market.

519
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:04,600
Even the sugar-coated haws
are bigger than before.

520
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,120
How much does it cost?

521
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,160
Three pennies for each bunch.

522
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:07,910
I want one.

523
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,040
Three pennies.

524
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,910
We want one.

525
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:12,880
Okay, choose one yourself.

526
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,910
Which one, dear?

527
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,990
Let me see.

528
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,510
This one.

529
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:19,400
Okay.

530
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,080
Okay.

531
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:23,710
Here.

532
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:24,470
Thank you.

533
00:23:26,230 --> 00:23:27,230
Sugar-coated haws.

534
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,040
Look, there is more sugar

535
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,160
than before.

536
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,560
I haven't eaten yet.

537
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,470
Just buy one for yourself.

538
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:37,470
But I just want to eat

539
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:38,800
the one you hold.

540
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,600
You are so annoying.

541
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,120
There are so many people here.

542
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,080
How could I eat it after you did?

543
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,750
I don't care.

544
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:51,320
So disgusting.

545
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,120
Eat it yourself.

546
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,840
I don't want to eat it.

547
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,910
I'm going back to Haoxue Cosmetics.

548
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:56,080
I will go with you.

549
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:56,640
It's not far away.

550
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,910
I don't need you.

551
00:23:57,910 --> 00:23:58,510
I will be with you.

552
00:23:58,510 --> 00:23:59,320
Stay away from me.

553
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,190
I will get close to you.

554
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,600
Don't follow me.

555
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,430
I just want to follow you.

556
00:24:02,430 --> 00:24:03,990
Stop clinging to me.

557
00:24:03,990 --> 00:24:05,230
I have to cling to you.

558
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,270
Mr. Ling.

559
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:11,800
Mr. Ning.

560
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:12,400
Mr. Ling.

561
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,950
Mrs. Ning.

562
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,400
What a coincidence.

563
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,910
Are you shopping too?

564
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,040
I can't relax

565
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,230
as you do.

566
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,270
I came to check

567
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,270
the order of the market.

568
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,430
It looks like

569
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm not doing my job.

570
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,320
Dear.

571
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:31,840
How about

572
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:33,470
you go back to

573
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,750
Haoxue Cosmetics first?

574
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:37,040
I will buy you

575
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,120
the hairpin I promised you yesterday

576
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:38,880
after I finish my work.

577
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,120
No way.

578
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,470
That's limited.

579
00:24:41,470 --> 00:24:42,670
I've been choosing for a long time.

580
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:43,840
What if it is bought

581
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:44,360
by someone else?

582
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,190
Well...

583
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:47,320
How about I buy you three?

584
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,840
No way, you broke your promise.

585
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,400
I didn't. I will buy you three.

586
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,750
Buy it for me.

587
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,190
You've promised me.

588
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:55,950
Why did you break your promise?

589
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:56,320
I came here

590
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,990
especially today.

591
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,560
Why don't you keep my company?

592
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,710
- Look, you...
- Mr. Ning.

593
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,910
Just be with Mrs. Ning.

594
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,510
I'm just going on a casual inspection,

595
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,910
and you don't need to be with me.

596
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,230
Mr. Ling.

597
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:12,950
Thank you.

598
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:14,320
Mr. Ling.

599
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:15,840
I'll borrow

00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,600

00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,750

Shall we

604
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:33,190
go to buy the hairpin now?

605
00:25:33,910 --> 00:25:34,880
No need.

606
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:39,560
The play is over.

607
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:41,880

Let me send you there.

It's quite close.

610

They've left.

649
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,710
the first time we watched the stars

650
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,750
was on the way to Haifang.

in addition to a star called Shenxiu,

658
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,270
there is another called Shangxiu.

Let's expose her identity

761
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,820
soon after Yuxuan finds out her details.

762
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:29,940
Your Ladyship.

763
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:30,420
Gui Bai.

764
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:31,210
Your Ladyship.

765
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,500
Why are you here?

766
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:36,940
His Lordship sent someone

767
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,060
to the capital to investigate.

768
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,730
Wen Wan fell ill on the way,

769
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:41,090
so she died shortly after

770
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,340
arriving in the capital
and being detained.

771
00:34:44,570 --> 00:34:45,900
As expected.

772
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:47,690
The Wen Wan who is now in Haifang

773
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,570
is the princess who holds

774
00:34:48,570 --> 00:34:50,210
the conferring document.

775
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,020
Someone is protecting her identity,

776
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,460
so no flaws can be found
for the time being.

777
00:34:53,610 --> 00:34:55,290
She came back in such a capacity

778
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:56,860
to open a cosmetic shop

779
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:58,210
and to participate in
the Imperial Supplier Contest.

780
00:34:58,610 --> 00:34:59,500
She must have been up to
something evil.

781
00:34:59,690 --> 00:35:00,980
We have to be careful.

782
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,610
No matter who she is,

783
00:35:05,420 --> 00:35:06,540
I'd like to see

784
00:35:07,650 --> 00:35:08,650
what she can come up with

785
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:10,460
better than Feiwan Face Cream.

786
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,140
(Joy Cosmetics is opening.
Welcome all distinguished guests.)

787
00:35:26,510 --> 00:35:27,160
Sangyu.

788
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,770
Mr. Tao.

789
00:35:31,650 --> 00:35:32,900
Why are you here today?

790
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,940
The Imperial Supplier Contest
is approaching.

791
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,770
I came to take a look.

792
00:35:37,290 --> 00:35:38,130
Where is Qingyun?

793
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:39,340
Didn't she come with you?

794
00:35:40,570 --> 00:35:41,420
I have no idea.

795
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:43,020
Is there anything

796
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:44,340
I can do for you?

797
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:44,980
And

798
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:46,540
you can come to me

799
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,650
when you are free.

800
00:35:48,570 --> 00:35:49,210
Don't worry.

801
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:50,460
Everything is going well.

802
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,610
And

803
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,770
everyone is very confident

804
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,210
in the Imperial Supplier Contest.

805
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:55,770
Sangyu.

806
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,210
Don't overwork.

807
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,570
Take a good rest.

808
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:03,940
Have a seat.

809
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:12,860
Here, Mr. Tao.

810
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:13,650
Thank you.

811
00:36:21,460 --> 00:36:22,770
What do you think of Qingyun?

812
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,570
She...

813
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
She's good.

814
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,820
Look.

815
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,650
You have been getting along
with each other for some time.

816
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:33,730
And she's serious to you.

817
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:35,020
So

818
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:36,820
as her sister,

819
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,020
I want to ask about
your feelings for her.

820
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:39,420
I don't have any affection

821
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,460
for Qingyun.

822
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,110
Do you hate her?

823
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:51,290
She is your sister.

824
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:52,820
How can I hate her?

825
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,940
Look.

826
00:36:56,210 --> 00:36:57,170
How about

827
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,690
you start getting along

828
00:36:58,690 --> 00:36:59,460
as good friends

829
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,540
at first?

830
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:01,610
Actually,

831
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,540
after the two are together
for a long time,

832
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,500
they may...

833
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,090
Sangyu.

834
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,090
Do you think it's okay

835
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:11,650
for me to be with her?

836
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,170
I think you are

837
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,090
a perfect match.

838
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,250
I'm not pushing you.

839
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,540
Resonance between a couple

840
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,860
is also important.

841
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,940
It's just that during
this period of time,

842
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,540
I realized that

843
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:36,460
if you meet a good one,

844
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,020
don't miss it.

845
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,730
Cherish the one by your side.

846
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:00,610
So...

847
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:01,090
Sangyu.

848
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:01,650
Actually, I...

849
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,420
Sangyu.

850
00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,290
Qingyun.

851
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:06,900
Come here.

852
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:08,090
Come on.

853
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,340
We are talking about you.

854
00:38:10,130 --> 00:38:11,130
General Tao.

855
00:38:12,090 --> 00:38:13,130
What are you talking about me?

856
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,130
We were saying that

857
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,570
my sister has a good eye.

858
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,610
I also think General Tao is reliable.

859
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,900
You have to take the chance.

860
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:26,170
Sangyu.

861
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,290
I want to be alone

862
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,380
with General Tao for a while,

863
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,290
is that okay?

864
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,020
Look at me.

865
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,650
I have something to do.

866
00:38:34,650 --> 00:38:35,500
I will leave you alone.

867
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:36,940
Thank you, Sangyu.

868
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,460
Come on!

869
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:46,170
General Tao.

870
00:38:46,770 --> 00:38:47,290
Take a seat.

871
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,540
By the way,

872
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:54,770
it occurred to me that
I also have something to do.

873
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,730
I am leaving.

874
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:57,060
General Tao.

875
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:03,130
General Tao.

876
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:04,820
You said before that

877
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:06,060
you have someone you like.

878
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,460
Who is she?

879
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,420
I have explained to you before...

880
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,250
Don't!

881
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
I don't believe it at all.

882
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,570
General Tao.

883
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:23,460
Qingyun.

884
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,570
I said

885
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:27,170
don't call me like that.

886
00:39:37,650 --> 00:39:38,770
This is the tea

887
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,060
I brought from the capital.

888
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,060
Chief Yuan.

889
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,340
Take a try.

890
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,570
Mr. Transport Commissioner,

891
00:39:46,610 --> 00:39:47,610
what's the matter?

892
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:49,690
Chief Yuan, easy.

893
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:51,340
I invited you here today

894
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,610
not to talk about official business,

895
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,340
but to catch up on the old days.

896
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,730
It's out first meeting.

897
00:39:57,210 --> 00:39:58,460
What do you mean by
catching up to the old days?

898
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:00,340
Although you and I

899
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,380
just met for the first time,

900
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:03,460
we have

901
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:05,130
good friends in common.

902
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:06,980
For example,

903
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,980
Shen Liancheng.

904
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:11,940
He

905
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:14,210
was my good friend.

906
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,770
Shen Liancheng

907
00:40:16,770 --> 00:40:18,380
pleaded guilty after being caught

908
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:19,420
red-handed by Mr. Ning.

909
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:21,170
You should catch up on the old days

910
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,570
with Mr. Ning.

911
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,290
It is related to the past
of the Tea Gang.

912
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,730
Mr. Ning has always hated the Tea Gang.

913
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,060
I dare not mention it to him.

914
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:34,340
What does the Tea Gang

915
00:40:34,340 --> 00:40:35,210
have to do with the Dragon Gang?

916
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,860
Chief Yuan, don't play dumb.

917
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,770
When Shen Liancheng was the chief,

918
00:40:41,770 --> 00:40:42,980
he told me clearly

919
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,060
how many people under him

920
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,940
were old members

921
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,500
of the Tea Gang.

922
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:47,500
Now

923
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:48,460
these people

924
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,980
are your subordinates.

925
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,570
If I tell Mr. Ning

926
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:53,170
about this,

927
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:54,860
guess

928
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:56,860
what he will think.

929
00:40:57,170 --> 00:40:59,290
What does it matter to me
what he thinks?

930
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:00,690
I'm not interested

931
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,020
and don't want to know.

932
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:05,820
If there is nothing else,

933
00:41:06,090 --> 00:41:07,210
I have to go.

934
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,210
Chief Yuan.

935
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,940
No worries.

936
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:13,170
I asked you here to discuss business.

937
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:22,170
You must have heard that

938
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,820
Ning Yuxuan and I

939
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,540
are not fellows at all.

940
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:28,690
This time, some foreign merchant ships
will enter the wharf.

941
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,020
I want you to

942
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,690
keep an eye out for these
merchant ships for me.

943
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,770
In this way,

944
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:35,380
Ning Yuxuan

945
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,340
would lose his prestige.

946
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,290
Mr. Ling.

947
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,650
Did you know that

948
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,020
the charges of the Dragon Gang
are very high?

949
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,570
Can you afford it?

950
00:42:00,820 --> 00:42:02,020
This is the deposit.

951
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,020
