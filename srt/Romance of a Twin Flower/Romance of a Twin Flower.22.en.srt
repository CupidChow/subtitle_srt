00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 22=

3
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,180
I am afraid

4
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:52,170
you are going to lose this.

5
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,380
Mr. Wang, hold on.

6
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,820
Victory or defeat

7
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,100
is not yet

8
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,740
decided.

9
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,300
Mr. Ning, pirates are coming.

10
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,500
Let's go.

11
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,580
Who are you?

12
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,900
How dare you rob the taels?

13
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:39,860
Your Lordship.

14
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,940
Mr. Wang ordered

15
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,900
that we should

16
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,340
pick all the taels up
as soon as possible.

17
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,860
Hurry up.

18
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,900
Move.

19
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:02,860
Move.

20
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:06,180
Move.

21
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,500
Come on.

22
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,740
Hurry.

23
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,660
Oh, no.

24
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,180
Move.

25
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:40,900
Put all the taels

26
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,980
to the deck.

27
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,060
Come on.

28
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:43,980
Hurry up.

29
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:44,660
Move.

30
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,220
Sir,

31
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,220
here are all the taels.

32
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:53,060
Please check.

33
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:53,900
Wang Jinyao,

34
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,510
you should stop pretending now,

35
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,310
shouldn't you?

36
00:04:58,900 --> 00:04:59,780
Am I right,

37
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,620
Chief Yuan?

38
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,540
Mr. Ning,

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,620
you're very smart.

40
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,860
However,

41
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,780
if you're over-intellectual,

42
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,780
you'll ask for trouble.

43
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,460
Ning Yuxuan,

44
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,420
Haifang

45
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,340
could live without Shen Liancheng

46
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,660
but couldn't live
without the Sea Trade Guild.

47
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,980
How dare your wife
transport cargo privately?

48
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,860
She affected

49
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:41,540
the goods' prices,

50
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,660
and you

51
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,660
tried every method

52
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,340
to break the Guild's rules.

53
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,060
Even if I can let you go,

54
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,980
my superiors

55
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,420
can't.

56
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,420
You

57
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,180
are not experienced enough.

58
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,100
Listen,

59
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:57,040
since you took the initiative

60
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,620
to escort the taels,

61
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,860
you couldn't live

62
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,340
after boarding the ship.

63
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,780
Chief Yuan,

64
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:04,620
kill him.

65
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,860
Yuan Lang,

66
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,540
since you and the Dragon Gang

67
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,460
did such a dirty thing for others

68
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,460
in the disguise of pirates,

69
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,460
do you think you can get away from it?

70
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,300
The court is ordering powerful armies

71
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,100
to encircle and suppress pirates.

72
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:23,220
You robbed the taels for him,

73
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,980
and he will

74
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,420
use the Dragon Gang as scapegoats.

75
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,860
Ning Yuxuan,

76
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,660
it's not time

77
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,980
to make mischief between us.

78
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,180
You know nothing.

79
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,060
Nothing at all.

80
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,100
I cooperate

81
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:46,660
with Chief Yuan,

82
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,420
so how could I sell him out?

83
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,060
Chief Yuan, don't worry.

84
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,300
I've already made plans.

85
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,100
Take them here.

86
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,620
Chief Yuan,

87
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,660
I recruited

88
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:00,780
these men

89
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,540
from the villages near Haifang

90
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:03,460
in the excuse of

91
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,900
hiring workers.

92
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,220
If you kill them now

93
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,660
and change their clothes

94
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:09,540
into pirates',

95
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:10,860
the Dragon Gang

96
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,100
won't get involved in this case,

97
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,540
and the problem will be solved.

98
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,540
Do you plan to use these villagers

99
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,780
as pirates?

100
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,100
Don't worry.

101
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,860
I always do this,

102
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,780
and nothing has happened.

103
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,460
Mr. Wang,

104
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,860
it's a good idea.

105
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,780
Even so,

106
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,100
I need you to help me.

107
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,900
Only in this way

108
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,460
can my plan work smoothly.

109
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:41,660
Look,

110
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:44,740
Mr. Ning

111
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,860
is a man of rectitude.

112
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:49,740
If he dies for protecting the taels,

113
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,980
it's meaningful,

114
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:53,100
isn't it?

115
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:01,460
Since it has become like this,

116
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,220
everyone has to be killed.

117
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,220
Only in this way can
all later trouble be spared.

118
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,180
Don't move.

119
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:33,540
Mr. Ning,

120
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,900
you're smarter than me.

121
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:38,180
You're the winner.

122
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,060
Yuan Lang,

123
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:44,700
how can you sell me out?

124
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,860
Although

125
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,620
I'm not righteous,

126
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:47,940
I won't

127
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,460
use villagers

128
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:51,220
as pirates,

129
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,420
neither will

130
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,220
the Dragon Gang.

131
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,300
I can

132
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,060
give you

133
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,220
all the taels

134
00:08:58,220 --> 00:08:59,580
as long as you can spare my life.

135
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,300
Wang Jinyao,

136
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:04,980
do you think

137
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,740
I will really use them to bet?

138
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,940
Look, Mr. Wang.

139
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,940
The taels

140
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,420
are being escorted

141
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,700
to the capital now.

142
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,340
We've already

143
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,740
had a plan for this matter.

144
00:09:32,340 --> 00:09:32,980
Kneel.

145
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,300
I wonder

146
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:42,460
why you come to me at night, Mr. Ning.

147
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,300
I come

148
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
for the robbery of the taels
at the Mid-Autumn Festival.

149
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,460
What do you mean?

150
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,500
You've met

151
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,340
Liu's Village's women.

152
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,980
Do you know

153
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,980
where their husbands went?

154
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,980
They are just

155
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,820
fishermen

156
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,220
or casual labors.

157
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,940
They are used as scapegoats.

158
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,700
Make it clear.

159
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,580
Haifang's taels for contribution
are robbed constantly

160
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,100
and couldn't be found.

161
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,460
However,

162
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,340
pirates are always used as scapegoats.

163
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,860
Don't you feel strange?

164
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,580
Do they just wait

165
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,620
to be caught without doing anything?

166
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,740
Why are the criminals always pirates?

167
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,420
So do you mean the pirates

168
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,980
who robbed Haifang's taels

169
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,700
and were arrested

170
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,500
were innocent people?

171
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,940
That's what Wang Jinyao

172
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,500
has been doing during these years.

173
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,180
Mr. Ning,

174
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,840
why did you tell me

175
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,700
this thing?

176
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,100
Chief Yuan,

177
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:43,580
Wang Jinyao won't

178
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,420
stop killing innocent people of Haifang

179
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,460
until he's arrested.

180
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,500
I doubted

181
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,420
if you worked for him before,

182
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:49,700
but it

183
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,980
matters to innocent people,

184
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,460
so I wanted to talk to you.

185
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,700
Do you really

186
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
want to work for this kind of person

187
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:57,060
with the Dragon Gang?

188
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,100
Sorry to disturb you.

189
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:13,820
Wait.

190
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,580
Wang Jinyao indeed

191
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:16,500
negotiated a deal with me.

192
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,060
He asked me to rob the official ship

193
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
at the Mid-Autumn Festival

194
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,980
in the disguise of pirates.

195
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,580
After you finish robbing,

196
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,220
he will

197
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,620
kill those innocent people
who he has prepared

198
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,300
and disguise them as pirates.

199
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:33,820
And this thing

200
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,940
has to be done by you.

201
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,940
Only then can he totally make you

202
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,820
obedient and be used by him.

203
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,620
If you don't trust me,

204
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,060
you can do as you planned

205
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,300
on the day of escorting the taels.

206
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,500
By then,

207
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:54,580
my words can be proved.

208
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,580
I just want

209
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,620
to help the Dragon Gang make a living,

210
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,180
and I won't

211
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,500
kill innocent people,

212
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,740
nor do I think it's worth it.

213
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,460
Are you willing to work with me

214
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:11,620
to arrest him?

215
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,180
Chief Yuan.

216
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,100
I need to board

217
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,700
to make the final check
before going out to sea,

218
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,220
and I have to take
some materials with me.

219
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,700
After we arrive in the capital,

220
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,620
I'll hand this case

221
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,580
over to Court of Judicial Review.

222
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,420
You made contributions to this case,

223
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:38,300
so why don't you

224
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,700
go to the capital with me

225
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:40,820
to help the Dragon Gang gain

226
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,460
a reputation of helping with the case?

227
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,100
Thanks for your kindness,

228
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,100
Mr. Ning.

229
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,340
I helped with the case
not for rewards or fame,

230
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,740
nor to help you.

231
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,420
I just didn't want

232
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:49,700
the innocent people to suffer.

233
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:51,980
Okay,

234
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:54,300
since you refused me,

235
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:56,460
I won't force you.

236
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,700
I just didn't expect you

237
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:58,980
to change those villagers

238
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:00,060
into your men.

239
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,460
If I had

240
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,420
killed you,

241
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:04,940
would I have ended up

242
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,980
like Wang Jinyao?

243
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,940
Everything needs to have a plan B.

244
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,340
I believe you'll understand me.

245
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,700
Besides,

246
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,740
it seems you also tried your best

247
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,700
to kill me.

248
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,580
Since we were acting,

249
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:20,220
we had to make it real.

250
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,700
Moreover,

251
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,980
you didn't get hurt, did you?

252
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,180
Die with me!

253
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:34,860
Watch out!

254
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,460
There are bombs in the boxes!

255
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,340
Get away from me.

256
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:42,860
Dear!

257
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,700
Ms. Nie!

258
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:48,220
Ji Man!

259
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:50,740
Ning Yuxuan!

260
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:33,220
(Are you confessing to me now?)

261
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:33,620
(Right.)

262
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,940
(You look like my Mr. Right.)

263
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,060
(You are my Mr. Right.)

264
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,940
(But I've never regarded you)

265
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,220
(as Nie Sangyu.)

266
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:39,980
Ji Man, I hate you.

267
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,980
(Since I'm Ji Man,)

268
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,500
(I should go to my home.)

269
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,820
It's open!

270
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:45,700
The shop is finally open!

271
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,460
(Those I hurt)

272
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,580
(will never forget)

273
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,580
(how I hurt them.)

274
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,580
They will never forget

275
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,860
the mistakes I made.

276
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,980
It's not your fault.

277
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,340
Whose fault is that then?

278
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,700
It's my fault. I'm sorry.

279
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,220
(To us,)

280
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,340
(we'd best end up)

281
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,180
(with separation.)

282
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,100
(You're my husband,)

283
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:03,220
(and you should support me.)

284
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:03,820
(You like me, don't you?)

285
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,740
(When I was bullied,)

286
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,220
(where were you?)

287
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:05,860
(I'll never)

288
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:06,420
(sleep on the same bed with you.)

289
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,820
(Why should I permit you to go back?)

290
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,860
(Nie Sangyu.)

291
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,460
(You made a mess in Ning's Mansion,)

292
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,620
(and it's unforgivable.)

293
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,340
(Yuxuan.)

294
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,980
(Do you think)

295
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,980
(I really look like)

296
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,580
(Nie Sangyu?)

297
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,300
- Good.
- Good.

298
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,060
(Half a year ago, capital)

299
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,700
- Wonderful!
- Good!

300
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:28,180
Do it again!

301
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,460
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

302
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,500
Good. One more!

303
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:43,700
Great!

304
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,180
Bravo.

305
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,860
I bought it there.

306
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,220
It's at the end of the street.

307
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:51,620
- Let's go.
- I'll go, too.

308
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:55,900
(Ji Man)

309
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,300
What do you think?

310
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:22,700
Do I look good?

311
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,100
Yes.

312
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,340
You have good taste, Miss.

313
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,580
This texture is called Linglong Silk,

314
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:30,100
which is precious and rare.

315
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,220
There are only two pieces
of this clothing in the capital

316
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,060
and could only be bought from me.

317
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,300
I'm lucky.

318
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,420
I don't think you're local

319
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,460
judging from your accent.

320
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,460
Are you new?

321
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,980
I came for someone,

322
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,580
who

323
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,580
is very important to me.

324
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,300
The one you love, right?

325
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:51,460
How do you know that?

326
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,820
I'm experienced.

327
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:54,700
Your eyes are smiling

328
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:55,740
and you look shining,

329
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:58,100
and I can tell that at the first sight.

330
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:02,820
It's quite obvious, isn't it?

331
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:10,020
(After I met you the first time,)

332
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:12,020
(four years have past)

333
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,940
(before)

334
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,700
(I got up the courage to come to you.)

335
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,540
(Today,)

336
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,220
(I'm going to let you know that)

337
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,700
(there's a girl named Ji Man)

338
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,500
(who has been loving you
for a long time.)

339
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,980
(In order to see you,)

340
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,860
(she's been really hard-working.)

341
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:28,860
Madam,

342
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,740
I want both of them.

343
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,700
Unfortunately,

344
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,460
another one

345
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,700
was booked by the First Lady
of Marquis Moyu's Mansion

346
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,620
a few days ago.

347
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,500
She said

348
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:37,700
she wanted to wear it at the wedding.

349
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,700
Wedding?

350
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,700
Shouldn't she wear
red clothes at the wedding?

351
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,980
You don't know that.

352
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,420
His Lordship

353
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,660
is going to marry his second wife today,

354
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,460
and the First Lady,

355
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:49,700
who is vixenish and jealous,

356
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,220
insists to wear white clothes.

357
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,420
She just wants to

358
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,900
embarrass the bride, doesn't she?

359
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,940
Marquis Moyu, who is handsome,

360
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,780
is very pitiful.

361
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,500
Why did he marry

362
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,900
such a troublesome wife?

363
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,700
I'm afraid

364
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,540
something is going to happen
at the wedding today.

365
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:06,900
Marquis Moyu?

366
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,700
Which one do you refer to?

367
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,700
There is

368
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,380
only one Marquis Moyu.

369
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,460
Ning Yuxuan,

370
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,900
the Left Consul.

371
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:18,620
Is...

372
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,620
Is he going to get married today?

373
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,020
Yes.

374
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:26,740
Miss, don't forget your bag.

375
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,500
Thank you.

376
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:33,460
(Ning's Mansion, Marriage)

377
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,860
He's getting married?

378
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,020
And he even marries two wives.

379
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:11,860
I can also do that.

380
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,460
I can tell Ning Yuxuan

381
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,700
that I want to be his third wife.

382
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:23,700
No.

383
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,860
No.

384
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:27,780
I must be crazy.

385
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,660
I'm a principled person,

386
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:31,420
so how could I be his third wife?

387
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,020
My husband

388
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,980
could only love me.

389
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,740
That's what I have been doing
during the four years.

390
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,180
I've been loving only him all the time.

391
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,460
During these four years,

392
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,980
I've been missing him

393
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,420
and telling him every day

394
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:42,220
to wait for me.

395
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,380
I've promised to leave the capital

396
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,460
and go to Haifang to you

397
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:46,420
because I want to tell you personally

398
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,420
that I've never stopped loving you.

399
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,660
Yes.

400
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,660
I should

401
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:00,180
raise up the cup

402
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,180
and tell him what I think.

403
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,980
Hi, Ning Yuxuan.

404
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,300
I'm Ji Man,

405
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,260
and I like you.

406
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,220
But you are married now,

407
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,980
so I want to congratulate you.

408
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,980
Congratulations

409
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,220
on your marriage.

410
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,060
I hope you and your wives

411
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,420
could love each other

412
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,220
and live a happy life

413
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,140
forever.

414
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,140
Hope you'll never separate.

415
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,140
Never...

416
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,780
Right.

417
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,060
I should tell him that.

418
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,500
Ning Yuxuan,

419
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:46,460
I know we're destined

420
00:20:46,460 --> 00:20:47,660
to be apart in this life.

421
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,420
- But even so...
- Stop.

422
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,140
I'll...

423
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:50,980
Stop running!

424
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,540
Stop!

425
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,940
Stop running!

426
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,540
Stop!

427
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,220
Stop!

428
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:06,740
Stop running!

429
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,380
- Did I see it wrongly?
- Stop!

430
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:10,180
Stop!

431
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:12,060
- Why does she look...
- Stop running!

432
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:13,700
Hurry.

433
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,570
Stop.

434
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:38,900
Stop running.

435
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,700
Go.

436
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,660
Stop.

437
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:44,420
Stop.

438
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,700
- Hurry.
- Stop running.

439
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
Nie Sangyu!

440
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,700
How is she?

441
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,540
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

442
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:33,660
Her Ladyship is weak,

443
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,220
and after being in water

444
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,420
for a long time,

445
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:37,780
I'm afraid it's not easy
for her to get better.

446
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:40,020
She needs to take time

447
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:41,940
to rest and recuperate.

448
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:43,740
Why did Her Ladyship suffer so much?

449
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,460
She was scared to faint and got injured.

450
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,300
She's really

451
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,860
experienced too much.

452
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:52,540
His Lordship returned last night?

453
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:55,500
It was so fast.

454
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,940
He didn't only return

455
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,220
but also returned

456
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,220
with Her Ladyship in his arms.

457
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,020
Her Ladyship

458
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,700
seemed to have got injured

459
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,060
and was in a coma.

460
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,700
How is she now?

461
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,980
The physician just checked on her

462
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:24,980
and said she was fine.

463
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,380
Fine?

464
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:29,140
If so,

465
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,460
why hasn't she woken up yet?

466
00:24:33,020 --> 00:24:34,740
I'm sorry, I didn't take care of her
well enough.

467
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,700
Let me do it.

468
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,460
Where is her medicine?

469
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,020
Sang Shen is decocting it.

470
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:44,900
It will be finished soon.

471
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:14,380
(Ji Man,)

472
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:16,980
(please wake up.)

473
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,900
(The longer you're in a coma,)

474
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,940
(the more I suffer.)

475
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,180
Marquis Moyu

476
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,220
is outstanding.

477
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
It was he

478
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,980
that took charge of building the wharf.

479
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:31,700
Yes.

480
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,940
Thanks to Mr. Ning,

481
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:33,700
the wharf is built.

482
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:34,860
From now on,

483
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,260
it'll be more convenient for us.

484
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:37,220
I heard

485
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,980
Marquis Moyu kept a low profile

486
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,420
and did many good things secretly

487
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:41,380
during the period

488
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,380
of building the wharf.

489
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,180
He's young and promising.

490
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:44,700
We'll

491
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,980
live a good life in the future.

492
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:46,900
Yes.

493
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:54,660
I'm sorry.

494
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:57,500
It's my fault.

495
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,060
I shouldn't have been cheated

496
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,780
by your pretending toughness,

497
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:05,660
nor should I have

498
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,700
believed your tricks

499
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,220
and put you into danger.

500
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:28,220
I want you

501
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,620
to be by my side forever.

502
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,700
I can't let you get injured again

503
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,060
because of me.

504
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,420
So please wake up.

505
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,380
I promise to make up for you.

506
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,020
Please wake up.

507
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,940
Dear.

508
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,500
Dear.

509
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,220
Dear.

510
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:14,420
Your Lordship.

511
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,540
You must be starving

512
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,620
after guarding Her Ladyship

513
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,300
for a long time.

514
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,260
I've prepared porridge and side dishes.

515
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:26,900
Please eat some and take a rest.

516
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,620
I'll guard Her Ladyship.

517
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:29,860
Go back now.

518
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,700
I can't feel assured
no matter who guards her.

519
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,500
Your Lordship,

520
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:37,460
look at Her Ladyship's face.

521
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,260
It's very red.

522
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,700
Does she have internal injuries?

523
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,700
Call the physician now.

524
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,460
Yes.

525
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:44,900
Muxu.

526
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:45,620
Dear.

527
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,500
Muxu.

528
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:49,620
- My dear.
- Are you awake, Your Ladyship?

529
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,460
I'm here.

530
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:50,780
Dear.

531
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:51,980
Stop shouting.

532
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:54,460
I was woken up

533
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,300
by your loud voice.

534
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,940
Was...

535
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,420
When

536
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,740
did you wake up?

537
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:11,980
Did you

538
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:14,420
hear what I said

539
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,220
just now?

540
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,060
It's good that you're awake.

541
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:26,900
How do you feel?

542
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:27,980
Do you feel uncomfortable?

543
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,140
Do I need to call the physician?

544
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,380
It's good that you're fine.

545
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
It's good that you're fine.

546
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,020
Don't worry.

547
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,860
I'll keep guarding you tonight

548
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:38,860
and won't go anywhere.

549
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,220
You must be starving

550
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:40,940
after sleeping for such a long time.

551
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,700
I prepared the braised haliotis

552
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,700
- and bacon.
- She just woke up.

553
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,540
How could she eat

554
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:45,620
such greasy foods?

555
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:46,060
Muxu,

556
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,700
cook something light

557
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,460
for her now.

558
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,460
No need.

559
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,220
I...

560
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,500
Yuxuan,

561
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,460
I...

562
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,140
I want to eat noodles cooked by you.

563
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,780
Noodles cooked by me?

564
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,980
Okay. Wait for me.

565
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,140
I'm going to cook for you.

566
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:14,740
Miss Wen.

567
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,220
What can I do for you, Your Lordship?

568
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,660
Go back.

569
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,900
Don't disturb her from resting.

570
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:27,540
Rest yourself, Sangyu.

571
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,940
I'm leaving.

572
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:43,260
Your Ladyship, I'm so glad you're awake.

573
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,180
I'm fine.

574
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:49,660
Muxu,

575
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:51,380
ask Sang Shen here for me.

576
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,980
I can take this chance

577
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:53,900
to see if she has finished
decocting the medicine or not.

578
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,220
(I've remembered everything.)

579
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,420
Have you got any news from Miss Ji?

580
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,420
Don't worry, Chief.

581
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,420
I've asked around,

582
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,980
and Miss Ji has woken up.

583
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:34,020
Fortunately, she's fine.

584
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:37,220
Otherwise,

585
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:39,700
I would be very guilty.

586
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,060
Chief, it's not your fault.

587
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:43,220
Our plan

588
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,420
could have killed two birds
with one stone,

589
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:45,940
but Lackey Ning ruined it.

590
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:46,860
He shouldn't have asked Miss Ji

591
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,980
to board.

592
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,460
It was

593
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:50,700
extremely dangerous.

594
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,460
Yes.

595
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,460
No matter Lackey Ning

596
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,780
did it on purpose or not,

597
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:56,460
he shouldn't have
asked Miss Ji to board.

598
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,060
Chief, if you had been him,

599
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:58,740
it would have

600
00:30:58,740 --> 00:30:59,900
never happened.

601
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:07,620
I thought

602
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,220
Miss Ji would be more
and more indifferent

603
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,260
to Lackey Ning

604
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,740
after knowing

605
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,860
she wasn't Mrs. Ning.

606
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:14,180
Why do I feel

607
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,700
they are

608
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,980
much closer now?

609
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:19,700
Chief,

610
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:21,260
why don't we kidnap

611
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,980
Miss Ji?

612
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,940
Although it's not
appropriate for you to do that,

613
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:23,740
we can do it.

614
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,260
We can't let Miss Ji

615
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,940
marry a bad man.

616
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:29,460
Hu's words were vulgar but right.

617
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,060
Chief,

618
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,980
if we delay taking action,

619
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,180
you'll regret it.

620
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,420
(I must)

621
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:39,700
(save Miss Ji first.)

622
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:48,980
Mr. Ning,

623
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,140
why are you here?

624
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,700
Ji Man is awake,

625
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:52,980
and she wants noodles cooked by me.

626
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,140
She's awake?

627
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,060
How is she?

628
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:55,900
She...

629
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,460
She wants noodles cooked by you?

630
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,980
Oh, no.

631
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,140
She hasn't become dumber

632
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,700
after the accident, has she?

633
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,660
I have to check on her now.

634
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:08,620
You shouldn't curse her.

635
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,420
She's very good.

636
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,140
This...

637
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,780
Thank you.

638
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,220
To be honest,

639
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:49,300
you really

640
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,220
treat her well,

641
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:51,900
but why are you

642
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,980
so hostile to me?

643
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,500
As maids,

644
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,980
we don't dare to be hostile to masters.

645
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,900
I just feel wronged for Miss Ji.

646
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,420
She has someone she loves,

647
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:00,900
but she has to...

648
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:04,460
Someone she loves?

649
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:07,980
Have you seen him before?

650
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,860
Of course

651
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,540
not.

652
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,060
But according to Miss Ji's description,

653
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,380
he's the most perfect man

654
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:17,220
in the world.

655
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,220
Is he?

656
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:20,740
What else do you know?

657
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,540
Tell me that.

658
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:24,420
Miss Ji said

659
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,420
the man she loved

660
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,460
was a tall and handsome gentleman.

661
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,460
He has delicate skins,

662
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:35,740
big eyes,

663
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:38,020
and a sharp nose.

664
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:47,540
However,

665
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:49,020
his face doesn't matter at all.

666
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,300
What matters the most

667
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,220
is that the man she loves

668
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,220
is ambitious and loves the people.

669
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,420
I think

670
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,620
that's me.

671
00:33:58,020 --> 00:33:58,980
Mr. Ning,

672
00:33:59,180 --> 00:33:59,860
you're

673
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,220
flattering yourself.

674
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,980
The man Miss Ji loves

675
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:04,220
is modest and polite,

676
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:05,300
which is

677
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,940
superior to you very much.

678
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,780
Modesty, politeness,

679
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,580
and ambitiousness

680
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,300
can not be compared

681
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,660
to a bowl of warm noodles
before sleeping no matter how.

682
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,620
Noodles.

683
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,940
What's this?

684
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,340
God,

685
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,340
please help Miss Ji

686
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,140
to restore her memories
as soon as possible

687
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,460
so that she won't need to eat

688
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:36,900
this kind of trash.

689
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:39,980
Well, I...

690
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,340
Your Lordship.

691
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,100
Your Lordship.

692
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,660
Her Ladyship said

693
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,020
she could be cared for by Sang Shen.

694
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,260
You must be tired after
guarding her for a long time,

695
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,260
so please go back to rest now.

696
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:50,380
No, I'd better...

697
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:52,540
Better...

698
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,340
Let me do this.

699
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:01,980
Don't move.

700
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:16,740
Your Lordship.

701
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:19,420
Your Lordship.

702
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,380
My Lady.

703
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:33,460
You shouldn't get up.

704
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,380
Lie down now.

705
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,820
Why do you serve the noodles in person?

706
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:39,780
You should have let Sang Shen do this.

707
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:41,020
I...

708
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:44,420
I want to watch you eat them.

709
00:35:47,260 --> 00:35:48,060
What?

710
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,540
Are you afraid I'll be disobedient?

711
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:50,580
No.

712
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:51,980
I...

713
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,940
It's hot.

714
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,820
Look at you.

715
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:59,020
You haven't rested well

716
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,100
after taking care of me
during these days.

717
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:02,460
Go back now.

718
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,620
I...

719
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,540
I won't eat the noodles
unless you go back.

720
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:13,420
Okay, I'll go back to rest.

721
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,020
Don't be burnt

722
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,780
when eating the noodles.

723
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:18,980
Rest well.

724
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,460
I'll visit you tomorrow.

725
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,940
Sang Shen,

726
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,060
take care of her.

727
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:25,820
Yes.

728
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,460
Goodbye.

729
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,580
My Lady,

730
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:53,300
you'd better not eat them.

731
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,980
I feel distressed for you.

732
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
Why?

733
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,820
I think they're delicious.

734
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,420
Sang Shen,

735
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:12,420
come here.

736
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,500
Sit down.

737
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,460
It's me.

738
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,060
What do you mean, My Lady?

739
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:29,380
You don't

740
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,580
get your brain hurt again, do you?

741
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,020
I mean it's me.

742
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,540
I'm your Miss Ji.

743
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,860
I'm Ji Man.

744
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:37,500
Of course I know you're Miss Ji.

745
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,500
Miss Ji?

746
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,380
My Lady,

747
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:46,860
you've restored your memories, right?

748
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:50,060
Exactly.

749
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,140
Do...

750
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:52,620
Do you remember

751
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:53,380
why

752
00:37:53,380 --> 00:37:54,460
I became your maid?

753
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,300
Of course I do.

754
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,780
Your parents died when you were young,

755
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:57,980
and you went to Haifang

756
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:58,660
at nine.

757
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,940
You were discovered
when stealing chicken and eating it,

758
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,860
and I saved you.

759
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,820
From then on, I kept you by my side

760
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:02,980
and treated you to chicken

761
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,820
for three months.

762
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,340
You still vomit

763
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,380
when seeing chicken now.

764
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:06,060
What do we

765
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,180
always do

766
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,420
every time Ship Guihai

767
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,980
stops at a wharf?

768
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,660
We eat the local foods.

769
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,100
The more ordinary a restaurant is,

770
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,300
the more delicious its foods are.

771
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:14,460
What do you

772
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:14,860
hate the most?

773
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,900
Taels.

774
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,780
I feel annoyed

775
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,420
because there are
too many taels to spend.

776
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,340
What do you

777
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:18,860
like the most?

778
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:19,860
Sun,

779
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,780
stars, and moon.

780
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,460
It's because they

781
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,260
can't be bought by taels,

782
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:23,420
and are precious.

783
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,860
My Lady.

784
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
My Lady,

785
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,940
you've finally restored your memories.

786
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:32,540
You remember who I am.

787
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:33,540
It's me.

788
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:35,260
I miss you so much, My Lady.

789
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,660
It's me.

790
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:38,660
You've always been by my side,
haven't you?

791
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,500
It's different.

792
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,820
It's just different.

793
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,420
Well,

794
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,780
My Lady,

795
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,260
what happened

796
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,620
between you and Nie Sangyu?

797
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,820
It's a long story,

798
00:38:57,940 --> 00:39:00,780
and what matters the most now

799
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:04,060
is the man I love.

800
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,180
The man you love?

801
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:08,900
Do you remember him?

802
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,300
Who is he?

803
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,460
Have you declared your love to each other?

804
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,460
Where is he?

805
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:13,820
I...

806
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:17,340
I found him,

807
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,860
but...

808
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:25,420
But...

809
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
Gui Bai,

810
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,260
do you think

811
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:34,540
she

812
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:35,980
and he

813
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,620
have watched

814
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,620
the starry sky before?

815
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:46,460
Who are

816
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:48,900
she and he?

817
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,540
(Mr. Ning,)

818
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,380
(you're)

819
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:54,660
(flattering yourself.)

820
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,100
(The man Miss Ji loves)

821
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,380
(is modest and polite,)

822
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,460
(which is)

823
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,980
(superior to you very much.)

824
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:01,780
What nonsense

825
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,980
am I thinking about?

826
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:04,820
What matters the most now

827
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,980
is to let Ji Man get recovered.

828
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,780
You're right, Your Lordship.

829
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,460
After Her Ladyship gets recovered,

830
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,460
her memories

831
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,020
will be recovered gradually.

832
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,460
Gui Bai,

833
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,060

834
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,140
