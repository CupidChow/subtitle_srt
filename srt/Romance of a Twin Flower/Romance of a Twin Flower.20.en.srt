=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,120
(Magistrate's Residence)

4
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,720
Her Ladyship

5
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,080
is studying a new product's formula

6
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,490
and has been buying its materials

7
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,880
in the market recently.

8
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:53,520
You're not exposed, are you?

9
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:54,490
No.

10
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:55,800
That's good.

11
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:57,960
We've agreed not to disturb her

12
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,850
when she's studying the formula.

13
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:00,520
But Her Ladyship seems

14
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:01,880
not to focus on the new formula.

15
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,360
She investigated
some kinds of medicine

16
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,800
that were in the shortest supply

17
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:06,130
and returned to Ship Guihai.

18
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:06,770
And then

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,040
two chief officers

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,290
went to sea separately.

21
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,810
I think

22
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:13,250
Her Ladyship wanted

23
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,200
to take some medicine back

24
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,250
when making the materials for the cream.

25
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,370
I didn't expect she had such a plan.

26
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,880
The cargo

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,410
needs to be checked at the wharf

28
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:27,640
before entering Haifang, right?

29
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,250
The wharf

30
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,720
is controlled by the guild,

31
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,810
and most people who are
responsible for checking populations

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,410
are bribed

33
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:33,600
by Wang Jinyao's men.

34
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:35,200
However, Chief Yuan

35
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,480
also bribed some of them.

36
00:02:37,250 --> 00:02:38,160
Speaking of this,

37
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:39,480
we haven't met him officially,

38
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,010
have we?

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,290
- Okay.
- Come on.

40
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:47,480
- Come on.
- Hurry up. Come on.

41
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:49,570
I'll do it myself.

42
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:50,970
I'll do it myself.

43
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:51,810
Come on.

44
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,040
I've been keeping an eye on Yuan Lang

45
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,810
under your order.

46
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:57,410
He's the chief

47
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,530
of the Dragon Gang now.

48
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:04,810
Go.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,760
Let's meet him.

50
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,760
We haven't met each other
for a few days

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,720
and have to know each other again.

52
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:17,690
Chief Yuan.

53
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,920
You're well-informed, Mr. Ning.

54
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:20,850
What's wrong?

55
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:22,850
Do you come to inspect the wharf?

56
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,370
The Dragon Gang's business

57
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,040
is getting better and better.

58
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:29,920
Many people of the Dragon Gang

59
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,410
need to make a living,

60
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,040
and I'm trusted by them,

61
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,370
so I can't slack.

62
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,320
It's good to reorganize
the Dragon Gang,

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,600
but don't seek instant
success and quick profits,

64
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,250
in case you'll follow the same
old disastrous road as Shen Liancheng.

65
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,850
What's wrong with your arm?

66
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,690
I was cut

67
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:55,920
by Shen Liancheng's men
at Magistrate's Residence.

68
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:56,720
It doesn't matter.

69
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:58,600
What a coincidence.

70
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:00,290
When Shen Liancheng died,

71
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,760
we found a Tea Gang's tattoo

72
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,160
on his arm.

73
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,010
It was on his right arm's...

74
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:09,640
It was in the same position

75
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:11,200
as your injury.

76
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,370
They look exactly the same.

77
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,200
Are you doubting something, Mr. Ning?

78
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,520
Since Shen Liancheng was
one member of the Tea Gang,

79
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:26,050
I think there must be his complices

80
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,760
who have the same tattoo

81
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,440
in the Dragon Gang.

82
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:32,730
Mr. Ning,

83
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,810
I don't understand

84
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,320
the Tea Gang in your words,

85
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:37,930
but aren't you hotheaded

86
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,760
to define a group of people

87
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,050
just because of one person?

88
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,730
I hope you can

89
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,170
prove your innocence.

90
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,490
What if my arm

91
00:04:58,840 --> 00:04:59,760
doesn't have a tattoo?

92
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,280
If so, I'll apologize to you.

93
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,570
And you should promise

94
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,320
that you'll never disturb anyone

95
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:05,520
of the Dragon Gang.

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,520
Deal.

97
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:09,760
Okay.

98
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,010
Chief.

99
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,490
It's okay.

100
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,200
Mr. Ning,

101
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,400
you could see

102
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,130
our chief

103
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,490
doesn't have a tattoo as you said.

104
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,440
Have you seen enough, Mr. Ning?

105
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:15,880
Sorry to offend you.

106
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:19,200
Please forgive me, Chief Yuan.

107
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:24,680
His injury is strange.

108
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,080
Chief, it's...

109
00:06:29,690 --> 00:06:30,930
The tattoo is the last memory

110
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,370
the Tea Gang left to me.

111
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,280
I destroyed it

112
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,490
for fear that

113
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,880
Ning Yuxuan would find evidence.

114
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,840
How is your process?

115
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,130
Since Yuan Lang

116
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,760
took over the Dragon Gang,

117
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:44,080
the wharf

118
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,050
has been more orderly.

119
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,370
I didn't find

120
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:47,520
suspicious deals

121
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:48,930
except

122
00:06:49,010 --> 00:06:49,880
the transportation of cargo.

123
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,170
Your Lordship,

124
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,050
should we continue
keeping an eye on him?

125
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,250
I always feel

126
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,810
he wants to hide something.

127
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,640
Continue keeping an eye
on him for some time.

128
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:03,200
Yes.

129
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:06,930
Have you heard

130
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,050
Xiajiu House

131
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,200
sells herbs at half the price of ours?

132
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:09,810
What?

133
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,730
How could it be?

134
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,960
They can't sell herbs
at such a cheap price.

135
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,520
Yes.

136
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:13,960
What should we do?

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,280
Go.

138
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,170
Let's go to Mr. Wang.

139
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,200
- Okay. Let's go.
- Go.

140
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,740
(Guo's Apothecary)

141
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:35,250
Mr. Wang,

142
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,080
you should think of a way.

143
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:38,320
Mrs. Ning

144
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,080
got a ship of herbs.

145
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:40,010
She didn't only use them herself

146
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,690
but also gave some

147
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,930
to Xiajiu House.

148
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,010
Their medicine's price

149
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,050
is very low.

150
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,490
Yes, Mr. Wang.

151
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,200
Some people of the guild

152
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:48,490
even went to their shop
in the disguise of poor people

153
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:50,080
in order to buy cheap herbs.

154
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,490
Let's use the same way.

155
00:07:52,010 --> 00:07:52,690
Break the apothecary.

156
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,400
Break it?

157
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,010
Well,

158
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,130
it's not good, isn't it?

159
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,760
But people

160
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:57,690
from Magistrate's Residence

161
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,250
patrol the apothecary every day,

162
00:07:59,370 --> 00:07:59,760
so we can't

163
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,280
be too brazen.

164
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:03,250
Yes, Mr. Wang.

165
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,440
Since Mrs. Ning could disturb
the medicine's market,

166
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,170
she may also do it
to the food market.

167
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,760
She wants to

168
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:09,130
ruin our businesses.

169
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:09,880
Yes.

170
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,010
He's right.

171
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,130
What if she...

172
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,200
What should we do?

173
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,730
What should...

174
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,370
Enough.

175
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,320
All cargo's prices

176
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,520
are decided by our guild

177
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:20,490
during these years,

178
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,520
so you shouldn't have been panicked

179
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,080
because of some ships of herbs.

180
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,690
I won't allow anyone

181
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,960
to ruin our guild's interests.

182
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:33,210
Mr. Ning,

183
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:34,450
you must support us.

184
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,450
Yes, Mr. Ning.

185
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:36,280
If it continues,

186
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:37,090
we will

187
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,450
go bankrupt.

188
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:40,130
Please support us, Mr. Ning.

189
00:08:40,280 --> 00:08:41,760
Please support us, Mr. Ning.

190
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,880
Please support us.

191
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:44,760
What are you doing?

192
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,400
What are you doing?

193
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:46,730
Be quiet.

194
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,640
Do you need to

195
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:48,640
go to Magistrate's Residence

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,920
to bother Mr. Ning
with such a small thing?

197
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:50,730
Wait.

198
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:52,760
Mr. Wang,

199
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,920
are they all from your guild?

200
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:57,130
Yes.

201
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,560
Why do they come here?

202
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,010
They come

203
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:01,640
for your wife.

204
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,560
My wife?

205
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,560
Mr. Ning,

206
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,640
please forgive me to be outspoken.

207
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:12,160
Our guild was established
a long time ago,

208
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:13,730
and we're responsible

209
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:15,400
for all goods' prices.

210
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,640
However,

211
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,520
your wife

212
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,250
got a batch of herbs secretly

213
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,680
and sold it privately.

214
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,160
She disturbed the market's order,

215
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,210
and owners of apothecaries

216
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,800
feel really wronged.

217
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,640
That's why

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,040
they have to

219
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,760
come here to ask you for justice.

220
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:32,760
Please support us, Mr. Ning.

221
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:35,330
Please support us, Mr. Ning.

222
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,610
How powerful my wife is

223
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:40,090
to make you ask for justice.

224
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:41,130
Mr. Ning,

225
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:44,040
it's our guild's responsibility

226
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:46,130
to defend Haifang's
businessmen's interests,

227
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,680
and prices

228
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,520
are also decided by our guild

229
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,400
before taking effect by businessmen.

230
00:09:52,090 --> 00:09:52,680
Only in this way

231
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,760
can we steady Haifang's market.

232
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,010
But your wife

233
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,760
broke the rule,

234
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,730
and many cheap herbs

235
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,520
seriously affected

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,450
the medicine market of Haifang.

237
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,730
Many businessmen

238
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,210
are affected seriously.

239
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:07,610
If it continues,

240
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,640
they won't be able

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,210
to make a living.

242
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:10,490
Yes.

243
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,040
After they sell herbs at a low price...

244
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:11,560
Yes.

245
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,970
...we can't sell our medicine.

246
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:13,880
We can't run our businesses.

247
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,280
Yes.

248
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:17,330
It's the guild that decides prices,

249
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,610
but

250
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,920
are they reasonable?

251
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:23,800
Mr. Ning,

252
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:25,450
the prices in Haifang

253
00:10:25,610 --> 00:10:26,640
have always been right

254
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,490
over the years.

255
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,850
The herbs' prices of Haifang

256
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,730
have risen by 40%
without any reason.

257
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:34,760
Is it true?

258
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Mr. Ning,

259
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,010
it's normal for the herbs' prices

260
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:41,520
to have a fluctuation.

261
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,130
Moreover, pirates have
appeared frequently

262
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,920
and robbed many cargo ships recently.

263
00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:48,040
That's why the herbs' prices rose.

264
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,880
It has nothing to do with our guild.

265
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,160
Mr. Ning,

266
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:53,760
please investigate it carefully.

267
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,680
Since my wife

268
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:00,610
can purchase high-qualified
herbs at a low price,

269
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:01,370
I believe

270
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,730
you can also

271
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:04,400
do that.

272
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,610
You can't say
you're considering for the people

273
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,730
only when you sell
reliable and affordable goods.

274
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,680
Mr. Ning,

275
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,330
it seems you want to connive

276
00:11:16,490 --> 00:11:17,760
at your wife's
disturbance of the market.

277
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:18,970
By then,

278
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,880
every shop will close,

279
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,160
and people will live a poor life.

280
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:23,370
Is that

281
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:25,160
what you want?

282
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,370
Mr. Ning,

283
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,090
as the magistrate,

284
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,920
will you abandon official business
because of your private business?

285
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,160
Mr. Wang,

286
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,010
can you tell me

287
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,250
what's the difference between official
business and private business?

288
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,210
The official business is for people

289
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,010
while the private business
is for yourself.

290
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,040
As the most generous man in Haifang,

291
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,640
you should know it,

292
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:56,040
shouldn't you?

293
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,450
You'd better

294
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,160
think of a method to
bring the guild on a right way

295
00:12:00,730 --> 00:12:02,280
instead of

296
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,010
wasting time asking me for justice.

297
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,090
Send them off.

298
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:09,250
Well, Mr. Ning...

299
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,130
Mr. Ning, don't leave.

300
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,610
Well, don't leave, Mr. Ning.

301
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:12,610
What...

302
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,280
What should we do?

303
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:13,920
What should we do?

304
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:14,920
- It's...
- Mr. Wang.

305
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,280
- Mr. Wang.
- Mr. Wang.

306
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,850
- I...
- What should we do?

307
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:19,400
What should we do?

308
00:12:20,090 --> 00:12:20,850
In order to

309
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:22,210
stop Lackey Ning from doubting us,

310
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:24,210
you actually

311
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:25,850
paid such a painful price.

312
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,210
Chief,

313
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,280
in my opinion,

314
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,760
we can just confess ourselves.

315
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,800
We're the later generation
of the Tea Gang.

316
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:35,160
Let's fight Lackey Ning to the end.

317
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,610
It's not that easy.

318
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,760
The Dragon Gang

319
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:38,920
is just on track,

320
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:40,610
members are not united,
and we're not armed enough.

321
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,920
If we do what you said,

322
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,920
we're just looking for death.

323
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:44,640
Chief,

324
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,330
what's your plan?

325
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:48,920
No matter what,

326
00:12:49,130 --> 00:12:49,970
I can't lead you

327
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:50,880
to follow the same old disastrous road.

328
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:52,370
My aim

329
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,160
is to bring the former
generation of the Tea Gang

330
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,850
and these kind members

331
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:57,610
on the right way.

332
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,130
Doesn't Ning Yuxuan

333
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:01,280
doubt us?

334
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,280
We should let him

335
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,640
see how our Tea Gang

336
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,160
do things.

337
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,160
Chief,

338
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:11,090
someone from Mr. Wang's mansion
passed on a message.

339
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,090
He asked you to go to Shuiyan House.

340
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:17,210
I see.

341
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:23,620
(Shuiyan House)

342
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,640
Since you inherit the Dragon Gang,

343
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,850
you'll be

344
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:29,370
very close

345
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,010
to the Sea Trade Guild.

346
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,490
Thanks for your trust, Mr. Wang.

347
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,130
The Dragon Gang

348
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,040
will try their best

349
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:37,730
to guard

350
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,040
the safety

351
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:40,010
of Sea Trade Guild's cargo.

352
00:13:40,450 --> 00:13:41,130
Okay.

353
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,250
What I attach most importance to

354
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,010
while doing business

355
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:45,800
is balance.

356
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,760
You know

357
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,680
it's not easy to do business in Haifang.

358
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:51,130
The cargo's transportation

359
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:53,280
mainly depends on the wharf,

360
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,520
but things don't go smooth

361
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,920
on the sea.

362
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,400
If there are storms or pirates,

363
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,010
the whole market of Haifang

364
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,730
will be affected.

365
00:14:01,730 --> 00:14:02,760
Now,

366
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,450
someone transported cargo privately

367
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,850
without the guild's permission.

368
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:07,970
Although

369
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:10,610
it's forgivable to transport
cargo privately,

370
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,280
it'll disturb

371
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:13,640
the balance of Haifang's market

372
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,210
if the cargo

373
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:17,610
isn't for the person's self-use.

374
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,450
Please read it, Chief Yuan.

375
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:35,700
(67 ships. 35 ships. 26 ships.)

376
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:41,220
(Buyer: Haoxue Cosmetics)

377
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:45,880
Mr. Wang,

378
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,250
what do you mean?

379
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:49,850
These ships

380
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:52,850
affect Haifang's balance,

381
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:56,640
and how do you think

382
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:58,610
I should deal with it?

383
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,610
It's easy.

384
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,520
Forbid these ships

385
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,330
to get close to Haifang.

386
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:08,400
Good idea.

387
00:15:09,130 --> 00:15:09,800
Keep talking.

388
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,760
Haven't pirates appeared frequently?

389
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:13,450
These three ships

390
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,330
must be robbed by them.

391
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:25,490
It turns out

392
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,330
you have the same thought as me.

393
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:29,010
Okay.

394
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:31,250
Please help me

395
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,400
to get rid of the trouble.

396
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:35,520
You'll get benefits.

397
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:37,850
No problem.

398
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:39,280
Mr. Wang,

399
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,920
you'll see.

400
00:15:44,270 --> 00:15:44,880
Goodbye.

401
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:48,900
(Shuiyan House)

402
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,370
Chief,

403
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,040
are we really going to

404
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,130
rob Ms. Nie's ships?

405
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,400
Of course.

406
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:53,450
I have my plan.

407
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:54,210
But...

408
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,010
Remember

409
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,610
that all I want is the cargo.

410
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,010
I thought Yuan Lang

411
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,680
was

412
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:06,250
an amazing

413
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,730
and loyal person,

414
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,090
but now,

415
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:11,640
it seems friendships
mean nothing to him.

416
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,010
They are nothing

417
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,010
when compared to money and interests.

418
00:16:18,370 --> 00:16:19,040
Mr. Wang,

419
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:19,850
Chief Yuan

420
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,400
has a close relationship

421
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:23,040
with the owner of Haoxue Cosmetics,

422
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,040
so will he overtly agree
but covertly oppose

423
00:16:25,210 --> 00:16:26,880
after you asked him to rob cargo ships

424
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,970
and kill all shipmen?

425
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
Am I easy

426
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,280
to be fooled?

427
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,490
If he wants a slice of the action,

428
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,800
he must rob ships

429
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,370
and can't fake it.

430
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:44,090
He dares to rob his friend's cargo,

431
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,450
and it can be regarded

432
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,280
as his guarantee of joining me.

433
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:50,450
Well,

434
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,520
send someone to keep an eye on the wharf.

435
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:54,160
Inform me

436
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:55,370
as soon as the Dragon Gang returns.

437
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,880
Yes.

438
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,800
(Haoxue Cosmetics)
Let me check

439
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:03,800
the herbs we give to Xiajiu House.

440
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:06,040
Angelica sinensis is
8,000 pence per ten maces.

441
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:08,490
It's 70% cheaper than the market price.

442
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,360
70%?

443
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,170
Borneol is 7,000 pence per ten maces.

444
00:17:11,410 --> 00:17:14,170
It's 40% cheaper

445
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,170
than the market price.

446
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,730
40%?

447
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:19,560
In this case,

448
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,840
we can give Xiajiu House a lower price

449
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,970
after counting

450
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:24,840
other herbs

451
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:26,490
and costs.

452
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,080
In this case,

453
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,800
those patients

454
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:31,120
can save

455
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,210
much money.

456
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,690
Yes.

457
00:17:32,890 --> 00:17:33,410
In this case,

458
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,730
it's much cheaper.

459
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,120
The guild is very black-hearted.

460
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,840
Ordinary people

461
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,730
don't know the outside market's price

462
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,170
and only regard the
guild's prices as normal,

463
00:17:46,890 --> 00:17:48,320
that's why they suffer losses
but can't say it out.

464
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:54,040
In this case,

465
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:55,450
the cost of the Feiwan Face Cream

466
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,450
could also be reduced by 20%.

467
00:17:58,490 --> 00:17:59,800
By then,

468
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,690
everyone can afford it.

469
00:18:02,410 --> 00:18:03,760
Really? That's perfect.

470
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:05,210
My Lady.

471
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,410
My Lady.

472
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:08,040
My Lady.

473
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:08,800
My Lady, something is wrong.

474
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,320
What happened?

475
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,120
Slow down.

476
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,080
Our ships...

477
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:11,760
What happened to the ships?

478
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,840
All cargo is robbed by pirates.

479
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:14,970
What?

480
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,210
Are you sure?

481
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:25,170
We caught many pirates today.

482
00:18:25,450 --> 00:18:26,360
At least there will be no accidents

483
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,040
on the sea for some time.

484
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,450
Pirates of Haifang don't stop appearing,

485
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,490
and what we did

486
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,650
is just a temporary solution.

487
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,250
We have to think about

488
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,250
a radical treatment.

489
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,040
Haven't you

490
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,410
ordered many people

491
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:38,970
to investigate nearby villages?

492
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:40,010
Have you found anything?

493
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,040
Haifang's forces are complicated,

494
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,730
and I've received no news

495
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,320
from scouts yet.

496
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,490
Your Lordship.

497
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:52,250
Your Lordship,

498
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,730
a runner from Magistrate's
Residence informed

499
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,250
that Her Ladyship's cargo ships
were robbed by pirates.

500
00:18:55,410 --> 00:18:56,120
What?

501
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,890
They are unscrupulous enough

502
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,410
to target at Mrs. Ning.

503
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,840
Isn't it coincident

504
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:02,210
that her ships are robbed now?

505
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,410
Mr. Ning,

506
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:04,800
the pirates

507
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,650
will think about a way to sell bribes.

508
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:07,520
I'll assist you

509
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:08,890
to patrol Haifang.

510
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,080
Thank you, Mr. Tao.

511
00:19:10,490 --> 00:19:11,490
Let's split up.

512
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,450
My Lady.

513
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,040
My Lady.

514
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:18,690
How is it?

515
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,890
His Lordship isn't at
Magistrate's Residence.

516
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,690
No?

517
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:25,410
Why isn't he there now?

518
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,690
My Lady, be patient.

519
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,210
How about we wait for him for a while?

520
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,320
I'm patient,

521
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,520
but the cargo doesn't only
include what we want

522
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:35,170
but also

523
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,360
the herbs to Xiajiu House.

524
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:37,800
Even if we can wait for the cargo,

525
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,600
those patients can't.

526
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,320
What...

527
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
What should we do,

528
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,040
My Lady?

529
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,450
We can't always wait.

530
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,730
We have to find the cargo.

531
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,040
The Dragon Gang.

532
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,890
Sang Shen and Muxu,

533
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:52,650
go to check

534
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,210
where we can find new cargo to supply.

535
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:55,490
I'll go to Mr. Yuan for help.

536
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,360
The Dragon Gang knows the sea

537
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,080
the best,

538
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:57,970
so they may find

539
00:19:57,970 --> 00:19:58,690
a clue of the cargo.

540
00:19:59,170 --> 00:19:59,650
Okay.

541
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,080
Yes, let's split up.

542
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:01,520
Go.

543
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,280
Go.

544
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:05,930
Chief,

545
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,840
all cargo we get

546
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,840
is recorded in the brochure.

547
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:09,280
I've checked all.

548
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:11,560
Yes, Chief.

549
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:12,650
All cargo

550
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,690
is stored

551
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:14,840
in the wharf's storage.

552
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:16,690
Clear out

553
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,410
Haoxue Cosmetics' cargo

554
00:20:17,410 --> 00:20:18,280
and store it separately.

555
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,970
I have to give it back
to Ms. Nie later.

556
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,930
Chief, there are more.

557
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,360
Mr. Yuan.

558
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:24,930
Ms. Nie.

559
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:26,890
Clean it.

560
00:20:26,890 --> 00:20:27,650
Mr. Yuan.

561
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,320
Mr. Yuan, something is wrong.

562
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,730
My cargo was robbed by pirates.

563
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,730
Ning Yuxuan isn't at
Magistrate's Residence now.

564
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:34,520
After thinking about it,

565
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,280
I have to come to you for help.

566
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,970
Those pirates will find a place

567
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,600
to store the cargo

568
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,490
after robbing it.

569
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,450
Since the Dragon Gang

570
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,840
knows the sea's situation the best,

571
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:42,970
can you follow me

572
00:20:42,970 --> 00:20:44,080
to look for my cargo?

573
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,690
Ms. Nie, calm down.

574
00:20:46,010 --> 00:20:47,080
There are many warehouses at the wharf.

575
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,970
If we check them one by one,

576
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:48,930
it will take time.

577
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,600
How about I ask the
members to look for it

578
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,800
and you wait for my news
in Haoxue Cosmetics?

579
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:53,840
I can't wait.

580
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,250
The cargo doesn't only
have the materials I need

581
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,760
but also the herbs to treat patients.

582
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,210
I can't bear waiting.

583
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,800
Well...

584
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:01,930
Please accompany me to look for it.

585
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:04,080
Ms. Nie,

586
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,730
I suddenly remember

587
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:06,320
some members

588
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,450
told me this morning

589
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:09,450
that some cargo ships were weird.

590
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,280
They didn't unload the cargo

591
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,410
at the wharf

592
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:13,650
but went to the mountain
through the bypath.

593
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:14,320
Chief,

594
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,210
I think

595
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,170
they may have

596
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:16,890
Ms. Nie's cargo.

597
00:21:16,970 --> 00:21:17,800
Mountain?

598
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,560
Yes.

599
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,120
Chief,

600
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,450
go and check it with Ms. Nie now.

601
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,970
I'll go to the wharf to
look for it with Zhao Long.

602
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:24,520
Let's go, Ms. Nie.

603
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,010
Sorry to bother you.

604
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,120
Go.

605
00:21:30,690 --> 00:21:31,800
Long,

606
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:33,490
Chief plays cat and mouse well

607
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,450
with Ms. Nie.

608
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:35,970
He found a chance

609
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:37,970
to rob her cargo,

610
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,320
which made her anxious,

611
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,450
and he will return it to her

612
00:21:41,450 --> 00:21:42,730
when it's time.

613
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,040
With that,

614
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,320
the girl

615
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,410
will fall in love with him.

616
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:48,120
Long,

617
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,450
Lackey Ning

618
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,970
could achieve nothing.

619
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,930
I didn't expect

620
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:53,840
Chief Yuan

621
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:55,450
to be skillful

622
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:57,010
in pursuing a girl.

623
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:58,520
You know nothing.

624
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,600
Chief Yuan had to rob Ms. Nie's ships

625
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,650
as his guarantee

626
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,410
to Wang Jinyao.

627
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,690
You did well today.

628
00:22:08,970 --> 00:22:10,560
Where are you going, Long?

629
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:13,730
The wharf.

630
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,520
We've been searching for a long time.

631
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:19,690
Didn't Zhao Long and Zhao Hu

632
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:20,320
say the ships were there?

633
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,360
Where are they?

634
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,520
Ms. Nie,

635
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,410
I think they should be nearby.

636
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:24,970
How about

637
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,170
resting for a while?

638
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:28,840
No ships are ahead.

639
00:22:29,170 --> 00:22:30,010
Let's...

640
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:30,970
Let's go back to search.

641
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:32,970
Wait.

642
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,410
There is a village.

643
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:35,600
Let's drink some water.

644
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,930
I'm not thirsty.

645
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:37,690
It's more important to find the cargo.

646
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:38,490
Let's look for it first.

647
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,080
Wait.

648
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,170
I'm thirsty.

649
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,170
Let's go.

650
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,930
Come on. Slow down.

651
00:22:50,930 --> 00:22:51,890
Thank you.

652
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:54,010
Here. Take it away.

653
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:54,930
Okay.

654
00:22:54,930 --> 00:22:55,730
We'll go back first.

655
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:58,840
You're back.

656
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,780
(Liu's Village)

657
00:23:05,010 --> 00:23:05,520
Okay.

658
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:15,360
Who are they?

659
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,360
I think

660
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,690
they're homeless refugees

661
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:19,360
and gather here to live.

662
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,320
I only

663
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:22,040
heard about refugees,

664
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,650
and it's my first time seeing them.

665
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:25,730
I'm leaving.

666
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,080
Refugees.

667
00:23:38,170 --> 00:23:38,840
Kid,

668
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,040
what are you doing?

669
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:41,320
I'm playing.

670
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,800
I brought candies today.

671
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,010
Do you want them?

672
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:49,930
Yes.

673
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,890
Okay.

674
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,840
Let me peel it for you.

675
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,010
You can eat it now.

676
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,280
Thank you, Miss.

677
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,210
My god.

678
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,730
Why didn't he eat it?

679
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,490
Miss,

680
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,890
can you give us some food?

681
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:17,320
- I want it, too.
- So do I.

682
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:18,450
So do I.

683
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,360
All of you can have a share.

684
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,210
I also want it.

685
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:20,890
Be patient.

686
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:21,890
All of you can have a share.

687
00:24:22,010 --> 00:24:22,600
Here you are.

688
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:25,170
- I want it, too.
- Me too.

689
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,560
There are no candies left.

690
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,800
I don't have more.

691
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,490
I'll bring them to you next time, okay?

692
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,930
Why didn't they eat candies

693
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,560
just now?

694
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,450
I think it's because they want to
use it to exchange for money.

695
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,600
Exchange for money?

696
00:24:46,210 --> 00:24:47,760
One candy is eight pence.

697
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,120
It could exchange for 250g of roughage

698
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,280
and some water,

699
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:51,650
so they're reluctant

700
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:52,890
to eat such a rare thing.

701
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,890
Are they even reluctant to eat a candy?

702
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,600
It seems

703
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:02,320
people don't live a good life here.

704
00:25:11,890 --> 00:25:14,040
How can I help them?

705
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:20,320
All cargo of my ship

706
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
is recorded in this brochure.

707
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:23,520
Please read it.

708
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,490
Only a few buckets of guano

709
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,520
is put in storage today?

710
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,650
Yes.

711
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:35,650
Where is the cargo?

712
00:25:36,450 --> 00:25:37,450
Show me.

713
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,840
I don't dare to do so, Mr. Ning.

714
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:41,930
The cargo here

715
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,170
is deposited by businessmen.

716
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,730
It's not mine at all.

717
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,600
Deposited?

718
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,080
Then why are there

719
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,650
no consigners or consignees

720
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:50,650
written in this brochure?

721
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:53,120
Does the cargo appear out of nowhere?

722
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,010
Who sent it to you?

723
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,730
Just some workers.

724
00:25:56,890 --> 00:25:58,650
They're under the
Dragon Gang's regulation.

725
00:25:58,730 --> 00:25:59,970
I heard

726
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:01,250
the guano

727
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,450
was bought from an island

728
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,600
at a high price by a rich man.

729
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,760
It's said to be used as fertilizer
in fields that are planted beans.

730
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,320
Nonsense.

731
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:10,360
Beans can be used as fertilizer,

732
00:26:11,450 --> 00:26:12,490
so he doesn't need guano at all.

733
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,960
Well,

734
00:26:14,690 --> 00:26:16,690
I just heard about it.

735
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,120
I've been living at sea from young,

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,210
and I've never farmed.

737
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,320
Your Lordship,

738
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:24,730
the cargo is strange.

739
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,250
Perhaps the bribes

740
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:27,170
we're looking for

741
00:26:27,970 --> 00:26:28,970
are in it.

742
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,120
It's not good.

743
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,760
Guano is dirty.

744
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,970
If you check each box,

745
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:35,930
won't my storage

746
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,970
be smelly?

747
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:40,760
Your hands will also get dirty.

748
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:47,930
Open boxes and check the cargo.

749
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,040
Yes.

750
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:05,560
Mr. Ning,

751
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,360
look.

752
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:08,170
It's indeed guano.

753
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:17,080
Wait.

754
00:27:54,170 --> 00:27:55,800
Is it guano?

755
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:01,890
Please spare my life, Mr. Ning.

756
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:02,490
Arrest him.

757
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:04,210
I know nothing,

758
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:04,600
Mr. Ning.

759
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:05,360
Ask my wife here.

760
00:28:05,650 --> 00:28:06,280
Mr. Ning.

761
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,650
Let her check if it's her cargo.

762
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,320
Yes.

763
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:10,080
Your Lordship.

764
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:11,410
Your Lordship.

765
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:14,010
Why are you here?

766
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,840
Her Ladyship and Chief Yuan

767
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:16,730
went to look for the cargo.

768
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,890
When we heard you were at the wharf,

769
00:28:17,890 --> 00:28:18,760
we rushed over.

770
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,170
What?

771
00:28:20,690 --> 00:28:21,520
Get out of my way.

772
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:27,210
What smell is it?

773
00:28:56,490 --> 00:28:57,360
Ning Yuxuan?

774
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:00,360
How do you know we're here?

775
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:02,360
I'm going to you.

776
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,490
Oh, you.

777
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:07,690
I lost my cargo

778
00:29:07,690 --> 00:29:08,840
and couldn't find you.

779
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,010
Fortunately, I asked
Chief Yuan for help.

780
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:13,970
I've found your cargo.

781
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:15,970
Really?

782
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,250
Where is it?

783
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,520
You stored her cargo

784
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,650
in the warehouse, didn't you?

785
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,250
The reason why

786
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,890
you took her to
the mountain to look for it

787
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:24,450
is to stop her

788
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:25,600
from going to the wharf, right?

789
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:29,760
Mr. Yuan,

790
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,320
according to the law,

791
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,210
you should be punished to die

792
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:34,080
if you rob cargo.

793
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:35,080
Mr. Ning,

794
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,520
don't slander me without evidence.

795
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,840
After I became the chief,

796
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,040
the Dragon Gang takes responsibility

797
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,080
for the transportation at the wharf

798
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,840
and the regulation of storages.

799
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,040
When we receive businessmen's cargo,

800
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,320
we only store it,

801
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,010
and we don't know

802
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,250
how to distinguish its sources.

803
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,170
Perhaps

804
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:53,970
someone wants to
plant stolen goods on me.

805
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:57,080
I'll find out.

806
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:00,730
Okay.

807
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,840
We've found the cargo, after all.

808
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,040
Mr. Yuan,

809
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,080
thank you

810
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,080
for accompanying me
to look for the cargo.

811
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:08,970
You're welcome.

812
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:10,320
Since it's found,

813
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,690
I'm leaving.

814
00:30:20,450 --> 00:30:21,280
Fortunately, the cargo is found.

815
00:30:21,280 --> 00:30:22,120
Fortunately.

816
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,410
Not at all.

817
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,210
From now on,

818
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,650
don't meet him alone.

819
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:31,410
Why?

820
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,170
Since he can be the Dragon Gang's chief,

821
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:34,560
he's not simple.

822
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:36,690
Haifang

823
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,730
is getting increasingly unstable.

824
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,320
Discuss with me

825
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,490
before doing things.

826
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,730
Don't go to the mountain with him alone

827
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,280
like today.

828
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,450
Are you jealous of him?

829
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:48,930
No.

830
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,690
Alright, I see.

831
00:30:52,210 --> 00:30:53,280
I have another emergent thing to do.

832
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:54,210
Accompany me.

833
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,080
I also want it.

834
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,250
All of you can have a share.

835
00:30:57,250 --> 00:30:58,170
All of you can have a share.

836
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,490
Sir, I want this one.

837
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:00,170
- Me too.
- Here you are.

838
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:00,970
All of you can have a share.

839
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:01,760
- Sir.
- Sir, what's this?

840
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,760
All of you can have a share.

841
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,080
Here you are.

842
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:06,730
All of you can have a share. Be patient.

843
00:31:07,010 --> 00:31:07,730
Here you are.

844
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,410
It's funny.

845
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:09,360
All of you can have a share.

846
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:11,490
Why are you in a daze?
Give them candies.

847
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,800
All of you can have a share.

848
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:14,600
All of you can have a share.

849
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,600
Here you are.

850
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,930
Here you are.

851
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:17,690
Thank you.

852
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,490
Okay.

853
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,410
Give me one.

854
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:20,450
- Pass it behind.
- Give me one.

855
00:31:21,690 --> 00:31:22,280
Here you are.

856
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,080
Here you are.

857
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:23,970
Get out.

858
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,360
- Get out.
- Who wants candies?

859
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,120
Come to me.

860
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,600
Get out now.

861
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,010
Get out now.

862
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:30,650
Get out of my way.

863
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,320
Get out.

864
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:32,930
Liu's Village doesn't like you.

865
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,600
You shouldn't stay here.

866
00:31:34,890 --> 00:31:36,600
Leave.

867
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:38,170
We come to give food,

868
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:39,120
and we don't have bad intentions.

869
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,360
We don't need them.

870
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:40,760
Get out.

871
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,120
Liu's Village doesn't need you.

872
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:42,840
Leave.

873
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:44,450
Take them away.

874
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:45,840
You're liars.

875
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,280
They are liars.

876
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,840
What are you doing, Mrs. Liu?

877
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,650
They are jinks.

878
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,280
Jinks have come here.

879
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,450
Liu's Village will be destroyed.

880
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:54,250
Get out.

881
00:31:54,250 --> 00:31:54,730
Come on.

882
00:31:55,010 --> 00:31:56,010
Send Mrs. Liu back now.

883
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,490
Liu's Village will suffer.

884
00:31:57,490 --> 00:31:58,450
Go back now.

885
00:31:58,450 --> 00:32:00,930
- Stop talking nonsense here.
- Liu's Village will suffer.

886
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,410
Liu's Village will suffer.

887
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:03,320
Sir and Miss,

888
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,250
I'm so sorry.

889
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,210
Mrs. Liu

890
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:07,520
is crazy.

891
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,450
Don't

892
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,970
take her words seriously.

893
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,080
- Yes.
- Don't take her words seriously.

894
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:11,650
It doesn't matter.

895
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,320
Don't take her words seriously.

896
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,250
Come on. Pass it behind.

897
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,280
Who doesn't get the candy?

898
00:32:15,490 --> 00:32:15,840
Here you are.

899
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,170
Everyone,

900
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,410
these two kind people

901
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:19,690
are here to help us

902
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,410
and give us things.

903
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:22,410
Shouldn't we

904
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:23,560
thank them?

905
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,120
- Yes.
- Thank you.

906
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,760
Thank you.

907
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,730
That's what we should do.
It doesn't matter.

908
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

909
00:32:29,010 --> 00:32:29,930
You're welcome.

910
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,220
You're so kind.

911
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,740
Yes.

912
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:38,840
Can it be eaten?

913
00:32:39,450 --> 00:32:40,210
People don't have much food

914
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,520
to eat here,

915
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:43,010
and they just

916
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:44,800
eat it to fill the belly.

917
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:52,170
What a shabby table.

918
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,520
Let me help you.

919
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:54,800
Thank you.

920
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:57,840
Okay.

921
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,600
It's done.

922
00:32:59,890 --> 00:33:01,690
Madam, why doesn't
the table get repaired

923
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:02,730
since it's broken?

924
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,120
Where are the men of the village?

925
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:07,120
Most of them go to sea.

926
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,840
Go to sea?

927
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:10,010
Where do they go?

928
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:12,120
Their ships are different,

929
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,450
and the places they go

930
00:33:13,450 --> 00:33:14,280
differ from each other.

931
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:16,410
Some of them go to Huangzhou,

932
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,410
and some of them go to Chuanhai.

933
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:19,890
My husband

934
00:33:19,890 --> 00:33:20,930
goes to the furthermost place,

935
00:33:20,930 --> 00:33:21,890
Yunzhou.

936
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:23,170
Yunzhou?

937
00:33:24,010 --> 00:33:24,930
Yes.

938
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:25,800
All of them

939
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,730
go to sea to make money.

940
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,450
Madam,

941
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:30,890
he is a man.

942
00:33:30,890 --> 00:33:31,520
Will you use him or not?

943
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,040
Why do you grab me?

944
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:35,410
I don't do manual labor.

945
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:36,760
Help them.

946
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,010
This gentleman...

947
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:43,210
He is very capable.

948
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:47,420
I...

949
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,040
He's very capable.

950
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,320
Why hasn't he repaired the table

951
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
after half of the day past?

952
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,890
I can tell this gentleman

953
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:02,970
doesn't do manual labor

954
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,210
at the first sight.

955
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:04,890
It's done

956
00:34:04,890 --> 00:34:06,360
by your wife, right?

957
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:09,040
Yes.

958
00:34:09,370 --> 00:34:11,850
She helps me

959
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,290
with manual labor.

960
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:16,120
Occasionally.

961
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:19,890
What's wrong?

962
00:34:20,930 --> 00:34:22,080
What's wrong? Let me see.

963
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,240
You're so careless.

964
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:26,850
My hand is dirty.

965
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,890
Although you haven't done much work,

966
00:34:29,890 --> 00:34:31,010
you've sweated a lot.

967
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,810
Miss,

968
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,240
you can't marry a man

969
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,240
who has nothing
but only a beautiful face.

970
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,410
After all,

971
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:40,370
he can't avoid working, right?

972
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:45,490
Yes.

973
00:34:46,770 --> 00:34:48,120
Alright. Go away.

974
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:51,600
- It's...
- It's not a big deal.

975
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,970
It's difficult.

976
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,930
You won't feel tired
after working together.

977
00:34:55,930 --> 00:34:57,010
Mrs. Zhen,

978
00:34:57,370 --> 00:34:58,890
I picked vegetables just now.

979
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,240
Cook them

980
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,680
for the two kind people.

981
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,560
Check it.

982
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:13,770
It's repaired.

983
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:15,970
This gentleman is good at learning.

984
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:16,810
He's

985
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,080
capable of working.

986
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,520
By the way, Gentleman,

987
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,200
my chicken house is also broken.

988
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,040
Can you

989
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,200
help me to repair it?

990
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:35,680
No problem.

991
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,490
Madam, tell the villagers

992
00:35:37,490 --> 00:35:38,680
that they can ask him

993
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:40,010
for help.

994
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,120
He loves working the most.

995
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,600
Great.

996
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:42,450
Just ask him for help.

997
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:44,680
Mr. Ning, capable people
have to work more.

998
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:47,810
Great.

999
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Go.

1000
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,490
Come on.

1001
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:50,770
- Gentleman.
- Go.

1002
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:52,810
Go and repair my chicken house.

1003
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:53,370
Hurry up.

1004
00:35:53,370 --> 00:35:54,200
Slow down.

1005
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:55,850
Don't get injured.

1006
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:58,240
Come on.

1007
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:58,890
It's here.

1008
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:00,770
This is my chicken house.

1009
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:01,410
Come on.

1010
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,410
Look. It's broken.

1011
00:36:02,410 --> 00:36:03,770
Please repair it.

1012
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
My chick runs away.

1013
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:25,370
Mr. Wang,

1014
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,720
I've achieved

1015
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,120
the agreement with you.

1016
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:29,520
Chief Yuan,

1017
00:36:30,810 --> 00:36:32,240
why is Haoxue Cosmetics' cargo

1018
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,640
not here?

1019
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:34,850
Don't mention that.

1020
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:36,450
After we robbed Mrs. Ning's cargo,

1021
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,770
Ning Yuxuan searched the wharf

1022
00:36:37,770 --> 00:36:38,890
crazily.

1023
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:41,290
Fortunately,
I stored the cargo separately

1024
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,640
so that he didn't discover it.

1025
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:46,720
Ning Yuxuan really

1026
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,330
likes his wife.

1027
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,330
Although

1028
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:52,290
he didn't get something on me,

1029
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,770
he's kept an eye

1030
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:54,680
on the Dragon Gang.

1031
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:55,970
I'm afraid

1032
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,640
we have to be careful during these days.

1033
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,850
Chief Yuan,

1034
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:03,890
thanks to your hard work
with your members.

1035
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,160
You can deal with the cargo.

1036
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:08,490
You can sell or keep it

1037
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,520
as you like.

1038
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:12,120
I only want your honesty.

1039
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,520
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

1040
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,560
Chief Yuan,

1041
00:37:16,810 --> 00:37:18,450
please forgive my talkativeness.

1042
00:37:20,410 --> 00:37:22,810
How do you deal with

1043
00:37:23,770 --> 00:37:25,640
the shipmen of those ships?

1044
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,770
According to the rule,

1045
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,930
we should avoid killing people

1046
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,490
after robbing cargo.

1047
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,330
I threw them into the sea,

1048
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,560
and I don't care

1049
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,560
if they are alive or not.

1050
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,490
It has nothing to do with us.

1051
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:41,010
Good.

1052
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,040
Chief Yuan,

1053
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:45,890
you did things precisely and fast.

1054
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,010
You're very excellent.

1055
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:48,160
From now on,

1056
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,330
the Dragon Gang

1057
00:37:50,330 --> 00:37:51,410
and Sea Trade Guild
are united officially

1058
00:37:51,410 --> 00:37:52,810
and corporate honestly.

1059
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Chief Yuan,

1060
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,040
this is the guild's token.

1061
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,850
You can go to

1062
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:01,040
all Sea Trade Guild's places

1063
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:02,810
with it.

1064
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,410
You're me

1065
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,120
when having this token.

1066
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:08,970
You're so generous

1067
00:38:09,490 --> 00:38:11,040
to give me this precious, Mr. Wang.

1068
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:14,370
We're family from now on.

1069
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,370
And we'll do

1070
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,850
more important deals.

1071
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,540
(Sea)

1072
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,810
Everyone,

1073
00:38:35,810 --> 00:38:37,010
because of

1074
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:37,850
your united devotion,

1075
00:38:37,850 --> 00:38:39,200
our things

1076
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,290
get repaired

1077
00:38:40,290 --> 00:38:42,010
so fast.

1078
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:42,930
However,

1079
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:43,520
we need to

1080
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,450
specially thank two persons.

1081
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:48,010
They are our benefactors,

1082
00:38:48,010 --> 00:38:49,970
Mr. and Mrs. Ning.

1083
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,040
Mr. Ning,

1084
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,450
our village

1085
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,560
is worse than Haifang.

1086
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:58,410
And we don't have

1087
00:38:58,410 --> 00:38:59,720
many activities to do at night.

1088
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,520
We'll

1089
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:02,200
just dance around the fire.

1090
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:02,930
Come on.

1091
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,330
Let's dance.

1092
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:09,600
Come on.

1093
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,370
Come on.

1094
00:39:28,410 --> 00:39:29,560
- Come with us.
- I...

1095
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:30,160
Go.

1096
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:31,640
Come on.

1097
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:33,970
I don't know dancing.

1098
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:35,290
It's easy.

1099
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:39,600
Right.

1100
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:48,240
(It turns out to be easy)

1101
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:50,410
(to live happily.)

1102
00:39:58,370 --> 00:39:59,640
Come on. Let's dance.

1103
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:00,520
Perhaps

1104
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
you've been not afraid of fire.

1105
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,680
Come on.

1106
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,560
Let's dance.

1107
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:08,040
Although I don't know

1108
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,600
what happened

1109
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,560
to you before,

1110
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:12,290
I'm going to accompany you

1111
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:13,890
to pass it.

1112
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,040
Your physical injury

1113
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,290
should get recovered soon,

1114
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,240
and so should

1115
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,010
your psychological injury.

1116
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:35,200
Come on.

1117
00:40:48,930 --> 00:40:49,930
Come on.

1118
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,370
It doesn't matter. I'm here.

1119
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,810
Go.

1120
00:41:00,370 --> 00:41:00,930
Go.

1121
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,160
One, two, three, four.

1122
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:19,680
