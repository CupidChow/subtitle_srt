=Romance of a Twin Flower=

00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:45,670
You...

4
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,030
You've restored your memories?

5
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:50,700
Yes.

6
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,460
If time goes back to the day

7
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,620
when you found me in desperation

8
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,020
18 years ago,

9
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,620
I would never have

10
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:14,100
thought of today.

11
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,780
A soldier guarding the city gate

12
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,660
became a general.

13
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,740
And a friend who said he'd see me again

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,060
had never been heard

15
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,220
from since.

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,660
A pair of twin sisters,

17
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:30,900
you took one,

18
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,020
I kept the other.

19
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,500
We thought

20
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,300
the two of them would never
see each other again.

21
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,060
But

22
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,060
fate still

23
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,420
entangled them together.

24
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:42,980
What do you mean?

25
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,580
Ji Man, who you raised,

26
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,700
entered Marquis Moyu's Mansion

27
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,740
in Sangyu's place.

28
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,900
Man

29
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:56,820
entered Marquis Moyu's Mansion

30
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,860
in Sangyu's place?

31
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:00,580
A few months ago,

32
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,860
I returned to the capital from
the Northwest to report on my work,

33
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,260
and went to visit Sangyu

34
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,700
at her husband's home,
Marquis Moyu's Mansion.

35
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,220
I quickly determined that

36
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,860
she was not Sangyu.

37
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:14,860
But they looked very similar.

38
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,100
Only then did I think of

39
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,580
the baby you carried away back then.

40
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:19,980
I guessed that

41
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,580
she must be Sangyu's

42
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,180
twin sister,

43
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,220
so I kept it a secret.

44
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,020
Later I learned that

45
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,380
Sangyu and Ning Yuxuan made a scene,

46
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,060
then she fell off a cliff
and fell into the water,

47
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,340
losing all her memories.

48
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,140
As for how the two of them

49
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,780
switched identities,

50
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,740
I don't know

51
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:39,340
the reason.

52
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,100
Since that day,

53
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,420
I have sent people all the way

54
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,900
to inquire about Sangyu's whereabouts,

55
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,180
looking for your trace.

56
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:47,300
Not long ago,

57
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,580
I got the news that

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,460
since Sangyu fell off the cliff that day,

59
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,260
she...

60
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:00,340
It's all my fault.

61
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,700
I was too conniving with Sangyu,

62
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,740
which actually did her bad.

63
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,300
One of the two sisters

64
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,580
passed away

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,740
and the other has amnesia.

66
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,620
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:26,540
I didn't take good care of Sangyu.

68
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,260
It's not your fault.

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,180
I just can't accept it for a while.

70
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,020
The two of them

71
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,620
have changed their appearance

72
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,220
and started over.

73
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:41,180
But

74
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,060
they still can't get rid of

75
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,780
the curse of the previous generation.

76
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,620
Somehow,

77
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,980
they still got mixed up

78
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:53,180
with the Ning family.

79
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:55,060
The Ning family?

80
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,900
What do you mean?

81
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,540
Xiangyuan.

82
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,900
I don't have to

83
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,260
hide anything now.

84
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,660
At that time, Ning Zhongtian,
an official of the imperial court,

85
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:07,700
was ordered to exterminate
the Tea Gang.

86
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,660
I was also a member of it.

87
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,860
You were one of the Tea Gang?

88
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:18,740
But back then,

89
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,580
I didn't see your name

90
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,660
on the wanted list.

91
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:25,900
My pseudonym in the Tea Gang
was Tiger.

92
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,940
You were the Third Chief
of the Tea Gang?

93
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,620
Exactly.

94
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,180
When the Tea Gang was destroyed,

95
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:32,780
I escaped by chance.

96
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,420
During the crisis,

97
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,020
I saved the two infant daughters

98
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,020
of Cai Wenzheng,

99
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,020
the chief of the gang.

100
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,700
They are

101
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,020
the important bloodline
of the Tea Gang.

102
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,420
It turns out that

103
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,220
the twins

104
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,220
are not your own daughters.

105
00:05:56,260 --> 00:05:57,340
Ji Ming,

106
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:58,300
but you know that

107
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,140
the imperial court is going to

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,260
look into the Tea Gang.

109
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:05,980
Xiangyuan.

110
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,620
For the sake of our brotherhood,

111
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:09,420
and the fact that Ji Man

112
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,980
and Sangyu are twin sisters,

113
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,420
please let Man go.

114
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,620
After Man is safe,

115
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,740
I will plead guilty to the court.

116
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,420
But Ji Man

117
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,620
is the dignified

118
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,140
second-rank lady with imperial mandate.

119
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,820
The crime of deceiving the emperor

120
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:30,020
will be executed

121
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,140
and the family will be implicated.

122
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:42,460
Get up.

123
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:46,980
That being the case,

124
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,940
we might as well
make the best of a mistake

125
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,500
and let outsiders think that

126
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,540
Ji Man is my daughter,

127
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,700
and let Nie Sangyu continue
to live in the Marquis's Mansion.

128
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,460
It might be safer for her

129
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:58,820
that way.

130
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,340
Xiangyuan.

131
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,340
Among so many men in the world,

132
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,060
no matter who she admires
and wants to marry,

133
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,300
I will definitely give her
all my assets

134
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,340
as the dowry

135
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,420
without hesitation.

136
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:11,300
But that person

137
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,860
can never be Ning Yuxuan.

138
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:15,060
Ning Yuxuan's father, Ning Zhongtian,

139
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,020
was the culprit

140
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,220
who killed their father

141
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:19,340
and destroyed the Tea Gang.

142
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,380
How could they be a couple

143
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,460
with an absolutely
irreconcilable blood feud?

144
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:28,100
No matter what,

145
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,300
I have to cut off the karma

146
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,260
and take Man

147
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,300
away from Ning Yuxuan.

148
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,220
No!

149
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,020
Ming.

150
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,340
Never hurt Man

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,420
on impulse.

152
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,420
She is now the daughter

153
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,940
of the general,

154
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,220
and no one dares to bully her.

155
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,940
If you

156
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,500
forcibly take her away,

157
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,060
how can the Ning's Mansion let go

158
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,700
after losing their First Lady?

159
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,660
Whether it is you

160
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,780
or Man,

161
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,540
if you are hunted down by officers

162
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,180
and your identity is exposed,

163
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:55,980
it will lead to

164
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:58,500
a fatal disaster.

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,500
Am I just

166
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,180
going to

167
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,700
watch Man

168
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:03,660
live in a muddle-headed way

169
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:05,420
with the son of

170
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,380
the one who killed his father?

171
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:10,060
A few days ago,

172
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,260
Ji Man told me that

173
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,740
her discord with Ning Yuxuan

174
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,900
had reached the point of divorce.

175
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,740
In fact, Sangyu

176
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,340
and Ning Yuxuan
were not living a happy life.

177
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,060
It's better for us

178
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,140
to wait and see,

179
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:27,060
secretly fueling the flames

180
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,340
and separating Man and Ning Yuxuan

181
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,980
without intention.

182
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:31,460
Once

183
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,300
we get the divorce paper,

184
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,580
we will take Man

185
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,260
to a safer place.

186
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,100
That being the case,

187
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,940
Xiangyuan,

188
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,420
I will rush back to Haifang now.

189
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,500
So

190
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,100
that's how

191
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,140
the whole thing went.

192
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,380
I...

193
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:09,500
I've finished.

194
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,540
I...

195
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,660
I swear I'm not lying.

196
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:20,620
I held nothing back.

197
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,900
It turns out that you came to

198
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,540
Marquis's Mansion

199
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,220
in this capacity.

200
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:30,940
Right.

201
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,940
It is because

202
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,540
your men

203
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,780
salvaged the wrong person
from the river.

204
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,020
And

205
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:40,700
they should be punished.

206
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,580
I didn't intend to

207
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
go to your mansion

208
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:50,780
to pretend to be your wife.

209
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,980
Weren't you trying to

210
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,860
look for the man you love?

211
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,140
I was young by then.

212
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:12,860
Tell me the story again,

213
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,180
just the first half.

214
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,620
Why did you fall in love with me

215
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,180
at first sight?

216
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,660
I've said it four times.

217
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:23,580
You still don't understand?

218
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,700
I really don't understand.

219
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,540
I won't say that again.

220
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,740
Don't you think

221
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:37,500
the whole thing

222
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,420
is a coincidence?

223
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,460
I do.

224
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,380
Right.

225
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,500
There are such coincidences

226
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,740
in this world.

227
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,940
Even I can't believe it.

228
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,260
You just believed it?

229
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,420
Yes.

230
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Weren't you

231
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,540
quite suspicious before?

232
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,260
Why now...

233
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,500
Don't you have any questions?

234
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,260
Things

235
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,260
have changed now.

236
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:08,020
I remember

237
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,060
all the things you did for me.

238
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:12,380
Plus this box of ironclad proof.

239
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,380
Of course I believe it.

240
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:19,380
You have nothing

241
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,220
to say to me?

242
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,860
Well...

243
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,340
No.

244
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,620
You've told the story four times.

245
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,780
I have no more questions.

246
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,460
I said it four times.

247
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,660
But you didn't say anything.

248
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,140
I have nothing to say.

249
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,700
Leave.

250
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,540
Leave.

251
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,820
You!

252
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,660
Wait.

253
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,580
Dear.

254
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:02,060
Wait.

255
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:07,900
Say it.

256
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,180
I...

257
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:16,180
I...

258
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,780
I'd like to listen to it again.

259
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,180
I am leaving.

260
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,380
Well...

261
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,940
The man you love

262
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,140
wants to admire the moon with you.

263
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:00,620
I have no time.

264
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,140
Nerd.

265
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,140
Your Ladyship.

266
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,500
Have you heard?

267
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,380
Look. Right?

268
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:38,020
Yes.

269
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
Let me tell you.

270
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,140
What?

271
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,980
It's said that Her Ladyship...

272
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,980
Her Ladyship has hidden

273
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,940
many portraits of His Lordship.

274
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,420
Muxu.

275
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,860
Do you think

276
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,660
everyone looks at me

277
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:51,540
strangely?

278
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,220
That's because

279
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,340
it is rumored in the Mansion

280
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,180
that you admired His Lordship so much

281
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:55,820
that you collected related items of his.

282
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:57,340
What?

283
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,740
W-What?

284
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,420
Get to work.

285
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,020
Get to work. Get to work.

286
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:03,540
Who spread it?

287
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,940
Does this still need to be spread?

288
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:06,100
So many people

289
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,260
saw it yesterday.

290
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,980
Your Ladyship.

291
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,660
- They can't see me.
- Your Ladyship.

292
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,860
The chef wants you to decide

293
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,100
what His Lordship will have for dinner.

294
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,300
Are you looking for His Lordship?

295
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,300
I'll take you there.

296
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,260
I am not looking for him.

297
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:28,460
I am so ashamed.

298
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,940
Let me disappear in the Mansion.

299
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,700
Her Ladyship really
loves His Lordship deeply.

300
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,940
(Magistrate's Residence)

301
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,340
Sang Shen.

302
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,820
Where is Man?

303
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,180
Well,

304
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,060
I haven't seen her

305
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:45,940
for hours.

306
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,620
Muxu went to Haoxue Cosmetics
to look for her.

307
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:50,580
Muxu.

308
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:51,500
Man...

309
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,260
Your Lordship.

310
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,820
Her Ladyship isn't at Haoxue Cosmetics.

311
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,220
She's not at Haoxue Cosmetics?

312
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,260
Then where has she been?

313
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:57,660
Could...

314
00:14:57,660 --> 00:14:59,220
Could it be that she's
looking for raw materials?

315
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,100
Just think about

316
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,900
what abnormal behavior

317
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,340
she had today.

318
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:05,260
She seemed to have said that

319
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,420
she was ashamed
or something like that.

320
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,220
Wait here.

321
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,060
I am going to look for her.

322
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,500
Come on.

323
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,540
How can I continue to live here?

324
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,660
No way.

325
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:42,580
I have to think of a way

326
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,980
to restore my dignity.

327
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,340
It's all because of you bad guy.

328
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,420
You bad guy?

329
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,300
Are you looking for me?

330
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,500
You eavesdropped on me.

331
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,300
I'm just

332
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:00,300
curious.

333
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,340
Why are you hiding here?

334
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,180
Is there something that
belongs to me

335
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,460
under the plum blossom tree?

336
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,140
No!

337
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:12,340
I already told you

338
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:15,260
I was immature at that time.

339
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,540
So childhood likes

340
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,620
don't count.

341
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,420
But are you

342
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,860
admitting that

343
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,300
you liked me

344
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,260
very early on?

345
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,620
You!

346
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,180
No!

347
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,660
What's so embarrassing about

348
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,020
liking your husband?

349
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,300
I won't be living here.

350
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,980
Wait!

351
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,260
Well...

352
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,420
What if I have a way

353
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,700
to get your dignity back?

354
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,340
What way?

355
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,060
Don't you think

356
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,820
everyone of the Mansion

357
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,680

Thick pillow.

373
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,060
Thin pillow.

Thin pillow.

00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:52,260

My Lady.

381
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,860
Your Ladyship, I made you a thin pillow.

382
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,260
But Sang Shen insisted on
changing it to a thick one.

383
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:57,820
Miss Ji

384
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:58,820
likes thick pillows.

385
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,180
Right?

386
00:17:59,180 --> 00:17:59,460
Thin pillow.

387
00:17:59,460 --> 00:17:59,940
Thick pillow.

388
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,460
- Thin pillow.
- Thick pillow.

389
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:01,260
Alright.

390
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,380
Enough.

391
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:07,220
Put both the thin and thick ones.

392
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,860
I like them both.

393
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,380
Okay?

394
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:12,820
By the way, Sang Shen.

395
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:13,900
In order to

396
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:14,820
avoid suspicion,

397
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:15,700
call me Your Ladyship

398
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,020
just like Muxu.

399
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,500
But in my mind,

400
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:22,300
you just strayed into
Marquis Moyu's Mansion.

401
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:23,340
You have never had a wedding,

402
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,500
nor a marriage certificate.

403
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,460
Why are you a couple?

404
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:26,100
Nonsense!

405
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,300
Her Ladyship is the First Lady,

406
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,380
the principal wife of His Lordship.

407
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,060
How could she be the First Lady?

408
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:32,260
They hadn't held a wedding,

409
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,380
so of course they aren't a couple.

410
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:34,340
She's my Miss Ji,

411
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,300
not the First Lady.

412
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,220
She is the First Lady.

413
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:36,980
My Lady.

414
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:37,300
First Lady.

415
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:37,740
My Lady.

416
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:37,980
First Lady.

417
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,540
My Lady.

418
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,140
Not First Lady.

419
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:39,780
First Lady.

420
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,380
My Lady.

421
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:40,860
First Lady.

422
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,260
My Lady.

423
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:41,620
First Lady.

424
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,100
First Lady.

425
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:42,660
My Lady.

426
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:43,900
First Lady.

427
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,300
My Lady.

428
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:46,700
First...

429
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,980
My Lady, what's the matter?

430
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,740
Are you unhappy?

431
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,620
Am I saying something wrong?

432
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:57,500
No.

433
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,380
I...

434
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:00,180
I'm a little tired.

435
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,140
You can

436
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,020
leave me alone.

437
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,940
But, My Lady...

438
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,770
Go.

439
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,060
Come on.

440
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:13,980
Go.

441
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:27,940
Right.

442
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,020
Why didn't you

443
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:03,060
go to Haoxue Cosmetics today,

444
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,260
but loafed on the job here?

445
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,420
You are lazy.

446
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,380
You run around all day

447
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:10,500
with nothing to do.

448
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,500
You must have traveled

449
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:12,420
all over Haifang.

450
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,700
You are right.

451
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,820
Listen.

452
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:15,940
I found

453
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,900
a lot of new restaurants.

454
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:17,980
Are you interested in

455
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:19,020
eating with me?

456
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,740
No.

457
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,780
I'm busy making money.

458
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,460
As a girl,

459
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:27,060
why are you talking about money
all the time?

460
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,180
How can I repay your debt

461
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:29,700
if I don't make money?

462
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,300
If you can

463
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,700
make me happy,

464
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,980
your debt will be paid off.

465
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:36,380
How is it?

466
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,220
Sorry.

467
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:38,740
I don't make a living by this.

468
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,060
I will pay back your money
as soon as possible.

469
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:45,140
I am kidding.

470
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,300
Don't be angry.

471
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,620
I'm just kidding.

472
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:52,620
Your Ladyship.

473
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:54,100
My Lady, you finally got up.

474
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,220
Breakfast is ready

475
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,140
and is right in the lobby.

476
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:56,500
Okay.

477
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,140
I heard that

478
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,300
His Lordship is going to the lobby.

479
00:20:58,300 --> 00:20:59,220
It turns out that

480
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,100
he wants to eat with you.

481
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:05,540
Then let's eat out.

482
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,220
Dear.

483
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,460
- My Lady.
- Where are you going?

484
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:28,980
We were all right

485
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,540
last night, weren't we?

486
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,340
Why does she ignore me today?

487
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,780
A woman's mind

488
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:37,500
is hard to guess.

489
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:41,740
I think it's more difficult

490
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:43,020
to guess your mind.

491
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:55,700
(From sister Qian Lianxue)
(Now I am in Haifang.)

492
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,620
(I spend a lot on food
and clothing every day.)

493
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:59,460
(I have no money for you
to squander.)

494
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,740
(Bingyan.)

495
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:02,340
(You are no longer young)

496
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,820
(and you have to work.)

497
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,140
(Set off immediately)

498
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:06,620
(to Haifang.)

499
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,940
(I will find a job for you)

500
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:08,820
(in Haifang,)

501
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,020
(so that you can live on yourself.)

502
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:12,140
(If you don't listen to me this time,)

503
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,220
(we will no longer)

504
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,580
(be siblings.)

505
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:21,380
Qian Lianxue.

506
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,500
Have you been overwhelmed

507
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,220
after living in Marquis Moyu's Mansion

508
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,740
for a while?

509
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:27,380
After I meet you, I will ask you,

510
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,580
since you won't pay off the debt for me,

511
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:30,260
do you want

512
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:31,900
your own brother to die?

513
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,820
Young Master, don't worry.

514
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,420
Miss Qian has always been
the best to you,

515
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,940
and she will never leave you alone.

516
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,180
Young Master.

517
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:48,380
Someone is asking to see you.

518
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,340
Who's that?

519
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:56,980
This is Tanxiang.

520
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,620
I have been ordered by Magistrate

521
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,260
to wait here for Young Master Qian.

522
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,860
Tanxiang?

523
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:06,700
Where is my sister?

524
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:08,420
She is still busy working
at Haoxue Cosmetics.

525
00:23:08,620 --> 00:23:10,180
My master ordered me that

526
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,980
if you have any needs

527
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,540
in Haifang,

528
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,460
I'm going to be all obedience.

529
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,340
All obedience?

530
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,700
Really?

531
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,180
I

532
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:35,500
will definitely

533
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:36,660
serve you well.

534
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,060
Mr. Qian.

535
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:39,540
This is your first time
in Haifang, isn't it?

536
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:41,220
There are many novelties in Haifang.

537
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,220
You can eat and play all day.

538
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,300
Young Master.

539
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,100
If you're not in a hurry,

540
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:48,660
I'll show you around.

541
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,380
What's so special

542
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,860
about this boring place?

543
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,860
How about we go for a drink?

544
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:56,060
A drink?

545
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,380
Boring. No.

546
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,660
There are a lot of things

547
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,740
to have fun here.

548
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:01,580
Music, opera,

549
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,380
and gambling.

550
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:05,180
Gambling?

551
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,660
Do you have money?

552
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:16,820
Your Ladyship.

553
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,780
You've been getting along well
with His Lordship.

554
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,020
What happened today?

555
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,820
My Lady.

556
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,860
Could it be that you have figured it out

557
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,020
and no longer like him?

558
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:24,900
What are you talking about?

559
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,980
They are

560
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,460
a perfect match.

561
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,300
You know nothing.

562
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,180
Do you know what love is?

563
00:24:29,180 --> 00:24:30,180
She and Mr. Yuan

564
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,300
are a perfect match.

565
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:32,180
Do you know what love is?

566
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,780
It should be His Lordship.

567
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,540
How dare you push me?

568
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,460
It should be Mr. Yuan.

569
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,220
His Lordship.

570
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:35,820
Mr. Yuan.

571
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,260
His Lordship.

572
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,700
Stop!

573
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:40,820
If the two of you continue to quarrel,

574
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,900
I will find a family

575
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,660
for each of you.

576
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:44,980
My Lady.

577
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,260
Your Ladyship.

578
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,780
We don't want to leave you.

579
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,180
So cheesy.

580
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:49,860
Let me go.

581
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,980
Let me go.

582
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,060
No.

583
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,940
Your Ladyship.

584
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,180
Who's leaving?

585
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,260
Miss Shui, you came just in time.

586
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:57,940
These two girls

587
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,220
are becoming more
and more disobedient.

588
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,260
Why don't you

589
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,060
see if

590
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:01,940
there are any suitable people
in your place

591
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:02,820
who can marry them?

592
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,260
- Your Ladyship.
- We are on good terms with each other.

593
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,340
And we do everything for you.

594
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,780
Right, Sister Muxu?

595
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,540
I seem to be younger than you.

596
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:09,100
Sister Sang Shen.

597
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,020
Really? I look younger than you.

598
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:10,820
Again!

599
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,260
Hang out now

600
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,860
and you are not allowed
to come back until dark.

601
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,900
Otherwise I...

602
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,420
I will arrange a wedding
for each of you.

603
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,660
Your Ladyship, I am leaving.

604
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:19,380
My Lady, goodbye.

605
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,740
- Let me go first.
- What are you doing?

606
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,340
Don't follow me.

607
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,220
Walk behind me.

608
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,420
Isn't it nice to

609
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,460
have these two girls with you?

610
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,140
Tell me why you asked me here.

611
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,140
I have something serious.

612
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,100
What?

613
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:33,580
What's this?

614
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,900
Take a try.

615
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,180
Isn't it Feiwan Face Cream?

616
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,700
Try it again.

617
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,700
Why does it smell

618
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,620
different from before?

619
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,020
Exactly.

620
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,500
Because I added new ingredients.

621
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,980
The formula of
the new Feiwan Face Cream

622
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,500
has been upgraded.

623
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,540
It contains

624
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:03,180
skin-tightening medicinal materials.

625
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:05,100
And the most important thing is that

626
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,300
now the cost of Feiwan Face Cream

627
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:06,900
has been reduced,

628
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:08,460
and even ordinary people can afford it.

629
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,780
I'm still worried.

630
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,220
Feiwan Face Cream

631
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:13,860
is famous for

632
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,260
its precious medicinal materials.

633
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,300
How can ordinary people

634
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:17,060
understand your consideration

635
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,460
in changing the formula?

636
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,980
What if those

637
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,300
rich young ladies

638
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,780
say they have a bad taste?

639
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:23,500
I am not afraid.

640
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,020
Effect speaks louder than words.

641
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,140
I am not afraid of their judgment.

642
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,060
It makes sense.

643
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,420
You should try it first.

644
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,780
If it works well,

645
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,900
let's find a way

646
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,820
to promote it.

647
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:34,820
Okay.

648
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,220
Here, take it.

649
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:37,780
- By the way,
- Thank you.

650
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,580
we recently

651
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,660
launched a new product.

652
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:40,260
Would you like to try?

653
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:40,660
Sure.

654
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,580
Okay, Lan'er.

655
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,620
Show them around.

656
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,260
Ladies, this way, please.

657
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,140
I'd like to take a look.

658
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,260
I'd like to take a look at this.

659
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,060
This is our new product.

660
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,020
Good.

661
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:50,260
- Take a try.
- Yes.

662
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:50,780
This.

663
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,620
I like the smell.

664
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,060
Your Ladyship.

665
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,060
Gui Bai.

666
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,940
What's up?

667
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:58,140
Wang Jinyao's case

668
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:58,980
has been closed.

669
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,460
Closed?

670
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,100
He...

671
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,500
His Lordship is going to Liu's Village

672
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,300
to comfort the villagers.

673
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,900
He wants to go with you...

674
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:05,500
When?

675
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:05,940
I am also going.

676
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,660
Then let's go now.

677
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:32,940
How can I survive?

678
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,340
Gen!

679
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,740
Mr. Ning, Mrs. Ning.

680
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,700
Xiaobao, come over.

681
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,260
Mr. Ning, Mrs. Ning.

682
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:55,700
Why are you here?

683
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,740
You are back.

684
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:00,580
I knew you would come.

685
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,780
But Gen

686
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:06,460
will never come back.

687
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,980
Granny Liu.

688
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,540
My condolences.

689
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:12,700
If Mr. Ning

690
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,060
hadn't found out the truth,

691
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,740
we would have been

692
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,500
still kept in the dark.

693
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,940
Wang Jinyao committed
a heinous crime,

694
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:20,820
disregarded human lives,

695
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:22,620
and tricked innocent men

696
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,540
to replace the pirates.

697
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,460
Wang Jinyao has already pleaded guilty.

698
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,620
All the truth came out in the wash.

699
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,820
No one else

700
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,380
will be victimized in the future.

701
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,620
If it weren't for Mr. Ning,

702
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:35,220
our husbands

703
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,820
would bear the stigma of pirates

704
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:39,220
until their death.

705
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,140
Mr. Ning, Mrs. Ning.

706
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,740
Everyone of Liu's Village...

707
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,860
Don't do this, granny.

708
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:46,620
Don't do this. Don't do this.

709
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:47,060
Get up.

710
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,540
Get up. Get up.

711
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,620
- Get up, everyone.
- Get up.

712
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,780
- Don't do this.
- Get up.

713
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:51,540
Get up.

714
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,380
- Get up.
- Get up.

715
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,540
Come on.

716
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:55,020
Come on.

717
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,540
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

718
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,940
Get up first.

719
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,820
As the magistrate of Haifang,

720
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,180
I will definitely give everyone

721
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:03,060
a peaceful life.

722
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,140
Poor Xiaobao.

723
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,860
How will the two of us

724
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:12,020
make a living in the future?

725
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,220
Mrs. Zhen.

726
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,980
Everyone, don't worry.

727
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,300
From now on, the government

728
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,300
will bring you food

729
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:18,940
every month

730
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,340
to ensure your supply.

731
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:21,900
I will definitely let you

732
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:23,100
have a peaceful life.

733
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,180
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

734
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,060
Thank you, Mrs. Ning.

735
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,220
Thank you.

736
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,340
Thank you, Mrs. Ning.

737
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,180
Xiaobao, don't cry.

738
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,060
Remember.

739
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,740
From now on,

740
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:37,620
no one will bully the people

741
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,940
in the village.

742
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:41,020
Grow up quickly.

743
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,140
And only after that can you

744
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,980
protect everyone

745
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,300
in the village.

746
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,220
Understand?

747
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:49,420
Xiaobao, did you hear?

748
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,620
I see.

749
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,620
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

750
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,740
Thank you, Mrs. Ning.

751
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:58,300
Thank you.

752
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:01,500
You are so kind.

753
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Thank you.

754
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:16,140
What are you thinking about?

755
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,260
Now the truth came to light.

756
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,020
But their husbands

757
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:28,220
and those kids

758
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,980
will never come back.

759
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,740
You have now

760
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,700
eradicated the biggest cancer

761
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,620
in Haifang.

762
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,780
I believe

763
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,860
this is enough to

764
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:50,020
comfort their spirits in heaven.

765
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,260
Do you think

766
00:31:00,740 --> 00:31:01,420
I've done enough?

767
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,100
You will definitely

768
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:05,900
do a better job than now

769
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:06,820
in the future.

770
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,380
I believe in you.

771
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,700
What?

772
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,300
Why are you looking at me like this?

773
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,260
I am wondering

774
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:30,660
what kind of person

775
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,620
you really are.

776
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,900
What do you mean?

777
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,540
Look.

778
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,980
You are a moneygrubber,

779
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:44,820
a glutton,

780
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,660
with a bad temper.

781
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Am I such a person

782
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:57,340
in your heart?

783
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,460
You keep saying that

784
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,500
we have to clarify our responsibilities.

785
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,260
You care about everything.

786
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,300
Even if it is a trivial matter,

787
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,980
you will hold me accountable.

788
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:08,980
You...

789
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,340
Are you going to praise me
or scold me?

790
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,380
But at the supreme moment,

791
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:15,980
you rushed out to save me

792
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,940
without hesitation,

793
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,340
even disregarding your own life.

794
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,300
In my heart,

795
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:28,940
you seem to have become

796
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,940
a very important person.

797
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,180
You are the same to me.

798
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,700
I have indeed been avoiding you

799
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,060
these days.

800
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,460
Because I have no idea...

801
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,220
I don't know

802
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:56,420
how to face you,

803
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,940
and I don't know

804
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,780
how to face myself.

805
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:05,900
Tell me.

806
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,420
How long

807
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,540
will I have to live

808
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,460
as Nie Sangyu?

809
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,620
When can I

810
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,100
be Ji Man again?

811
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:18,020
When can I

812
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,580
be with you

813
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:21,580
fair and square

814
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,140
as Ji Man?

815
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:45,740
Trust me.

816
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:48,180
I will definitely give you

817
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:49,140
a satisfactory answer.

818
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,700
Of course I trust you.

819
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,060
Otherwise I wouldn't have come.

820
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:10,900
Place your bet.

821
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,420
Go.

822
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:12,780
I won.

823
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:13,500
Tai.

824
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,820
Tai.

825
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,300
I will follow you.

826
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,140
- Tai.
- Tai.

827
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:21,260
- Sai.
- Tai.

828
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:22,340
- Sai.
- Sai.

829
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,180
Sai. Sai. Sai.

830
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:27,100
Sai. Sai. Sai.

831
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:29,100
Sai. Sai. Sai.

832
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:33,340
I won again!

833
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,060
I quit.

834
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:39,420
I kept winning yesterday,

835
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,100
why did I keep losing today?

836
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,500
I am leaving.

837
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,540
Mr. Qian.

838
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,620
Try it again.

839
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:44,620
Since you lost,

840
00:34:44,620 --> 00:34:45,820
let's win the money back.

841
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:46,540
No way.

842
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,500
My luck is gone.

843
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:47,860
I am leaving.

844
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,460
Mr. Qian.

845
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,940
Did you quit?

846
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:54,540
I won't come here anymore.

847
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:56,060
Alright.

848
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:58,860
Then please settle the bill.

849
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,620
How much?

850
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,100
(Borrower Qian Bingyan)

851
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,020
One thousand taels.

852
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,620
How is it possible to be
so much money?

853
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:09,300
Sir.

854
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:10,580
For three days and three nights,

855
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,820
you kept borrowing

856
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,700
and losing money.

857
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,900
You don't think

858
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:17,300
the money is yours, do you?

859
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:19,980
Sir.

860
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,580
We did lose so much money

861
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,540
these days.

862
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,980
But I don't have that much money on me.

863
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:29,620
What?

864
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,060
I don't have that much money.

865
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,900
This is the first time
I've heard of someone

866
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:37,380
coming to the casino
without bringing money.

867
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,180
Don't you have money?

868
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:42,260
Mr. Qian.

869
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,060
Let me go.

870
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,740
Let me go. Mr. Qian!

871
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,620
- Mr. Qian!
- You are really a young master.

872
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,780
Let me go.

873
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,060
It'd okay that you don't have money.

874
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:51,740
Just leave something behind.

875
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:53,940
I have money.

876
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,620
Where?

877
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,260
My sister.

878
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,540
My sister is at Magistrate's Residence.

879
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:00,020
Ask her for money.

880
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,420
Okay.

881
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:13,980
Mr. Qian.

882
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,100
Are you okay?

883
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:16,420
I am fine.

884
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,060
I am so scared.

885
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,820
It's all right.

886
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,740
Miss Qian, the doorman brought a letter

887
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,180
and said it should be delivered
to you as soon as possible.

888
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:26,470
Letter?

889
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:32,260
(Sister, please come to rescue me
with money.)

890
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:35,580
Miss Qian, what's up?

891
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,780
Nothing, I see.

892
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:39,660
You should go.

893
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:40,540
Yes.

894
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:46,620
(Prevent my hand from being cut off.)

895
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:48,660
Cut off?

896
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:50,740
(Your brother Bingyan.)

897
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,980
(Dongshan Casino)

898
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,260
Dongshan Casino?

899
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,980
Haifang?

900
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:03,980
Sister.

901
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,100
Sister.

902
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,940
You are finally here to save me.

903
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,220
Save me!

904
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:14,260
Save me!

905
00:37:15,660 --> 00:37:16,700
- Have you brought the money?
- Sister.

906
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,820
I didn't lie to you.

907
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,300
We are relatives of Mr. Ning.

908
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,460
Mr. Ning is my cousin.

909
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,260
Let me go.

910
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:21,900
Shut up.

911
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,020
Sir.

912
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,700
How much does my brother owe you?

913
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:33,660
Not much.

914
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,300
One thousand taels.

915
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,700
Sister.

916
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,420
Save me.

917
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,820
- My brother's ignorance
- Save me.

918
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:43,180
is causing you trouble.

919
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,140
Please forgive him.

920
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,340
But

921
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,220
one thousand taels

922
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,300
is a lot of money.

923
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,780
What about this?

924
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,660
I'll write you an IOU.

925
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,100
Let him go first.

926
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,020
I'll collect the money.

927
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,020
How long?

928
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,060
How long?

929
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:03,180
Sister!

930
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:08,300
A month.

931
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:09,980
Bingyan!

932
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:13,940
Sister, save me!

933
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,340
Bingyan!

934
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,780
- Bingyan!
- No!

935
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,780
Save me!

936
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,820
Let go of my brother!

937
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,740
Let go of my brother!

938
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,260
A month?

939
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,100
Do you think he can last this long?

940
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:25,580
Ten days! Ten days!

941
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,580
Save me, sister!

942
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,740
I will collect the money in ten days.

943
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,020
Sister!

944
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,340
Sister!

945
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:39,220
Save me, sister!

946
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,300
Save me!

947
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:44,820
Bingyan!

948
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,340
Bingyan!

949
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:49,980
Not even ten days.

950
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:51,460
Bingyan!

951
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:56,180
I will give you money in three days.

952
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,620
Three days!

953
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,220
Three days!

954
00:39:01,060 --> 00:39:01,820
Three days!

955
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:07,060
I am begging you.

956
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,340
Save me!

957
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,860
Sister!

958
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,300
Three days.

959
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,020
Three days,

960
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,780
I will be waiting for you.

961
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,540
Three days.

962
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:23,180
Keep an eye on him.

963
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:23,860
- Yes.
- Yes.

964
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:26,980
Save me!

965
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,460
