=Episode 27=

3
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:45,900
I caught you, huh?

4
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:46,930
Look. Look.

5
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,170
Whose dress is this?

6
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,900
What the...

7
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,370
And one more.

8
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,540
How dare you…

9
00:01:59,500 --> 00:01:59,930
It's

10
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,700
a man's wedding robe...

11
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,610
Wedding robe?

12
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:16,940
And this is my size.

13
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,010
It's my wedding robe.

14
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,610
I should put it back.

15
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,450
This sneaker,

16
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,860
he's keeping it from me.

17
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,570
I got to watch my diet now.

18
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:46,220
Your Lordship.

19
00:02:46,820 --> 00:02:47,770
Your Lordship.

20
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:05,290
Ning Yuxuan.

21
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,490
The wedding robe is done.

22
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,660
Ning Yuxuan.

23
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,170
Ning Yuxuan.

24
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:09,770
Dear.

25
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,570
Ning…

26
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,170
You are finally back.

27
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:17,140
What are you doing here?

28
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,610
I've been waiting for you.

29
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:20,860
What took you so long?

30
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:21,980
I…

31
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:26,330
I have something to tell you.

32
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,570
This year…

33
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:33,330
What is it?

34
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:35,660
Why are you laughing?

35
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,490
Never mind.

36
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,660
Nothing.

37
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,660
This year's

38
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,610
Imperial Supplier Contest

39
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:46,860
will be held in Haifang next month.

40
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:48,730
Haifang.

41
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:50,450
I know.

42
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:52,490
You…

43
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,450
You know?

44
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,050
Mr. Qin

45
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,610
went to Haoxue Cosmetics this morning

46
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,450
and told us already.

47
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,890
I was wondering where you were.

48
00:03:58,890 --> 00:03:59,980
This Qin Yixian…

49
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,050
The document has just been issued.

50
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,490
I…

51
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:03,610
I wanted to make sure

52
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,700
that the court

53
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,140
put cosmetics on the list.

54
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,450
I didn't want you to feel let down,

55
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:07,890
so…

56
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:08,890
So, is it on the list?

57
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,050
Of course it is, otherwise…

58
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,220
So we can participate in the Contest?

59
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,420
You bet we can.

60
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:15,140
The document also says

61
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,290
that whoever wins

62
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,170
the Contest

63
00:04:17,170 --> 00:04:17,780
will be appointed

64
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,100
as the chairman of the Sea Trade Guild.

65
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:24,490
Don't… Don't look at me this way.

66
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,340
Let me make it clear.

67
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:28,490
Even though you are my wife,

68
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,100
I will not treat you differently

69
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,130
from the others.

70
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,100
I can't

71
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,980
favor anybody.

72
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:40,100
What do you mean?

73
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,660
You mean I have to

74
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:42,780
rely on you other than

75
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:43,250
my own strength?

76
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Of course you have strength.

77
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,290
How could you say that?

78
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,250
Anything else?

79
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:50,130
Wish you success.

80
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,460
Enough about it.

81
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,690
Is there anything else?

82
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,780
Anything else?

83
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,420
No.

84
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:00,930
Are…

85
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,490
Are… Are you sure?

86
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,490
I am.

87
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,370
Really?

88
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,810
Really.

89
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,130
Then I'm leaving.

90
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:22,580
Hey, I'm really leaving.

91
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,370
I'm so tired.

92
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:27,980
See you.

93
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:31,490
Fine.

94
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,860
Your Lordship,

95
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,900
the thing you asked me to…

96
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,980
So tired.

97
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,100
She didn't find out, right?

98
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:04,860
Your Lordship.

99
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,220
You've kept me busy for days.

100
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:12,460
I'm exhausted.

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,780
Please propose to her soon.

102
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,170
I will.

103
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:19,460
I've

104
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,290
had a plan.

105
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:25,130
I don't need you to tell me what to do.

106
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,460
He wouldn't tell me.

107
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,170
Don't think I don't know.

108
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,370
How come I have dark circles now?

109
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:00,250
What a shame.

110
00:07:06,490 --> 00:07:08,290
I must look the best

111
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,580
on my wedding day.

112
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,130
Your Ladyship.

113
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:12,810
Gui Bai?

114
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:14,220
What are you doing here?

115
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:16,020
These are the pastries

116
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,490
from the new bakery in the market.

117
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,460
They are for you.

118
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,130
Please take them back.

119
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,690
I'm

120
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,020
on a diet right now.

121
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,420
I'll pass.

122
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,370
His Lordship said

123
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:33,420
you'd like them.

124
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,460
He said that?

125
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,780
Since he said it,

126
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,580
I'll keep it.

127
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:51,050
My job is done here.

128
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,490
Please enjoy.

129
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:53,340
I'll take my leave.

130
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:54,690
Alright.

131
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,810
You do know me well.

132
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:19,730
What's this?

133
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:46,890
Ji Man,

134
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:49,980
I'd like to trade my three lives

135
00:08:51,100 --> 00:08:52,490
for your happiness of one lifetime.

136
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:55,410
Marry me.

137
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,890
Be my real wife.

138
00:08:58,940 --> 00:08:59,610
Okay?

139
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:07,940
How did I do?

140
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,010
Don't you feel

141
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:12,460
the urge to say yes?

142
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,820
Your Lordship,

143
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,370
it doesn't matter what I say.

144
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,610
You need to make
Her Ladyship say yes.

145
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:27,650
Now, get out.

146
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,460
Watch it.

147
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,940
My flower petals.

148
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,730
Muxu,

149
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,460
Sang Shen,

150
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,060
come here.

151
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:43,180
Do I look good in this dress?

152
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,340
What's wrong?

153
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,650
Does it make me look too pale?

154
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,700
It's...

155
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,180
Very nice!

156
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,820
You look so pretty, My Lady.

157
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,730
Do I have to change to another headband?

158
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:57,650
No.

159
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,770
It fits perfectly with your dress.

160
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,300
What about my hair wear?

161
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:00,580
Should I wear a necklace

162
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,650
or

163
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:02,300
a pair of earrings?

164
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:02,610
No.

165
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:03,650
You look pretty just the way it is.

166
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,180
Really?

167
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:04,650
Really.

168
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,460
My Lady,

169
00:10:08,130 --> 00:10:09,580
something's wrong with you.

170
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:12,010
What's wrong?

171
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,370
You changed your dress

172
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,250
and put on makeup.

173
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,460
Where are you going?

174
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,130
Yeah, where?

175
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:24,490
It's a secret.

176
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,340
Secret?

177
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,100
I see.

178
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,370
Her Ladyship dressed up so nicely.

179
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,610
I bet she's having a date
with His Lordship.

180
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:31,700
What are you talking about?

181
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:33,010
Miss Ji is stunning.

182
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,730
Ning Yuxuan is not

183
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:34,820
her only admirer.

184
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,610
What does that mean?

185
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,730
I mean Ning Yuxuan
is not good enough for her.

186
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:37,610
Tonight,

187
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,100
(Haoxue Cosmetics)
I'll go by myself.

188
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,580
Do not follow me.

189
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,180
Got it?

190
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,940
My Lady, you can't.

191
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,610
It's getting dark outside.

192
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,770
Where are you going alone?

193
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,060
I'm not a kid anymore.

194
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:46,700
Don't worry about me.

195
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,340
See you.

196
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:48,700
But…

197
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,370
Man.

198
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,580
Dad?

199
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,610
Mr. Ji.

200
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,300
Dad!

201
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:07,220
You are finally back.

202
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,940
Silly girl.

203
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,370
It's okay. Everything's fine.

204
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,180
When did you come back?

205
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,010
I came to see you as soon as I arrived.

206
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,580
Come on, let's talk inside.

207
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:16,770
Not inside.

208
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,130
It's not convenient to talk here.

209
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,410
Let's go somewhere else.

210
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:22,980
It's been four hours,

211
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,980
and she's still not here.

212
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,770
Gui Bai,

213
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,980
are you sure

214
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,340
you delivered the box to her?

215
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,100
I did.

216
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,770
I put a note inside.

217
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:39,530
She

218
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,220
should've read it, right?

219
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:44,650
You put a note inside?

220
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,820
I…

221
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,700
Your Lordship.

222
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,370
Her Ladyship's here. Get ready.

223
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,370
Your Lordship,

224
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:00,010
Muxu just went to
the Magistrate's Residence and said

225
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,220
Her Ladyship left with an old gentleman

226
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,490
outside Haoxue Cosmetics.

227
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:05,770
An old gentleman?

228
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:06,340
Yes.

229
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:07,490
Muxu said

230
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:08,650
she didn't know that man.

231
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,220
She heard Her Ladyship call him dad,

232
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,490
and Sang Shen call him Mr. Ji.

233
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:12,980
Her Ladyship hasn't come back

234
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,940
since she left with him.

235
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,370
Alright.

236
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:18,530
I see.

237
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,730
I'll take my leave.

238
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,010
Your Lordship.

239
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:23,820
He's back.

240
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,490
Who?

241
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,580
Guihai Warrior.

242
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,580
Dad,

243
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,340
why did you bring me here?

244
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,530
We could've caught up

245
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,580
in Haoxue Cosmetics.

246
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,370
No rush.

247
00:12:35,370 --> 00:12:35,980
Let's stay here

248
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,250
and catch up first.

249
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,460
I finally found you.

250
00:12:42,610 --> 00:12:43,650
I'd been looking for you

251
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:44,940
in the capital for months,

252
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,300
yet there was no sign of you.

253
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,700
I was worried sick.

254
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,340
Alright, Dad.

255
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,730
It was my bad.

256
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,610
I shouldn't have

257
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:54,860
gone to the capital
without telling you.

258
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,770
Sorry, I have made you worry.

259
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,980
Mr. Ji,

260
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:59,770
it's not Miss Ji's fault.

261
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:01,010
She suffered from amnesia,

262
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:02,410
and she even forgot me.

263
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,610
Amnesia?

264
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,340
That was awful.

265
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,010
Now,

266
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,730
let me take a look at you.

267
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:11,180
Dad,

268
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:12,530
look,

269
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,130
I've recovered.

270
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,300
Do you recognize me?

271
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:16,060
Of course.

272
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:16,860
Why wouldn't I?

273
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:18,370
Good. I'm glad.

274
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,490
Come on, sit down.

275
00:13:20,770 --> 00:13:21,410
Dad,

276
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,490
you can go to Haoxue Cosmetics

277
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:23,890
to find me in the future.

278
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,220
I tell you what,

279
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,130
I'm the owner

280
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,100
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

281
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,940
You can go there anytime you want.

282
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,860
Don't worry.

283
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:29,940
Any time will do.

284
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:30,860
I just

285
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,220
came back to Haifang,

286
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:34,370
and I didn't know about your situation.

287
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,890
If Ning Yuxuan caught us

288
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,060
meeting each other there,

289
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,410
he'd get suspicious.

290
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:41,370
Don't worry, Dad.

291
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,890
Ning Yuxuan

292
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,460
has known

293
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:46,700
that I'm Ji Man.

294
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:47,890
And he knows

295
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,940
that I'm your daughter.

296
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:51,530
What?

297
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,770
He knows already?

298
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,580
Yes.

299
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,060
Then, did he

300
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,300
do something to you?

301
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,580
Why are you looking like that, Dad?

302
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,770
He's not a ghost anyway.

303
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:03,730
What are you afraid of?

304
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,610
Man.

305
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:15,530
You are hiding something from me.

306
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,250
I'm not.

307
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,370
Are you sure?

308
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,770
I'm sure.

309
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,410
Fine.

310
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:30,250
Then I have a question for you.

311
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:30,890
Go ahead.

312
00:14:33,770 --> 00:14:34,250
You have

313
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:35,370
a natural daughter, don't you?

314
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,460
Nonsense.

315
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:41,060
I have one daughter only, and it's you.

316
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,530
No way.

317
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,940
I was

318
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,300
mistaken for

319
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,700
Ning Yuxuan's wife

320
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,410
because they all said

321
00:14:48,410 --> 00:14:49,250
I looked exactly

322
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,460
like his wife.

323
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,530
That's why

324
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,340
I was brought to the Ning's Mansion.

325
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,130
After thinking about it,

326
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,410
if you don't have

327
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:57,490
another daughter,

328
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,370
what are the odds
for something like this to happen?

329
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:03,460
Get up and sit down.

330
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:07,770
Coincidence happens all the time.

331
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,220
And it's not strange
that two people look alike.

332
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
Now that I'm back,

333
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:13,410
let's forget

334
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,610
about the past.

335
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,460
You should

336
00:15:15,650 --> 00:15:17,820
get your life back on track.

337
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:21,060
Ship Guihai is your home.

338
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:22,980
I know.

339
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,340
But, Dad,

340
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,100
I want to discuss this

341
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,340
with Ning Yuxuan

342
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,530
before I make a decision.

343
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,940
I'm not in a hurry to go back.

344
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:30,580
You two have nothing
to do with each other.

345
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:31,980
Why do you

346
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,530
need his approval to go home?

347
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,130
That's not true.

348
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:35,700
In Haifang,

349
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:37,370
my identity is his wife.

350
00:15:37,650 --> 00:15:39,100
Everybody thinks so.

351
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,220
Well,

352
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,770
if people find out

353
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:43,370
my real identity,

354
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:45,700
how is he supposed to govern this place?

355
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,580
It'll cause him trouble.

356
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:50,980
You should mind your own business.

357
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,100
Why do you

358
00:15:52,890 --> 00:15:54,530
care so much about him?

359
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,650
Mr. Ji,

360
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:57,860
you may not know

361
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,940
that Miss Ji went to the capital

362
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,100
to look for Ning Yuxuan, the one she loves.

363
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:03,010
Man,

364
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:06,220
don't tell me

365
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,490
you two are already

366
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,700
in a relationship.

367
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,940
We are not.

368
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,730
Not yet, at least.

369
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:20,370
But, it's happening.

370
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,580
That's ridiculous.

371
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,580
You can't stay
in the Magistrate's Residence

372
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,180
like this anymore.

373
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:32,300
There's nothing going on between us.

374
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,820
Dad,

375
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:34,410
we didn't do anything wrong,

376
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,460
and we stay in separate rooms.

377
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,130
Or what?

378
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,220
You want to move in with him?

379
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,340
Come on, Dad.

380
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:41,890
Listen,

381
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,730
please go back first.

382
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,980
I've still got something to do.

383
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:46,820
I'll go to visit you tomorrow.

384
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,700
Where are you going?

385
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,530
We finally got together.

386
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,340
Don't you want to stay longer with me?

387
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,730
Of course I do.

388
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,770
But…

389
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:57,460
But I've got something

390
00:16:57,650 --> 00:16:58,460
to do tonight.

391
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,340
No.

392
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,130
Now that I'm back,

393
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,610
I won't let you

394
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:04,260
stay in his residence anymore.

395
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,450
I have an appointment with him tonight.

396
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:07,500
I really have to go.

397
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,340
You must go back to the ship with me.

398
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:10,860
Dad,

399
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:11,970
please listen to me.

400
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:13,060
I really have to go.

401
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,540
I can't go back with you to the…

402
00:17:14,970 --> 00:17:15,650
No.

403
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,740
Come on. Let's go back to the ship.

404
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,060
- My Lady.
- Come on. Dad.

405
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,580
(Ship Guihai)

406
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:34,500
My Lady. My Lady.

407
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,780
Mr. Ning is outside.

408
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:37,340
Mr. Ning is here.

409
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,370
Mr. Ning is here?

410
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:38,860
Who?

411
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,450
His Lordship.

412
00:17:40,610 --> 00:17:41,820
Let him in.

413
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,020
We can't.

414
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,340
Mr. Ji and his people
are guarding outside.

415
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:44,970
That's right.

416
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:46,210
Good point. I forgot.

417
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:49,370
You two, go ahead
and lure them away. Come on.

418
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:51,500
Go.

419
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,370
You must've waited…

420
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,500
Waited for me for a long time yesterday.

421
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,740
It was worth it.

422
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,300
I was worried about you.

423
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:37,970
Why did your father

424
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,930
bring you back to the ship in a hurry?

425
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,890
Did something happen?

426
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,020
Nothing happened.

427
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:45,410
My father just thinks

428
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:46,500
that it's not proper for me

429
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,450
to stay in your residence.

430
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,580
Don't worry.

431
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,650
I'll take care of it.

432
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,060
You didn't sleep well

433
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,130
last night, did you?

434
00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:06,020
You got dark circles.

435
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:08,060
I look bad?

436
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,540
No.

437
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:11,540
You are always pretty.

438
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:21,410
Do you think your father

439
00:19:23,170 --> 00:19:23,970
has a misunderstanding

440
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:25,300
about me?

441
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:26,890
Maybe I should explain it to him.

442
00:19:27,450 --> 00:19:28,930
Don't think too much.

443
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,450
My father is very open-minded.

444
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:32,930
And he told me

445
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,340
that he'd have my back

446
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:35,860
no matter with whom I fall in love.

447
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,340
That's why I had the courage to go

448
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:38,170
to the capital to look for you.

449
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:39,580
That makes sense.

450
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,210
After all,

451
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,020
you traveled thousands of miles

452
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,740
to look for your Mr. Right.

453
00:19:44,690 --> 00:19:45,580
I should

454
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:46,610
thank your father.

455
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:49,970
Stop making fun of me.

456
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:56,410
I missed you so much.

457
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:20,820
Who is it?

458
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,260
Dad.

459
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:25,410
Dad…

460
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,260
Mr. Ji, nice to meet you.

461
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:29,020
Dad,

462
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,890
this…

463
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:31,890
This is…

464
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,930
Mr. Ning,

465
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,780
why didn't you

466
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,170
let me know you were here?

467
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,690
You two met in secret.

468
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:39,020
How inappropriate!

469
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:43,780
I'm Ning Yuxuan.

470
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,410
Nice to meet you, Mr. Ji.

471
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,170
I'm sorry if I offended you.

472
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:50,820
You are an official,

473
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,820
and I'm just a businessman.

474
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,540
I dare not have you apologize to me.

475
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:54,340
Dad.

476
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,370
Ji Man

477
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,860
somehow

478
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,340
exchanged identities

479
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,130
with my wife Nie Sangyu.

480
00:21:01,340 --> 00:21:03,100
I should've told you about that earlier.

481
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,580
But I just found out recently

482
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,100
what happened exactly.

483
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:08,610
It's my fault that I

484
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,020
had you worried for long.

485
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:11,860
It's also my fault.

486
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,130
Now that you've found out

487
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:13,860
what happened,

488
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,740
and you said yourself

489
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,740
that your wife is Nie Sangyu,

490
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,690
then you should understand

491
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,890
that Man

492
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:23,340
cannot replace your wife

493
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,450
and keep staying in your residence

494
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,820
without a proper cause.

495
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,450
Dad,

496
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,340
Ning Yuxuan had nothing

497
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,690
to do with my amnesia.

498
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
And

499
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,610
there's no misunderstanding
between us anymore.

500
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,890
Actually…

501
00:21:33,890 --> 00:21:34,690
Actually what?

502
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,860
Are you going to be called
Nie Sangyu for the rest of your life?

503
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:38,860
I'm not…

504
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:40,970
I know what your father means.

505
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,610
Honestly, I don't want Ji Man

506
00:21:43,890 --> 00:21:45,340
to live under another
woman's name either.

507
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,410
I was going

508
00:21:46,820 --> 00:21:48,210
to give her a proper title,

509
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,930
and bring her betrothal presents

510
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,930
to propose to her

511
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,450
and make her

512
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:56,890
my one and only wife.

513
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:06,340
But because

514
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,610
she's a second-rank lady
with imperial mandate,

515
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,890
although I'll marry her,

516
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,450
she has to keep her real name

517
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,260
a secret for the time being.

518
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,610
And later, I promise

519
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,260
I'll find a solution to this.

520
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,300
Fine.

521
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,650
But,

522
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,690
to be my son-in-law,

523
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:23,540
you must possess two qualities.

524
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:26,060
One, honesty.

525
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:27,650
And two, diligence.

526
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,610
You've already lied to the public

527
00:22:29,610 --> 00:22:31,100
about my daughter's real identity.

528
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,930
As for diligence,

529
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,820
you are the magistrate of Haifang,

530
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,130
a high-ranking official.

531
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,170
You can order your subordinates

532
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,930
to do anything for you.

533
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,610
How do I know you are diligent?

534
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,410
Dad,

535
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:43,260
you may not know

536
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,100
that while you were away,

537
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,020
Ning Yuxuan

538
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,690
did many good deeds

539
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,060
and

540
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,100
worked hard in the interest

541
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,580
of the people in Haifang.

542
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:50,650
So what?

543
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:52,970
That's his job.

544
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:54,300
Mr. Ning,

545
00:22:54,370 --> 00:22:55,450
the trade in Haifang

546
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,650
relies on the wharf.

547
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,260
As the local magistrate,

548
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,690
do you know

549
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:00,890
how many hours

550
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,450
the dockmen work every day,

551
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,020
how much they make,

552
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:05,740
and if there's any injustice?

553
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:09,260
But the Dragon Gang

554
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,890
is in charge of the wharf affairs, Dad.

555
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,370
Mr. Ji, thank you for your reminder.

556
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,210
The Imperial Supplier Contest

557
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,170
will be held soon.

558
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,500
The wharf will be busier

559
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,260
during that time.

560
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:18,410
I should

561
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:18,930
pay more attention to…

562
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:20,540
Mr. Ning, please say no more.

563
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:22,410
There's nothing for us to talk about,

564
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:23,740
official or private matters.

565
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,970
Forget about the proposal.

566
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:27,260
From now on,

567
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:29,820
Man must stay on Ship Guihai.

568
00:23:29,930 --> 00:23:31,060
She won't go back to your residence.

569
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,890
She won't go back?

570
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:34,340
- Why?
- Why?

571
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:35,610
I've figured out

572
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:36,650
a solution to have Man

573
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,780
leave your residence
without raising any questions.

574
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:41,540
What solution?

575
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,890
Divorce.

576
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:46,260
Dad,

577
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:48,170
what are you talking about?

578
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,370
I won't agree to that.

579
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:50,780
Please think again, Mr. Ji.

580
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:52,260
As for the rest,

581
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,450
I'll do my best
to meet your requirements.

582
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:55,860
Mr. Ji, please

583
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:57,450
give me a chance to prove myself.

584
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,540
Dad…

585
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:00,130
Mr. Ning, you are busy.

586
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:01,610
I won't keep you.

587
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,580
Please go back.

588
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,300
But…

589
00:24:07,690 --> 00:24:08,450
Sang Shen.

590
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,410
Sang Shen.

591
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:15,130
Your Lordship,

592
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:16,690
please go back first.

593
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,130
Then,

594
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,210
let me talk to my father.

595
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:36,130
Mr. Ji,

596
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,970
I'll take my leave.

597
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,540
But I won't give up.

598
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:51,540
Dad,

599
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,610
what's the matter with you?

600
00:24:52,610 --> 00:24:54,340
Why are you giving him a hard time?

601
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,210
What?

602
00:24:55,410 --> 00:24:56,740
Did I say anything wrong?

603
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,100
You…

604
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,780
Dad,

605
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,890
you once

606
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,300
told me that you'd

607
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:09,060
have my back no matter

608
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,740
with whom I fall in love.

609
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,820
How can you take it back

610
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,060
and break your promise today?

611
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:15,370
Man,

612
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:17,100
you can love anyone,

613
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,210
except

614
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:19,890
for Ning Yuxuan.

615
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,340
Why?

616
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,930
Because…

617
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:26,500
Because you are too young

618
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:28,780
and bewitched by him.

619
00:25:29,130 --> 00:25:29,890
I won't allow you

620
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,170
to see him anymore.

621
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:31,860
Dad,

622
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,410
I've grown up.

623
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:34,540
I'm not a kid anymore.

624
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,860
I know who's the right one for me,

625
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,820
and I'm sure

626
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,610
that I'm in love with him.

627
00:25:37,610 --> 00:25:38,970
I want to marry him.

628
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,410
No one can change my mind.

629
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:41,340
Marry him?

630
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,450
I won't let you.

631
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:47,740
And I'm not going

632
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,780
to divorce him either.

633
00:25:52,780 --> 00:25:53,580
You…

634
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:09,020
Make way, please.

635
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,690
Coming through.

636
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:16,540
Your Lordship.

637
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,060
Your Lordship.

638
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,740
Your Lordship, you haven't
seen Her Ladyship for days.

639
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,610
Is everything okay with you?

640
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,780
Why are you dressed like this

641
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,970
working on the wharf?

642
00:26:28,970 --> 00:26:31,020
Mr. Ji made a good point

643
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,970
that the Imperial Supplier Contest
is approaching,

644
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,020
but we know very little

645
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,060
about the wharf,

646
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:36,860
so I want to be here

647
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:37,890
in person

648
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:39,130
to conduct a secret inspection.

649
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,020
Then, I'll keep you company.

650
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,210
You don't have to.

651
00:26:44,690 --> 00:26:45,860
It'll catch people's attention.

652
00:26:45,930 --> 00:26:47,130
It's okay. I'll find something myself.

653
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,450
Go ahead and mind your own business.

654
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,890
Hurry, hurry.

655
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:58,060
Can you do it or not?

656
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,370
Are you blind?

657
00:27:06,690 --> 00:27:07,410
Sir,

658
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:08,500
excuse me,

659
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,260
are you still hiring?

660
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,300
You are too skinny. You can't work here.

661
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,860
Just leave.

662
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,540
Please let me try.

663
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,060
I… I can do this.

664
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,340
Alright.

665
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,260
Let's try one day first,

666
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:21,610
see if you can endure the hard work.

667
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:23,450
No payment if you don't
finish the whole day.

668
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:24,740
Alright.

669
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,300
Thank you.

670
00:27:26,130 --> 00:27:27,020
Thank you, sir.

671
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,410
Then

672
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,370
where shall I register?

673
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,450
Register?

674
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:33,450
Anybody can

675
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:34,450
work here.

676
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,370
No need to register.

677
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,020
Hurry.

678
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,300
Go to work.

679
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:41,780
Hey, what are you looking at?

680
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,410
Chen,

681
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:44,340
take him to work.

682
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:45,340
Count it carefully.

683
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:45,650
Come here.

684
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:46,450
Sir.

685
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,780
Come on. Let's do this.

686
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,610
Be steady.

687
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:52,690
Sir,

688
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:53,930
how long

689
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:55,100
do you have to work every day?

690
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,370
Till no more ships dock here.

691
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,930
That long?

692
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,930
And how much do you make?

693
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:02,740
It's hard to say.

694
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,260
It depends on the employer's mood.

695
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,260
It's not much.

696
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,260
That's tough.

697
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,500
Stop talking and get to work.

698
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,260
If the employer catches you chatting,

699
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,170
he'll fire you.

700
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:09,690
Hurry.

701
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:10,690
Come on.

702
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:11,930
Hurry up.

703
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,610
Watch it. Careful.

704
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,410
Look. Look.

705
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,100
It's only been a few months,

706
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,890
and Haifang has become so popular.

707
00:28:18,890 --> 00:28:19,580
Tell me about it.

708
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:20,860
There's more.

709
00:28:20,890 --> 00:28:21,650
Let's walk down a little.

710
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,610
Okay.

711
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:23,860
Let's go.

712
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,450
Dad, look.

713
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:26,340
Ever since

714
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:28,020
the establishment of
the Shipping Department,

715
00:28:28,020 --> 00:28:29,650
more and more people have

716
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:30,740
come to Haifang.

717
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:32,890
And because of the tax exemption,

718
00:28:32,890 --> 00:28:33,580
the market has become

719
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,860
more bustling than ever.

720
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,260
Good.

721
00:28:37,650 --> 00:28:38,370
On top of that,

722
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:39,370
such local gangsters

723
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:40,610
as Wang Jinyao

724
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:41,820
and Shen Liancheng

725
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,970
have all been removed.

726
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,340
So, our life in Haifang

727
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:46,370
will become better and better.

728
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,170
You said this much

729
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,450
just to tell me

730
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:51,930
that Ning Yuxuan
is credited with all this, right?

731
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:53,610
Come on.

732
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:54,890
No.

733
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:56,210
I'm only telling the truth.

734
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,300
None of these would've happened

735
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,020
without his hard work.

736
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,370
My Lady. My Lady.

737
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:01,340
Look at that person.

738
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,450
Isn't that Mr. Ning?

739
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,580
That one.

740
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:16,580
Is it?

741
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:19,540
It's him.

742
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:20,540
Why is he…

743
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,820
There are more in the back.

744
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,370
It is Ning Yuxuan. Well,

745
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:31,060
look. That's him, right?

746
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,820
The one in blue clothes.

747
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,300
It is him.

748
00:29:34,970 --> 00:29:35,930
Is Mr. Ning

749
00:29:35,930 --> 00:29:37,260
putting on a show for me?

750
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,580
Man,

751
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:39,860
did you bring me here

752
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,340
to watch him putting on a show?

753
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,610
What are you talking about, Dad?

754
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,410
I had no idea he was here.

755
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:48,130
Besides,

756
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,450
he's here to experience the hard work.

757
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:52,020
He's not putting on a show.

758
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:03,930
Don't be lazy. Keep working.

759
00:30:03,970 --> 00:30:04,450
Coming.

760
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,020
I'm talking to you.

761
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:08,370
(If parents do love their children,)

762
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:10,690
(they'll consider for them in the long run.)

763
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,020
(Ning Yuxuan,)

764
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,210
(I know)

765
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,890
(you are a good kid,)

766
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:18,370
(but you two aren't meant
to be together.)

767
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,060
(Haifang Wharf)

768
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:24,650
Chief,

769
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,130
our men said

770
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,100
a lot of daily-use articles

771
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,060
were brought on Ship Guihai.

772
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,540
And someone spotted that Ms. Nie

773
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,370
went to the market

774
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:31,210
with a middle-aged man.

775
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,210
Many people

776
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:33,500
called the middle-aged man

777
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,650
Mr. Ji.

778
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,610
Mr. Ji?

779
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:38,820
Could he

780
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:40,540
be Guihai Warrior?

781
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,300
Mr. Huang,

782
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,170
let's pay him a visit one day.

783
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:44,740
Okay.

784
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:46,890
I also want to find out

785
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,370
his relationship with Man.

786
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:49,970
Chief, here's the thing.

787
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,100
In my opinion,

788
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,890
after all,

789
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,780
you've just taken over
the position as the chief.

790
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,020
Guihai Warrior is
an influential businessman.

791
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,300
Age-wise,

792
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,020
he is

793
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,300
an elder of yours.

794
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:01,100
So, it's better for you

795
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,020
to send him a letter first

796
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:03,580
to notify him of your visit,

797
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,170
which will be much politer.

798
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:05,860
Besides,

799
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:07,300
Guihai Warrior

800
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,610
never cared

801
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:10,210
to collude with Shen Liancheng.

802
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,260
I'm sure

803
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:13,500
he's a righteous man.

804
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,780
It's a pity

805
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:16,100
that I'd never had a chance

806
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,170
to meet him in person.

807
00:31:17,690 --> 00:31:18,260
Chief,

808
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,210
now that

809
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:20,210
you are the new chief

810
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:21,580
of the Dragon Gang now.

811
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:22,780
There'll be many opportunities

812
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,780
for us to cooperate with him.

813
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,970
Why don't we take this chance

814
00:31:24,970 --> 00:31:26,930
to leave him with a good impression?

815
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:29,650
Mr. Huang, you are right.

816
00:31:30,650 --> 00:31:31,780
Then let's send him a letter first.

817
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,370
Okay.

818
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,410
Hurry.

819
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:35,020
My Lady. My Lady.

820
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:35,890
Come here, Sang Shen.

821
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,340
Lie down.

822
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,260
Careful.

823
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,340
Lie down. Come on.

824
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:42,930
Here.

825
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:44,370
Listen to me.

826
00:31:44,370 --> 00:31:45,060
If my father

827
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,100
comes here later,

828
00:31:46,170 --> 00:31:47,370
you can do my voice

829
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,210
and stop him from coming in.

830
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,860
My Lady, I can't do your voice.

831
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,410
Please stay. I'm afraid.

832
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:52,610
Don't worry.

833
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,860
I have something urgent
to talk to Ning Yuxuan.

834
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,650
I'll be right back.

835
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:55,650
Won't be longer

836
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,740
than two hours.

837
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,650
Moreover,

838
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,340
my father is in bed asleep already.

839
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:00,130
He won't come here.

840
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,130
Just relax.

841
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:03,130
- My Lady.
- Shh.

842
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,060
Now, go to sleep.

843
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,740
(Haifang Wharf)
Finally off work.

844
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:19,370
Yeah.

845
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,580
I know a nice steamed bun restaurant.

846
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,370
Let's go get some.

847
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:22,930
Sure.

848
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:24,540
Bro, are you coming?

849
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,780
You go first. I'll take a rest here.

850
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,210
Alright, then we are leaving.

851
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:29,780
Your Lordship.

852
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,260
It's getting late.

853
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:34,650
Let me escort you back home.

854
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,970
If I hadn't come to work here today,

855
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,130
I wouldn't have found out

856
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,410
that there is a big problem on the wharf.

857
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:49,610
Let's go.

858
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,500
Let me rest a little.

859
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:52,170
Ning Yuxuan.

860
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:53,890
Your Lordship,

861
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:55,450
I'll go stand guard for you.

862
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,020
What are you doing here?

863
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,170
You are really here.

864
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,300
Your hands are rubbed raw.

865
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,100
I'm fine.

866
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,970
Let me see.

867
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,450
No.

868
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,970
Come on.

869
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,610
Sit down.

870
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,540
Fortunately, I brought medicine.

871
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,650
I can't believe you.

872
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,610
You should be more careful.

873
00:33:29,820 --> 00:33:31,450
I just went to the Magistrate's Residence,
and you weren't there.

874
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:32,970
I knew you must've still been here.

875
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:35,100
My dad was just saying it.

876
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,740
Why did you take it so seriously?

877
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:37,780
It's okay.

878
00:33:38,130 --> 00:33:39,890
My father-in-law made a good point.

879
00:33:40,650 --> 00:33:41,890
Now that I worked here for a day,

880
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:43,100
I did find out a big problem

881
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,020
on the wharf.

882
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:46,340
Look,

883
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:47,450
the Imperial Supplier Contest

884
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:48,580
is coming up soon.

885
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,340
We should think about

886
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,130
how to make the wharf
function smoothly.

887
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,020
Who's your father-in-law?

888
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,340
Somebody didn't show up that night

889
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,260
and made me wait for so long.

890
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,820
I didn't know my dad would come back,

891
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,820
and I had no idea

892
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,530
my dad wouldn't allow me to see you.

893
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:17,050
I thought…

894
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:17,860
I know.

895
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,620
But why does your father

896
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,570
not allow us

897
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,660
to see each other?

898
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:29,410
Maybe…

899
00:34:29,970 --> 00:34:31,860
Maybe he just came back,

900
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,530
and

901
00:34:34,090 --> 00:34:35,410
he's having a hard time accepting it.

902
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:38,220
I'm not sure.

903
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:39,890
I've got

904
00:34:39,890 --> 00:34:40,860
to talk to him again.

905
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,860
How about this?

906
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,410
We can let Gui Bai and Muxu

907
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:46,450
help us set the time and place

908
00:34:46,450 --> 00:34:47,260
before we meet.

909
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:48,530
What do you say?

910
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:50,740
It's a good idea.

911
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:52,700
That'll work.

912
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,490
Let me see.

913
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,700
Why did you ask me out

914
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,820
to the riverside that day?

915
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,220
I…

916
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:17,490
That day…

917
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:20,490
Forget it.

918
00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:21,700
You missed it anyway.

919
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,450
I'll tell you later.

920
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,490
No.

921
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:27,300
I want to know.

922
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,050
Later.

923
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:29,780
Why later?

924
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,860
I will tell you later.

925
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:33,090
You are keeping something
from me, aren't you?

926
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:33,570
No.

927
00:35:34,530 --> 00:35:35,010
Later.

928
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:35,930
I'll tell you later.

929
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,530
Don't go.

930
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:37,450
I'll tell you later.

931
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:38,260
Ning Yuxuan.

932
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,490
Sang Shen.

933
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:47,220
Sang Shen, wake up.

934
00:35:47,410 --> 00:35:47,970
Sang Shen,

935
00:35:48,220 --> 00:35:49,260
wake up.

936
00:35:49,370 --> 00:35:50,300
I'm back.

937
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,450
My Lady.

938
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,050
My Lady, you are back.

939
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:55,780
Did my father come?

940
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,530
I don't think so.

941
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,220
Good.

942
00:36:01,410 --> 00:36:02,660
You can go back and sleep now.

943
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,340
Easy.

944
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,780
My Lady, then I'm leaving.

945
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:19,860
Mr. Ji.

946
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,180
You are up so early.

947
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:23,820
Sang Shen.

948
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:26,860
Mr. Ji.

949
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:27,620
Come with me.

950
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,090
What's up?

951
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,450
Sang Shen,

952
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,820
how do I treat you?

953
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:39,220
You treat me

954
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,180
like your own daughter.

955
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,700
Why?

956
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,300
Then you shouldn't put Man in trouble.

957
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:44,740
How could I do that? Mr. Ji,

958
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,090
Miss Ji is like a sister to me.

959
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:52,090
She stayed out the whole night.

960
00:36:52,090 --> 00:36:53,930
She must've gone to meet Ning Yuxuan.

961
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:54,970
Instead of stopping her,

962
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,660
you helped her keep it from me.

963
00:36:57,410 --> 00:36:58,180
If something

964
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,490
happens between them,

965
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,180
how is Man supposed
to get married in the future?

966
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,890
So, you still don't think
that you put her in trouble?

967
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,860
Mr. Ji,

968
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,090
it won't happen again.

969
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:05,930
What should I do then?

970
00:37:05,930 --> 00:37:06,620
Now,

971
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:09,890
to make up for your mistake,

972
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,010
from now on,

973
00:37:11,090 --> 00:37:12,410
I want you to keep an eye on her.

974
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,260
Let me know right away

975
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:15,890
if she goes to meet Ning Yuxuan.

976
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,180
Got it?

977
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,340
Okay.

978
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:20,370
You can count on me.

979
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:29,660
Dear.

980
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:30,890
Who is it?

981
00:37:38,370 --> 00:37:39,140
You are here.

982
00:37:48,450 --> 00:37:49,180
Are we alone?

983
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:49,970
Yes.

984
00:37:51,490 --> 00:37:52,340
Were you being followed?

985
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,490
No.

986
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,260
Dizzy, dizzy. I feel dizzy.

987
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,050
I feel a little dizzy.

988
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,260
Did you miss me?

989
00:38:10,890 --> 00:38:12,220
I feel dizzy, too.

990
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:13,740
Come on, have a seat.

991
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,930
Take it easy.

992
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:15,660
Easy.

993
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:16,530
Easy.

994
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,570
- So many…
- Shh.

995
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:21,530
I prepared the best dishes

996
00:38:21,530 --> 00:38:22,890
for you today.

997
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,140
Tastes good?

998
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,010
Mr. Ji,

999
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:35,530
it's here.

1000
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:41,010
Cheers.

1001
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,300
Dad.

1002
00:39:01,570 --> 00:39:03,300
Dad, what are you doing here?

1003
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:06,490
Ning Yuxuan…

1004
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:12,300
Ning Yuxuan is well-versed
in both literature and martial arts.

1005
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:15,260
He can defeat a group
of bandits all by himself.

1006
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:17,010
Mr. Ji,

1007
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:17,820
I…

1008
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,300
I'm good at combat.

1009
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,620
And once he confronts the bandits,

1010
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,780
he's able to wipe out all of them.

1011
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,050
No bandits will be left alive.

1012
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:23,890
He's upright, honest,

1013
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,370
strong-willed, and heroic.

1014
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,370
I can't stand

1015
00:39:27,370 --> 00:39:28,180
any wrongdoings.

1016
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:30,220
He also helps those in need often,

1017
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:30,890
cares a great deal for the people,

1018
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,260
and attaches importance

1019
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,140
to agricultural infrastructure.

1020
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:34,570
I…

1021
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,050
Mr. Ji,

1022
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:38,700
I'll take good care of Ji Man,

1023
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,570
and I won't let anybody hurt her.

1024
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:51,220
I…

1025
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,490
I…

1026
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:01,220
I'd better leave.

1027
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:32,700
Dad.

1028
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,660
I'm Yuan Lang.

1029
00:40:40,890 --> 00:40:42,660
I've heard so much
about you, Guihai Warrior.

1030
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:44,370
I'm here today to pay you a visit.

1031
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,930
It's such a great honor

1032
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,220
to have the new chief

1033
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:49,530
of the Dragon Gang

1034
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,090
visit our Ship Guihai.

1035
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:54,930
I didn't expect you to be this young

1036
00:40:54,930 --> 00:40:56,340
and good-looking.

1037
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,180
I'm flattered.

1038
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,620
I just arrived in Haifang

1039
00:40:58,930 --> 00:41:00,090
and made quite a few friends.

1040
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,530
I think this is the place
where I can fulfill my ambition.

1041
00:41:02,930 --> 00:41:03,890
You are the most

1042
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,780
influential businessman in Haifang.

1043
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,890
I feel honored to be here

1044
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:08,370
and learn from you.

1045
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:12,700
Chief Yuan, you are being modest.

1046
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:14,450
The future of Haifang

1047
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:15,530
belongs to young talents

1048
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:16,700
like you.

1049
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,700
These two gentlemen are…

1050
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,300
I'm Huang Han

1051
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,570
of the Dragon Gang.

1052
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:40,700
It's you.

1053
00:41:44,740 --> 00:41:45,300
I'm Lang.

1054
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:46,930
Greetings, Mr. Ji.

1055
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:49,140
Please rise.

1056
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,180
You are really Lang.

1057
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:55,700
How's your father doing?

1058
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
He's...

1059
00:41:59,050 --> 00:41:59,930
fine.

1060
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,410
But his health

1061
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,860
has declined a lot.

1062
00:42:10,180 --> 00:42:10,970
Mr. Ji,

1063
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,010
do you remember

1064
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:13,780
that I was afraid of pain

1065
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:14,660
when I was little,

1066
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:15,970
and I didn't want to get a tattoo?

1067
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,370
You helped me get away from it.

1068
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,220
Yes,

1069
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:21,700
I remember.

1070
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:23,820
You've grown up

1071
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:24,970
into a successful young man.

1072
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:26,300
You've even

1073
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,180
become a chief now.

1074
00:42:31,890 --> 00:42:33,370
And I didn't expect you

1075
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,050
to be

1076
00:42:35,370 --> 00:42:36,820
Guihai Warrior.

1077
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,260
Tiger

1078
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:41,740
is your codename in the Tea Gang.

1079
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:43,700
Ji Ming

1080
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:45,370
is your real name.

1081
00:42:47,410 --> 00:42:48,820
So, Ms. Nie

1082
00:42:50,090 --> 00:42:51,620
is actually Ji Man, right?

1083
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:54,970
Looks like

1084
00:42:56,010 --> 00:42:57,010
you've known

1085
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,490
that Ms. Nie of Haoxue Cosmetics

1086
00:42:58,490 --> 00:42:59,700
is Ji Man,

1087
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,010
right?

1088
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,220
Man's thing

1089
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:09,370
has been bothering me for days now.

1090
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,820
I can't believe

1091
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,370
she's in love with Ning Yuxuan.

1092
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:16,260
It's bad fate.

1093
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:18,050
I'm also worried

1094
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,450
that Man will be in danger

1095
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:20,450
staying with him.

1096
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:22,050
Maybe

1097
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,090
we should tell her

1098
00:43:24,090 --> 00:43:24,740
who she really is.

1099
00:43:24,740 --> 00:43:25,570
No.

1100
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,370
If it's possible,

1101
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:29,410
I hope Man

1102
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:31,450
will never find out who she really is.

1103
00:43:32,490 --> 00:43:34,260
I don't want her to go through that.

1104
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,490
The grudge of the last generation

1105
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:38,260
shouldn't burden the juniors.

1106
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:39,820
Then are we going to give up

1107
00:43:40,450 --> 00:43:41,740
on taking revenge?

1108
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:42,570
Lang,

1109
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:45,180
I've been doing business for years,

1110
00:43:45,450 --> 00:43:46,890
and I'm doing it for you guys.

1111
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:48,660
I want to put an end

1112
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,050
to the grudge held
by the last generation.

1113
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:53,410
I only want you and Man

1114
00:43:53,700 --> 00:43:55,140
to stay far away from hatred

1115
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:57,010
and danger.
