00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 26=

3
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:47,420
I have always admired

4
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:48,660
Her Ladyship's craftsmanship.

5
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:49,660
But face creams

6
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:51,780
work differently

7
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,180
on different people.

8
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,820
And I have

9
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,540
my own face cream.

10
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,900
Try it now.

11
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:01,100
Your Lordship...

12
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,100
You don't want it?

13
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:06,740
I do, of course.

14
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,340
It's from you, Your Lordship.

15
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,300
I would certainly love it.

16
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,740
But these days,

17
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,660
my skin feels bad.

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:16,660
So...

19
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,660
Let me help you.

20
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,940
No, thanks, Your Lordship.

21
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,260
You knew the user

22
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,340
would be paralyzed

23
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:32,660
or even dead right away!

24
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,620
Your Lordship,

25
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,580
I don't know what you're talking about.

26
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:38,500
Please don't force me.

27
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,900
Force you?

28
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,660
Your Ladyship, I...

29
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:49,940
You don't dare to admit

30
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,660
what you've done, huh?

31
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,500
I'm innocent.

32
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,420
Did Her Ladyship

33
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,460
tell you something?

34
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,260
I can confront her.

35
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,540
Under such circumstances,

36
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,060
you're still lying?

37
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,060
Lying?

38
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,220
Your Lordship,

39
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,540
you know me.

40
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:08,140
I'm always loyal

41
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,220
to you.

42
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,500
Since you and I

43
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,660
got married,

44
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,900
you've never

45
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,980
cared about me.

46
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,820
But it doesn't matter.

47
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,020
As long as I can stay by your side,

48
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,620
I would be satisfied.

49
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,660
But,

50
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,620
to make Her Ladyship happy,

51
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,180
you accuse me of something

52
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,380
I didn't do.

53
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:27,220
My heart would hurt, too.

54
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,060
That year,

55
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,180
for you,

56
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,860
I even lost my virginity.

57
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,340
Can Nie Sangyu do that?

58
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,060
What's exactly the truth

59
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:40,100
of the virginity thing?

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,420
You ran away from home

61
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,900
and your father asked me to get you back.

62
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:48,980
I accidentally saw you be humiliated.

63
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:52,540
With sympathy, I married you.

64
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,860
But are you really as innocent

65
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,420
as you appear to be?

66
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,300
Nie Sangyu was lashed.

67
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,820
Was it you behind it?

68
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:08,060
No.

69
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,500
Did she stab you at the wedding?

70
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:11,820
No.

71
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,700
Or did you pounce at her?

72
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,180
I didn't.

73
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,100
Those bandits...

74
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,540
Did you arrange them?

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,260
I always love you, Your Lordship.

76
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,300
Every day, you and Her Ladyship

77
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,140
have been intimate.

78
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,940
I have to pretend

79
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,660
I didn't care about that

80
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,340
and I have to remain generous.

81
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,940
I also have feelings.

82
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,420
Nie Sangyu is in no case

83
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,980
better than me!

84
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,540
The evidence is overwhelming.

85
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,420
Tanxiang confessed everything.

86
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:49,380
You'll now be sent back to the capital

87
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,620
for the Court of Judicial Review.

88
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,660
Ning Yuxuan!

89
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,180
Miss Wen...

90
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,980
Now that you don't trust me,

91
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:58,980
I will

92
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,740
kill myself to prove my innocence!

93
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,900
Are you done performing?

94
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,940
Take her away.

95
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,420
Yes, sir.

96
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,060
Go.

97
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,780
Ning Yuxuan!

98
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:41,860
Miss Wen!

99
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,540
All the farces

100
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,380
should come to an end.

101
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:32,580
Your timing couldn't be better.

102
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,820
Tanxiang confessed everything.

103
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,260
Wen Wan had someone

104
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,500
poison Feiwan Face Cream

105
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,860
so that you would be

106
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:46,780
utterly discredited.

107
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:51,380
I just didn't expect

108
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,460
she would even

109
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,460
sacrifice others' lives

110
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:57,140
just to

111
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,980
frame me.

112
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,900
She really hates me.

113
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,540
She hates you

114
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:07,140
because of me,

115
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,740
after all.

116
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,460
If I hadn't

117
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,620
married her,

118
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,460
there wouldn't be so much trouble, right?

119
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,860
Our families used to be old friends.

120
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,340
After my father was killed,

121
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,180
we seldom communicated.

122
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,740
But over one year ago,

123
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:35,460
her father suddenly came to me.

124
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:37,340
He said she ran away from home

125
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,700
and asked me to look
for her in the suburbs.

126
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,980
- Miss Wen!
- Miss Wen!

127
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,380
Miss Wen, where are you?

128
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:52,060
- Miss Wen!
- Miss Wen!

129
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:52,900
Where are you?

130
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,820
Miss Wen!

131
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:55,540
Your Lordship!

132
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,500
Miss Wen!

133
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,060
Your Lordship,

134
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,980
I kind of heard someone

135
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,060
scream ahead of us.

136
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,420
A lady, I think.

137
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,380
Let's go check it out.

138
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,940
Miss Wen!

139
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,100
Go wait out there.

140
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,860
Don't touch me. Stay off!

141
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,860
Miss Wen.

142
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,340
Mr. Ning?

143
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,860
I quarreled with my father

144
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,660
and ran out alone.

145
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,900
Unexpectedly, I met some bandits

146
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,100
and they dragged me here.

147
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,980
Failing to resist,

148
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:42,260
I was raped.

149
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,540
I took a dagger with me.

150
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,020
So, when he wasn't noticing,

151
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,940
I stabbed him.

152
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,820
What do I do, Mr. Ning?

153
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,700
I killed him. What do I do?

154
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,620
I killed him.

155
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:58,620
You were protecting herself.

156
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,060
You would be all right.

157
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,380
I can't be taken to the court.

158
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,220
Don't.

159
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,740
Why did you stop me?

160
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:16,380
I lost my virginity

161
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,500
and even killed a man.

162
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:19,420
If I'm taken to the court,

163
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,820
my father and I would live with shame.

164
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,140
Mr. Ning, I beg you.

165
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't let anyone else

166
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,260
know this.

167
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:28,900
Will you?

168
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,220
I beg you.

169
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:32,820
All right.

170
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,940
I promise you.

171
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,900
I've lost my virginity.

172
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,780
Even if I married someone,

173
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,020
he would

174
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,620
know about this.

175
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,100
Failing to explain,

176
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,860
I'll have to die.

177
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,780
Mr. Ning, what can I do?

178
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,020
Only you can help me.

179
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,380
What do I do?

180
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,260
Please help me.

181
00:10:02,260 --> 00:10:04,580
I beg you. Help me, please.

182
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,540
Under such circumstances,

183
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,260
you can marry me first.

184
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,980
After everything is over,

185
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,260
I'll think of another way.

186
00:10:21,740 --> 00:10:22,900
Surprisingly,

187
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,020
she had such an experience.

188
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,020
It's about her reputation.

189
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,340
So, I never told anyone

190
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,420
why I married her.

191
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,580
Got it.

192
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,980
But when she asked the servants

193
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,900
to lash you,

194
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,980
I started to realize

195
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,580
she wasn't as innocent

196
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,860
as she appeared to be.

197
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,340
I learned much later

198
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:46,900
that she was behind this.

199
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,740
For the sake of our family friendship,

200
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,540
I had planned to let her go.

201
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,100
But later,

202
00:10:57,100 --> 00:10:58,420
Haoxue Cosmetics was on fire.

203
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:00,060
After that,

204
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:02,780
I had her investigated.

205
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,780
Who would know it was even her

206
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:07,340
who arranged the rape thing?

207
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:12,260
That man wasn't a bandit,

208
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,580
but an innocent woodcutter.

209
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,940
She had

210
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,380
such crazy love for you.

211
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,180
She killed an innocent man.

212
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,180
Is it really love?

213
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,580
With irrefutable evidence,

214
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,620
they would be punished, anyway.

215
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,820
Don't worry.

216
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:37,100
No one would

217
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,060
scheme against you anymore.

218
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,020
Hope everything would be all right.

219
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,660
Herbs should be planted

220
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,340
(Liu's Village)
according to circumstances.

221
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,540
What does that mean?

222
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:08,740
Look, for example...

223
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:09,780
This.

224
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,100
Wild chrysanthemum.

225
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,180
Wild chrysanthemum?

226
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,620
And dandelion.

227
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,780
They can be planted

228
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,700
even in the wilderness.

229
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,900
It's easy to plant them

230
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,860
and they can easily survive.

231
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,700
But

232
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,620
we've never planted any herbs before.

233
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:20,900
Yeah.

234
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,100
What if we fail

235
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:22,780
to plant them well?

236
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:24,780
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

237
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,020
Don't worry.

238
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,260
There's a plant

239
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,340
named herbal medicine.

240
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:29,060
Have you heard about it?

241
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,460
It's easy to be planted.

242
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:30,980
And we can start

243
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,900
with it.

244
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,860
I'll regularly

245
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,020
hire some men

246
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,740
with rich planting experience

247
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:35,860
to give you lectures.

248
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,620
- Nice.
- Sounds great.

249
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:38,740
That's more like it.

250
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:39,500
Awesome.

251
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,820
Come on, ladies.

252
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:41,940
Listen.

253
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,740
From this day on,

254
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,820
your village will be

255
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:44,940
the supplier of Haoxue Cosmetics.

256
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,540
I'll buy all your herbal medicine.

257
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,100
- Great.
- Terrific! Terrific!

258
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,220
In this way,

259
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:51,540
you won't worry

260
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,980
that you can't sell the herbal medicine.

261
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,980
And I don't need to worry

262
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,780
about the supplier problem.

263
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,380
Right?

264
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,420
- Yes.
- Yes.

265
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:57,700
This is great.

266
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,620
I promise

267
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,860
you'll live a good life

268
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:02,300
with enough food and drinks.

269
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,540
- Nice.
- Wonderful.

270
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,780
Oh, great.

271
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,860
Our life

272
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,900
will be better.

273
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,180
- Yes.
- That's right.

274
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:11,060
We'll live a great life.

275
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,460
- Terrific.
- How wonderful!

276
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,100
Look, look.

277
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,100
Knowing you would leave Shuiyan House,

278
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,580
these men, old or young,

279
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,700
nearly flocked

280
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,940
to my place.

281
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,100
- Yeah, Miss Shui.
- Yeah, Miss Shui.

282
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
- Don't leave.
- Don't. Don't leave.

283
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,100
All right.

284
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,500
I'll come back and see you.

285
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:30,100
By the way,

286
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,020
you can

287
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,020
take these flowers.

288
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,300
They're yours.

289
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,700
But...

290
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:36,780
But...

291
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,900
Fine.

292
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,180
Take the flowers.

293
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:47,420
My girl,

294
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,540
reconsider it, will you?

295
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:50,660
Think about it.

296
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,900
As the best lady of Shuiyan House,

297
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
if you give a farewell performance,

298
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,660
a lot of men would break their necks

299
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:57,140
to watch it.

300
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,180
How about

301
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,620
I give you 50% of the income?

302
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,460
No.

303
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,100
I'll give you 70%.

304
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:04,980
What do you say?

305
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,900
At last, you are

306
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:06,700
turning generous.

307
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,260
I'm always generous, OK?

308
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,380
Unfortunately,

309
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,500
this time,

310
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,540
I have to be generous, too.

311
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,780
My farewell performance

312
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:15,780
has been reserved.

313
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,980
Reserved?

314
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,260
Come on.

315
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,220
Who's got that honor?

316
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,340
There you are.

317
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,700
Have others not arrived yet?

318
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,500
For tonight's performance,

319
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,180
you're the only audience.

320
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:34,860
How's my dance?

321
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,340
Wonderful.

322
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,580
Gui Bai,

323
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,220
you know what?

324
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,780
I always had a wish,

325
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,260
to have

326
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,260
my own house.

327
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,020
And in the house,

328
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
I could dance for the man I love.

329
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,740
If you like it,

330
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,220
I can always dance for you.

331
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,260
Don't bother, Miss Shui.

332
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:55,500
Having watched you

333
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,540
dance for me alone,

334
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,900
I feel already honored.

335
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:00,940
I...

336
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,060
Actually, I had to be very brave

337
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:06,340
to leave Shuiyan House.

338
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,940
And it's you

339
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,540
who made me that brave.

340
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,860
Thank you, Miss Shui.

341
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:19,980
If I'm the one

342
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,060
who made you leave this place,

343
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,420
I would appreciate it.

344
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:30,500
But I've got work to do.

345
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,900
I have to go.

346
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,140
Gui Bai!

347
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,340
Do you really not know

348
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,180
my feelings for you?

349
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,140
Or...

350
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,180
Do you also mind

351
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,140
what I used to be

352
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,100
like all the other men?

353
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,660
I've never minded

354
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,900
what you used to be.

355
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,140
In this case,

356
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,340
why do you not dare to face

357
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,580
our relationship?

358
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:49,940
(I...)

359
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
(I can't give you a happy life.)

360
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,500
You get me wrong.

361
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,940
For you,

362
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,300
I have no other feelings

363
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,380
but appreciation.

364
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,100
Why is it so tiring

365
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,420
to teach others to plant herbs?

366
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,140
When the herbs grow

367
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:39,820
and you have to collect them,

368
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,020
you would be more exhausted.

369
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,180
My Lady,

370
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,540
I can't do that.

371
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,500
Think about Muxu.

372
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,780
She's tall

373
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,300
and she must be strong.

374
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,060
Let her do that.

375
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:49,060
Sang Shen, you spoke ill of me again.

376
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,420
Muxu,

377
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,580
what have you got for me?

378
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,940
You must be hungry, Your Ladyship.

379
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,420
Food is ready.

380
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:59,700
Muxu, it's so cruel of you.

381
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,220
This is what you've got for me?

382
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,340
Your Ladyship, you have no idea.

383
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,020
The death anniversary

384
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,340
of the old master is drawing nearer.

385
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,180
Everyone has to go vegetarian
for three days.

386
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,540
Death anniversary?

387
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:16,340
You enjoy the food alone.

388
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,260
I'll go check on him.

389
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,940
Ning Yuxuan.

390
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:27,860
Ning...

391
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,820
Wake up.

392
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,180
Ning Yuxuan.

393
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
You're awake?

394
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,580
Did you have a nightmare again?

395
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,900
Get back to sleep, then.

396
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,060
I should go.

397
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:31,100
Could you

398
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,220
lie in bed

399
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:36,940
for a while?

400
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,020
What?

401
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,420
Lie...

402
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,620
When I had a nightmare,

403
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,300
did I hurt you?

404
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,740
No.

405
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,860
But...

406
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,380
Why did you have a nightmare again?

407
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,900
Is this the reason

408
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,940
you never

409
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,060
share a bed with anyone else?

410
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:33,020
If anyone knows this secret,

411
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:37,180
she would be killed

412
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,780
or have to stick with me all her life,

413
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,660
keeping this secret.

414
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:46,740
Which do you pick?

415
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,020
Don't tease me.

416
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:02,860
Since I was little,

417
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,180
I've had this problem.

418
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,380
The doctor that I was jarred.

419
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:08,940
So, I always have nightmares.

420
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,180
Always.

421
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,660
Anything to do with your father?

422
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,420
When my father was killed,

423
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,100
I was right there.

424
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:39,780
Father, go!

425
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,900
Can anybody help us?

426
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,700
Come help us!

427
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,100
Help my father!

428
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:50,940
Somebody!

429
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:55,900
Father!

430
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,340
Father, get up!

431
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,500
I will take you home!

432
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:05,780
Does anybody help us?

433
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,020
Father!

434
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,300
Back then,

435
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,620
he took me to enlist the Tea Gang.

436
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,980
But Cai Wenzheng, chief of the Tea Gang,

437
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,100
regretted his decision.

438
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,580
Right in front of me,

439
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,060
they killed my father.

440
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,100
I was five years old then.

441
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,740
All by myself,

442
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,020
I dragged my father home.

443
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,620
Since then,

444
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:49,500
I've never

445
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,220
slept soundly.

446
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:51,900
The hatred

447
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,340
has been torturing me.

448
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,740
Then, the nightmares...

449
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:01,380
They keep me restless all the time.

450
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:12,020
Sorry.

451
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:15,060
I shouldn't have reminded you

452
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,420
of such sad things.

453
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,100
I finally know

454
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:23,140
why you're scared of fire.

455
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,580
I'm doing a lot better.

456
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:30,540
Not very scared of fire now.

457
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,740
So, I'll have

458
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,860
fewer nightmares.

459
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,180
Right?

460
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,140
From now on,

461
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,500
I'll always be with you.

462
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,620
If your father

463
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:56,100
comes again to your dream tonight,

464
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:00,420
I'll tell him

465
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:02,980
that Ning Yuxuan

466
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,220
has grown up.

467
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,060
And he's no longer alone.

468
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,540
He has me.

469
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,500
He's living a better life

470
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,380
and everything will be even better.

471
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,140
I also want to tell your father

472
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,860
to rest assured.

473
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,340
I'll promise him something, too.

474
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,460
I'll promise him

475
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:46,180
I would take care of you

476
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,700
for the rest of your life.

477
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
Sir.

478
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,700
Look at this.

479
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,380
This wedding dress

480
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,300
has billowing hemlines

481
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:23,860
and a widened girdle.

482
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,660
It can emphasize the graceful waist

483
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,620
of the bride.

484
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,860
And check this one.

485
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,580
This dress

486
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,940
has a widened neckline.

487
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:38,540
It can magnify

488
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,180
the bride's delicate neck.

489
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,420
Your Lordship, are you picking
the wedding dress

490
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:47,900
for Her Ladyship?

491
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,460
Look. Which one do you like?

492
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:53,820
Here's more.

493
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:54,980
They...

494
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,660
They all look good.

495
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,060
Then take your time.

496
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,460
How inconvenient!

497
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,700
So many styles.

498
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:06,020
Which one shall I pick?

499
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,140
Every girl

500
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,020
wants to be

501
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,100
nicely dressed

502
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,540
at her wedding.

503
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:15,460
They have their own favorite styles.

504
00:26:17,020 --> 00:26:18,220
Take your time.

505
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:20,540
(Which style does she like?)

506
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:22,300
I've been selling dresses for years

507
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,660
and I usually see

508
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,860
a girl and her friend

509
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,500
come to pick the wedding dress.

510
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,980
Seldom do I see a man

511
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:32,180
pick the dress for his bride.

512
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,740
Gentleman,

513
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,620
true love is precious.

514
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,900
Take your time.

515
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:46,820
Gui Bai.

516
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,940
Invite Miss Shui out tomorrow

517
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,740
to help me with this.

518
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,580
Go.

519
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,900
But Your Lordship,

520
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,500
Haoxue Cosmetics isn't far.

521
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:58,660
If you go personally,

522
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,820
you'll look more sincere.

523
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,740
I...

524
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:05,780
I don't want my wife to notice it.

525
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,300
After all,

526
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,380
I want her to be surprised.

527
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,740
There you go.

528
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:14,980
Gui Bai,

529
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,900
you decide

530
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,940
if I can have a happy life.

531
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,260
Fine.

532
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,820
In this case,

533
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,660
I'll get her here for you.

534
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,540
Good.

535
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,060
What?

536
00:27:58,340 --> 00:27:59,300
Miss Shui.

537
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:15,300
What did you come for?

538
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,300
Here. Try some.

539
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,460
For Her Ladyship, huh?

540
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,620
She's in the backyard.

541
00:28:20,140 --> 00:28:20,900
No.

542
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,700
You didn't come for Her Ladyship

543
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,260
or for some shopping.

544
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,780
You can't be coming for me, either.

545
00:28:35,300 --> 00:28:36,260
I came...

546
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:38,660
I...

547
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,660
I...

548
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:45,060
I'm quite busy here.

549
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,100
If you don't mind,

550
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,180
please leave.

551
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,540
What do you think, ladies?

552
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:52,500
Do you have something better?

553
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,340
Better?

554
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,500
Try this, then.

555
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,900
Our new product,

556
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:56,780
Shuilan Face Cream.

557
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,780
Here.

558
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,820
Check it out.

559
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:00,100
You try some, too.

560
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:02,660
Nice. It smells great.

561
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,380
Do you like it?

562
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:04,460
Then...

563
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:05,900
We'll take two.

564
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,420
All right.

565
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:06,980
Come on.

566
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:11,900
Here.

567
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,740
Thank you.

568
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,300
Take care.

569
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:30,300
You...

570
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,740
You can check this one.

571
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,340
(At one tomorrow afternoon,)

572
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,540
(come alone)

573
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,060
(to Haifang Clothing Shop.)

574
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,620
Miss Shui.

575
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,380
Nerd.

576
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:26,740
At one tomorrow afternoon,

577
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,260
come alone to Haifang Clothing Shop.

578
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,580
Who invited you?

579
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,740
Gui Bai just came.

580
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,180
He left this.

581
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:33,820
Gui...

582
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,540
Gui Bai?

583
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:37,180
At last?

584
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,340
He finally invited you.

585
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,420
Tomorrow,

586
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:42,220
do you want me to give you

587
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:42,940
- some romance or surprises?
- No.

588
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,500
And then...

589
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,260
He... He invited me alone.

590
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,660
And Gui Bai is timid.

591
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,660
What if you go

592
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,180
and scare him?

593
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:54,700
Do I look so scary?

594
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,980
Fine.

595
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,380
I'll stay in the shop

596
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,260
and expect the good news

597
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
of your smooth date.

598
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,420
(At one tomorrow afternoon,
come alone to Haifang Clothing Shop.)

599
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:25,580
Show me the account book.

600
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:33,020
Wrong numbers here.

601
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,340
Correct them.

602
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:42,540
Miss,

603
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,540
what can I do for you?

604
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,580
Browse as you wish.

605
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:47,340
No, thank you.

606
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,700
I'm waiting for someone.

607
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:50,620
Waiting?

608
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,220
For whom?

609
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:54,060
Miss Shui.

610
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,580
Your Lordship?

611
00:31:58,540 --> 00:31:59,980
Why are you here too?

612
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,460
What?

613
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,500
Where's Gui Bai?

614
00:32:09,620 --> 00:32:10,540
Actually,

615
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:13,300
he invited you here for me.

616
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,180
So, she is

617
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,940
your bride, huh?

618
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,180
She's gorgeous.

619
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,340
No wonder you love her so much.

620
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,980
No, Ma'am.

621
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:22,660
No.

622
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,380
You get us wrong.

623
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,300
You get us wrong.

624
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,460
Show us some dresses.

625
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,420
All right.

626
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:44,260
Get to the point, Your Lordship.

627
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,220
I'll try my best to help.

628
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,820
Actually,

629
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,780
I want you to do me a favor.

630
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,180
I want to marry my wife

631
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,180
very officially.

632
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,500
So, what others have,

633
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:56,580
she should have it, too.

634
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,180
But it's way too complicated

635
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,340
to pick a wedding dress.

636
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,540
So, I want you to help me

637
00:33:03,540 --> 00:33:04,260
with it.

638
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:09,940
Oh, I see.

639
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,780
You want me

640
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,940
to try the dress on, right?

641
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,740
If you trust me,

642
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,500
I can do it.

643
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,580
I trust you, of course.

644
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:18,860
Thank you, Miss Shui.

645
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,660
You're welcome.

646
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,900
Here, sir. Check this out.

647
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:25,220
Umm...

648
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,140
Your Lordship.

649
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,140
Miss, this dress

650
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,500
looks perfect on you.

651
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:58,500
Thank you.

652
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,500
Your Lordship,

653
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:00,660
Her Ladyship

654
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:01,860
would look better in it.

655
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,860
What do you think?

656
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:06,620
I'll take this one.

657
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,980
Ma'am, the bill, please.

658
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:08,820
All right.

659
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:20,740
Your Lordship,

660
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:22,860
you made a great effort.

661
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:24,380
Her Ladyship would be happy.

662
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:25,980
I...

663
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,340
I should go.

664
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,260
Miss Shui.

665
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:31,820
About this,

666
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,420
my wife...

667
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,260
Could you...

668
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:35,980
Don't worry.

669
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,180
I'll keep it secret.

670
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,460
Thank you, Miss Shui.

671
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,820
Why didn't you say anything?

672
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:54,100
Your Lordship.

673
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,860
When Miss Shui knew

674
00:34:57,860 --> 00:34:59,340
it wasn't you who invited her,

675
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,980
she looked very disappointed.

676
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,700
Even I could see

677
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:04,620
her feelings for you.

678
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,980
What about you?

679
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:09,780
Your Lordship,

680
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,740
I don't understand the love thing.

681
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:15,540
What misgivings do you have?

682
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,340
I'm a guard

683
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,740
who leads a dangerous life.

684
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:26,340
But Miss Shui

685
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:27,940
wants a stable home.

686
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,380
I don't dare to give her any promise.

687
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:31,660
Gui Bai,

688
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,780
since little,

689
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,940
you've been working for me

690
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,900
as a loyal fighter

691
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,340
and risking your life with me.

692
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,460
But you should also

693
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,700
have your own life.

694
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,340
Fighting and killing

695
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,460
shouldn't be everything of your life.

696
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:45,460
Understand?

697
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:46,740
Say no more, Your Lordship.

698
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,940
I've made up my mind.

699
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,020
I'm so clumsy

700
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,980
that I can only do one thing
very well in my life.

701
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:54,540
And that is

702
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,860
to protect you, Your Lordship.

703
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,340
I...

704
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,580
Fool!

705
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,180
Your Highness.

706
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,460
I summoned you

707
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,700
to give you a mission.

708
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:25,820
I heard the Transport Commissioner

709
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:27,260
for the Imperial Supplier Contest

710
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,100
is still vacant.

711
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,620
Transport Commissioner?

712
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:33,980
To counterbalance Ning Yuxuan,

713
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,380
that's the best position.

714
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,420
To control Haifang,

715
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,780
I invested a lot of money

716
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,980
just to support

717
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,220
the Sea Trade Guild

718
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,980
and the Dragon Gang.

719
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:49,420
Now,

720
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:52,020
Ning Yuxuan manages
the Shipping Department.

721
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,700
He's like taking me by the throat.

722
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,820
Your Highness, you mean

723
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:57,780
I should be the Transport Commissioner

724
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,580
and counterbalance Ning Yuxuan

725
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,940
in the name of supervision?

726
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,020
If I become the Transport Commissioner,

727
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:06,900
others wouldn't feel bad.

728
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,620
His Majesty will receive
fewer complaints, too.

729
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,500
I will

730
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:12,380
try my best to strive for it

731
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:13,860
and I won't let you down.

732
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,780
I also heard

733
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:18,700
if a store won the first place

734
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,380
in the contest,

735
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,820
its manager

736
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,420
would be the new chairman.

737
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,180
What do you think?

738
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,980
I plan to support one of my men

739
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:31,300
to remain the chairman

740
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,980
of the Sea Trade Guild

741
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,900
and get back your losses

742
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,740
in Haifang.

743
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:38,980
What do you think the chances are?

744
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,700
I will

745
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,340
burn my bridges.

746
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,420
The herbs are ready.

747
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:51,620
There you are, Mr. Qin.

748
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,420
Lianxue!

749
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,980
How could you carry

750
00:37:56,980 --> 00:37:57,980
such heavy things?

751
00:37:58,260 --> 00:37:59,020
Let me help you.

752
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,220
Come on. Be seated.

753
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,380
Umm...

754
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,020
Your Ladyship, Miss Shui,

755
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,660
would you like some preserves?

756
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:11,180
No.

757
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:12,260
No, thank you.

758
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:15,820
Mr. Qin,

759
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,260
you keep coming here

760
00:38:18,260 --> 00:38:19,300
in the last two days.

761
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,380
If you have nothing else to do,

762
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:21,140
how about I hire you?

763
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,620
You have no job, anyway.

764
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,180
Who said that?

765
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,420
I'm getting busy soon.

766
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:27,500
Come on.

767
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,420
Actually, I came

768
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,660
to tell you something serious.

769
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,820
Are you sure?

770
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,700
Of course.

771
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,780
Come over.

772
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,300
What is it?

773
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,140
Listen,

774
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,660
His Majesty will have
this year's Imperial Supplier Contest

775
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:46,460
held in Haifang.

776
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,060
Haifang?

777
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,100
It's absolutely true.

778
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,900
Ms. Nie,

779
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,100
your Feiwan Face Cream is

780
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:55,180
so famous in Haifang.

781
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,300
If you win the contest,

782
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,940
you can be an imperial supplier.

783
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:59,340
What a wonderful opportunity!

784
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:00,820
Yeah.

785
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,820
By then, we will make

786
00:39:03,820 --> 00:39:05,060
a great deal of money.

787
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,820
All you care about is money.

788
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,180
I do the accounts.

789
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,300
I have to care about money.

790
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:10,620
That's what makes me like you.
Frugality.

791
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,740
Let's go do the accounts.

792
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:13,500
All right.

793
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:14,620
What do you think?

794
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:15,340
What do you think?

795
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,580
We should take part.

796
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,420
I agree.

797
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,540
It's such a great chance

798
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,740
and our shop must take part.

799
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:20,580
Yeah.

800
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:22,940
But Ning Yuxuan

801
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,380
has never told me about this.

802
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,820
And lately,

803
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,940
he's been elusive.

804
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,260
Weird.

805
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:32,780
I'm talking to you.

806
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:33,660
Did you hear?

807
00:39:33,820 --> 00:39:34,740
Yes.

808
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,260
I think he might...

809
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:39,220
For selecting imperial suppliers,

810
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,140
there's a lot of work.

811
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,220
If he forgets to tell you,

812
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,740
that's understandable.

813
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:43,900
But I think he's...

814
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,620
Customers have come.

815
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,900
I'll attend them.

816
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,260
But I haven't...

817
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,580
Ladies, come this way.

818
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:54,740
Muxu,

819
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,300
I have a question.

820
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:58,900
Have you realized

821
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:00,420
that Ning Yuxuan has been sneaky lately?

822
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:04,380
He seems to be a little bit weird.

823
00:40:04,420 --> 00:40:05,820
Very elusive.

824
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,020
You noticed that, too?

825
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:10,020
Is he keeping something from me?

826
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,460
I...

827
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,060
I don't think so.

828
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,140
He isn't?

829
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,740
What's wrong, Your Ladyship?

830
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:18,220
But I feel...

831
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,540
Oh, I see.

832
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:22,700
He takes charge

833
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,740
of the Imperial Supplier Contest

834
00:40:23,740 --> 00:40:24,100
and he must be knowing

835
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,580
a lot about recruitment, right?

836
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,940
But he doesn't want me to ask.

837
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,180
So, he's been avoiding me.

838
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:30,660
That must be it.

839
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:32,060
Then Your Ladyship,

840
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:33,940
will you ask His Lordship about it?

841
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:34,900
I...

842
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:39,900
I won't, of course.

843
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,580
Am I that kind of person?

844
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,220
I would never get information

845
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:46,060
by using my identity.

846
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,340
I'll do a fair competition.

847
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:51,860
Get to your work.

848
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:03,100
Ning Yuxuan, are you in?

849
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:07,660
Ning Yuxuan?

850
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,940
I'll see what you're doing secretly

851
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:18,780
behind my back.

852
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,140
Red organza?

853
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:32,700
Why does he have this?

854
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:40,260
How dare you, Ning Yuxuan!

855
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:44,420
You keep a mistress, huh?

856
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,780
Good for you.

857
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,340
I caught you, huh?

858
00:41:51,340 --> 00:41:52,380
Look. Look.

859
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:53,620
Whose dress is this?

860
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:55,340
What the...

861
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,820
And one more.

862
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,980
How dare you...

863
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:05,380
It's

864
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,140
a man's wedding robe...
