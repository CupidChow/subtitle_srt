00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:45,870
You're right, Your Lordship.

4
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,540
After Her Ladyship gets recovered,

5
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:48,540
her memories

6
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,150
will be recovered gradually.

7
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,540
Gui Bai,

8
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:00,180
has anyone told you

9
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,260
that you've become more talkative?

10
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,460
My god.

11
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,900
The man you love is Ning Yuxuan?

12
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,580
Shush.

13
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,060
Keep your voice low

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,380
in case

15
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,780
others will hear it.

16
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,100
It can't be.

17
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,140
It's true,

18
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,620
but I also didn't expect the man,

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,380
who I came to Haifang from the capital for,

20
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,260
was him.

21
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,180
And he's always by my side.

22
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,580
Isn't it coincidental?

23
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,340
Is the man you love

24
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:42,580
really Ning Yuxuan?

25
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,500
I remember

26
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,060
you wrote a poem for him,

27
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,380
although it wasn't idiomatic.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,340
You also drew him,

29
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:51,820
although it was ugly.

30
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:53,420
But My Lady,

31
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,740
you really went everywhere

32
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,020
in order to pursue him,

33
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,740
and you even lost your memories.

34
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,420
Well,

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:00,300
is the box

36
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,540
you cherish very much

37
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,100
full of Ning Yuxuan's stuff?

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,780
What box?

39
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,220
It's...

40
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,900
I remember that.

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:12,060
Why do you remember everything?

42
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,820
It's very shameful.

43
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:15,740
My Lady,

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,900
you've collected many of his things...

45
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,900
Alright.

46
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,580
Stop talking about this thing.

47
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:22,180
If people in the Mansion hear that,

48
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,100
I'll be too ashamed to live.

49
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,820
Let's just

50
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:27,180
keep it a secret.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,460
But My Lady,

52
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:30,460
since you've restored your memories,

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,620
let's go and tell him

54
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,940
that you're going

55
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,820
to find the man you love

56
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,580
and leave Ning's Mansion.

57
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,420
Why do we need to leave Ning's Mansion?

58
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,180
Then

59
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:44,100
let's tell him

60
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:45,300
you haven't restored your memories,

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,780
and find a chance
to leave here in the future.

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,220
What's wrong with you?

63
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:50,980
Why do you always

64
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,020
ask me to leave Ning's Mansion?

65
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,580
I've said

66
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,780
I like Ning Yuxuan.

67
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,380
Since he's in the Mansion,

68
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:56,780
I won't go anywhere.

69
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,820
My Lady, I don't think he's good.

70
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,620
Yes, he's good.

71
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,220
Fine.

72
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,300
I think

73
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,060
you've really restored your memories.

74
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,020
You're defending him

75
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,060
as desperately

76
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:06,180
as before.

77
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,180
Since Wang Jinyao was arrested,

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,340
and Shen Liancheng was killed,

79
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,260
Haifang

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,820
could be in peace now.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,900
When your memorial to the throne

82
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,100
is read by His Majesty,

83
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,420
I think

84
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,380
he will reinstate you

85
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,540
and let you leave Haifang.

86
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,300
It's not emergent.

87
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,740
Is there anything you haven't done yet,

88
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,500
Your Lordship?

89
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:29,740
I want

90
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,660
to establish a special
Shipment Department here

91
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,820
and make Haifang

92
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,020
the biggest cargo transportation market.

93
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,860
You have a broad and
long-term view, Your Lordship.

94
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,740
It's Haifang's people's luck,

95
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,620
and so is everyone's.

96
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,340
Wait.

97
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,100
We haven't come to
Haifang for a long time,

98
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,260
but you're very good at flattering.

99
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,740
Remember

100
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,780
to speak less and work more.

101
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,540
Yes, Your Lordship.

102
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,460
Is the repairment of Ship Guihai

103
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,460
almost finished?

104
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,060
It's basically repaired.

105
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,220
If Her Ladyship is willing,

106
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,060
she can go back to live at anytime.

107
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:21,140
Shouldn't

108
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,380
it be painted again?

109
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:25,260
It was just painted.

110
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,660
But Ji Man just woke up,

111
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,980
and it's inconvenient for her
to go back to the ship,

112
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,220
isn't it?

113
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,860
Yes, if you say so.

114
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:49,740
It's checked.

115
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,580
Mr. Ning.

116
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,100
What a coincidence.

117
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,020
I'm going to visit Ms. Nie.

118
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,220
Thanks for your kindness, Chief Yuan.

119
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,740
She's woken up

120
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,700
and is fine,

121
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
but she needs to rest quietly.

122
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,180
(Haifang Wharf)

123
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,980
If you don't

124
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,100
disturb her,

125
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,780
it'll be the best kindness to her.

126
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:18,140
Did she

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,820
tell these to you?

128
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,580
I think

129
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,420
she doesn't want you to disturb her.

130
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,060
You'd better not

131
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:26,900
guess others' thoughts as you like.

132
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,020
I really

133
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:31,140
thank you

134
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:37,700
for Liu's Village's people

135
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,820
on the case of the official taels,

136
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:41,580
but if you have

137
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,420
other bad intentions,

138
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,460
I think

139
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,900
you'd better give up.

140
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,060
I always put the shoe on the right foot.

141
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,220
If the Dragon Gang

142
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,260
does evil things in the future,

143
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,060
I won't ignore them

144
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,820
even if we've cooperated before.

145
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,420
Mr. Ning,

146
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,980
the Dragon Gang

147
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,220
is different from before.

148
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:03,020
It's our rule

149
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,860
to protect the good and punish the evil.

150
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,940
I hope

151
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:07,420
you won't be biased against
the Dragon Gang

152
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,860
because of the past things.

153
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,540
Haifang is going to change.

154
00:07:15,820 --> 00:07:17,460
If you can lead the Dragon Gang

155
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,420
to be on the right track,

156
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,180
I promise

157
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,460
you'll make achievements in Haifang.

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:23,380
I indeed

159
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,620
don't want you

160
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,780
to follow the same old disastrous
road as Shen Liancheng.

161
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:32,340
That's all I want to say.

162
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,380
Be careful.

163
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,180
Goodbye.

164
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,900
My Lady,

165
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,020
try it.

166
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,940
Why is the soup so black?

167
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,820
It's because it's not ordinary.

168
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,660
It's medicine.

169
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,780
It's the tonic

170
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,900
that I specially asked
the physician to prescribe.

171
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:03,660
You encountered assassination

172
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,660
and drowning,

173
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,780
and I feel so distressed for you.

174
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:09,460
What's this?

175
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,340
Is it fish?

176
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,220
You used to say

177
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,500
fish was beneficial to eyes and brains

178
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,700
and made people smarter.

179
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,180
Well,

180
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,900
is it

181
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:22,860
the physician's prescription

182
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,700
to cook fish into medicine soup?

183
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:24,940
This is my idea.

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,780
I just think

185
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:27,100
its effect

186
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,700
can be doubled

187
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:28,980
and you can get better soon.

188
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,420
Take it now, My Lady.

189
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,180
It's so smelly.

190
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,060
Smell it yourself.

191
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,980
I don't want to take it.

192
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,780
My Lady,

193
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:44,820
you liked fish the most

194
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,140
in the past.

195
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,980
Every month,

196
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,900
you'd follow fishing ships

197
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:48,980
to go fishing in the sea.

198
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:51,700
And then,

199
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,020
you'd send the freshest fish

200
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,740
to the capital at the top speed

201
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
and give it to the man you love.

202
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,220
I've remembered everything,

203
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:03,460
so don't always mention that.

204
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,660
I should

205
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:07,460
find a chance

206
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,420
to tell him

207
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,900
what I have done for him.

208
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:13,860
My Lady, take it now.

209
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,260
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

210
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,340
Fortunately, you're back.

211
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,180
Finally.

212
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,660
I'm really fine now.

213
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,580
It's good that you're fine.

214
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,580
Look.

215
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,780
I'm really fine.

216
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,620
Don't worry.

217
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:33,420
That's great.

218
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:34,300
Go on with your work.

219
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:34,660
Yes.

220
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,300
It's okay now.

221
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:36,100
Go on with your work.

222
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:36,700
- Yes.
- Yes.

223
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,500
Go.

224
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:37,980
Let's go.

225
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:39,340
Come here and let me see.

226
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,740
Are you really fine now?

227
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,420
Yes.

228
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,220
I'm glad

229
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:45,260
that you're fine.

230
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:48,100
We've been worrying
about you during these days.

231
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,340
Thanks to your management

232
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,980
to Haoxue Cosmetics

233
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,900
in these days when I was absent.

234
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:55,980
Thank you.

235
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,220
You're welcome.

236
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:57,820
That's

237
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,860
what we should do.

238
00:09:58,860 --> 00:09:59,740
Don't worry.

239
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:01,180
But

240
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,780
are you sure you're really fine?

241
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,940
Yes.

242
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,180
Why are you being

243
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:09,100
womanishly fussy,

244
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,780
Miss Shui?

245
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,580
I just...

246
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,100
Miss Shui, feel assured.

247
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,300
Her Ladyship

248
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,380
is being protected seriously

249
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,620
by Magistrate's Residence.

250
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:16,940
Whenever she goes,

251
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,820
His Lordship will follow.

252
00:10:18,980 --> 00:10:20,940
It's hard for us to meet her,

253
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,740
isn't it?

254
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,460
Don't play a joke on me.

255
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,180
Since you've been
working hard in these days,

256
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,100
I can't be idle.

257
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,700
I want to study cheap cream

258
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,220
during this period.

259
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:31,700
By then,

260
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,660
please try it.

261
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,460
No problem.

262
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,580
In fact,

263
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,940
I also want to

264
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,500
announce one thing to you.

265
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,060
I plan

266
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,020
to leave Shuiyan House.

267
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,820
Really?

268
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,620
I'll find

269
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
a house to live

270
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,820
and focus on

271
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,300
running Haoxue Cosmetics.

272
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,940
Miss Shui, congratulations.

273
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,260
You're closer

274
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,660
to your dream.

275
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,740
Mrs. Ning,

276
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,820
I should thank you.

277
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,140
I'll tell you another thing.

278
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:14,380
- What is it?
- What?

279
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,820
I've remembered everything.

280
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,700
All my memories have been restored.

281
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:22,820
Really?

282
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,100
Yes.

283
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,180
That's great.

284
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,500
Mr. Cao.

285
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,780
(Ning Yuxuan's memorial to the throne)

286
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,180
Your Majesty,

287
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:51,820
Mr. Ning's memorial

288
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,780
of setting up the
Shipping Department in Haifang

289
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,620
has been delivered.

290
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,660
Read it now.

291
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,900
I'm Ning Yuxuan,

292
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:00,020
and I want Your Majesty
to read this in person.

293
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,780
The chairman of Sea Trade Guild,

294
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,900
Wang Jinyao, has been arrested,

295
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,620
and Haifang is regaining
its peace gradually,

296
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,700
but it's far from enough.

297
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,140
In my opinion,

298
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:09,940
lots of businessmen gather in Haifang,

299
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,660
which is the entrance,
as well as the exit.

300
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,220
Both its north and south have sea.

301
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,100
If we can set up the Shipping Department

302
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,620
in Haifang

303
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,980
and use new politics of sea trade,

304
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,780
I think people will be benefited

305
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,660
in the trend

306
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:23,380
of sea trade.

307
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,460
I wonder if it's appropriate.

308
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:27,300
Sincerely hope Your Majesty could
read my memorial and give suggestions.

309
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,500
That's all.

310
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,100
Ning Yuxuan

311
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,580
indeed

312
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,500
doesn't disappoint me.

313
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,100
After he was demoted
and sent to Haifang,

314
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,860
he not only cleared his name

315
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,940
but also

316
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,180
solved such a big problem

317
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,220
for me.

318
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:45,580
Okay.

319
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,380
Your Majesty,

320
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,580
without your trust and support,

321
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,860
I'm afraid it would have
been hard for Mr. Ning,

322
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,620
who is at the seventh-rank,

323
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,860
to make achievements in Haifang.

324
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,060
Ning Yuxuan

325
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,580
caused Lord Tan to lose money,

326
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,700
and I'm sure Lord Tan

327
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,980
will condemn him.

328
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,340
Mr. Cao,

329
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,700
deliver my words

330
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:20,060
that

331
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,220
Mr. Ning is reinstated

332
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,660
and responsible

333
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,980
for the Shipping Department in Haifang.

334
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:28,060
Yes.

335
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:29,620
Wait.

336
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,220
There is one more message

337
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:35,180
that you need to
tell Mr. Ning face to face.

338
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,900
If what he does

339
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,540
can really bring benefits to the people

340
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:41,980
and revive

341
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,140
our state,

342
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:46,860
I'll remove

343
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,260
all obstacles for him.

344
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:50,820
Just ask him

345
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,500
to do it without fear and worries.

346
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:53,980
Yes.

347
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,780
I didn't expect His Majesty
to be that bad.

348
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:06,060
I've been managing Haifang

349
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,620
for a decade,

350
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,820
and he actually wants to get it back

351
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,940
by setting up the Shipping Department.

352
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,860
How ridiculous!

353
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,780
The nomination of Ning Yuxuan
has been pronounced.

354
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:19,340
I'm afraid

355
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,060
he'll live in Haifang for a long time.

356
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,820
Haven't you said

357
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,860
to make him disappear in Haifang

358
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,540
without letting anyone know?

359
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,860
I don't remember it wrongly, do I?

360
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,540
I'm sorry that I'm too careless.

361
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,020
I didn't expect Wang Jinyao

362
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,180
to be trashier than Shen Liancheng.

363
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,380
He didn't kill Ning Yuxuan

364
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,420
on the official ship

365
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,900
and even exposed himself.

366
00:14:40,060 --> 00:14:41,540
Fortunately, he's dead

367
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,660
and our later trouble is eliminated.

368
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,180
Are you explaining to me?

369
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,020
Please calm down, Your Highness.

370
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,980
Ning Yuxuan

371
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,140
managed to hide in Haifang.

372
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,980
We're in the capital, and Haifang is
beyond the reach of our power,

373
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,340
so we could only use
others to work for us.

374
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,860
That's why we failed frequently.

375
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:58,980
Since we've put aside
all considerations of being exposed,

376
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:02,020
and are at the same level,

377
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,980
I'll deal with Ning Yuxuan personally.

378
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,820
Let's see

379
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,860
who's the real chosen one.

380
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,980
It's your business

381
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,020
to decide the method,

382
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:31,260
and I

383
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,340
only care for the result.

384
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,140
(Ning Yuxuan,)

385
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:40,740
(I swear to fight you to the end.)

386
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,500
(Magistrate's Residence)

387
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:55,780
It's delicious.

388
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:57,700
Your Ladyship.

389
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,540
Your Ladyship.

390
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,900
His Lordship

391
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,620
cooked lotus seed soup for you.

392
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,460
Are all of these cooked by him?

393
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:05,180
Yes.

394
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,700
You're the only one

395
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,460
he's cooked for since his childhood.

396
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,540
No wonder they taste bad.

397
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:12,940
My Lady, you're strange.

398
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,020
Have you really fallen in love with him?

399
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:29,300
(All animals are used for shooting.)

400
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:34,310
(None of them are hurt.)

401
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,380
(Do you love her?)

402
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,780
(Yes.)

403
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,100
(Therefore,)

404
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,660
(fish isn't terrifying.)

405
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,580
Move out.

406
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,020
Don't touch me.

407
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,140
Don't bump against me.

408
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,860
Move out.

409
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,260
It's so hot.

410
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,100
Try it.

411
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,260
Are you burnt?

412
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:06,820
I cooked the fish soup with medlar,

413
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,260
and it's very nourishing.

414
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,140
Actually,

415
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,300
I just drowned

416
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,220
without getting hurt,

417
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,460
so you needn't have spent much effort.

418
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,500
Men

419
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:18,620
should take care of

420
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:20,340
the woman they love.

421
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,980
Try it.

422
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,420
Why

423
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,500
did you cook

424
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,900
the fish soup today?

425
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:43,300
It's because

426
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,220
the physician said it was
beneficial to your eyes and brain,

427
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,100
and it could speed up your recuperation.

428
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,500
In order to braise it,

429
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,540
I overcame my psychological disorder.

430
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:56,660
It's not a big deal

431
00:17:57,620 --> 00:17:58,260
as long as it's for your good.

432
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,580
What psychological disorder is it?

433
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,260
I can tell you,

434
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,780
but you should promise
that you won't be angry.

435
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,340
Go ahead.

436
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,060
A few years ago,

437
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,260
a woman

438
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:13,420
would put a bucket of fish
at the gate of my mansion

439
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,420
on the first day of each month.

440
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,420
Have you

441
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,380
already known that?

442
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,580
No.

443
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,260
I don't know her name

444
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,060
or anything else,

445
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,820
so how could I know that?

446
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,620
But sometimes,

447
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,580
she would leave

448
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,540
some strange love poems.

449
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,940
She did it every day

450
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:38,940
and never stopped.

451
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
How do you know

452
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,140
it was a woman?

453
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:49,100
A man couldn't

454
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,020
do such a thing.

455
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,260
Well,

456
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,500
perhaps

457
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,980
he could.

458
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:03,700
However,

459
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,900
Marquis's Mansion

460
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,020
never used ingredients
with unknown sources,

461
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,820
so whenever Mr. Liu opened the gate

462
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,820
of the Mansion every summer,

463
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:11,980
he would see a bucket of rotten fish.

464
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,740
Besides, those who didn't know the truth

465
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,580
would think it was used
to tarnish the gate

466
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:18,460
by our enemies,

467
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,660
so...

468
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:23,660
Enemies?

469
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,580
(I took a long way to send you fish,)

470
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,780
(but you thought it was from enemies?)

471
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:32,620
(Fine.)

472
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,980
(Since that,)

473
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,260
(no one is allowed to eat fish.)

474
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:36,860
You...

475
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,020
Take the fish soup away.

476
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,820
I took a long time
to braise it, and you...

477
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,220
I don't like it.

478
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:43,820
Leave.

479
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:46,220
Haven't we agreed that
you won't get angry?

480
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,260
Am I angry?

481
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,700
I just

482
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:49,700
don't like fish soup.

483
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,140
Will you leave or not?

484
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,780
Yes or no?

485
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,540
I see.

486
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,380
You're jealous of that woman.

487
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,460
I...

488
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,460
It's spilling over.

489
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,140
Leave.

490
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,260
I wanted to tell you the truth,

491
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,780
but you stopped me.

492
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,140
(Qinghui Pavilion)

493
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,220
(Vague Fragrance and Dappled Shadows)

494
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:23,380
(Fangfei Pavilion)

495
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:29,900
Mr. Gui,

496
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,740
look around this house.

497
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,460
It's near the mountain and sea,
facing the south.

498
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,820
Its Feng Shui is perfect.

499
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,980
Moreover, there is
an official road at the gate.

500
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,460
It's a quiet place in the market.

501
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,020
Look at

502
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:43,100
the tall and big wooden beam.

503
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,100
It's very light and spacious.

504
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,500
The best advantage

505
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,740
is that there is
an empty room in the backyard.

506
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:50,260
When you two get married

507
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,120
and have children,

508
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,780
it'll be amazing

509
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,580
to live in such a big yard.

510
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,980
You misunderstand us, sir.

511
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,180
- The buyer isn't...
- No.

512
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,700
We'll buy it.

513
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,100
How much is it?

514
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:02,020
You have good taste.

515
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,780
I'll give you the preferential price,

516
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,660
400 taels.

517
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,060
400 taels?

518
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,620
Can you lower the price?

519
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:11,380
Well...

520
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,140
This house

521
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:14,580
is near the sea and mountain,

522
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,540
and it's a quiet place in the market.

523
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,180
It's the best house I sell.

524
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,820
I wouldn't have recommended it to you

525
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,820
if we didn't have a close relationship.

526
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,460
Others can't buy it even if they want to.

527
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,340
It only costs 400 taels.

528
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,300
What are you doing?

529
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,740
We've bought the house.

530
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,620
You don't need to
look around it anymore.

531
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:30,700
Leave.

532
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,660
What happened?

533
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:33,860
Don't you recommend this house

534
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,140
only to me?

535
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,700
Why are there other buyers?

536
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:38,260
Calm down. I'll deal with it.

537
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,340
Although

538
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,420
we came here late,

539
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,420
I've recommended the house

540
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,020
to this buyer

541
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,380
a few days ago.

542
00:21:44,380 --> 00:21:45,860
According to the order of arrival,

543
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:47,580
it's ours.

544
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,940
Even if you came here
before us, so what?

545
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:50,220
The house should belong to the buyer

546
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,860
who bids higher.

547
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:53,500
How about

548
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
adding more money?

549
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,060
410 taels.

550
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,780
410 taels.

551
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,380
I'm a businessman,

552
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,580
and this house's Feng Shui is good,

553
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:10,660
so I'm determined to buy it.

554
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,500
420 taels.

555
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,260
430 taels.

556
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,860
450 taels.

557
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:21,740
Miss,

558
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,300
will you continue bidding?

559
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,620
600 taels.

560
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,580
Gui Bai.

561
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,460
I don't want others

562
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,460
to get what she likes.

563
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,260
I'll give you the money right now.

564
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,140
Are you going to bid again?

565
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,100
Lunatics.

566
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,340
How

567
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,100
useless you are.

568
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,500
Sir.

569
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:58,660
I'm sorry, sir.

570
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,220
Sir, I didn't mean to irritate you.

571
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,380
You're very bold and resolute.

572
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:01,940
Sir.

573
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:15,900
What happened

574
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,420
to Her Ladyship and Miss Qingyun?

575
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,260
They look worried.

576
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,180
I know

577
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,060
Miss Ji's thoughts.

578
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,140
How do you know that?

579
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,060
Her Ladyship and you

580
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,940
have been doing something secretly.

581
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,060
What are you doing?

582
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,980
It's none of your business.

583
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:38,060
That is our secret.

584
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,260
You...

585
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,980
You and Yuxuan

586
00:23:43,980 --> 00:23:45,060
are getting closer and closer,

587
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,060
but why are you worried?

588
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,740
That's why I'm worried.

589
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,260
How about you?

590
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,780
It's General Tao

591
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,820
that upsets me.

592
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,740
He lit the lantern for me

593
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,860
at the Lantern Festival,

594
00:24:03,980 --> 00:24:05,860
but he hasn't taken the next action yet.

595
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,180
They're nerds.

596
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,540
Qingyun,

597
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,460
how about

598
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,340
I find a chance

599
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,980
to ask General Tao out

600
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,540
and let you two

601
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,540
get along with each other?

602
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:27,620
Really?

603
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:31,260
But

604
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:33,660
I can't help you
with the following things.

605
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,380
General Tao,

606
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,260
as classmates,

607
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,300
we haven't met each other
for a long time.

608
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,020
I've always wanted to visit you,

609
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,220
but I couldn't find a chance.

610
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,620
It's good

611
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,420
to see you're fine.

612
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,340
Sangyu is blessed

613
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:56,660
and could survive every disaster.

614
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:57,980
And it also

615
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,580
thanks to Yuxuan's care.

616
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,700
I should thank

617
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
General Tao for his care to you.

618
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,420
General Tao, thank you.

619
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:05,740
Me?

620
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:06,820
Why?

621
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,260
Of course I need to thank you.

622
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,500
Qingyun is always naughty.

623
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,820
If she wasn't

624
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:13,340
looked after by you in Haifang,

625
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,860
I would have been worried.

626
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:16,700
You're welcome.

627
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:17,780
Sangyu,

628
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,900
since Qingyun

629
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,660
is your sister,

630
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,180
I regard her as my sister, too.

631
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,820
I'm afraid I'll be busy

632
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:27,100
during this period,

633
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,940
so

634
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,380
I have to

635
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:30,860
leave Qingyun to you.

636
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,340
Please take care of her.

637
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,340
Do you hear her?

638
00:25:34,460 --> 00:25:36,580
Remember her words.

639
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,220
Well,

640
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,500
I have something to deal with.

641
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,740
How about you accompany
Qingyun to hang out?

642
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:46,660
I'm leaving.

643
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,780
Sangyu,

644
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:52,540
well,

645
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,900
take care of yourself.

646
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:54,740
Don't worry.

647
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,340
- Go.
- Let's go, General Tao.

648
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:56,700
Go.

649
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,460
Wait.

650
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,820
Where are you going?

651
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,820
His Lordship asked us to check

652
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,700
the ending.

653
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:07,620
After the check,

654
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,700
the goods could be
returned to their owners.

655
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,740
Are you done?

656
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:11,380
No.

657
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:12,260
There are some rooms

658
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,100
that need to be checked carefully.

659
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,500
I see. Go.

660
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,140
(My god.)

661
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,140
(What if that box)

662
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:21,780
(is discovered?)

663
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:23,860
(No,)

664
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,620
(I can't let that happen.)

665
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,580
Sang Shen.

666
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,580
We're not exposed, are we?

667
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,220
Don't worry, My Lady.

668
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,020
I did it secretly,

669
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,660
and even Muxu didn't know that.

670
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,020
Let's go.

671
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:53,860
My Lady,

672
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
why do we sneak to Ship Guihai

673
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,900
at midnight?

674
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,660
Do you remember the box

675
00:26:58,660 --> 00:26:59,660
you mentioned to me?

676
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,260
Ning Yuxuan

677
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,420
is repairing Ship Guihai.

678
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:04,980
If he discovers the box, it'll be bad.

679
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,660
We have to solve it

680
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,700
before it's discovered.

681
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:10,620
Okay.

682
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:11,060
Let's go.

683
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:12,860
Wait.

684
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,100
What's wrong?

685
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,820
This is our place,

686
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:18,260
so we don't need to

687
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,260
be furtive.

688
00:27:23,420 --> 00:27:24,700
You're right.

689
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,700
Go.

690
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,540
Close the door.

691
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,980
Okay.

692
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,580
Come on. Give me a hand.

693
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,140
It's still here.

694
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,100
The key.

695
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,940
That's it.

696
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:11,780
My Lady,

697
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,580
we can't

698
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,860
- let Mr. Ning discover it.
- Shush.

699
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,980
Keep your voice down.

700
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,660
Otherwise, we'll be exposed.

701
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:20,380
My Lady,

702
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,300
I'll take it away

703
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:22,060
and throw it into the sea.

704
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:26,620
Wait.

705
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:30,900
I spent much time

706
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,620
on this box.

707
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,260
You can't throw it away.

708
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:35,620
My Lady,

709
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,940
are you reluctant to throw these things

710
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,580
or

711
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,620
your liking to Mr. Ning?

712
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,060
Anyway, I don't want to throw them.

713
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:42,900
If not,

714
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,220
where will you hide these things?

715
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,340
I'll hide...

716
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,100
The most dangerous place

717
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,860
is the safest.

718
00:28:57,980 --> 00:28:58,380
Go.

719
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,300
Okay.

720
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:02,780
Your Highness,

721
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:04,300
we found him.

722
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,340
Your Highness.

723
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,100
Mr. Qian.

724
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,220
Your Highness,

725
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,620
we found him.

726
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,660
What?

727
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:12,980
We found Ji Ming.

728
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:13,820
Where is he?

729
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,940
He's in the capital,

730
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,100
but

731
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:18,340
he seems to

732
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,060
be leaving the capital soon.

733
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,540
Take me to him now.

734
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,380
Your Highness,

735
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,660
I found another thing.

736
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:43,900
Hurry up.

737
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,260
Okay.

738
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,740
Everything

739
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,420
is a proof of your love for him.

740
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:52,500
My Lady,

741
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,300
aren't you afraid of

742
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,420
Mr. Ning discovering them?

743
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
Your Ladyship.

744
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:58,100
Your Ladyship, something is wrong.

745
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:58,900
Your Ladyship.

746
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,380
What's wrong?

747
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:01,060
His Lordship is heading here.

748
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,100
We can't let him

749
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,220
discover them.

750
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:05,300
Let's hide them.

751
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,700
We...

752
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:08,700
We...

753
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:09,420
Sang Shen,

754
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,020
take them away

755
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:10,700
right now.

756
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,540
Okay.

757
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,020
Hurry.

758
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,460
Hurry up.

759
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,060
What should we do?

760
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,820
Gui Bai, take the others out.

761
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:31,460
Yes.

762
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,580
Why haven't you slept yet
when it's late?

763
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,260
What are you doing?

764
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,540
I'm

765
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,220
drinking tea

766
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:53,060
and admiring the moon.

767
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,580
Admiring the moon?

768
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:01,780
Are you going to steal it

769
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,260
since you're dressed like this?

770
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:08,100
I can wear whatever clothes

771
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,820
to admire the moon.

772
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,460
I like this outfit.

773
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:17,380
You can't see the moon clearly here.

774
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,820
I'll take you to the yard.

775
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:19,740
No need.

776
00:31:22,300 --> 00:31:23,020
I...

777
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:25,140
I feel

778
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,340
my legs are sore.

779
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,460
Do you?

780
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,580
Then I'll pick you up.

781
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,300
No.

782
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:32,900
No.

783
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:33,580
I don't want that.

784
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:35,940
Can you stop pretending now?

785
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,900
What's in the box?

786
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,780
Who's the owner?

787
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,380
It's

788
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,540
my private things.

789
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:55,900
It has nothing to do with you.

790
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,140
Mind

791
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,420
your own business.

792
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:09,220
I'm not here to blame you.

793
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,020
I want to help you.

794
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:13,380
Change the things in the box

795
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,460
into mine,

796
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:16,740
and it'll be fine.

797
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:22,620
(What is in the box is yours.)

798
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,420
Anyway, I won't leave.

799
00:32:28,420 --> 00:32:29,460
I won't let you see it.

800
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:42,340
Your Highness.

801
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,620
Your Highness.

802
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:46,020
He's in this room.

803
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,340
Hello?

804
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:54,700
Hello?

805
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,140
Ji Ming?

806
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,700
Ji Ming?

807
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Ji Ming!

808
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:16,820
Xiangyuan.

809
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,500
Xiangyuan.

810
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,020
Should I call you Ji Ming

811
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:45,780
or

812
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:48,740
Guihai Warrior?

813
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,340
There's only us in this room,

814
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,500
so you can tell me

815
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,700
what happened

816
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,180
during these 18 years.

817
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,140
How did you become

818
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,820
the famous Guihai Warrior?

819
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,260
Why don't you meet your daughter

820
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:12,140
in almost 18 years?

821
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:13,300
Xiangyuan,

822
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,820
please forgive me

823
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,020
for not reaching out to you.

824
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,180
I just want to

825
00:34:18,180 --> 00:34:19,540
end

826
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,660
my past life.

827
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,900
It's for my safety,

828
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,780
as well as yours.

829
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,140
Is that the reason why

830
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:28,020
you abandoned your daughter

831
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,140
for many years

832
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,100
and didn't care for her

833
00:34:30,420 --> 00:34:31,500
while living a happy life

834
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,260
with another daughter?

835
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,860
If Sangyu knew that...

836
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,620
Who is she?

837
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
She's Ji Man's

838
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,060
twin sister,

839
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:50,980
and she died.

840
00:34:51,140 --> 00:34:53,180
Don't you know that?

841
00:34:53,340 --> 00:34:54,420
What?

842
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,700
She died?

843
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:39,540
You should leave

844
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,540
after finishing the tea.

845
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,220
I won't leave

846
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:42,900
until I see

847
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,060
the things in the box.

848
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,300
I'm...

849
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:45,940
Your Lordship,

850
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:48,180
someone is making a mess in the Mansion.

851
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,180
Her Ladyship's maid, Sang Shen,

852
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,100
and

853
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,860
Miss Wen's maid, Tanxiang,

854
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:54,060
are fighting.

855
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,180
What?

856
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:03,980
Sangyu,

857
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,980
I'm sorry I didn't teach my maid well.

858
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:07,100
I'll discipline Tanxiang

859
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:08,820
after going back.

860
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,180
Leave, everyone.

861
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,780
- Yes.
- Yes.

862
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:30,300
Dear.

863
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:30,860
The box...

864
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,340
This is the evidence.

865
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,340
It's...

866
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,700
(Ning Yuxuan)

867
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,780
This is His Lordship's
collection of poems,

868
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,140
and he lost this sachet

869
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:52,900
a few years ago.

870
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,020
It turns out Her Ladyship
keeps them all.

871
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,500
You've been loving me for a long time

872
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,940
and even collected

873
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,180
such old things.

874
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:08,140
No.

875
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,500
It's very moving.

876
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,100
No.

877
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:12,740
I was used

878
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,300
to living

879
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:15,940
a frugal life,

880
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,700
so I collected

881
00:37:18,220 --> 00:37:19,420
everything

882
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,500
thrown by others.

883
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:21,940
It's just my hobby.

884
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,860
You caused a misunderstanding

885
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,980
because of your personal hobby.

886
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,860
If you want to love me,

887
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,260
just do it aboveboard.

888
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,540
Give it back to me.

889
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,300
Tanxiang,

890
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:46,220
if you

891
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,460
slander Sangyu again,

892
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,380
I'll never forgive you.

893
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,340
Yes.

894
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,380
Miss Wen,

895
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,980
teach your maid well.

896
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:58,890
Yes.

897
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,340
Leave, all of you.

898
00:38:07,900 --> 00:38:09,340
- Yes.
- Yes.

899
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,540
Do you want to see

900
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:22,220
how affectionate we are?

901
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:43,940
Tell me the truth.

902
00:38:43,940 --> 00:38:44,940
Don't touch me.

903
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,900
Why do you hide so many of my things?

904
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:48,700
Tell me.

905
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,140
Give it back to me.

906
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:55,980
I'm tired now.

907
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:56,980
Go back.

908
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,620
I...

909
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,500
I apologize

910
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,420
for my rude words.

911
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,980
I shouldn't have said

912
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,380
you had bad taste on selecting a man.

913
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,460
Instead, you have really good taste

914
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,940
on selecting a man.

915
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:15,830
You're so shameless.

916
00:39:17,620 --> 00:39:18,090
I...

917
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,420
Give me that.

918
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:30,940
No.

919
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,060
I wore it many years ago.

920
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:39,180
Where did you get it?

921
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:41,540
I...

922
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:48,900
To tell you the truth,

923
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:54,140
I've restored my memories.

924
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:57,020
You...

925
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,260
You've restored your memories?

926
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,020
