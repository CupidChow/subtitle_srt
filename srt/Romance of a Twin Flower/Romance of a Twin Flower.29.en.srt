=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,720
(Ning Yuxuan,)

4
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,310
(marrying you)

5
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,600
(is a dream that I have had
for so long.)

6
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:53,470
(I hope we'll live)

7
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,470
(a simple,)

8
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:57,110
(peaceful, and happy life.)

9
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,640
(Dad will understand)

10
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,390
(how much we love each other,)

11
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,080
(and give us his best wishes.)

12
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:12,270
Who is it?

13
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,870
What are you doing here?

14
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,710
Mr. Yuan.

15
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,270
Glad that I made it.

16
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,670
No mistake is made.

17
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,390
What do you mean?

18
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:31,550
(Father,)

19
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:33,360
(Mother,)

20
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,270
(even though you're in heaven,)

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,240
(you would still)

22
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:38,990
(feel happy for me.)

23
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,800
(I thought I would be lonely forever.)

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,080
(Unexpectedly, I met a girl)

25
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:47,040
(and we love each other.)

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,110
(She gives me warmth)

27
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,590
(I've never experienced before.)

28
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:52,640
(And her name is)

29
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,520
(Ji Man.)

30
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,150
Your Lordship.

31
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:57,270
Your Lordship,

32
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,360
Her Ladyship is gone.

33
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,360
Gone?

34
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,520
When it was time for the wedding,

35
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,430
I went to remind Her Ladyship

36
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,040
and Miss Muxu.

37
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,590
I knocked on the door
but they didn't answer.

38
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,960
Worried about Her Ladyship,

39
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:08,110
I had to break in.

40
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,270
But no one was in the room.

41
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,360
I searched the whole residence

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,960
and didn't find them.

43
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:12,360
Did anyone suspicious

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,390
come here?

45
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:14,550
No.

46
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,640
According to the servants,

47
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,990
Her Ladyship left voluntarily.

48
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,920
Voluntarily?

49
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,520
Come.

50
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,670
Mr. Ning,

51
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,640
what are you doing here?

52
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,830
It's too late.

53
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:37,800
Mr. Ji is sleeping.

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,040
I came to see...

55
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:38,990
How about you come tomorrow?

56
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,520
You...

57
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:41,040
Get out of the way!

58
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
But Mr. Ning...

59
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:42,670
Out of my way!

60
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:43,110
Mr. Ning,

61
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:43,520
you can't break in!

62
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:43,920
Out of my way!

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,710
- Mr. Ning!
- Mr. Ning!

64
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:45,270
Sang Shen!

65
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:45,990
Let go of him!

66
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,760
Where's Ji Man?

67
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,760
I have something to tell Mr. Ning.

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,670
Leave us.

69
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,320
Yes.

70
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,430
Get to work. Go.

71
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:53,150
Mr. Ning,

72
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,960
Her Ladyship went to see you.

73
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,270
To marry you,

74
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,800
she asked me to put some sleeping drug

75
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,830
in Mr. Ji's tea.

76
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,920
Isn't she with you?

77
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,800
She...

78
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:06,830
She isn't here?

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,240
No, she isn't.

80
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Where could she be?

81
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,800
She's gone?

82
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,480
Where could she be?

83
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,760
Would she be in danger?

84
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:18,880
Don't be nervous.

85
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,390
Calm down.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
She wasn't taken back here.

87
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:24,390
In her room,

88
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,470
there was no trace of struggle.

89
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:26,680
She wasn't kidnapped.

90
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,120
Then...

91
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,710
Where did she go?

92
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:32,560
Her Ladyship is always helpful.

93
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,270
Can it be that

94
00:04:34,270 --> 00:04:34,880
she went to help someone

95
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,200
in need?

96
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:38,590
Perhaps.

97
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:42,390
I'll go see Qin Yixian.

98
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,390
You go check it with Tao Siwei.

99
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,470
Let's look for her separately.

100
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:45,910
Yes.

101
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,150
What are these birds?

102
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:00,230
White-browed birds.

103
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,320
Look.

104
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,760
This one is you

105
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
and this one is me.

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,520
They indicate that you and I

107
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,910
would be a happy couple.

108
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:14,230
Who would be a happy couple with you?

109
00:05:14,390 --> 00:05:15,150
Lianxue.

110
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:19,270
I've made up my mind.

111
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
Let's hold our wedding

112
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,560
here in Haifang.

113
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,440
Then,

114
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,910
you needn't come every day

115
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,560
to the post.

116
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:33,150
Are you...

117
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:35,320
Are you proposing to me?

118
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:37,830
Lianxue,

119
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,120
will you

120
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,790
marry me?

121
00:05:57,910 --> 00:05:58,830
Qin Yixian!

122
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,030
Qin Yixian!

123
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,790
Qin Yixian, open the door!

124
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,440
What's up?

125
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:04,910
Is my wife here?

126
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,910
No.

127
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,470
Did you

128
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:14,200
see her?

129
00:06:15,910 --> 00:06:16,910
- No.
- No.

130
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:25,700
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

131
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:39,680
Your Lordship.

132
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:41,680
What have you got?

133
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:51,710
General Tao and Miss Qingyun

134
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:53,680
didn't see Her Ladyship.

135
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,960
She isn't at Qin Yixian's place, either.

136
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,830
How about we return to your residence?

137
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,790
Maybe she's back there.

138
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,470
I just came from my residence.

139
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,270
She isn't there.

140
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:09,560
She isn't on the ship,

141
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,080
in her shop,

142
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,120
or with her friends.

143
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,030
Haifang is a small town.

144
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,320
Where else could she go?

145
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,200
There's one place we haven't searched.

146
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,790
What is it?

147
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:34,440
Go.

148
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:40,150
Chief,

149
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,830
why did we get up so early

150
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,440
and sit here doing nothing?

151
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,390
I didn't even finish my beautiful dream

152
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,520
where I had a wedding.

153
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,590
To wait for someone.

154
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,320
Whom?

155
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:53,680
Someone would certainly come.

156
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:19,470
Long,

157
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:21,390
what's wrong with Chief?

158
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,910
Since he had dinner

159
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,120
with Guihai Warrior,

160
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:25,790
he has been acting weirdly.

161
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,230
Oh, I know.

162
00:08:29,470 --> 00:08:31,150
Because this afternoon,
the fortune-teller said

163
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,870
Chief and Miss Ji
didn't make a perfect couple.

164
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:36,280
I'm going to Ship Guihai.

165
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:44,920
Ji Man!

166
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:47,560
Ji Man!

167
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,680
Are you in?

168
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:54,870
Mr. Ji?

169
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,110
Mr. Ji!

170
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,230
Mr... Mr. Yuan.

171
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:05,830
Mr. Ji?

172
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,200
Mr. Ji.

173
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:09,510
Mr. Ji.

174
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:19,630
Mr... Mr. Yuan.

175
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,920
Who asked you to drug Mr. Ji?

176
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,280
Where's Ji Man?

177
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,870
Mr. Yuan,

178
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:31,630
Mr. Ji would only sleep for a while.

179
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:33,710
It won't be harmful.

180
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,590
Ridiculous!

181
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,320
Mr. Yuan, Mr. Yuan!

182
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,510
I know you're a good man

183
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,710
and you've been loving Miss Ji.

184
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,680
But since she returned

185
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,560
from Haifang,

186
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,400
she and Mr. Ning

187
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,320
have been loving each other.

188
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,680
Hope you would let her marry him.

189
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:46,920
Do you know what you did

190
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,200
would screw her?

191
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,230
I have no time for any explanations.

192
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:52,110
Take care of Mr. Ji.

193
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,590
Mr. Yuan!

194
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:01,750
(Ning Yuxuan,)

195
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:04,200
(without your father,)

196
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:06,680
(nothing would have happened.)

197
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,440
(Ji Man and I)

198
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:10,230
(wouldn't have
lived apart for years, either.)

199
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,280
Yuan Lang!

200
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,320
Where's my wife?

201
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,990
Lackey Ning!

202
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,590
Looking for your wife

203
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,510
at my place, huh?

204
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,440
Cut the crap

205
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,230
and give my wife to me!

206
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:34,110
This is my territory,

207
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,200
not your residence.

208
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,350
What?

209
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,870
Will you break in?

210
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,230
You can't stop me.

211
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,400
Your Lordship.

212
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,420
Your Lordship.

213
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:52,960
Muxu?

214
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:57,800
Muxu,

215
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,440
where's my wife?

216
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:02,010
She...

217
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,440
She's on her way

218
00:11:03,450 --> 00:11:05,230
back to Ship Guihai.

219
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:08,750
Ship Guihai?

220
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:10,750
Ship Guihai...

221
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:11,680
Your Lordship, wait.

222
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,470
Her Ladyship left me here

223
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,400
to give you a message.

224
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,470
What is it?

225
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:22,800
She said,

226
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:25,080
between you and her father,

227
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:27,160
she chose her father.

228
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,400
She also said...

229
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:31,510
She also said,

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:33,860
"A couple leaves each other.

231
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:35,770
And what's gone is gone.

232
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,340
You and I

233
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,610
should break up."

234
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,730
A couple leaves each other.

235
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,370
And what's gone is gone.

236
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:49,490
You and I should...

237
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,220
Your Lordship.

238
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,340
Gui Bai,

239
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,350
let's go.

240
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:24,320
Zhao Long, Zhao Hu,

241
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,920
walk Miss Muxu back to Ship Guihai.

242
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:28,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

243
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:33,350
Miss Muxu,

244
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:34,510
here we go.

245
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,830
Come and look.

246
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:55,080
Nice fur.

247
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,230
Come and look.

248
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:57,830
Take a look.

249
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,280
Pendants for sale.

250
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:00,280
Come and look.

251
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:12,560
Man,

252
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:15,730
I know you can't accept the truth

253
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,130
for a moment.

254
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,490
I kept it from you

255
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,860
to protect you

256
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,650
and for your own good.

257
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,490
Sorry, Dad.

258
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:45,490
I was too willful

259
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:49,410
to understand you.

260
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,220
Now I finally understand

261
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:58,180
why you used to be so anxious.

262
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:00,610
It was my bad.

263
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:02,890
Man,

264
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,730
I don't want you to live in hatred.

265
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:09,820
I also don't want you

266
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,530
to forget the hatred.

267
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:15,530
Your father,

268
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,250
Yuan Lang's father,

269
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:20,250
and those innocent people

270
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,180
of our gang

271
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,580
died miserably!

272
00:14:29,730 --> 00:14:32,100
I don't want you to forget them.

273
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,940
Luckily, it isn't too late.

274
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:40,530
We'll stick to our plan

275
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,610
and leave Haifang,

276
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,820
the place of trouble!

277
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:48,250
Man,

278
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,490
in this world,

279
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,770
nothing is so hard to bear.

First bow to heaven,

you're awake.

316
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,100
It's been three days.

317
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,450
Go have some rest in your bedroom.

318
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:23,540
Otherwise,

319
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,450

(it would affect)

00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,370
it's been days.

349
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:24,170
You should at least eat something.

350
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:27,580
Try a little persuasion.

351
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,170
My Lady,

352
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:30,340
eat something.

353
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,930
Or you would be starving.

354
00:19:35,370 --> 00:19:36,210
I'm not hungry.

00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,020
Go get me the account books

357
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:42,610
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

358
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,020
These days,

359
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,370
how's our business?

360
00:19:50,170 --> 00:19:50,740
Don't worry.

361
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:50,970
Here, My Lady.

362
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:52,340
Even if you're away from the shop,

363
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,410
the turnover

364
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:54,820
has still been over a thousand taels.

365
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,340
The Contest is upcoming.

366
00:20:02,450 --> 00:20:03,500
The businessmen

367
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,820
have arrived one after another, I guess.

368
00:20:05,610 --> 00:20:06,450
However...

369
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,740
I don't think

370
00:20:09,740 --> 00:20:11,100
they only came for the purchase.

371
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:12,780
I guess

372
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,930
they want to figure out

373
00:20:15,930 --> 00:20:16,580
our real secrets.

374
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:17,410
Then...

375
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,860
Will they

376
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,740
steal our formulations?

377
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,820
Let them be.

378
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:25,930

379
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:27,450
you have women in Liu's Village

380
00:20:27,450 --> 00:20:28,740
grow the herbs you need

381
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,410
so that they can earn some money.

382
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,650
You and His Lordship

383
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,930
are really kindhearted.

384
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,580
I just wonder...

385
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,170
Muxu.

386
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:37,300
Stop it.

387
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:41,340
I promised my father

388
00:20:41,930 --> 00:20:43,340
that I would leave Haifang soon.

389
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:44,690
So,

390
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,690
I plan to leave

391
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,370
my shop

392
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:50,370
to Miss Shui.

393
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,210
- What?
- What?

394
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,170
- But the Contest is coming.
- No idea.

395
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,300
I'm taking care of something for her.

396
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:56,210
Ji Man.

397
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:01,500
Mr. Yuan.

398
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:03,500
If necessary,

399
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:04,970
my men

400
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,170
can come and help you.

401
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,130
Muxu,

402
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:08,970
Sang Shen,

403
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:10,610
please leave us.

404
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,580
I have something

405
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:13,890
to tell Ji Man.

406
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:17,210
Muxu.

407
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:17,860
What?

408
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,690
Go.

409
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:20,610
Come on.

410
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,340
These days,

411
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,410
is everything all right?

412
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:37,970
Yes.

413
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,740
Glad to hear that.

414
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,260
If something bothers you,

415
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,100
tell me about it.

416
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:46,740
Ji Man,

417
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,450
you and I are supposed to be...

418
00:21:48,450 --> 00:21:49,260
Mr. Yuan,

419
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,000
I do have something

420
00:21:53,370 --> 00:21:54,410
to ask you.

421
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,610
Go ahead.

422
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,740
In your heart,

423
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,510
do you still hate Ning Yuxuan?

424
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:07,920
And

425
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,000
do you still want revenge?

426
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,030
Before I met you again,

427
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:21,760
I hadn't dreamed about the future.

428
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,830
I thought dying with those men

429
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,200
who destroyed our gang

430
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,550
would be

431
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:29,720
my best ending.

432
00:22:32,450 --> 00:22:33,410
Over all these years,

433
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,130
Ning Yuxuan isn't the only man

434
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,300
who has lived in hatred.

435
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,340
So have I.

436
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:43,860
But I had good luck, anyway.

437
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,610
You and I met again.

438
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,100
I then changed my mind.

439
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,860
I want to live.

440
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,210
I want to live a good life

441
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:52,410
with you

442
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,540
and Mr. Ji.

443
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,100
I would forget

444
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:58,130
the dirty and terrible past.

445
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,610
Ji Man,

446
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,820
if you leave with me,

447
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:04,690
I can

448
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,300
let go of all my hatred.

449
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,540
Don't worry.

450
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,540
I promised my father

451
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,930
that I would leave Haifang soon.

452
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,930
I'll keep my promise.

453
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:18,020
And Mr. Yuan...

454
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,970
Hope you'll remember

455
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,020
what you just said.

456
00:23:23,650 --> 00:23:24,370
Good.

457
00:23:25,410 --> 00:23:26,210
By then,

458
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,890
we can live in a beautiful place,

459
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,340
forget about the past,

460
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:30,930
and start a new life.

461
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:34,890
Ji Man,

462
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:36,450
have some rest

463
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:37,780
and take good care of yourself.

464
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:38,780
If you need anything,

465
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,100
come to me.

466
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:42,740
I'm always

467
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,610
at your service,

468
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,020
My Lady.

469
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,540
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

470
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:31,890
Come on.

471
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,100
Come in, please.

472
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,740
Muxu, where's Miss Ji?

473
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,500
In the backyard.

474
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,130
What happened?

475
00:24:44,610 --> 00:24:45,820
Safflowers were waterlogged.

476
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,450
My Lady!

477
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:48,740
How was it?

478
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,690
Did you collect the herbs?

479
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:50,580
My Lady,

480
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,410
I...

481
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:52,860
I took some men to the wharf

482
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,020
to receive the safflowers.

483
00:24:54,020 --> 00:24:55,580
During the inspection, I found

484
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:56,970
that the safflowers were waterlogged

485
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:58,970
because of the careless crew.

486
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,890
All of the safflowers

487
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,370
were waterlogged?

488
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,060
Now,

489
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,410
the Contest is upcoming.

490
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,370
It's too late

491
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:12,210
to book some more safflowers.

492
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,970
With all the safflowers we have now,

493
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:14,860
we can't make

494
00:25:14,860 --> 00:25:15,860
enough Feiwan Face Cream.

495
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,740
What... What do we do?

496
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,170
How did that happen?

497
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:30,970
I don't know.

498
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:32,690
Muxu,

499
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:34,060
where are the medical books

500
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,100
I brought back?

501
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,300
On the shelf of the wing room.

502
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,450
You stay here.

503
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,580
I'll go check if I can find

504
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,410
a substitute.

505
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,780
What do we do?

506
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,980
(Collection of Herbs)

507
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:53,500
Chrysanthemum.

508
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,370
No.

509
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:06,060
Bombax.

510
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,970
Rangoon creeper...

511
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:09,860
Rangoon creeper.

512
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,780
What are you doing?

513
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,740
You're just in time.

514
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,100
The delivered safflowers
were waterlogged.

515
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,650
Before I leave,

516
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,340
I have to find

517
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:16,340
a substitute.

518
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,650
You're leaving?

519
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,930
Yes. I didn't get to tell you about it.

520
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,100
I...

521
00:26:22,610 --> 00:26:23,740
I may have to be away from Haifang

522
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,450
for a while.

523
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:27,030
So, for the Contest,

524
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,200
I'll count on you.

525
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,310
It's a long story.

526
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,960
I'll explain it to you later.

527
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,070
Now, my top priority

528
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,600
is to find

529
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,680
a substitute

530
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,790
for safflowers.

531
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,070
Safflowers?

532
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,120
They indeed have many effects,

533
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,740
to improve blood circulation

534
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,890
and calm the nerves.

535
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:45,940
But it's not easy to find

536
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,650
such rare herbs.

537
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:48,980
I know.

538
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:50,890
So, I was thinking.

539
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:52,330
If one kind of herb doesn't work,

540
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,700
how about we mix

541
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,740
several kinds?

542
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,170
Based on a perfect proportion.

543
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,980
You made sense.

544
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,810
But different herbs

545
00:26:58,810 --> 00:26:59,980
have different properties.

546
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:00,940
It can't be

547
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,890
that easy

548
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,020
to mix them.

549
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:09,700
Check this.

550
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:11,850
Pseudo-ginseng,

551
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:14,130
rhizome of Chuanxiong,

552
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:15,810
and myrrh.

553
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:16,500
They all

554
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,130
improve blood circulation.

555
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,810
And the powder

556
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,370
would be white.

557
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:22,980
Maybe we can try them.

558
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,940
But they smell

559
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:25,700
so differently

560
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,810
from Feiwan Face Cream.

561
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:30,810
The smell won't be a problem.

562
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:32,940
But time is pressing.

563
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:34,700
If there's no other way,

564
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,330
I have to collect some herbs
from the mountain.

565
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,980
But it's going to rain, I think.

566
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,500
No time to waste, anyway.

567
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,090
How about this?

568
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,370
Let's take action separately.

569
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,780
I'll check if I can buy

570
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,060
some safflowers on the market.

571
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:54,220
All right.

572
00:28:00,310 --> 00:28:01,550
Rhizome of Chuanxiong.

573
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,840
Maybe it'll really work.

574
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,160
Ma'am,

575
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,310
do you sell safflowers?

576
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,160
Safflowers?

577
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,270
They're sold out.

578
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:12,990
Miss, look.

579
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:13,880
Would you like something else?

580
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,710
No, thank you.

581
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:15,270
Fine.

582
00:28:17,310 --> 00:28:18,920
Sir, do you sell safflowers?

583
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,070
Sorry, but they're sold out.

584
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:20,880
Sold out?

585
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,030
Thank you all the same.

586
00:28:28,790 --> 00:28:30,400
Pendants and toys.

587
00:28:30,510 --> 00:28:31,600
Miss, take a look.

588
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:35,440
Come and look.

589
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:36,790
Pendants.

590
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:54,750
Why is it you?

591
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,790
I... I...

592
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:57,310
So,

593
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:58,680
it's you who stalked me,

594
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,550
right?

595
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,230
His Lordship

596
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,990
worries about Her Ladyship

597
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,270
and asked me to keep an eye.

598
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:09,070
I'm on a mission.

599
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,200
So, Mr. Ning sent you.

600
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:14,750
His Lordship is having a hard time.

601
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,680
He hasn't complained.

602
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,440
But I know

603
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:20,440
he keeps

604
00:29:20,470 --> 00:29:21,680
thinking about Her Ladyship.

605
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,400
Then please tell His Lordship

606
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,030
that Her Ladyship is

607
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,360
in trouble recently.

608
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,860
(Residence)

609
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,310
Your Lordship.

610
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,680
Her Ladyship has a problem

611
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:58,640
with her delivered safflowers.

612
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,200
They were waterlogged.

613
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,640
What...

614
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:06,640
She's going up the mountain alone

615
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,600
to collect

616
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
some substitute herbs.

617
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:10,710
Going up the mountain alone?

618
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:14,990
I get it.

619
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:49,680
This is it.

620
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:07,990
Oh, no.

621
00:31:08,510 --> 00:31:10,310
According to the book, the rhizome

622
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,840
should be yellowish-white.

623
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:14,840
Wrong color.

624
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:30,470
It's going to rain.

625
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,840
Ji Man!

626
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,440
Ji Man!

627
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,230
Ji Man!

628
00:31:58,310 --> 00:31:59,400
Ji Man!

629
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:05,360
Her medical book.

630
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,960
Ji Man!

631
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,510
Ji Man!

632
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,840
Ji Man!

633
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:31,600
General Tao.

634
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:38,030
General Tao.

635
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:42,120
What brings you here?

636
00:32:42,310 --> 00:32:43,270
I hear

637
00:32:43,270 --> 00:32:44,880
there's a new restaurant
on the street corner

638
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,120
with great dishes.

639
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,510
If you have time,

640
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:50,640
let's go have dinner there.

641
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,440
But it's raining heavily.

642
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Quite inconvenient.

643
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:57,990
I have umbrellas.

644
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,470
Shall we go?

645
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,600
I'm not interested in food.

646
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,880
I would rather not go.

647
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:07,750
General Tao.

648
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,120
General Tao.

649
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:10,550
Miss Qingyun.

650
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Muxu?

651
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:13,640
Did you see His Lordship?

652
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,030
He isn't here.

653
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,270
What do you

654
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:16,960
want him for?

655
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,710
Her Ladyship went up the mountain
for herb collecting.

656
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,230
But it's raining heavily.

657
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,360
Worried about her,

658
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,470
I went to the Magistrate's Residence

659
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:23,790
but didn't find His Lordship.

660
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:25,030
I had to come here and try my luck.

661
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:25,680
How long has she been away?

662
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:26,790
For more than two hours.

663
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,470
I'll go look for her.

664
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,310
Let me go with you.

665
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,920
Go find His Lordship!

666
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:32,710
All right.

667
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:36,840
Go. Let's check over there.

668
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:38,710
Here. Eat it.

669
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:39,750
Enjoy some food.

670
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,360
Eat it.

671
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,160
Tastes great.

672
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:43,680
Indeed.

673
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,200
Excuse me,

674
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:45,510
did you see a lady

675
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:46,360
like this tall

676
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:47,270
go up the mountain?

677
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:53,920
Isn't this the lady?

678
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,990
Not her.

679
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,200
But nearly as tall as her.

680
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:56,750
No.

681
00:33:57,030 --> 00:33:58,550
I think she's the one.

682
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,840
Qingyun, let's go.

683
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,060
(Wine)

684
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:09,470
This girl

685
00:34:09,470 --> 00:34:11,280
looks quite sweet.

686
00:35:14,150 --> 00:35:14,960
Are you all right?

687
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:19,360
Blood!

688
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:20,760
Mr. Tao, you're bleeding!

689
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:21,400
I'm all right.

690
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:22,760
Go.

691
00:35:23,670 --> 00:35:24,800
Let's go up there for your sister.

692
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:27,510
No way.

693
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:28,880
You're so badly wounded.

694
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:29,960
I have to take you back.

695
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:30,960
I'm all right.

696
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:34,400
No! Go back with me!

697
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:38,720
Go.

698
00:36:27,590 --> 00:36:28,550
Ji Man!

699
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:32,240
Ji Man!

700
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,470
Ji Man!

701
00:36:34,990 --> 00:36:36,440
Ji Man, are you all right?

702
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:39,990
How do you feel?

703
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,440
Who is it?

704
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,630
(The wedding day)

705
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:54,590
What are you doing here?

706
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:55,400
Mr. Yuan.

707
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,030
Glad that I made it.

708
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:58,440
No mistake is made.

709
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:00,030
What do you mean?

710
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,470
I'll explain it to you some other day.

711
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:02,240
Now, go with me.

712
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,470
Let go of me!

713
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:05,030
Before you explain it,

714
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:05,880
I'm not going anywhere!

715
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,030
I...

716
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,800
Miss Muxu,

717
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:11,670
please leave us.

718
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,720
I have something

719
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,470
to tell her.

720
00:37:16,550 --> 00:37:17,670
Muxu, leave us.

721
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:29,670
Speak.

722
00:37:29,670 --> 00:37:30,190
Ji Man,

723
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,360
you mustn't

724
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,510
marry Ning Yuxuan!

725
00:37:35,070 --> 00:37:35,920
Mr. Yuan,

726
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:37,760
Ning Yuxuan and I

727
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:38,960
love each other.

728
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,920
No one can

729
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,800
break us up.

730
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:42,960
In my heart,

731
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
you're like my big brother.

732
00:37:43,990 --> 00:37:44,400
I hope

733
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,280
you'll give me your best wishes,

734
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,240
instead of being ridiculous.

735
00:37:46,590 --> 00:37:47,400
You're right.

736
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,400
I'm indeed your brother.

737
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,360
Fine.

738
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:53,670
I'll tell you everything.

739
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:55,960
18 years ago,

740
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,960
in the Tea Gang,

741
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,510
you were born.

742
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,030
Then those uncles told me

743
00:38:01,150 --> 00:38:02,070
that I was your brother

744
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:04,030
and I had to protect you.

745
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,190
You mean I'm related...

746
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,280
To the Tea Gang?

747
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:22,320
You're a descendant.

748
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,760
However,

749
00:38:24,630 --> 00:38:25,840
your biological father

750
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:28,320
isn't the Third Chief Ji Ming,

751
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,800
under the codename Tiger.

752
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,030
He is

753
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,440
Cai Wenzheng,

754
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:36,030
the Chief of the Tea Gang.

755
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,360
I don't know what you're talking about.

756
00:38:53,630 --> 00:38:54,510
Ji Man,

757
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:56,150
do you still not understand?

758
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:57,620
Ning Yuxuan's father,

759
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:58,970
Ning Zhongtian,

760
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:01,780
was killed

761
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:03,090
by Cai Wenzheng.

762
00:39:03,340 --> 00:39:04,140
And you are

763
00:39:05,530 --> 00:39:09,300
Cai Wenzheng's biological daughter.

764
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,220
Your father Cai Wenzheng

765
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:19,780
was hunted and killed

766
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,180
by Ning Zhongtian's subordinates.

767
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,300
Before he died,

768
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,530
he entrusted his twin daughters,

769
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,140
you and Nie Sangyu,

770
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,570
to Mr. Ji.

771
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Mr. Ji, all by himself,

772
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:31,660
couldn't take care of two girls.

773
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,930
So, he entrusted Nie Sangyu

774
00:39:34,450 --> 00:39:35,930
to Nie Xiangyuan.

775
00:39:37,660 --> 00:39:38,890
Mr. Ji turns out

776
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,050
to be your foster father.

777
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,050
Your biological father

778
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,010
is Cai Wenzheng.

779
00:39:50,090 --> 00:39:50,930
Mr. Ji

780
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:51,930
didn't want me

781
00:39:51,930 --> 00:39:52,740
to tell you about this.

782
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:54,490
But I have to!

783
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,530
I can't just watch you

784
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,530
love Ning Yuxuan

785
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,530
more and more

786
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,620
or even live with him forever.

787
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,370
I must protect you.

788
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:22,700
Nie Sangyu is

789
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,530
my biological sister?

790
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,370
If you don't believe me,

791
00:40:31,370 --> 00:40:32,410
go back to the ship with me

792
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:33,740
and let Mr. Ji

793
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,370
explain everything.

794
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,010
Then who are you?

795
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,180
How did you get to know this?

796
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,260
I'm the son of Yuan Dingshan,

797
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,570
the Second Chief of the Tea Gang.

798
00:41:00,450 --> 00:41:01,570
When I was little,

799
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,620
I gave you this jade pendant

800
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:05,970
as your birthday present.

801
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:37,740
I don't believe

802
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:39,050
even a single word of yours.

803
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,090
I'm going to see Ning Yuxuan now.

804
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,450
He's waiting for me.

805
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,740
It's all right that you don't trust me!

806
00:41:49,930 --> 00:41:51,340
You can also deceive yourself.

807
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:52,780
You can even

808
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:54,010
let go of the hatred

809
00:41:54,010 --> 00:41:55,860
for your fathers' death.

810
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,050
But have you thought about it?

811
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:02,700
Over all these years,

812
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,530
Ning Yuxuan has been trying hard
to annihilate Tea Gang members.

813
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:07,140
If he knows

814
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:07,930
you're the daughter

815
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:09,700
of the man who killed his father,

816
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:11,820
would he really

817
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,490
let it go?

818
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,370
Back then,

819
00:42:45,370 --> 00:42:46,700
he took me to enlist the Tea Gang.

820
00:42:49,660 --> 00:42:51,340
But Cai Wenzheng,
the Chief of the Tea Gang,

821
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:52,370
regretted his decision.

822
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:53,890
Right in front of me,

823
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,570
they killed my father.

824
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,340
I was five years old then.

825
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,220
All by myself,

826
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,530
I dragged my father home.

827
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,860
Since then,

828
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:11,700
I've never

829
00:43:11,700 --> 00:43:12,700
slept soundly.

830
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:14,140
The hatred

831
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:15,700
has been torturing me.

832
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:18,970
Then, the nightmares...

833
00:43:21,930 --> 00:43:23,660
They keep me restless all the time.

834
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:33,260
