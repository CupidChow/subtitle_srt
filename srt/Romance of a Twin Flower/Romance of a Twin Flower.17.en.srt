=Episode 17=

3
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,360
Be careful. Careful.

4
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:49,960
Get up, Gui Bai.

5
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,410
Get up!

6
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,880
Get up, Gui Bai.

7
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:00,320
Get up!

8
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,130
Come on.

9
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:09,850
Have some water.

10
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,970
How do you feel?

11
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:20,250
You seldom drink, do you?

12
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:22,410
I have to protect His Lordship.

13
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,600
I can't drink.

14
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,690
Then you shouldn't have drunk that much.

15
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:27,370
Do you

16
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,720
just give yourself to His Lordship?

17
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,130
His Lordship...

18
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,370
He's a good official.

19
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,250
He often says

20
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
we should contribute to life,

21
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,850
defend the people,

22
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,090
learn from the sages,

23
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:49,640
and maintain a peaceful world.

24
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,920
Peaceful world.

25
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,370
What a nerd!

26
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,010
I know

27
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,130
you've been stalking me

28
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,480
these days.

29
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,570
Your master

30
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,010
sent you for some investigations,

31
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:32,570
right?

32
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,530
But I also know

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,040
you're doing something else.

34
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:43,530
Protecting me.

35
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:47,410
Do you know

36
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,810
how I realized that?

37
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,250
Because wherever I went,

38
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,920
I could smell

39
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,720
the blood from you.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:11,640
The man behind this

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,880
framed me with Lianxiang's death

42
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,080
and urgently forced me to plead guilty.

43
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,130
If I guess correctly,

44
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,760
since my jade pendant was lost,

45
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:24,490
I've been in his trap.

46
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:26,050
Haifang is far from the capital

47
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,610
but the news went back there

48
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,880
so quickly.

49
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm afraid they want to suppress us

50
00:04:33,170 --> 00:04:34,400
with this murder case.

51
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,050
His Majesty has been aware.

52
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,370
You'll be sent back to the capital

53
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,760
for the interrogation
of the Court of Judicial Review.

54
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,840
In case of unexpected trouble,

55
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:47,320
I guess they would kill you

56
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,170
before you return to the capital

57
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,640
and pretend you killed yourself.

58
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,440
I know.

59
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,610
I'm a titled lady

60
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:58,080
and now involved in a murder case.

61
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:02,440
If I'm really sent back to the capital,

62
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,690
I would be pretty much doomed.

63
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,050
I might even die.

64
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:10,370
So, this place

65
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,200
could be the safest for me

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,840
and the easiest to be monitored by you.

67
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,440
Ning Yuxuan,

68
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:18,370
I know you've been protecting me

69
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,730
from the beginning.

70
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:25,440
Thank you.

71
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:30,960
Boss.

72
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,130
Have you got anything?

73
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:34,320
Shen Liancheng has a minion Qiang,

74
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,010
a habitual thief.

75
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,810
He used to be stingy.

76
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:39,050
He spent all the money he stole

77
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:39,930
on the wine.

78
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:40,570
And in the casino,

79
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,690
he was heavily in debt.

80
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,930
But the other day,

81
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:44,050
he suddenly

82
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,130
got rich.

83
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,370
He not only paid off the debt,

84
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,880
but also became a wealthy man

85
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:49,370
in the casino.

86
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,130
My brother and I

87
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,490
sounded him out.

88
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:52,610
He confessed.

89
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:54,610
Shen Liancheng asked him

90
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,050
to steal the jade pendant.

91
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,280
Shen Liancheng?

92
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,010
Shen Liancheng isn't an enemy

93
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,320
of Ms. Nie.

94
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,280
He probably

95
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,250
framed her to trap Ning Yuxuan.

96
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:10,520
You two,

97
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:11,570
keep a close eye on Shen Liancheng.

98
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:12,730
His plan failed.

99
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:13,520
In a day or two,

100
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,840
he would do something else.

101
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:16,490
Got it.

102
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:17,050
Got it.

103
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,130
Go.

104
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:21,880
The smell?

105
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,930
After you left that day,

106
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,760
I rethought

107
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,170
Lianxiang's case.

108
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:27,570
All the evidence

109
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:29,250
pointed to Mrs. Ning.

110
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,050
But one thing

111
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:31,250
was wrong.

112
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:32,840
The smell.

113
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,080
I wouldn't be wrong

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,010
about Mrs. Ning's smell of rouge.

115
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,490
But in Lianxiang's room,

116
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,280
I didn't smell

117
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,960
the same rouge.

118
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,810
Instead,

119
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:42,930
I smelt something

120
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:44,130
I seldom smelt before.

121
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:44,930
So, at that time,

122
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:45,810
I didn't realize

123
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:46,960
what smell it was.

124
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:47,690
But the other day,

125
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,010
I went to the wharf.

126
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:50,200
I smelt the same thing

127
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,730
from the boatmen

128
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,520
of the Dragon Gang.

129
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,250
The fishy smell

130
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:56,170
with the mildew smell

131
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,490
from the cabins.

132
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,610
This smell

133
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,690
would only exist on those

134
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,320
who always put out to the sea.

135
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,760
So, I'm sure

136
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,280
Mrs. Ning didn't

137
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:05,960
go to Lianxiang's room

138
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:07,250
that night.

139
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,570
The Dragon Gang?

140
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,050
It's quite a big thing.

141
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,840
What? How do I not know?

142
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,010
You know what?

143
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,130
It's not Mrs. Ning

144
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:22,250
who killed Lianxiang.

145
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,250
Not her?

146
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,370
Then who did?

147
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,490
No idea.

148
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,610
But I heard

149
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:28,690
Miss Shui of Shuiyan House

150
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,640
saw the murderer

151
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,730
and recognized him.

152
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:32,050
She did?

153
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,250
Yes.

154
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:35,130
The other day, she was jarred

155
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,280
and couldn't say anything.

156
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,520
Now, she has woken up.

157
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,690
Officers are waiting for her testimony.

158
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:40,570
Really?

159
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:43,570
Don't you see that more officers

160
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:45,200
are patrolling around Shuiyan House?

161
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,370
They're waiting for Miss Shui

162
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,640
to identify the murderer.

163
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,760
You're right, I guess.

164
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:49,400
Recently,

165
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,610
more officers are patrolling.

166
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:53,280
These years,

167
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:55,570
Shen Liancheng has been doing crimes

168
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,880
with the support of Lord Tan.

169
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:58,640
But now,

170
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,440
Lord Tan has abandoned him.

171
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:01,880
Few men

172
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:03,080
still want to follow him.

173
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:04,280
You're right.

174
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,490
After Shen Liancheng dies,

175
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:07,840
the original Dragon Gang

176
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,930
would no longer exist.

177
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,400
By then...

178
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,520
Lang,

179
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,810
we would have to

180
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,610
rely on you.

181
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:18,730
- Yeah.
- That's right.

182
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,730
Gentlemen,

183
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,880
you're my seniors.

184
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,050
You've been groveling

185
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,520
to Shen Liancheng for years.

186
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,800
Now we finally get a chance

187
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,970
to restore our gang.

188
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,610
I swear I'll do my best

189
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:39,880
to regain our status!

190
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,560
Good point.

191
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,760
Yeah. Good point.

192
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,160
- That's good.
- That's great.

193
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:44,880
Good point.

194
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Chief, bad news.

195
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:49,280
Around Shuiyan House,

196
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,490
more officers are guarding.

197
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,040
They change shifts every two hours.

198
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:53,880
Our men can't get in.

199
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,280
Chief,

200
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:56,490
what do we do?

201
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:00,090
What time is it?

202
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,330
A quarter past six.

203
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,450
Let's stick to our plan.

204
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:08,450
Yes.

205
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,850
Shen Liancheng set out with his men?

206
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:13,560
Yes.

207
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,490
It's quite lucky

208
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,800
for an idiot like him

209
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,920
to have lived to this day.

210
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,680
You screwed your mission

211
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,560
and still laughed at someone else?

212
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,680
If you fail your mission again,

213
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,160
Shen Liancheng

214
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,330
would be your example.

215
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,560
I understand.

216
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:41,090
I've arranged the best warriors

217
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:42,250
of Haifang

218
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,330
to stand by

219
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,760
and cooperate with Shen Liancheng.

220
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,920
This time,

221
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,730
they must do the mission perfectly.

222
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,090
It's best to kill them both.

223
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,490
Only in this way

224
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,760
can Master stop worrying.

225
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,160
Yes.

226
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,520
What are you waiting for?

227
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,210
Kill them!

228
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,760
Losers.

229
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,850
Go.

230
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,280
Miss Shui,

231
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:53,640
could you please do me a favor?

232
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,850
What is it?

233
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,490
I have a fair idea

234
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,610
of the man behind all this.

235
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,450
But with so little evidence,

236
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,610
I can't arrest

237
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,400
the murderer.

238
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,970
In this case,

239
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,800
Nie Sangyu would be sent to the capital

240
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,490
for the interrogation.

241
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,850
So, I need to set a trap.

242
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,250
And I need you

243
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:13,920
to cooperate with me.

244
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,450
I spread disinformation

245
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,160
that you saw

246
00:12:18,610 --> 00:12:19,280
the face

247
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,560
of the murderer.

248
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,090
Are you saying

249
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:25,880
I should wait in my room

250
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,130
until the murderer comes?

251
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,760
I'll arrange

252
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,760
the best guards

253
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,010
to keep you safe.

254
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,970
Let me do it.

255
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,210
Your Lordship,

256
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
I want to stay here

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,280
and protect Miss Shui

258
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,610
without moving a step.

259
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,450
When I'm around,

260
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,370
I'll let no one hurt her.

261
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,330
Miss Shui.

262
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:51,520
If you trust me,

263
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:55,130
I'll protect you with my life.

264
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,210
I trust you.

265
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:05,400
Don't be afraid.

266
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,450
I promised to keep you safe.

267
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,640
Even at the cost of my life.

268
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,210
How touching!

269
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,090
Chief, some men are coming.

270
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:50,970
Our men saw

271
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:51,730
Shen Liancheng take his minions

272
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:52,730
to the Magistrate's Residence.

273
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:53,520
As soon as

274
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,450
they saw him,

275
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:55,370
they reported it.

276
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,160
Chief.

277
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:58,520
Oh, no.

278
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:03,450
Hey, where are you going?

279
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,090
Come on. Be seated.

280
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:06,760
Don't worry, Miss Shui.

281
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,560
Be seated.

282
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,450
Don't move.

283
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,250
Oh, I know.

284
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:28,760
What?

285
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,560
It may hurt.

286
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,370
Bear it.

287
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,850
I'm used to it.

288
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:45,880
To what?

289
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:47,330
Can anyone in this world

290
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:48,730
be used to getting hurt?

291
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,880
Since my childhood,

292
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:54,370
I've been fighting around
with His Lordship

293
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,760
and following his instructions,

294
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,730
to contribute to life...

295
00:14:58,850 --> 00:15:00,040
Defend the people,

296
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,280
learn from the sages,

297
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:03,090
and maintain a peaceful world.

298
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:06,370
What a nerd!

299
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,130
Next time when you protect others,

300
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:08,920
could you first

301
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,210
take care of yourself?

302
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:11,730
The life doesn't hurt.

303
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,970
Neither does the world.

304
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:13,760
When you're wounded,

305
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,280
only you feel hurt.

306
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,400
Ning Yuxuan.

307
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,610
Why did you suddenly take me back?

308
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:30,250
You released me without permission.

309
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:31,130
Would this cause trouble?

310
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:32,010
Listen.

311
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,090
The murderer would do something tonight.

312
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,280
I must arrest him and his men.

313
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,590
The prison is no longer safe.

314
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,540
You should hide here.

315
00:15:39,850 --> 00:15:41,040
You found the murderer?

316
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,280
Not yet.

317
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:44,450
But trust me.

318
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,490
Tonight,

319
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,070
everything would be clear.

320
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,210
Tonight?

321
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:51,850
What would...

322
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:52,800
Stop asking questions.

323
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:53,330
Later,

324
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:54,370
hide somewhere.

325
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,450
Whatever you hear,

326
00:15:55,610 --> 00:15:56,490
don't come out.

327
00:15:58,970 --> 00:15:59,610
Go.

328
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:02,920
Stay safe.

329
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,610
Just go.

330
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:22,620
(Magistrate's Residence)

331
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,370
Chief,

332
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,330
everything is ready

333
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,330
as you wanted.

334
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,330
Under such circumstances,

335
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,010
we have to fight desperately.

336
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,880
Tonight,

337
00:16:31,850 --> 00:16:34,370
I must kill Ning Yuxuan!

338
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,730
Yes, sir.

339
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:47,620
(Be Diligent and Alert)

340
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:55,400
Shen Liancheng, Chief of the Dragon Gang,

341
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:57,920
broke out of prison, killed Lianxiang,

342
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
and tried to kill the witness Miss Shui.

343
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,520
Tonight, he even broke in

344
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:06,170
to assassinate me.

345
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:08,360
Shen Liancheng,

346
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,320
do you plead guilty?

347
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,970
You knew I would come?

348
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:16,520
The man behind you

349
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,600
tried so hard to get you out of prison

350
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,520
because he wanted you to do something.

351
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,340
But your murder came to light

352
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,420
and you failed to kill Miss Shui.

353
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,500
You have no way out now.

354
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,540
Unless you want to be abandoned,

355
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,780
you'd better confess.

356
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,260
Nice trap, Mr. Ning.

357
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,260
But so what?

358
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:47,460
You forced me

359
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,940
like this.

360
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:50,060
Even if I have to die,

361
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,500
I would fight it out with you!

362
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,220
Now that I dared to break in,

363
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,060
I didn't dream to leave alive!

364
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,020
Take him down!

365
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,340
(Will Ning Yuxuan be in danger?)

366
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,060
Ning Yuxuan!

367
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,900
Ning Yuxuan, are you all right?

368
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,100
Leave.

369
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,500
No, I won't!

370
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,820
I must stick with you!

371
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,740
I must stick with you!

372
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:28,500
Leave!

373
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,340
I'll stick with you, alive or dead!

374
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,100
I won't...

375
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:32,140
I won't leave.

376
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:32,940
No.

377
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:53,860
No.

378
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,180
Ning Yuxuan!

379
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:07,760
♪Memories are always bitter
My heart is breaking into pieces♪

380
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:12,550
♪Even a true lover's knot
can't make us a true couple♪

381
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,900
- My wife
- Ning Yuxuan.

382
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,340
can't get hurt.

383
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:19,860
No.

384
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,140
Ning Yuxuan!

385
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:26,100
Ms. Nie, are you all right?

386
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,580
Ning Yuxuan.

387
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,060
Ning Yuxuan...

388
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:30,940
How do you feel?

389
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,020
Sorry.

390
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,260
It's my bad. Sorry.

391
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,660
It doesn't matter.

392
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:41,900
I'm not that fragile.

393
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,380
Ning Yuxuan...

394
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,900
Ning Yuxuan.

395
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,380
Ning Yuxuan!

396
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,580
Ning Yuxuan, don't scare me.

397
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:55,140
Wake up!

398
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:58,660
Ning Yuxuan!

399
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,060
Ning Yuxuan, don't scare me.

400
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,500
Sorry.

401
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,860
I'm sorry.

402
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:15,580
Hey,

403
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,500
be gentle.

404
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,100
Or let me do it.

405
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,260
You?

406
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:21,060
You want him to hurt more?

407
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:21,700
I...

408
00:22:21,940 --> 00:22:22,660
It's all right.

409
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,020
I was wounded,

410
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,500
but I killed Shen Liancheng.

411
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:27,100
It's worth it.

412
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,820
Boss,

413
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,580
I don't agree.

414
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,700
Last night,

415
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,940
you could have

416
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:32,980
also killed Lackey Ning!

417
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,780
That was quite critical.

418
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:36,700
If I missed it,

419
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,060
I might hurt Ms. Nie.

420
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,500
I couldn't make a rash act.

421
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,980
So, you didn't want to hurt Ms. Nie.

422
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,300
We thought you...

423
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:45,060
I showed mercy to Lackey Ning?

424
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:51,180
The Nings are

425
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,700
our sworn foes.

426
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,020
I would never show any mercy

427
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,500
to Ning Yuxuan.

428
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,820
Shen Liancheng is dead.

429
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,220
We got rid of

430
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
our biggest trouble.

431
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,020
Now,

432
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,260
our plan to restore the Tea Gang

433
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,980
would officially start.

434
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,180
From this day on,

435
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:08,260
anyone who did bad things,

436
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,500
in collusion with Shen Liancheng,

437
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,460
would be eliminated.

438
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,020
Some men wanted
to go back to the right path

439
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,260
but were restrained by Shen Liancheng.

440
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,420
Let's present them

441
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,780
a totally new Dragon Gang.

442
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:23,460
Eliminating the bullies
and helping people in need

443
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:25,660
are the only codes of conduct

444
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,580
of our Tea Gang.

445
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,020
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

446
00:24:21,020 --> 00:24:22,060
Thank you

447
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,900
for protecting me all the time.

448
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,340
But it turns out...

449
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,820
It turns out

450
00:24:31,980 --> 00:24:33,340
I'm not your wife.

451
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,740
You have to get better soon.

452
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:47,300
Don't scare me.

453
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,060
Do you hear?

454
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:12,620
(Magistrate's Residence)

455
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,500
- Your Lordship.
- Where's my wife?

456
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,940
Has she left?

457
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,020
Take it easy, Your Lordship.

458
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,420
Her Ladyship is still here.

459
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:44,500
In the past few days,

460
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,540
she was taking care of you.

461
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,180
Now, she's resting in her room.

462
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,660
Glad she has stayed.

463
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,460
Glad she has stayed.

464
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,780
Now that you woke up,

465
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,180
I'll have the doctor

466
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,020
check up on you.

467
00:25:55,020 --> 00:25:56,300
Not now.

468
00:25:56,940 --> 00:25:58,460
Have you interrogated the criminals?

469
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:01,020
Have they signed the testimonies?

470
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,220
My wife must be vindicated.

471
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,260
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

472
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,420
They were interrogated.

473
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,780
After Shen Liancheng died,

474
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,060
his men all confessed.

475
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,020
They not only admitted

476
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:09,780
how they framed Her Ladyship,

477
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,740
but also that they killed the beggars

478
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,020
in the temple of the capital.

479
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,540
Before I passed out,

480
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,580
I kind of saw the mark of the Tea Gang

481
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,780
on Shen Liancheng.

482
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,980
He was also from the Tea Gang?

483
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,740
Do some investigations

484
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,340
and see if the Dragon Gang

485
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,540
has more remnants from the Tea Gang.

486
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:35,740
Yes, sir.

487
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
Another thing.

488
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:40,340
Shen Liancheng made a sudden attack.

489
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,420
But Yuan Lang popped out unexpectedly.

490
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,260
How did he know about the attack?

491
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,900
I'm confused, too.

492
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,980
How could Yuan Lang

493
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:50,980
get here much faster than me?

494
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,540
He must have known

495
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,660
Shen Liancheng's plan.

496
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,740
Or he wouldn't have come

497
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,580
so fast.

498
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,980
Yuan Lang.

499
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,020
Shen Liancheng.

500
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,260
Dragon Gang.

501
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:11,100
Do a more careful investigation.

502
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,300
There must be something fishy.

503
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,500
Yes.

504
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,060
The problem in Haifang is

505
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:19,500
more complicated than I imagined.

506
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,420
No more thinking about this.

507
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,180
My wife must be tired these days.

508
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,180
Ask the cook to make something delicious

509
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:29,900
for her.

510
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,220
But Her Ladyship said,

511
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,780
after you woke up,

512
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,700
she would find Ship Guihai

513
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:38,900
and leave here.

514
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:40,660
What?

515
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,540
Your Ladyship.

516
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,260
You're awake?

517
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,260
Do you feel any better?

518
00:27:58,420 --> 00:27:59,940
Does anything ail you?

519
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:02,740
I... I feel...

520
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,500
I feel numb all over.

521
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,300
I don't feel good at all.

522
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:07,340
What's the numb part?

523
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,660
Your arm?

524
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,020
Or the wound on your back?

525
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,180
Is it because of that wound?

526
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,300
How does it hurt?

527
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,340
It hurts here.

528
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,700
Your heart?

529
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,020
What's wrong with it?

530
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:28,540
It hurts?

531
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:30,260
Is it because of the wound?

532
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:31,220
But...

533
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:38,580
Are you all right or not?

534
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:40,980
I...

535
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:48,500
I'm so silly. You fooled me again.

536
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:49,700
The doctor said

537
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,700
you were all right

538
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:51,660
and would be better soon.

539
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,500
So...

540
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,500
So, I'm leaving.

541
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,500
Do you really wish to leave?

542
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,420
Yes.

543
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,100
Now, I know

544
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,980
who I am.

545
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,500
Shouldn't I go home?

546
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:13,900
And...

547
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,500
And I'm not Nie Sangyu.

548
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,260
Not your wife.

549
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,020
But I've never treated you

550
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,580
as Nie Sangyu.

551
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,100
So...

552
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,700
So, I'm Ji Man.

553
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,420
I should go back to my own home.

554
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:46,180
So much for this conversation.

555
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:46,820
I'll take Muxu away.

556
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,900
You stay for more rest.

557
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:52,300
The soup was just made.

558
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,260
It's still hot.

559
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,500
Have it before it gets cold.

560
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,900
Your Ladyship,

561
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:08,180
are we really leaving?

562
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,740
What about His Lordship?

563
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:13,020
Muxu,

564
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:16,220
I'm not Nie Sangyu.

565
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:17,580
I'm Ji Man.

566
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,020
So,

567
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,980
stop calling me Your Ladyship.

568
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,300
Call me My Lady instead.

569
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,740
Yes, Your Ladyship.

570
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,660
No.

571
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,900
My Lady, I mean.

572
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:30,100
Where are we going now?

573
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:40,900
Now...

574
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,020
We're going back to Ship Guihai.

575
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:46,740
Ship Guihai?

576
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:50,980
Here we go.

577
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,260
What's up?

578
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:14,260
Someone asked to see Miss Ji.

579
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,980
Miss Ji?

580
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:17,460
Yes.

581
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:19,900
Get him in.

582
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,500
Yes.

583
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,500
Here he is.

584
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:37,980
Miss Ji Man,

585
00:31:38,300 --> 00:31:39,580
someone's looking for Ship Guihai

586
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,940
on the wharf,

587
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,260
claiming to be you.

588
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,500
I guess

589
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,020
she must be a fraud.

590
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:47,060
You're always on the ship, aren't you?

591
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,020
What?

592
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,580
Someone pretends to be Miss...

593
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:00,660
Who dares to pretend to be me

594
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,780
and make trouble at my place?

595
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,460
Bring her to me.

596
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,940
I'd like to see

597
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:07,180
who this woman is.

598
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,100
- Yes.
- Yes.

599
00:32:20,020 --> 00:32:21,060
- Done.
- All right.

600
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,660
Come on. Hurry up.

601
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:24,540
(Haifang Wharf)

602
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,100
Hurry.

603
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,580
Watch your step. Be careful.

604
00:32:34,940 --> 00:32:35,700
What...

605
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:38,500
What a big ship!

606
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,980
So, this is Ship Guihai?

607
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,260
Ship Guihai.

608
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:50,260
Enjoying the sea breeze here

609
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,460
feels so good.

610
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,020
It's nothing.

611
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:53,940
After we embark on the ship,

612
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,980
we can enjoy the sea breeze every day.

613
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,580
Really?

614
00:32:58,900 --> 00:32:59,540
Muxu.

615
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:01,740
Think about it.

616
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:03,740
If...

617
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:05,260
If I'm not

618
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,020
Guihai Warrior's daughter,

619
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:06,500
would...

620
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,420
Would we have

621
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,500
nowhere to go?

622
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:10,740
My... My Lady,

623
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,340
don't scare me.

624
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:15,900
It wouldn't happen.

625
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,740
I was just kidding.

626
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:19,100
Come on. Let's go over there.

627
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:19,700
All right.

628
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:19,980
Go.

629
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,540
Why hasn't she come yet?

630
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:27,460
My Lady, you're back.

631
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,340
You're really back.

632
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,300
We looked for you for a long time.

633
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:30,340
At last, you're back.

634
00:33:30,340 --> 00:33:31,300
Yeah, My Lady.

635
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,100
You're finally back.

636
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,260
- Great.
- Wonderful.

637
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,540
Miss Ji?

638
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,420
This is terrific.

639
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:47,780
Make way!

640
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,780
Miss, you...

641
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,260
Oh, My Lady.

642
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:56,340
My Lady, you're finally back!

643
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:57,420
Where have you been?

644
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,940
- I miss you so much.
- Let go of her!

645
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,540
If you still didn't come back,

646
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,340
I would abandon the ship

647
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,260
and search for you on the land!

648
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,220
But Miss...

649
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:04,500
These days,

650
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:05,420
it's been so hard for me

651
00:34:05,420 --> 00:34:07,460
to pretend to be you.

652
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:08,820
Miss.

653
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:11,180
Excuse me, but who are you?

654
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:12,620
I'm Sang Shen.

655
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:13,100
Sang...

656
00:34:14,140 --> 00:34:14,860
Sang Shen?

657
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:17,780
My Lady, you don't recognize me?

658
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:20,660
Should I know you?

659
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,100
I... I grew up with you,

660
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,500
sticking together for a dozen years.

661
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:23,980
Yeah.

662
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,430
Yeah, My Lady.

663
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,160
Right, My Lady.

664
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:25,900
That's right, My Lady.

665
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,100
You grew up with me,

666
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,900
sticking together for a dozen years?

667
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,180
Do you remember that?

668
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,540
Her Ladyship...

669
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,780
She fell into the water and got hurt.

670
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,020
She forgot a lot of things.

671
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:38,940
Hurt?

672
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,420
Are you all right, My Lady?

673
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:41,900
- Much... Much better now.
- Are you all right?

674
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,460
And who are you?

675
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:46,940
Me?

676
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,020
Let go of her!

677
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:49,980
I'm Muxu,

678
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:53,460
Miss Ji's closest maid.

679
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,540
Shut up!

680
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,340
Go away!

681
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,380
This is my lady.

682
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,180
Who do you think you are?

683
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,940
She's my lady!

684
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:58,660
Wait, wait.

685
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,820
I have something to ask you.

686
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,500
Are you sure

687
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,380
I'm your lady

688
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,300
and Ji Ming's daughter?

689
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:04,380
Yes, of course.

690
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,340
You're my lady.

691
00:35:05,340 --> 00:35:06,020
Forget about anything else.

692
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:06,980
The smell of cream

693
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,860
on you

694
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,020
can be unique in the world!

695
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,500
It's made of lily, cardamon,

696
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,900
rosin, almond, and glossy Ganoderma.

697
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,660
That explains.

698
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,820
No wonder when I embarked,

699
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,780
I felt very familiar.

700
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,860
Of course, you did.

701
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,620
This is your home!

702
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,700
Yeah.

703
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:23,820
This is your home, My Lady.

704
00:35:25,060 --> 00:35:25,820
Why can't I

705
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:26,500
think of anything?

706
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,020
Come with me, My Lady.

707
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,500
Hurry.

708
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,180
Let me show you around.

709
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:29,620
Wait for me.

710
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,100
Hurry.

711
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,820
My Lady, come in.

712
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:34,580
Come in and look.

713
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,820
This is your room.

714
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:40,140
My room?

715
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,940
What a luxury room!

716
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,220
My Lady,

717
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:44,180
come this way.

718
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,220
Check your clothes.

719
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,140
These are the new clothes

720
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,140
for you.

721
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,300
Made of luxurious ramie fabric

722
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,500
we brought back from Yinzhou

723
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,700
before the turn of the year.

724
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:54,820
Just in fashion.

725
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,580
Ramie fabric?

726
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:58,660
The special fabric

727
00:35:58,660 --> 00:35:59,460
for the Palace

728
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:00,220
in Yinzhou?

729
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,940
Yes, your favorite fabric.

730
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,020
Extremely expensive.

731
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,660
All the clothes are made of it?

732
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,180
There are a few more
wardrobes of clothes.

733
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,380
What are these?

734
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,020
My Lady, they're all yours.

735
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,460
Come and look.

736
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,100
Muxu,

737
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:26,940
look at this.

738
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:28,940
Put it on.

739
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:29,900
Come on.

740
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,060
Looks great.

741
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,300
Yes, yes.

742
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:36,180
A good jewel makes you look better.

743
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,060
Look at this bracelet.

744
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,180
Looks perfect.

745
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,540
- My Lady.
- Better than those in the capital.

746
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,220
But My Lady,

747
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,540
you never wore such jewels before.

748
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,060
These are your favorite.

749
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,420
The best pearls. Round and plump.

750
00:36:50,420 --> 00:36:51,140
They're mine?

751
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:05,580
What a great pearl!

752
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:07,940
For my daily wear?

753
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,020
My Lady,

754
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,220
come here and see.

755
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:12,860
Something more?

756
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,620
Come and check.

757
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:16,420
What else?

758
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,020
Come on. Be seated.

759
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,580
You must be tired.

760
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,620
- All right.
- Be seated first.

761
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:19,940
My Lady.

762
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:21,180
- My Lady.
- You're so wealthy.

763
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:22,820
Books you've collected for years.

764
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,530
(Collection of Herbs)
Look.

765
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:25,980
Collection of Herbs?

766
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,500
Sheng Nong's Herbal Classic?
[*The Holy Farmer, a legendary ruler]

767
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,300
They're all out-of-print collections.

768
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,060
Classic of Cold Pathogenic Diseases.
Classic of Acupuncture.

769
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,500
Reference to Famous Herbs.

770
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:35,420
(My Lady, can you understand)

771
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,620
(these words?)

772
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,060
(Stop nagging.)

773
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,780
(We don't read the words,)

774
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,180
(but we can read the pictures.)

775
00:37:40,180 --> 00:37:41,180
(Besides,)

776
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,100
(I can learn to read)

777
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,500
(from this day on.)

778
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,180
(Sang Shen,)

779
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,020
(you should learn, too.)

780
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:46,820
(Why am I)

781
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,060
(recalling...)

782
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:48,500
My Lady,

783
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,420
you must be thirsty. Have some water.

784
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,300
Thank you.

785
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:57,540
What a nice cup!

786
00:37:58,060 --> 00:38:00,060
It's just your drinking cup.

787
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,020
Made of a whole piece of jade.

788
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,020
Jade?

789
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:03,980
A whole piece?

790
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,340
No flaws at all.

791
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,980
It feels warm and was perfectly carved.

792
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,860
Such a great cup

793
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:10,380
is even a rare treasure

794
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,460
for noble families in the capital.

795
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,780
It's true.

796
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:13,900
I can't drink with it.

797
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,140
Let's put it away.

798
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,500
If it's dropped or crashed,

799
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,300
there would be trouble.

800
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:18,300
Let me put it away.

801
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,300
No big deal, My Lady.

802
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,820
It's just a cup.

803
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,300
We've got some more in the warehouse.

804
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,140
Fine.

805
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
It's no big deal.

806
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,220
Besides this,

807
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,500
there are many more little things

808
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,220
you bought on impulse

809
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:33,660
but soon forgot.

810
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,500
Gold, silver,

811
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,500
jade, or glaze.

812
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,020
And everywhere, you bought houses,

813
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,180
shops, fields, and horse ranches.

814
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,860
Remember?

815
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,700
Here's the catalog.

816
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,540
Check it out.

817
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,380
Buy anything you want.

818
00:38:43,380 --> 00:38:44,580
I make records for you.

819
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:45,580
When you want something,

820
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,660
you can find it immediately.

821
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,900
What a wealthy family!

822
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,380
My Lady,

823
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,780
you're the only daughter of Ji Ming,

824
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,060
Guihai Warrior.

825
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,660
Not to mention such little things,

826
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:56,980
you even own Ship Guihai.

827
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,020
That's right.

828
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,020
I own the whole ship.

829
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:02,620
You remember it?

830
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,340
Never mind, My Lady.

831
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,380
Let me show you this.

832
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,500
You will recall something.

833
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Here, My Lady.

834
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,580
Formulations and experimental records

835
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:11,820
of the face creams

836
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:12,420
you've worked out for four years.

837
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:13,300
Check them out.

838
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:17,460
(The 12th formulation of face cream)

839
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,900
These are my formulations.

840
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,220
(The 13th formulation of face cream)

841
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,340
Five spoons of almond oil
and ten maces of beeswax.

842
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:26,340
Boiling for one hour.

843
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,620
All the processes

844
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
have been recorded.

845
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,380
Even the degree of boiling

846
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,900
and the most secret herb are recorded.

847
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,660
So, I knew how to make the cream before.

848
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,500
My Lady,

849
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,540
you invented the creams

850
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,940
just for us.

851
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,380
When you saw we have chapped skin

852
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:44,980
and bad appearances

853
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:45,820
because of the exposure to the sun,

854
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,060
you made up your mind

855
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,380
to make the best creams for us.

856
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,460
My Lady, you're the kindest girl

857
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:50,580
and you care about us most.

858
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,020
Think harder.

859
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:53,300
Have you recalled anything?

860
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,180
No, nothing.

861
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,780
It's... It's all right, My Lady.

862
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,020
Now that you're back,

863
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,140
you'll gradually get back your memories.

864
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,300
By the way, My Lady,

865
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:30,860
are you...

866
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,540
Are you still single?

867
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:35,100
What do you mean?

868
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,660
My Lady,

869
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:38,060
you ran away from home

870
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,980
to find the man you love

871
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,900
in the capital.

872
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,940
Did you find him?

873
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:42,500
The man I love?

874
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,820
The man she loves?

875
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:45,140
After a glance at him on the wharf,

876
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,140
you loved no one

877
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,140
but him.

878
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,020
After only a glance,

879
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:49,140
I fell in love with him?

880
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:55,300
Sounds like I used to be

881
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,580
very shallow.

882
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,420
Just a handsome man...

883
00:40:58,420 --> 00:40:59,940
Can he be more handsome
than Ning Yuxuan?

884
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:01,860
Who's Ning Yuxuan, My Lady?

885
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:06,780
No... Nobody.

886
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,700
Sang Shen.

887
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:10,580
Where's my father?

888
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:13,140
I mean Guihai Warrior,

889
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:14,700
my very rich father.

890
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:16,300
Let's... Let's go find him.

891
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:16,660
Go.

892
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,020
My Lady,

893
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,380
you have no idea.

894
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,140
After you left a message
and ran away from home,

895
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,820
Mr. Ji got very angry.

896
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,540
He went to the capital for you.

897
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,980
But since he left,

898
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,180
we've heard nothing of him.

899
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,540
We can't help worrying.

900
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,500
You didn't hear of him?

901
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,420
Then why didn't you search for him?

902
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,140
Don't worry.

903
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,580
Mr. Ji is like a free loach.

904
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,060
Wherever he goes,

905
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,100
he'll be safe.

906
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:35,980
He ordered us

907
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,580
to wait in Haifang until he returned.

908
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,900
Oh, I see.

909
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,220
Ning Yuxuan.

910
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:12,780
What are you doing here so late?

911
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:15,020
For business.

912
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:17,980
For business?

913
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:19,140
Who are you?

914
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:19,900
How daring!

915
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:20,980
This is Mr. Ning Yuxuan,

916
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,580
the magistrate of Haifang

917
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,340
and the husband of Miss Ji.

918
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,420
What?

919
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:27,580
Gui Bai,

920
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,940
Ship Guihai
hasn't been repaired for years.

921
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,140
It shall be under repair from now on.

922
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,660
Everyone aboard

923
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,940
should disembark for settlement.

924
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:36,540
Off you go.

925
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:41,620
You came for the repair thing?

926
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,060
In this case,

927
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,580
we wouldn't bother you.

928
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,060
We can afford the repair, after all.

929
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:52,500
Yeah, we'll repair it personally.

930
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:53,580
You can't force us, can you?

931
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:54,460
Without charging,

932
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:56,020
I'm not forcing anyone.

933
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,020
If anything goes wrong with the ship,

934
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:58,020
people will die.

935
00:42:58,060 --> 00:42:59,780
And no one can be responsible.

936
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:02,020
If you find it

937
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:02,980
very inconvenient,

938
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,020
I can offer my residence

939
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,020
for your settlement.

940
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:12,460
No, thanks.

941
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:14,940
How about this?

942
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,340
Tonight,

943
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:17,900
we'll set up

944
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:18,500
the fishing nets

945
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:19,140
and canvas

946
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,940
and spend the night simply

947
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,220
on the wharf.

948
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:22,220
By then,

949
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:22,980
we wouldn't disturb

950
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:23,860
the repair work.

951
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:24,700
What do you say, Your Lordship?

952
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,580
- Come on. Let's do it...
- Gui Bai,

953
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,100
any fishing nets or canvas,

954
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,340
once found damaged,

955
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:32,540
must be repaired.

956
00:43:32,860 --> 00:43:33,420
Yes, sir.

957
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:35,020
None of them can be taken off the ship.

958
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,420
Ning Yuxuan!

959
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:39,180
I...

00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:40,900
