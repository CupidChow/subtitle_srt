00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 18=

3
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,650
My Lady.

4
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:47,130
The sailors have been

5
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:47,960
placed in the inn.

6
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,130
Why don't we go there?

7
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:50,050
I don't want to go.

8
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,690
My Lady,

9
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,720
we left in a hurry

10
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,320
and I forgot to bring any cash.

11
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,440
How are we gonna pay for the hotel?

12
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,360
Don't worry.

13
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,360
I've figured it out.

14
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,720
Tonight,

15
00:01:57,720 --> 00:01:59,440
the three of us will go to
Haoxue Cosmetics

16
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:00,440
and make do with it.

17
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,650
Haoxue Cosmetics?

18
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:02,800
Where is Haoxue Cosmetics?

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,520
Haoxue Cosmetics.

20
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,650
Haoxue Cosmetics

21
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:06,240
is my cosmetics shop.

22
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:07,520
As long as I'm with you,

23
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,720
I'll be happy no matter where I go.

24
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:11,250
You're finally back, My Lady.

25
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:12,410
It's been so long,

26
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,250
and I have so much

27
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:14,370
to tell you.

28
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,640
Let's sleep together tonight.

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,090
No.

30
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,370
Miss Ji took care of Mr. Ning

31
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:19,320
all night last night,

32
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,640
and she's also been through a lot today.

33
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,290
Why don't we go back
to the Magistrate's Residence?

34
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:24,010
- No!
- No!

35
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:25,640
I don't want to go back.

36
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,640
You can go back if you want.

37
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,600
You'd better leave now.

38
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,290
No, I'm not leaving.

39
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:31,530
I'll be wherever you are.

40
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,480
Don't touch Miss Ji!

41
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,760
Who are you? Don't touch her!

42
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,010
- You shouldn't touch her.
- Let's go.

43
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,530
Don't touch her!

44
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,200
Don't touch her!

45
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:39,970
Your Lordship.

46
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,440
Should we follow them

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,290
to Haoxue Cosmetics?

48
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,410
Don't rush.

49
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,130
We won't go into a battle
without being fully prepared.

50
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:52,880
Go and buy some food and drink,

51
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,850
and let's send them over.

52
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,130
Yes.

53
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:57,640
Once a person eats her fill,

54
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,040
she'll get sleepy.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,640
When she's sleepy,

56
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:06,600
she'll want to go home.

57
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,250
I haven't been here for some days,

58
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,970
and everything has been fixed up.

59
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:19,480
It must be His Lordship...

60
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:20,640
My Lady.

61
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,530
Is this your Haoxue Cosmetics Shop?

62
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,160
My Lady.

63
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,570
You're amazing.

64
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:27,160
I didn't expect you

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,850
to open such a big shop

66
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:29,290
after you left.

67
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:29,760
Sang Shen.

68
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:33,810
Let's

69
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,160
sleep here tonight.

70
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:35,920
But...

71
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,530
There are no beds or blankets here.

72
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,690
How are we gonna sleep here?

73
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,040
That's not what you're good at.

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,760
I can make a hammock with a rope

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,850
and tie it up, and then
we can sleep on it.

76
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,970
Yeah.

77
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,320
Take out the rope.

78
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:45,810
We can do that.

79
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,200
I wasn't allowed

80
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,010
to take anything

81
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:52,850
when I got off the ship.

82
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:54,250
I have

83
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,570
nothing on me now.

84
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,850
That's not helpful.

85
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,200
What's the big deal?

86
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,160
It's such a big place here.

87
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,160
We can sleep anywhere.

88
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:00,760
Look at me.

89
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,810
You...

90
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,970
How comfortable.

91
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,250
My Lady.

92
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,810
You are the Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate.

93
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:08,690
How can you sleep on the floor

94
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,370
like her?

95
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,530
What second-rank lady?

96
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:12,690
Just ignore it.

97
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:13,570
Don't tell anyone about it.

98
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:14,920
What? I don't understand.

99
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,050
What does second-rank lady mean?

100
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,250
All right.

101
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:18,370
Tonight,

102
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,930
we'll just make do

103
00:04:20,050 --> 00:04:21,280
and sleep here.

104
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,810
Why are you here?

105
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,010
His Lordship and I

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,570
are here to bring you some food.

107
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:50,760
Well...

108
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,170
It doesn't look delicious.

109
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,370
It looks delicious.

110
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,760
What do you mean, Mr. Ning?

111
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:58,810
Dear, don't take it wrong.

112
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,610
I was afraid you'd get hungry,

113
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,010
so I brought you something to eat.

114
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,200
First of all, I'm not your "dear".

115
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,370
Secondly,

116
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,370
I'm not hungry.

117
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,200
My Lady.

118
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,840
We left in a hurry today

119
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,170
and didn't eat anything.

120
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,810
Why don't we...

121
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:21,400
Why don't we

122
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,050
eat something?

123
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,050
There are so many kinds of them.

124
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:31,760
Say something...

125
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,200
Yes, My Lady.

126
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,960
The food is innocent,

127
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,730
and it looks delicious.

128
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,520
All right.

129
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,170
Mr. Ning, is there something else?

130
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,370
When I said I wanted
to repair Ship Guihai,

131
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:00,690
I didn't mean to
make things difficult for you.

132
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:01,960
After Shen Liancheng robbed the ship,

133
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,370
it does need repairs.

134
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:04,200
I was hoping

135
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,490
you could move to
the Magistrate's Residence.

136
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:07,690
If you don't want to see me

137
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:08,170
or don't want to talk to me,

138
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:08,400
it's okay.

139
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,050
Just think of it

140
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:09,810
as a place

141
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,520
to eat

142
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,080
and to sleep.

143
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,050
Is that all right?

144
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:17,610
I think it's good

145
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,730
to eat here and sleep here.

146
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,250
Right?

147
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:22,930
Yes.

148
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,610
So don't bother,

149
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,320
Mr. Ning.

150
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:29,170
Please go back.

151
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,760
Good night.

152
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,080
Eat up.

153
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,730
It's so good.

154
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,280
My Lady, you should have some.

155
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:54,280
It's delicious.

156
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,200
This one should be good.

157
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,170
It's good.

158
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:58,170
It's delicious.

159
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,880
My Lady.

160
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,130
My Lady.

161
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,560
Where are we going now?

162
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,560
I...

163
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,880
I'm going to Shuiyan House

164
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:09,330
to see Miss Shui.

165
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:19,520
Why are there so many people

166
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,610
on the street today?

167
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,680
Don't you remember?

168
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,250
The Shangsi Festival is coming up.

169
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,210
The Shangsi Festival?

170
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,800
It's the birth anniversary
of the Yellow Emperor.

171
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:26,610
During the Shangsi festival,

172
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,610
there is a grand lantern festival

173
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,490
in Haifang

174
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:30,560
when men

175
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,130
can give lanterns to the woman

176
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:33,040
of their choice

177
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,210
to express their love.

178
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,160
Legend has it that

179
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,010
couples

180
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:37,160
who light lanterns together

181
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,040
will receive the greatest blessings

182
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
from heaven.

183
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,330
The Lantern Festival.

184
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,280
My Lady.

185
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:50,610
Do you want to see the lanterns

186
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:51,520
with His Lordship?

187
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,130
I don't.

188
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:56,400
That's right.

189
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,400
Bravo.

190
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,680
Bravo.

191
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,370
Look.

192
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,330
They dance so well.

193
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,640
It's so beautiful.

194
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,010
- It's beautiful.
- It's beautiful

195
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:16,970
Bravo!

196
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,490
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

197
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,490
Mrs. Ning.

198
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,160
I want to apologize to you

199
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:00,800
for what happened.

200
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,490
Please get up.

201
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:14,920
You mustn't say that.

202
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:16,920
You told the truth

203
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,090
and cleared my name.

204
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,730
I should thank you.

205
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
It was my fault for being weak,

206
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:23,850
and I made you

207
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,970
suffer a lot in prison.

208
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,370
No.

209
00:11:26,610 --> 00:11:28,850
I didn't suffer much in there.

210
00:11:30,850 --> 00:11:31,970
I'm here today

211
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,800
to tell you

212
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,640
two things.

213
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,090
Please go ahead, Mrs. Ning.

214
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:39,490
Have a seat.

215
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,760
The first thing

216
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,490
might sound unbelievable to you,

217
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,010
but I swear

218
00:11:56,010 --> 00:11:56,970
every word I say is true

219
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:57,920
and there are no lies.

220
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,970
Although they call me Nie Sangyu,

221
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,400
I'm not her.

222
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,800
A few months ago, I fell off a cliff

223
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,130
and I lost my memory.

224
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,010
When I woke up,

225
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,850
everyone called me Nie Sangyu,

226
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,970
and I thought I was her.

227
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:20,730
It wasn't until recently that I found out

228
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:23,800
I'm not her.

229
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:25,520
I'm...

230
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm the daughter of Guihai Warrior

231
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,090
Ji Ming.

232
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:29,970
My name is Ji Man.

233
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,330
You are

234
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:33,680
Guihai Warrior's daughter?

235
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,680
I know

236
00:12:39,850 --> 00:12:41,090
what I said

237
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,210
might be hard for others to believe.

238
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,920
After all, I...

239
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,760
That explains it.

240
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:47,520
I've been wondering

241
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,330
how someone as honorable

242
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,370
and loyal as you

243
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,680
could be the infamous
She-devil of the Capital.

244
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:57,800
Nevertheless,

245
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:58,850
I did accept

246
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,880
the title of Second-rank Lady
with Imperial Mandate

247
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,370
in the name of Nie Sangyu.

248
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,730
So,

249
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:05,520
we can't

250
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,010
let others know about it yet.

251
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:08,330
You still have to

252
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,680
call me Mrs. Ning.

253
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,160
Don't worry.

254
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,370
It's no problem.

255
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,250
There's one more thing.

256
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,800
I'd like to ask you

257
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,210
to be the manager of Haoxue Cosmetics.

258
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:22,880
I...

259
00:13:23,730 --> 00:13:25,130
I'm not trying to deceive you.

260
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,970
I genuinely

261
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,250
want you

262
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,160
to join me

263
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,450
in running Haoxue Cosmetics.

264
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,280
You'll manage the shop,

265
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,610
and I'll develop new products.

266
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,880
What do you think?

267
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,970
The fact is we're not

268
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,250
the same kind of people.

269
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,400
Haifang

270
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
is a small place.

271
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,210
When I first arrived here,

272
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:57,400
I also wanted

273
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,160
to have a simple

274
00:13:59,850 --> 00:14:01,160
and happy life,

275
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,330
and to live like a normal person,

276
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,730
but I didn't expect that in the end,

277
00:14:07,210 --> 00:14:09,250
I would still have to rely on men.

278
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,880
It's true

279
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:13,680
that I love money.

280
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:16,370
It's because I feel insecure.

281
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:23,760
I want to leave this place

282
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,970
and find

283
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:32,090
a quiet house

284
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,330
where I can

285
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,280
sing songs only for

286
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,210
the people I like

287
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,280
without charging them.

288
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,160
Miss Shui.

289
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:55,450
We're all born different,

290
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,130
but we all have

291
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,730
the right to choose our own path in life.

292
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,490
In my opinion,

293
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,850
you're smart,

294
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:07,330
and you have a unique temperament.

295
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,610
You also have a vision.

296
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,210
I don't think you're content

297
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,130
to just follow

298
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:12,130
one path in life,

299
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:12,970
am I right?

300
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:28,160
Life is short,

301
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:30,330
and I hope

302
00:15:30,970 --> 00:15:32,400
that we can both try

303
00:15:32,520 --> 00:15:34,400
to do what we love.

304
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:36,610
I want to join you

305
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,280
in realizing our dreams together.

306
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,970
Okay?

307
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:03,560
All right.

308
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:04,490
Look at this.

309
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:06,130
This is fresh.

310
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:06,880
Okay.

311
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:07,560
Take a look!

312
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,280
How about this one?

313
00:16:15,730 --> 00:16:17,040
Watch it. Be careful.

314
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,800
Okay.

315
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:19,730
How is Ship Guihai being repaired?

316
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,880
As you instructed,

317
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,490
it should be finished

318
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:24,880
in a few days.

319
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,160
Since she

320
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
doesn't want to live
in the Magistrate's Residence,

321
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,010
then just fix the ship

322
00:16:32,610 --> 00:16:33,450
and give it back to her.

323
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:34,520
Yes.

324
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,490
How is the Dragon Gang?

325
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:40,450
After Shen Liancheng's death,

326
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,330
they started killing each other

327
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,400
and electing a new leader.

328
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,640
According to my investigation,

329
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,680
Yuan Lang is also involved in it

330
00:16:47,010 --> 00:16:48,090
and has won the hearts

331
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,040
of many people.

332
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,640
The good thing is

333
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:52,880
he has driven out

334
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,730
those who used to do evil in Haifang.

335
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,970
Do you think Yuan Lang

336
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,280
could be Lang?

337
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:02,920
Why do you think so?

338
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:04,930
Yuan Lang

339
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,760
arrived in Haifang

340
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,040
almost at the same time as us,

341
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:09,410
and he infiltrated

342
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:11,170
the Dragon Gang in such a short time.

343
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,120
Is it possible

344
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,320
that he already has some connection

345
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:18,760
with the Dragon Gang before?

346
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:25,280
Shen Liancheng was a member
of the Tea Gang.

347
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,010
Within the Dragon Gang,

348
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:29,970
there might still be

349
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,040
remnants of the Tea Gang.

350
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,690
But these are just my speculations.

351
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,840
We should find a chance

352
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,760
to see if Yuan Lang

353
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,840
is Lang.

354
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,010
Greetings, Chief.

355
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,410
Mr. Wang, your fish

356
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
are colorful,

357
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,560
but sadly, they seem to have
lost their strength to swim

358
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,320
after being kept in the tank
for too long.

359
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,650
I'm sorry.

360
00:18:57,650 --> 00:18:58,520
Do you know

361
00:18:58,690 --> 00:18:59,970
why I'm here?

362
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,760
I won't let you worry.

363
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:04,930
We've lost half of our influence

364
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:05,930
in Haifang,

365
00:19:06,930 --> 00:19:08,120
as for the remaining half,

366
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,210
you must guard it with your life.

367
00:19:11,490 --> 00:19:12,650
Yes.

368
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,420
(Shuiyan House)

369
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:19,560
Welcome, sir.

370
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,320
Please come inside.

371
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,930
It's my treat today.

372
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,760
Okay.

373
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,120
Welcome, sir. Please come inside.

374
00:19:25,010 --> 00:19:25,450
Hurry.

375
00:19:26,170 --> 00:19:26,800
Welcome.

376
00:19:27,010 --> 00:19:27,760
Please come inside.

377
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:28,490
Okay.

378
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,490
Mr. Wang.

379
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,560
Mr. Yuan.

380
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,320
Mr. Wang, you invited me over in person.

381
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:46,360
I wonder what this is about.

382
00:19:46,490 --> 00:19:47,690
Please.

383
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,650
Take a seat.

384
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,280
Mr. Yuan.

385
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,600
At this point,

386
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:57,320
there's no need

387
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,890
to beat around the bush.

388
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,560
I can see that

389
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,840
you're

390
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,690
a practical person.

391
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:03,970
Let's talk

392
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:05,800
openly and honestly.

393
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:06,840
What do you say?

394
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:07,730
Mr. Wang.

395
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:08,970
Let's cut to the chase.

396
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,970
Well, the Sea Trade Guild

397
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,410
never got along well

398
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,040
with Shen Liancheng.

399
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:17,320
I'm sure

400
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,600
you're aware of this as well.

401
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:19,320
Well?

402
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:21,210
Mr. Wang, did you invite me over

403
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:22,730
just to talk about this?

404
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,210
Looks like I can't

405
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,760
hide anything from you.

406
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,360
Shen Liancheng

407
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,890
was reckless and impulsive by nature,

408
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,010
and he was vulgar.

409
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,250
He was a real menace to Haifang.

410
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,800
What you did

411
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,560
is truly satisfying.

412
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:41,490
Mr. Wang.

413
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,210
You don't have to say that.

414
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,690
As the new chief of the Dragon Gang,

415
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,410
I have some ideas of my own.

416
00:20:48,970 --> 00:20:51,010
I want to revive the Dragon Gang

417
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,250
and break free from
the oppression of Ning Yuxuan.

418
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:55,730
It seems that

419
00:20:55,730 --> 00:20:57,800
we're on the same page.

420
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,560
Mr. Yuan.

421
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,080
I'd like to help you regain control

422
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,560
of the wharf in Haifang.

423
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,120
What do you think?

424
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,170
Okay.

425
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:08,250
The Dragon Gang and the Sea Trade Guild

426
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,490
are the two biggest forces

427
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,650
in Haifang.

428
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:12,930
We should have joined forces long ago

429
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:13,800
to deal with those

430
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,250
who want to meddle in Haifang's business.

431
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:18,120
If we join together, we'll both benefit.

432
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,360
I'm willing

433
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,250
to work with you.

434
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:23,450
Good.

435
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
Let's work together.

436
00:21:32,410 --> 00:21:34,210
You must have had something good
happen to you today

437
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,730
to treat us

438
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,010
to so many delicious food.

439
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,760
If I want you to work for me,

440
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:44,170
I'd better bribe you first.

441
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:47,890
Right now,

442
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,890
Haoxue Cosmetics is
going through a low period,

443
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,280
but I believe

444
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,970
this is also its chance
to rise from the ashes.

445
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,490
So,

446
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:58,170
today,

447
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,490
I brought you your share certificates.

448
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,690
From now on,

449
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,560
Miss Shui will be

450
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:03,800
the manager of Haoxue Cosmetics,

451
00:22:03,970 --> 00:22:05,120
and Miss Xue

452
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,690
will be the accountant.

453
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:08,760
Okay.

454
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,890
Rest assured.

455
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:11,320
I'll do

456
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:12,170
my job well.

457
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:13,410
It seems that

458
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,210
it won't take long

459
00:22:15,450 --> 00:22:16,730
for me to leave Shuiyan House.

460
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:23,890
However,

461
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:25,360
I think

462
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,760
we shouldn't be too optimistic.

463
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:30,760
After all,

464
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:32,360
I was criticized by Lianxiang
not long ago,

465
00:22:33,010 --> 00:22:34,560
and Haoxue Cosmetics was just vandalized.

466
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:37,600
I don't know what kind of

467
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,970
unexpected situation might happen

468
00:22:38,970 --> 00:22:40,210
when we open for business.

469
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:45,120
People are not blind.

470
00:22:45,650 --> 00:22:47,040
They can see clearly

471
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,280
what kind of person you are.

472
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,650
With me as the manager,

473
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,650
are you still afraid
there will be no customers?

474
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:02,450
Yeah.

475
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,280
I'm not afraid.

476
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:05,520
Come on.

477
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:06,210
Come on.

478
00:23:06,410 --> 00:23:06,930
Come on.

479
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:08,360
Let's work together

480
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,520
and we can definitely revive

481
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,970
the glory of Haoxue Cosmetics.

482
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,080
No, not just revive,

483
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,560
we'll make it even bigger.

484
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,450
Come on.

485
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:17,730
Come on.

486
00:23:17,790 --> 00:23:18,190
Come on.

487
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,690
- No problem.
- No problem.

488
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,930
It's such a small business.

489
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,970
I don't know

490
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,410
why Miss Ji cares about it so much.

491
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:27,990
Shh!

492
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:30,170
How dare you look down on her business?

493
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:30,930
Haoxue Cosmetics

494
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:31,970
is the fruit of her labor.

495
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:34,010
Trivial matters like this

496
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,520
should be left to the servants

497
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,100
to handle.

498
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,630
Why does she have to do it herself?

499
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,400
Well, you may not know

500
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:41,320
that she used to

501
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,010
manage thousands of shops,

502
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,490
and each of them made a fortune.

503
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,410
So what?

504
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,690
Even thousands of shops
are not as important as

505
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:53,170
Haoxue Cosmetics.

506
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,210
What do you know?

507
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,250
You've been nowhere and seen nothing.

508
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,520
- What a poor girl.
- Sang Shen, Muxu.

509
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:56,930
I...

510
00:23:57,250 --> 00:23:58,120
How do you know I don't know?

511
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,010
I know. I just know.

512
00:23:59,010 --> 00:23:59,930
You're just a little girl.

513
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:02,690
Mr. Yuan, what a coincidence!

514
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:04,120
What are you two doing here?

515
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,450
Our lady is inside.

516
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:09,930
When our lady comes back,

517
00:24:09,930 --> 00:24:11,600
you should definitely meet her.

518
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:13,650
I'm sure she will like someone

519
00:24:13,650 --> 00:24:15,690
as magnanimous as you.

520
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:16,760
Well?

521
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
Are you trying to set them up?

522
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,930
It's not impossible.

523
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:26,730
Mr. Yuan.

524
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:27,650
What a coincidence.

525
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:28,560
Let me introduce her to you.

526
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,320
She's the new maid

527
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,280
our lady just hired.

528
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,250
Her name is Sang Shen.

529
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,170
Miss Sang,

530
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:37,930
are you not waiting for

531
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:39,040
Guihai Warrior's daughter?

532
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:40,970
It's a long story.

533
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,800
I'll tell you about it

534
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:42,800
next time.

535
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:43,450
But

536
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:44,840
my loyalty to our lady

537
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:45,650
is as unwavering as the sun and the moon.

538
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,410
Ship Guihai

539
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,760
will always be my home.

540
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,890
I still have something to do.

541
00:24:53,170 --> 00:24:53,760
I should leave.

542
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:55,170
Okay, Mr. Yuan.

543
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,850
How could you say that to him?

544
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,550
What did I say?

545
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,030
I didn't say our lady is Ji Man.

546
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,040
She is

547
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,010
the daughter of Guihai Warrior,

548
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,690
but somehow

549
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:05,890
she became the She-devil of the Capital.

550
00:25:05,890 --> 00:25:07,250
- That's unfair.
- Shh!

551
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,280
Don't say it out.

552
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,010
Got it.

553
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,520
You little girl.

554
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:13,890
I hate you.

555
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:19,800
Marquis Moyu's wife

556
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,410
used to be called

557
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,170
Nie Sangyu.

558
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:26,010
Nie Sangyu.

559
00:25:26,010 --> 00:25:27,210
Suddenly, she

560
00:25:27,210 --> 00:25:28,170
became

561
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:29,890
the daughter of Guihai Warrior.

562
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:30,930
The daughter of Guihai Warrior.

563
00:25:31,650 --> 00:25:32,760
What about the other one?

564
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,970
Nie Sangyu,

565
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,730
the She-devil of the Capital,

566
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:36,320
where is she?

567
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,280
Yes, where is she?

568
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,520
She's disappeared.

569
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,690
Disappeared?

570
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:41,280
Disappeared.

571
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,010
They are both my younger sisters.

572
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:45,780
Tell our men to keep an eye out for her.

573
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:48,320
Yeah.

574
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,520
We mustn't let others know

575
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,970
about her identity,

576
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,450
and we need to pretend

577
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,010
we don't know anything about it.

578
00:25:54,170 --> 00:25:55,360
We'll protect her in secret.

579
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,690
That's the best way

580
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,890
to keep her safe.

581
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:11,890
Boss.

582
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:17,360
If you like Miss Ji,

583
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:19,010
why don't you be with her?

584
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:20,760
My brother is right.

585
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:22,840
It's the time

586
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,410
to cut the knot.

587
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:28,560
I'll...

588
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:31,410
What's wrong with you again?

589
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,250
Do what you have to do.

590
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:54,410
(You're not Ning Yuxuan's wife.)

591
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,560
(You never loved each other.)

592
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,410
(So,)

593
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,410
(I still have a chance.)

594
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:07,600
Miss.

595
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,560
Mr. Qian has

596
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,170
sent you several letters recently.

597
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,460
Okay. You can leave.

598
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,330
Yes.

599
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:17,820
(To Qian Lianxue:)

600
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:26,180
(Send me 500 taels of silver,
or my life will be in danger.)

601
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:29,320
500 taels?

602
00:27:33,930 --> 00:27:35,410
My little brother
has gambling debts again.

603
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,890
When will he grow up?

604
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:43,600
He was like this in the capital.

605
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,320
Now I'm in Haifang,
but he still won't let me go.

606
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:46,800
He only thinks about me

607
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,280
when he needs money.

608
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:49,320
I...

609
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,120
500 taels.

610
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,410
Where am I gonna find 500 taels?

611
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,730
Xue.

612
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:08,520
Xue.

613
00:28:10,690 --> 00:28:11,760
Xue.

614
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:12,560
I heard

615
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,040
that the Lantern Festival tonight
is gonna be fun.

616
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,280
Let's go together.

617
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:16,410
Qingyun.

618
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:17,890
I would love to go with you,

619
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:18,690
but look,

620
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,890
I have to stay here to tend the shop.

621
00:28:21,010 --> 00:28:22,280
I can't leave.

622
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:24,080
Tend the shop?

623
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,120
But there aren't

624
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,080
many customers.

625
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,250
The Lantern Festival

626
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,410
is an annual event in Haifang.

627
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:34,120
Let's go together.

628
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:37,560
Wait,

629
00:28:38,170 --> 00:28:39,210
what about General Tao?

630
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:44,360
It's such a beautiful night.

631
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,080
Why don't you

632
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,320
ask General Tao out?

633
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,210
He won't go with me.

634
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,490
What's wrong?

635
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,320
Did you two fight?

636
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:54,280
He said

637
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,560
we should stay away from each other.

638
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,360
He doesn't want people
to misunderstand our relationship.

639
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,840
Do you still have feelings for him?

640
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:03,690
Of course I do.

641
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,080
That's it.

642
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,280
Since you still have feelings for him,

643
00:29:07,280 --> 00:29:08,600
you should go after him.

644
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:09,280
But...

645
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,360
But he said

646
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,650
he likes someone else.

647
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,410
Well,

648
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:20,600
are they

649
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,520
together now?

650
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,360
Then you still have a chance.

651
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,730
You should treat him as a friend

652
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,520
and invite him

653
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:35,970
to the Lantern Festival.

654
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
Will that work?

655
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,690
How would you know if you don't try?

656
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:42,080
You're right.

657
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:45,730
I wouldn't know

658
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,760
until I try.

659
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,010
Tanxiang.

660
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:53,800
Do you think His Lordship

661
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,840
will light a lantern for me?

662
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,450
Of course he will.

663
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,080
You two are

664
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
legally married.

665
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,170
Lighting a lantern for you

666
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,650
is what he should do.

667
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:06,760
Miss Wen.

668
00:30:07,170 --> 00:30:08,930
You're dressed beautifully today.

669
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,210
His Lordship will be enchanted by you

670
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:11,600
when he sees you.

671
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,210
It doesn't matter

672
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,840
whether he will be enchanted or not.

673
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:23,930
As long as I can keep you by my side,

674
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:27,280
I'll be satisfied.

675
00:30:28,890 --> 00:30:29,840
Tonight,

676
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,800
I'm going to make you

677
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,170
light a lantern for me

678
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,210
in front of everyone.

679
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,040
Tonight is the Lantern Festival.

680
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:40,450
There will be a lot of people.

681
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,210
Are all the arrangements in place?

682
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:45,490
Rest assured, Your Lordship.

683
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,210
Everything is in place,

684
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:47,360
and we have strengthened the security

685
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,650
to ensure safety tonight.

686
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:51,170
Okay.

687
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,650
Your Lordship.

688
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,410
I heard that today is
the Lantern Festival.

689
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,800
It's said

690
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,210
that during the festival,

691
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:04,360
men will express their love

692
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:05,890
to women.

693
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,210
I've just arrived in Haifang.

694
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:10,320
I also want to join in the fun.

695
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:13,930
Can I invite you

696
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:15,600
to release a lantern

697
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,120
with me?

698
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,210
Your...

699
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,560
Your Lordship?

700
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,210
I'm on official business tonight.

701
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,040
You can go by yourself.

702
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,210
Your Lordship.

703
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,600
Miss Wen.

704
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:39,930
Do you think His Lordship

705
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,120
is going to see Her Ladyship?

706
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:45,490
Well...

707
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:47,080
Are we still going?

708
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:48,250
Yes.

709
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,170
Of course we will go.

710
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:55,760
It's urgent.

711
00:32:01,410 --> 00:32:02,600
Miss, here's your wine.

712
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:03,320
Please enjoy.

713
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,250
Well, well, it's urgent.

714
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:29,740
All right, you can go.

715
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:37,940
Miss.

716
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,260
You haven't paid yet.

717
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:41,420
What?

718
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,060
You haven't paid.

719
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,660
Pay what?

720
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,260
You drank the wine and ate the food.

721
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:46,900
Why do you

722
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,900
want money from me too?

723
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,380
Mr. Qin, there you are.

724
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,020
Is Miss Shui not here tonight?

725
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:58,500
She's not here.

726
00:32:58,820 --> 00:32:59,860
She represents the Shuiyan House

727
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:01,060
in the lantern show every year.

728
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,340
Her role is important.

729
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,620
You can see her at the fair.

730
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,820
You also ask me for money.

731
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,500
The fair?

732
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,620
It's natural to pay for the drink.

733
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,580
Why should I give you money?

734
00:33:08,180 --> 00:33:10,020
Why should I give you money?

735
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,020
Tell me...

736
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,540
But...

737
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,020
Why?

738
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,180
Do you want to dine and dash?

739
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,260
There are people watching.

740
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,260
- Listen to this.
- Well...

741
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,500
Do I owe him money?

742
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,260
You be the judge.

743
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,740
Since I was a kid,

744
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,780
when did I ever renege on a debt?

745
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:27,220
- Why?
- How strange.

746
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:27,940
Put it on my tab.

747
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,980
- Okay.
- It's not my debt.

748
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:30,500
Let's go.

749
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,740
Make it clear.

750
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:41,500
Muxu.

751
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:43,420
Put these products

752
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,300
on top.

753
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:44,900
Okay.

754
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:47,540
The shop is finally opening tomorrow.

755
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,460
His Lordship must have

756
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,220
prepared a big meal

757
00:33:49,220 --> 00:33:50,500
and been waiting for you to come back.

758
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,980
Why should we go back?

759
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:55,100
My Lady.

760
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,540
Aren't we going to see

761
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,500
the Lantern Festival?

762
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,460
Tomorrow is the opening day.

763
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:04,540
Forget about the Lantern Festival.

764
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,460
Yeah.

765
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,020
Hurry up.

766
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,020
Let's finish the work first.

767
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:09,940
Excuse me.

768
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,540
Is this

769
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,700
Haoxue Cosmetics Shop owed by Nie Sangyu

770
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,420
who is a famous businesswoman in Haifang?

771
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,060
Mr. Yuan.

772
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,700
Mr. Yuan.

773
00:34:19,380 --> 00:34:20,300
It's not bad here.

774
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:22,460
Ms. Nie.

775
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:23,780
Today's the Lantern Festival.

776
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:24,540
Don't you want to take a walk outside?

777
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:25,140
No.

778
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,540
Tomorrow, Haoxue Cosmetics Shop

779
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,820
will be finally open again.

780
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,980
I have to get ready.

781
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,020
It hasn't opened yet.

782
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:31,460
Let's go.

783
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,420
I'll take you out for a stroll

784
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,220
while we both have time.

785
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,980
You should go by yourself.

786
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:36,860
I have a lot of things

787
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:37,580
to do here.

788
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:41,860
I have an idea.

789
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,380
Take your products

790
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,580
and let's warm up first.

791
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,420
What?

792
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:47,420
It's beautiful.

793
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:48,020
Yeah.

794
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,180
It's beautiful.

795
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,300
It's beautiful.

796
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:20,980
Bravo.

797
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:23,820
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

798
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,580
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

799
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,220
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

800
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,340
- Bravo.
- Bravo.

801
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,220
Qingyun.

802
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,860
From today on,

803
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:41,340
you can't call me Qingyun anymore.

804
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,780
Well, I'll call you

805
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:46,900
Miss Nie?

806
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,500
That sounds good.

807
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:52,980
General Tao.

808
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,340
Are you also here to see the lanterns?

809
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,620
I'm here

810
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,820
to check the security.

811
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,700
It's so lively here.

812
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:05,460
Would you like to walk around with me?

813
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,660
I've never

814
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,020
released a lantern before.

815
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,140
I have something to do later.

816
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,940
What could you possibly have to do
during the festival?

817
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,220
I'll...

818
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,780
I'll go back to the barrack later.

819
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,100
I'm on official duty.

820
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:22,420
I can't be away from my post
for too long.

821
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:22,940
I'm sorry.

822
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,060
General Tao.

823
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,060
Qingyun.

824
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,420
Miss Nie.

825
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:31,940
Goodbye.

826
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,620
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

827
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:48,500
Have some rest here.

828
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,580
I've told the owner

829
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,540
to put it on my tab.

830
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:53,060
You don't have to rush back.

831
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:54,260
I'll let your senior know.

832
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:55,020
Okay.

833
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,300
Here is the water.

834
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,100
Have a sip.

835
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:58,460
I'm gonna leave.

836
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,300
Mr. Qin.

837
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,140
Do you want to hear me sing?

838
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,010
Miss Qian.

839
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:09,900
You're drunk.

840
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,540
Let me go.

841
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,060
I'm serious.

842
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,980
Whether it's

843
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,260
singing,

844
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:21,740
dancing,

845
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,860
washing clothes, or cooking,

846
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,820
I can do them all.

847
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:29,820
What are you talking about?

848
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,540
Come on.

849
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,380
Sit down.

850
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,420
Sit down.

851
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:34,060
Have some rest first

852
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,500
and you'll be fine.

853
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,460
As long as you can give me money.

854
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,060
I need

855
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,500
a lot of money right now.

856
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,740
I really need

857
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:53,300
a lot of money.

858
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,580
What happened?

859
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,700
I have my reasons,

860
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,940
but I can't tell you.

861
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:02,020
You can tell me.

862
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,780
Maybe I can help.

863
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:07,540
I just need money.

864
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,140
I need a lot of...

865
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,860
A lot of money.

866
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,340
Why?

867
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:22,540
I need money.

868
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:23,580
Miss Qian.

869
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,900
(Nie)

870
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:17,260
Nie.

871
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:19,420
Turns out

872
00:40:20,780 --> 00:40:22,580
Mr. Tao has been interested in me
for some time.

873
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,780
How do you feel about

874
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,260
being followed like this?

875
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,420
Why are you following me?

876
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,260
I...

877
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,460
I'm asking you.

878
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:47,540
You have too many suitors,

879
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,580
and I'm afraid of causing a crowd.

880
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:52,380
It's my duty

881
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,380
to make sure

882
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,620
the Lantern Festival goes on well.

883
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,460
It's beautiful.

884
00:41:57,580 --> 00:41:58,700
Suitors?

885
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,060
Where are they?

886
00:42:04,340 --> 00:42:05,540
I think you're the only one.

887
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:15,700
That's where they release lanterns.

888
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:19,420
Don't you want to

889
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,460
release a lantern

890
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,580
for the person you like?

891
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,500
I'm devoted to serving His Lordship.

892
00:42:24,950 --> 00:42:25,470
I don't have

893
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,040
anyone I like.

894
00:42:35,270 --> 00:42:36,380
Then I'll release a lantern

895
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:37,140
for the person I like.

896
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,420
Farewell.

897
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,420
Miss Shui.

898
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,850
You should

899
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,080
change your clothes.
