=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 37=

3
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:03,500
Did Ning Yuxuan send you here?

4
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,140
His Lordship

5
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:06,570
guessed Lord Tan's conspiracy long ago.

6
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:08,010
He specially sent me

7
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:09,100
to protect your safety.

8
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,700
Why?

9
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,420
Mr. Ling.

10
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,220
His Lordship asked me
to convey a word to you.

11
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:19,700
The tribulations are endless.

12
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,010
It is never too late to mend.

13
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,660
Don't let the world go into chaos

14
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:26,170
because of your own selfish desires.

15
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,570
After all, I am just

16
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:49,260
an abandoned pawn of Lord Tan.

17
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,890
Ning Yuxuan.

18
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,220
I ended up losing to you.

19
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,890
Lord Tan.

20
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:15,450
Why are you so surprised?

21
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,260
Ning Yuxuan.

22
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,100
How long are you going to

23
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:19,980
frame me?

24
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,420
He didn't frame you.

25
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,100
Lord Tan.

26
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,260
I have been a witness

27
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,660
to every evil you have done.

28
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:29,100
Ling Jianxing.

29
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:31,100
You took refuge in me

30
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,010
because you coveted the position
of Prime Minister.

31
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:33,860
Now you have

32
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:34,730
lost to him yourself,

33
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,450
but you still want to drag me down.

34
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,450
Four years ago, during the grain disaster
in the northwest,

35
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:40,660
His Majesty sent me to
preside over the alliance.

36
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:42,820
But you secretly captured the merchants
in the northwest

37
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,330
and embezzled the relief funds.

38
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:45,330
Nonsense!

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,940
The three magistrates of Haifang
died suddenly one after another

40
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:49,890
because they

41
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,140
didn't listen to you.

42
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,980
So you secretly

43
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,170
sent Shen Liancheng and Wang Jinyao

44
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,980
to kill them.

45
00:03:53,980 --> 00:03:54,940
Nonsense.

46
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:56,330
You are all talking nonsense.

47
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,540
You are united to

48
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,260
drive me to a dead end.

49
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:10,050
Uncle.

50
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:12,730
Now we have a witness
and physical evidence.

51
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:14,490
Do you have anything else to say?

52
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:22,660
The country should be mine.

53
00:04:23,420 --> 00:04:24,900
Mine!

54
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,610
When my power was overwhelming,

55
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,220
you were still a baby!

56
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,340
Enough.

57
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:34,100
Uncle.

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,660
You have left no means untried
in your life,

59
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:39,900
but you ended up

60
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,250
like this.

61
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,780
I believe that the Court of Judicial Review

62
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,050
will handle it fairly.

63
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:48,930
Take him down.

64
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:49,460
Yes.

65
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,340
I'm the king of the world.

66
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,420
I am!

67
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,610
I'm the king of the world!

68
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,690
My uncle's matter

69
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,690
is over.

70
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:05,660
But I feel

71
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,290
very upset.

72
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,100
Alright.

73
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:13,690
I need some time alone.

74
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,610
Mr. Ning.

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,810
Take care of

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,370
the rest.

77
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,050
Yes.

78
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,420
Ning Yuxuan.

79
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,780
I have something to tell you.

80
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,980
We entered the academy

81
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,980
and served as officials

82
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:56,340
in the same year.

83
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,170
But I never beat you

84
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,250
even once.

85
00:06:04,810 --> 00:06:06,490
It is precisely because of this obsession

86
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:10,490
that I ended up like this.

87
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:14,130
You have contributed
to exposing Lord Tan.

88
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,610
The Court of Judicial Review will
take it into consideration.

89
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:22,130
I will reflect on myself deeply

90
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,020
every day and every moment

91
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,930
in prison.

92
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:32,730
In fact, when I was young,

93
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,170
my ideal was also to work for
the welfare of the common people.

94
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:36,980
It's a pity that one wrong step

95
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,730
led to a total loss.

96
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,130
Ning Yuxuan.

97
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,780
Our original ideal

98
00:06:46,930 --> 00:06:48,100
is up to you.

99
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,340
We shouldn't forget

100
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:05,220
our duty as officials.

101
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:41,540
Your Majesty.

102
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,220
Your Majesty.

103
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,490
Your Majesty.

104
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,580
I lied to you

105
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,610
and I deserve death.

106
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:07,660
Ji Man.

107
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,780
Is there anything you want
to say to me?

108
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,490
I would like to implore Your Majesty

109
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,130
not to blame Ning Yuxuan.

110
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,220
Ning Yuxuan didn't know

111
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,020
my identity

112
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,810
until I was awarded the second-rank
lady with imperial mandate.

113
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,490
And he didn't know until later about

114
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:24,860
the Tea Gang.

115
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,020
So these actually have nothing
to do with him...

116
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,690
It was Lord Tan who obstructed

117
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,130
the Tea Gang's refusal to surrender.

118
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,580
Mr. Ning has confessed to me.

119
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,100
So

120
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,300
you've known everything?

121
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,370
You don't blame Ning Yuxuan now,

122
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,610
do you?

123
00:08:46,890 --> 00:08:47,980
You may stand up.

124
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:50,340
Thank you, Your Majesty.

125
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,220
The matter of the Tea Gang

126
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,130
is over now,

127
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:03,300
but

128
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,370
your identity...

129
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,820
Mr. Ning is now promoting

130
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,770
the new policy in Haifang.

131
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,130
He held the Imperial Supplier Contest

132
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,300
and brought down Lord Tan.

133
00:09:20,530 --> 00:09:21,940
All his achievements

134
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:22,730
can allow him to

135
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,100
take over smoothly

136
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,530
the position of Prime Minister.

137
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,410
Yes.

138
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,250
During the days

139
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:49,820
I spent

140
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,820
with Ning Yuxuan,

141
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:53,220
I have seen his courage

142
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,460
and strategy.

143
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,530
I believe that

144
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:58,460
with his ability,

145
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,580
he can definitely assist Your Majesty

146
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,650
and become a judicious minister.

147
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,410
So...

148
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:26,980
So I want to...

149
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,860
I want to leave Ning Yuxuan.

150
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:34,130
Although the matter of the Tea Gang

151
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:35,700
has been made public,

152
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,610
I did replace

153
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,180
Nie Sangyu's identity

154
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:41,220
and everyone knows it.

155
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:44,370
I know that the capital
is different from Haifang,

156
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,130
where reputation

157
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:49,180
and people's background matter a lot.

158
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:50,370
So if

159
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,770
Ning Yuxuan has anything
to do with me,

160
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,980
it will not only be detrimental

161
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:55,770
to his status and career,

162
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:58,010
but will also increase
Your Majesty's troubles.

163
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,490
So

164
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:01,610
I would like to implore Your Majesty

165
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:03,730
to trust Ning Yuxuan.

166
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,890
Don't be suspicious of him

167
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,770
because of my identity.

168
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,820
Your Majesty, please.

169
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,980
Please allow me.

170
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:25,490
Mr. Ning

171
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:27,490
chose the right person.

172
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,730
You are

173
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,180
quite reasonable.

174
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:31,730
What to do next

175
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,820
is up to you.

176
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:41,580
Thank you,

177
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,820
Your Majesty.

178
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:30,650
(Ning Yuxuan.)

179
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,770
(You should take over as Prime Minister.)

180
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:36,460
(My departure)

181
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:39,370
(is the best choice for you.)

182
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:43,010
(Will you blame me?)

183
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,650
(Can you wait for me?)

184
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,700
(I still want to see you one last time.)

185
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,370
Siwei.

186
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,980
Siwei.

187
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:01,220
Siwei, are you there?

188
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,490
(Playing the flute to call for spring, the exiled
looked at each other and couldn't help crying.)

189
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,300
(Countless wild geese that parked by the Dongting
Lake at night eagerly flew north before dawn.)

190
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:28,740
(Nie Sangyu)

191
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,130
You mean His Majesty
is going to let Ji Man go?

192
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:38,180
Indeed.

193
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,340
Our people inquired secretly.

194
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,180
Now Lord Tan was dragged down

195
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,220
by Ning Yuxuan.

196
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,610
Once the Tea Gang is proven innocent,

197
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:43,490
maybe the fake lady

198
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,650
will be acquitted of a charge soon.

199
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,060
Acquitted of a charge?

200
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:55,130
I got it. You should go.

201
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,060
Yes.

202
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:10,780
(Nie Sangyu)

203
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,530
Who let you in?

204
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,340
I heard that

205
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,130
my sister was impersonated.

206
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,300
You were the one

207
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,410
who took her to jail after the contest,

208
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,220
weren't you?

209
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,130
Yes.

210
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:35,130
This is His Majesty's order.

211
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,060
No wonder.

212
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:41,980
Although she is very nice to me,

213
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,220
these days

214
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:45,770
I always feel that

215
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,340
she is not the same as before.

216
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,730
So my sister died long ago.

217
00:14:58,180 --> 00:14:58,730
You knew this

218
00:14:58,730 --> 00:15:00,010
long ago,

219
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:01,340
why didn't you tell me?

220
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:02,980
Just now I was still wondering

221
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,700
why you asked me to find her

222
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,860
and let her rewrite that poem

223
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,940
written by my sister.

224
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,130
Now I see.

225
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,820
You wanted to use her handwriting

226
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,860
to let her expose herself

227
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,180
in front of His Majesty, didn't you?

228
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:17,700
Shouldn't I do this?

229
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:29,010
She killed Sangyu.

230
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,700
This is the price she should pay.

231
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,890
She killed my sister?

232
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:42,530
No.

233
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,100
No way.

234
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:43,700
She would never do that.

235
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,940
Why are you still speaking for her?

236
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,530
These days,

237
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,280
she has deceived everyone

238
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,670
as your sister

239
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,460
and turned into a lady
with imperial mandate,

240
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,580
enjoying everything

241
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,250
that should have belonged
to your sister.

242
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,220
But even Sangyu's body

243
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:02,180
wasn't found.

244
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,940
Sangyu?

245
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,820
So did you

246
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,410
put on the lantern

247
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:17,730
with the word Nie on it

248
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,300
for Nie Sangyu?

249
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,300
I should have realized that.

250
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:29,800
I should have realized that

251
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,040
the one you like

252
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,510
is my sister.

253
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:37,560
I thought that

254
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:39,960
as long as I treat you wholeheartedly,

255
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:42,040
one day

256
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:43,710
I will be the only one

257
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,830
in your life.

258
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,920
But I didn't expect...

259
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,160
I didn't expect that

260
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,560
the person you like

261
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,280
is my sister.

262
00:16:55,870 --> 00:16:57,080
So did you

263
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,110
agree to

264
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,350
marry me back then

265
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:04,070
to fulfill

266
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:06,360
my sister's wish?

267
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:14,840
Yes.

268
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,360
Qingyun.

269
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,070
I thought I would change.

270
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:45,990
I thought that I would fall in love
with you after marriage.

271
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,400
But I was wrong.

272
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,470
I can't make it.

273
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:57,180
Tao Siwei.

274
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,840
Now

275
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,070
I feel disgusted

276
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,840
even when I see you.

277
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,360
Your love is but a one-man show.

278
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,120
My love for you is in vain.

279
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,600
So boring.

280
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,170
Although I was so deep in love,

281
00:18:31,710 --> 00:18:33,160
it won't be my everything.

282
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,640
(Sorry, Qingyun.)

283
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,420
(After all, I failed you.)

284
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:17,710
Ji

285
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,550
Man.

286
00:19:29,310 --> 00:19:31,400
You look exactly the same.

287
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,840
No wonder even I was fooled.

288
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,030
As I expected,

289
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,360
you knew it long ago.

290
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,680
Then come with me.

291
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,550
To where?

292
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:47,960
To meet His Majesty.

293
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,880
He's going to interrogate you himself.

294
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,920
Did he tell you personally?

295
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,470
Yes.

296
00:19:56,510 --> 00:19:57,550
Of course.

297
00:19:58,230 --> 00:19:59,160
I was only

298
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,750
ordered to do so.

299
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:06,120
General Tao.

300
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,310
It is a crime to deceive the emperor

301
00:20:10,310 --> 00:20:11,680
to falsely convey the imperial edict.

302
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,470
So what?

303
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,710
Since you deceived the emperor,

304
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,200
why can't I

305
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,960
falsely convey the imperial edict?

306
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,230
Mr. Ning.

307
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:12,790
Mr. Ning.

308
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,790
Where is Nie Sangyu?

309
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,200
General Tao came just now

310
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,470
and took away the suspect Nie Sangyu,

311
00:21:16,470 --> 00:21:18,120
saying that His Majesty
wanted to interrogate her.

312
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:18,990
His Majesty?

313
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:19,840
And

314
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
I just saw General Tao

315
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
taking Mrs. Ning to the north.

316
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
The north?

317
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,200
Yes.

318
00:21:27,070 --> 00:21:27,840
No!

319
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:03,220
(Outside Haifang City)

320
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:24,790
You knew it

321
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:25,470
at the Magistrate's Residence
that day, right?

322
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:28,160
So you deliberately tested me.

323
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,160
It's just that I thought you would

324
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,710
at least consider Ning Yuxuan's situation

325
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,880
for the sake of your friendship

326
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,550
for so many years.

327
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:43,360
If you were really Sangyu,

328
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,840
why would I have tested you?

329
00:22:46,550 --> 00:22:47,230
If Ning Yuxuan

330
00:22:47,230 --> 00:22:48,920
really regarded me as
a close friend,

331
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,070
why had he been

332
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:52,120
lying to me for so long?

333
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:54,310
It's just I never thought that

334
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,030
you could survive until now

335
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,070
after committing the crime
of deceiving the emperor.

336
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,270
Do you think that

337
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:01,750
with His Majesty's oral instructions,

338
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:03,960
you can get away with it

339
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,510
after returning to the capital?

340
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,510
Okay.

341
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,120
Let me tell you.

342
00:23:07,510 --> 00:23:09,070
You lied to me

343
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,920
and you lied to Sangyu.

344
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,070
Over the years,

345
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:14,680
Sangyu and I had learned
and grown up together.

346
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
Seeing that she and Ning Yuxuan
were in love,

347
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:18,960
I was happy for her.

348
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,790
Then one day you told me

349
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,970
she is dead.

350
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,360
She is my sister.

351
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:32,200
Do you know

352
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:33,400
how sad I was

353
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,440
when I found out about this?

354
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,920
On the day she fell off the cliff,

355
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:37,880
I went to rescue her.

356
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:38,920
Tao Siwei!

357
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,360
- Ning Yuxuan!
- Don't come close.

358
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:41,640
Don't come close.

359
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,470
Don't come close.

360
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,960
Tao Siwei, let her go.

361
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,470
Stop being obsessive.

362
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:48,550
Ning Yuxuan.

363
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:50,600
My life

364
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,510
is like a ridiculous mistake.

365
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:55,030
One wrong step led to a complete loss.

366
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:56,680
I dragged others down

367
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:58,640
and lost myself.

368
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,160
Your Lordship.

369
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:01,960
Your Lordship.

370
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:04,710
Nie Sangyu's death

371
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,940
- was just an accident.
- Shush.

372
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,470
Ning Yuxuan.

373
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,470
Get away.

374
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:11,750
No!

375
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:12,120

427
00:27:22,030 --> 00:27:22,840
All right.

428
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,960

429
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,750
what's the point

430
00:27:37,710 --> 00:27:38,710
No worries.

431
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:44,230

432
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:45,840
I am sure

433
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,360
she will come back.

434
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,710
But it's been days.

435
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,550
My cousin searched the whole mountain.

436
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,960
There is still no news of her.

437
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:02,920
Listen.

438
00:28:03,510 --> 00:28:04,840
Easy, Lianxue.

439
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:06,790
I...

440
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,710
What is the use of us?

441
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,960
We can only wait here

442
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:12,840
or pray for her.

443
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:16,070
We can't do anything.

444
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,920
Stop crying, Lianxue.

445
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,440
Listen to me.

446
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,640
In fact, sometimes

447
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,510
no news

448
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:26,470
is the best news.

449
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:27,160
You know?

450
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,200
Sometimes,

451
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:31,510
I would also

452
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,790
stay up all night

453
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,640
worrying about her safety.

454
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:39,200
But I have a hunch

455
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,640
that she will come back.

456
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:43,710
Trust me.

457
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,470
And think about it.

458
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,030
If she came back

459
00:28:47,030 --> 00:28:48,510
and saw that Haoxue Cosmetics

460
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:49,600
was different from before,

461
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:51,920
she would definitely
feel very sad, right?

462
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:56,440
Since there is

463
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,680
no news now,

464
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:58,550
we

465
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,400
should

466
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:00,470
manage

467
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:01,510
Haoxue Cosmetics well.

468
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,070
Okay?

469
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:04,750
When she comes back,

470
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:05,600
she will see that Haoxue Cosmetics

471
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,640
is still the champion shop
of the Imperial Supplier Contest,

472
00:29:06,710 --> 00:29:08,790
the same as before.

473
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,680
Stop crying.

474
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:15,510
I'm not crying.

In the days to come,

498
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,120

503

to leave for the capital immediately.
