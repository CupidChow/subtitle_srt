00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:59,060
(Imperial Supplier Contest)

4
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,080
Where is Her Ladyship's booth?

5
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,550
Over there.

6
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,710
Here.

7
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:18,800
Put it here.

8
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,640
Here.

9
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,760
This time, the Imperial Supplier Contest

10
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,800
is voted by the people

11
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,670
to choose the winner.

12
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,240
Don't worry.

13
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,590
Our Feiwan Face Cream

14
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,800
is so popular now.

15
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:42,590
Of course we have a great chance
of winning.

16
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,040
I just don't know

17
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,760
if Ruyue is going to play
any tricks today.

18
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,390
No matter what tricks she plays,

19
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,080
today, only the product has a say.

20
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,480
Mr. Ning's proposal to

21
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:05,110
let the common people
participate in the selection this time

22
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:06,830
pays attention to public opinion.

23
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,430
This time's Imperial Supplier Contest

24
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,590
is indeed more popular.

25
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,920
It is for the purpose
of benefiting the people

26
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:15,240
to let them use the products
of imperial suppliers.

27
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,430
Mrs. Ning's Haoxue Cosmetics

28
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,590
is a popular shop

29
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:24,640
second to none in Haifang.

30
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,520
Mr. Ning, don't

31
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,870
practice favouritism too much.

32
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:30,710
Favouritism?

33
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:33,920
But the result of
the Imperial Supplier Contest

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,320
depends on

35
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,040
the public opinions
of the people of Haifang.

36
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,080
Mr. Ning, you're right.

37
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,040
Everyone.

38
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,550
The preliminary contest
of the Imperial Supplier Contest

39
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,670
officially started.

40
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,760
We will select three shops

41
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,200
for the final selection.

42
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,360
Everyone.

43
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:01,430
Feiwan Face Cream,

44
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,240
the participating product
of Haoxue Cosmetics,

45
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,110
is available for free trial today.

46
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:05,240
Great.

47
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,670
Come on. Come on.

48
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,830
Come here.

49
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,550
Take a look.

50
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:12,710
Welcome to try.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:13,710
Take a try.

52
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:15,550
- Try it.
- Try it.

53
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,830
Let me try.

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,470
- Try it.
- Try it.

55
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:18,790
This one.

56
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:19,710
Good for facial care.

57
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,390
Take a try.

58
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,470
Take a look at

59
00:04:22,030 --> 00:04:23,390
Joy Cosmetics' products.

60
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,960
Come here.

61
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,520
How is it? Does it smell good?

62
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:28,230
Come on. Take a try.

63
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,350
We don't have to try it at all.

64
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,320
I've used several bottles of

65
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,560
Feiwan Face Cream.

66
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:33,790
Yes.

67
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,200
It's very effective.

68
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,440
- Right.
- Just buy their products.

69
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
- Really?
- One more for me.

70
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,640
Very effective.

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,080
Everyone.

72
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:42,200
Welcome to

73
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,470
try our Joy Face Cream.

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:45,000
This face cream

75
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,680
was developed

76
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:48,120
and tested

77
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,080
by our princess herself.

78
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,320
Here, take a look.

79
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:50,790
Have a try.

80
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,790
Try the Feiwan Face Cream.

81
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,080
Give her a try.

82
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:53,790
Come on.

83
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,390
Here.

84
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,120
Look.

85
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,520
The whitening effect is awesome.

86
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:58,520
So smooth.

87
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,520
Very good.

88
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,270
Not long after I arrived in Haifang,

89
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,960
I felt that the trade potential here

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,030
was great.

91
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,590
In my opinion,

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,830
instead of acquiring some new stores,

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:15,590
it is better

94
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:17,230
to support the old ones.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,030
This time, I chose Moon Face Cream,

96
00:05:20,230 --> 00:05:21,520
which I personally developed,

97
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,150
to participate in
the Imperial Supplier Contest.

98
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,960
It works to moisturise

99
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,960
and instantly restore radiance

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,470
to sun-burned skin.

101
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:31,440
Moon Face Cream?

102
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,680
Feiwan Face Cream is better.

103
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,270
Our Feiwan Face Cream is better.

104
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:35,150
Leave her alone.

105
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:35,680
Here.

106
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:36,560
Listen.

107
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,640
Feiwan Face Cream is better.

108
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,560
Help yourselves.

109
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
I have been allergic

110
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,150
to other products before,

111
00:05:41,390 --> 00:05:42,470
which is very uncomfortable.

112
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,390
Everyone.

113
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,230
Anyone who votes for us today

114
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,590
gets a free bottle of Moon Face Cream,

115
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:54,030
plus 50% off of it

116
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:57,200
for a year.

117
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,880
50% off?

118
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,590
Let's have a look.

119
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm not going to try it.

120
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,390
Don't go.

121
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,230
Miss, don't go.

122
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:01,270
Miss, don't go.

123
00:06:01,350 --> 00:06:02,150
Miss.

124
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,230
Miss.

125
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,350
Come back, Miss.

126
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:05,390
Don't go.

127
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,680
Don't go. Don't go.

128
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,520
Everyone.

129
00:06:09,830 --> 00:06:10,270
This...

130
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,760
Let's go.

131
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:22,350
Take a try.

132
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:23,230
Take a try.

133
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,520
Don't go. Have another look.

134
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,080
Our Feiwan Face Cream is better.

135
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:32,880
Let me try.

136
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:35,000
Moon Face Cream is really good.

137
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,270
Look, it's soon absorbed

138
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:37,150
and is highly moisturizing.

139
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:37,960
Yes.

140
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,640
Our Moon Face Cream

141
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,150
is something good.

142
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,390
It is comparable

143
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,590
to Feiwan Face Cream.

144
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,520
What kind of formula did she use

145
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,680
to make it comparable

146
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,710
to our Feiwan Face Cream?

147
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:48,030
What to choose?

148
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,080
Just choose the Moon Face Cream.

149
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,270
Joy Cosmetics has never had

150
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,000
this product before.

151
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,590
It seems that

152
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,320
she has prepared us a surprise today.

153
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
If you like it,

154
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,150
I will give you one for free.

155
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,120
But remember to vote for us.

156
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:03,230
I also want one.

157
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:03,760
I also want one.

158
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:04,390
Give me one.

159
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,030
I also want one.

160
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:05,830
One for me.

161
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:01,640
According to the testers' inspection,

162
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,150
Moon Face Cream
and Feiwan Face Cream

163
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:05,320
are almost the same

164
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,350
in terms of texture

165
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,710
and touch.

166
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,390
To choose a better quality one

167
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,760
from the two,

168
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,470
the only way

169
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,470
is to disclose the formulas

170
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,760
on the spot.

171
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
I don't know
if you are willing to do so.

172
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,960
The formula

173
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,590
is the result of careful research

174
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,990
by everyone.

175
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,040
It is inappropriate

176
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,560
to make it public like this.

177
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:39,990
Ms. Nie, don't you dare?

178
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,110
Of course I dare to do so.

179
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:50,920
But I suggest that

180
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,960
we each submit the formula

181
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,800
to the selection officer
for inspection.

182
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,350
I agree.

183
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:00,350
Since both of you

184
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,560
agree,

185
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:03,800
let's do it.

186
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,870
Sir, please.

187
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,510
Sir, please.

188
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,220
(Feiwan Face Cream's Formula,
Moon Face Cream's Formula)

189
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,020
(Powdered rhinoceros horn)

190
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:49,920
By comparing

191
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,870
the formulas of Moon Face Cream

192
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,040
and Feiwan Face Cream,

193
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
I found that the two
face creams are the same.

194
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,440
But

195
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:57,920
Moon Face Cream added

196
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,960
a rare medicinal material.

197
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,750
Now we can draw a conclusion.

198
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:22,990
Ms. Nie.

199
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,510
Would you like to

200
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,990
use my Moon Face Cream?

201
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,750
That being the case,

202
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,680
thank you, Princess Ruyue.

203
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:50,710
How is it?

204
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,320
There's powdered rhinoceros horn.

205
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:55,800
So

206
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:57,710
the face cream smells better.

207
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,440
But the production cost
will also be higher.

208
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,350
Feiwan Face Cream has been

209
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,750
selling well for a long time.

210
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:07,680
No matter in the capital or Haifang,

211
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,040
everyone knows it.

212
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,800
But Ruyue's Moon Face Cream

213
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:14,440
only appeared recently.

214
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:16,800
You must have

215
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,040
copied our formula.

216
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:21,320
You mean

217
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:23,560
I copied your Feiwan Face Cream?

218
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,400
Yes.

219
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,750
My Lady.

220
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:30,680
Everyone in Haifang knows that

221
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,470
those of Haoxue Cosmetics
are deeply attached to each other.

222
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,830
So it is understandable for you

223
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:37,230
to shield each other.

224
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,080
It's just that

225
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:41,990
Mr. Ning,

226
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,830
Ms. Nie is your wife.

227
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,400
You shouldn't

228
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,960
practice favouritism.

229
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:53,200
Princess Ruyue, you speak so seriously.

230
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:55,710
We all know that Mr. Ning and Mrs. Ning

231
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:57,040
are deep in love.

232
00:11:57,590 --> 00:11:59,040
But don't

233
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,920
practice favouritism.

234
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,590
Indeed, Princess Ruyue

235
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,230
cannot be accused of plagiarism

236
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,630
because of the early sales
of Feiwan Face Cream.

237
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:10,920
After all, the Imperial Supplier Contest

238
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,920
intends to select
the best quality products.

239
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,920
I think

240
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,990
it's best to let the final voting result

241
00:12:15,990 --> 00:12:16,830
be the final word.

242
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:23,040
Voting for the Imperial Supplier Contest
officially began.

243
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,680
Hurry up, let's vote.

244
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,750
Girls, vote for us.

245
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,040
Vote for us. Vote for us.

246
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:30,590
Vote for us.

247
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:31,400
Vote for us.

248
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:33,350
Come on.

249
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:34,800
Vote for us.

250
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,470
Vote for us.

251
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:39,160
Thank you. Thank you.

252
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,280
Thank you. Thank you.

253
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,350
Thank you. Thank you.

254
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:43,040
Vote for us.

255
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:43,680
This way.

256
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,320
Vote for her.

257
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,470
Yes.

258
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,990
Thank you everyone for voting for us.

259
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,510
All voting has closed.

260
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,040
Please be patient.

261
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,080
The result

262
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,830
will be announced shortly.

263
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:52,470
Hold on.

264
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,160
Mr. Ling.

265
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,870
I

266
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,630
haven't voted yet.

267
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:11,110
I'll vote for

268
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,560
Feiwan Face Cream.

269
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,440
Mr. Ning.

270
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,110
The outcome is clear.

271
00:14:44,350 --> 00:14:45,200
However,

272
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,630
what you have done

273
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,630
is enough to prove that

274
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,990
you are deep in love,

275
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,200
which makes others envious.

276
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,630
Mr. Ling.

277
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,680
My vote

278
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,280
is for justice.

279
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,320
Bad practice

280
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:02,110
may work for a while,

281
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:04,560
but it will never win to the end.

282
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,350
Mr. Ning is right.

283
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,870
Let's wait and see.

284
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:11,680
Okay.

285
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:19,620
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

286
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,320
Ruyue even plagiarized

287
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,830
in order to win.

288
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:24,710
Mr. Ning

289
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,160
is the head
of the Imperial Supplier Contest,

290
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,320
isn't there anything he can do?

291
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,280
Exactly.

292
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,230
Ruyue revealed your relationship

293
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,470
with Mr. Ning in front of everyone.

294
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,630
It is inconvenient for Mr. Ning

295
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,750
to interfere too much.

296
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,350
Right.

297
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:40,710
It is precisely because
of his current status

298
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:41,990
that I can't let him

299
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,080
stand in for me at this moment.

300
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,630
What to do?

301
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:52,280
Wen Wan

302
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,230
took away the formula
of Feiwan Face Cream

303
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:55,110
without anyone noticing.

304
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:57,990
Were it not for this Contest,

305
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,200
we would have been kept
in the dark until now.

306
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,200
Yes.

307
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:03,560
It seems that we will have to
work harder

308
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:04,680
in the next games.

309
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:05,990
We have already lost

310
00:16:05,990 --> 00:16:06,800
the first round.

311
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,040
Let's shift our focus

312
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,230
to the next two rounds.

313
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:11,710
It is no problem for us

314
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,960
to complete the production on time
for the second round.

315
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,400
But about the new recipe

316
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,870
for the third round...

317
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,040
I have some ideas,

318
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,350
but they are not mature yet.

319
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,230
Listen, Muxu.

320
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:26,630
I'll write you a list later.

321
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,040
Buy me

322
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,200
some raw materials.

323
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,040
Okay.

324
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:30,990
Never mind.

325
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,510
We should try to

326
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,870
make a good showing

327
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:34,590
in the next few rounds.

328
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,750
Qingqing.

329
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,510
Qingqing.

330
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:48,750
Qingqing.

331
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:49,350
Let me go.

332
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,400
You are so annoying.

333
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,830
I said I don't want to
see you anymore.

334
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:52,990
Just go back with me.

335
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,230
Instead of suffering outside

336
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:55,200
every single day,

337
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
you might as well go back with me

338
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,920
to enjoy your life.

339
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:57,990
Don't you know

340
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,110
what you are up to?

341
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:00,440
I won't go back with you.

342
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,200
Qingqing, stop making a scene.

343
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:02,510
Let me go.

344
00:17:02,510 --> 00:17:03,160
Go back with me.

345
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
- Let go.
- Qingqing.

346
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:05,030
What are you doing?

347
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,310
How dare you?

348
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:08,680
Let go.

349
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:09,510
How dare you touch her?

350
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:10,120
It hurts.

351
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,790
Why is it you again?

352
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,880
Every time I catch up with Qingqing,

353
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,030
you always make a mess.

354
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:14,960
Qingqing.

355
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,640
Tell him about our relationship.

356
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:17,310
Qingqing.

357
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,550
Today I will

358
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,680
officially make it clear

359
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
our relationship.

360
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:24,510
This is

361
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:27,270
my former fiancé.

362
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,790
Did you hear?

363
00:17:28,790 --> 00:17:29,960
Fiancé.

364
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:32,360
It hurts.

365
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:32,880
But

366
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,510
he doesn't like me.

367
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:36,710
He just wants

368
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,840
my family's ancestral recipe.

369
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
So he has been pestering me

370
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,070
these days.

371
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,270
Mr. Qian.

372
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,990
Since she doesn't want to
see you again,

373
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,880
please don't pester her anymore.

374
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:49,510
Who are you?

375
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,680
It's none of your business.

376
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,400
And you, Shui Yiqing.

377
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,840
Look at you now.

378
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,310
You are just a singer

379
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:57,360
in Haifang.

380
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,550
And this guard.

381
00:17:59,990 --> 00:18:01,600
Is he your new lover?

382
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:04,230
Let go.

383
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,120
Say that again.

384
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,550
Let go.

385
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:06,200
Qingqing.

386
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:07,990
Gui Bai, let him go.

387
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,440
Let him go, Gui Bai.

388
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,880
- Qingqing.
- Let him go.

389
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,200
Shui Yiqing, good for you.

390
00:18:16,510 --> 00:18:18,230
You did this to me

391
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,880
for a servant?

392
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:21,640
What's wrong with a servant?

393
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,360
What's wrong with a singer?

394
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,270
What's wrong with a guard?

395
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,710
We are better than you villain.

396
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:27,710
Shui Yiqing!

397
00:18:27,990 --> 00:18:29,470
You slut!

398
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:30,880
- You!
- Gui Bai!

399
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,470
Let's wait and see!

400
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:37,200
You! You two!

401
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:43,840
Thank you

402
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,960
for your help today.

403
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,750
Since you are fine,

404
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:51,710
I'll be leaving.

405
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,120
I...

406
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,880
What a nerd.

407
00:19:16,340 --> 00:19:18,620
(Osmanthus, Rose, White Poria, Royal Jelly,
Ligusticum sinense, Fresh Aloe Vera)

408
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:47,880
Miss Shui.

409
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:50,880
What's up?

410
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:54,990
Nothing.

411
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,790
I just ran into something.

412
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:57,990
It's fixed now.

413
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,680
If anything happens to you,

414
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,680
just let me know.

415
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,750
Don't take it all on yourself.

416
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,160
I see.

417
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,550
I have

418
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,960
something for you.

419
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,400
Look.

420
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:12,070
What's this?

421
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:13,360
This is our family's secret prescription

422
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,880
for traumatic medicine.

423
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,600
Secret

424
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:18,840
prescription?

425
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,640
Sorry.

426
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:24,400
I didn't tell you before that

427
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,440
our family

428
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,790
has a pharmacy in the capital.

429
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,400
It was left to me by my father

430
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,310
before he died.

431
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:33,310
The effect of Scar Recovering Cream

432
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,360
is very similar to that of it.

433
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:35,440
So I thought

434
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,710
this might help

435
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,550
with your new formula.

436
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,400
No way.

437
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,120
I can't accept

438
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:43,960
such an important thing.

439
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:44,960
Take it.

440
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,160
I can't.

441
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,120
Just listen to me.

442
00:20:49,070 --> 00:20:50,550
Facing the formidable enemy,

443
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:51,920
Haoxue Cosmetics

444
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:52,550
can't easily

445
00:20:52,550 --> 00:20:53,710
pass it.

446
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,960
So I think

447
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,360
as long as it helps you,

448
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,310
even

449
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,400
a little bit

450
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:00,030
is worth it.

451
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,840
Thank you, Miss Shui.

452
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:09,960
Thank you for trusting me.

453
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:10,990
Don't worry.

454
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,750
I'll hurry up to develop new products.

455
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,200
With your consideration,

456
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,510
Haoxue Cosmetics will definitely
win to the end.

457
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,880
I trust you.

458
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:44,160
Are there any spies out there?

459
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:46,360
Gui Bai has already checked.

460
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:48,680
There is no one outside tonight.

461
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:56,990
Then no need for this.

462
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:14,230
Today you lost your first contest
to Joy Cosmetics.

463
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:15,470
Are you

464
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:20,680
okay?

465
00:22:22,790 --> 00:22:23,550
I'm fine.

466
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,200
Anyway, I came second.

467
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,750
I will find out the plagiarism

468
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,440
of Feiwan Face Cream.

469
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,750
Thank you.

470
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,840
The final champion of
the Imperial Supplier Contest

471
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:48,160
won't be plagiarized.

472
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:52,510
Do you have a way?

473
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:53,840
I have thought of

474
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,640
a formula for the new product
in the finals.

475
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,200
Tomorrow morning,

476
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,400
I will go to the mountains
to collect herbs.

477
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,400
I will go with you.

478
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:08,960
I didn't mean anything else.

479
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,640
It's just that

480
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,880
there will be spies on that occasion.

481
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:22,200
Okay.

482
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,310
Greetings to Princess Ruyue.

483
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,310
Stand up.

484
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,880
Take the Moon Face Cream.

485
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,790
It should relieve

486
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,550
the redness on your face.

487
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,030
Thank you for your kindness.

488
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,710
I'm sorry for that.

489
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,960
Lan'er happened to come across you

490
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,600
having an argument with Miss Shui

491
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:55,680
on the street today.

492
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:58,070
You seem to be very close

493
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:00,310
to Miss Shui.

494
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,990
But why are the women

495
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,200
in Haoxue Cosmetics in Haifang

496
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:10,600
all that vicious?

497
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,600
Mr. Qian.

498
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,710
Such a woman

499
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,310
is not worth mentioning.

500
00:24:18,070 --> 00:24:19,440
Princess, you are right.

501
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,200
But I wonder

502
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:24,270
why did you invite me here

503
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:26,230
late at night.

504
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,790
My servant girl said you and Miss Shui

505
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,270
were talking about a formula.

506
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,960
I called you here today

507
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,510
to ask

508
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,270
what this formula

509
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,710
refers to.

510
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,510
To tell you the truth,

511
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,990
Miss Shui is the descendant
of a prisoner.

512
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,840
She has an ancestral

513
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,310
secret formula of traumatic medicine,

514
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,510
which is unique.

515
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,270
So according to your opinion,

516
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,550
what if

517
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:55,310
we use it in the face cream?

518
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:56,550
Face cream?

519
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,840
It may work.

520
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,200
I'm supposed to

521
00:25:05,310 --> 00:25:06,680
do this for you.

522
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,750
But now

523
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,070
I am at odds

524
00:25:09,070 --> 00:25:09,990
with Miss Shui.

525
00:25:10,310 --> 00:25:11,510
Plus, she is always

526
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,120
guarded by that idiot.

527
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,360
To get the prescription smoothly,

528
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:16,160
I'm afraid...

529
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:18,120
You don't need to worry about this.

530
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:20,310
After that,

531
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,030
I can introduce you

532
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:23,310
to Mr. Ling Jianxing.

533
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,840
I guess you know that

534
00:25:26,990 --> 00:25:27,920
great trees are good for nothing

535
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,600
but shade.

536
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:33,510
Then I will thank you in advance.

537
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,710
I will do my best

538
00:25:35,710 --> 00:25:36,990
to live up to the expectations

539
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:38,400
of you and Mr. Ling.

540
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:40,270
I will count on you then.

541
00:25:40,510 --> 00:25:41,310
Lan'er.

542
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,270
See him off.

543
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:45,510
Yes.

544
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,920
Sir, this way, please.

545
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:55,550
What has Ling Jianxing

546
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:56,840
been up to recently?

547
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:58,600
In addition to the Joy Cosmetics

548
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,360
of Princess Ruyue,

549
00:25:59,550 --> 00:26:01,070
Ling Jianxing has also been

550
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:02,440
courting the bosses of several
other industries recently.

551
00:26:03,750 --> 00:26:04,400
It seems that

552
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,160
he wants to arrange the candidates

553
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,230
for the chairman of
the Sea Trade Guild

554
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,550
as his own.

555
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:09,310
It's supposed to be

556
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,550
a situation of universal peace.

557
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,200
But he's creating

558
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,360
a foul atmosphere.

559
00:26:14,310 --> 00:26:15,510
How is the Dragon Gang recently?

560
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:16,960
Yuan Lang

561
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,790
hasn't gone out recently,

562
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,960
and he seems to be planning
something big.

563
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,160
If Ling Jianxing wants to conquer Haifang,

564
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,270
the Dragon Gang

565
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,600
is an important part of it.

566
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,030
I hope Chief Yuan

567
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:29,960
can keep his promise

568
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:30,710
and create

569
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,920
a brand new Dragon Gang.

570
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,360
Yes.

571
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,440
Recently, Ling Jianxing's spies

572
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,920
have become more and more lazy.

573
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:38,710
Maybe Your Lordship

574
00:26:38,710 --> 00:26:40,030
and Her Ladyship's outpouring
of true sentiments

575
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,360
made them unable to find any doubts.

576
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:42,470
And they are ready to give up.

577
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,070
Forget it.

578
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,230
Leave it alone.

579
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:48,990
It's being late.

580
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,010
- I'm going to find Man.
- Your Lordship.

581
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:51,790
What?

582
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:52,310
Your Lordship.

583
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:53,360
Mr. Qin Yixian

584
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,160
asked someone to send a message that

585
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,310
his life is in danger

586
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:56,120
at Joy Cosmetics.

587
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,360
He asked you to save him.

588
00:26:57,550 --> 00:26:59,120
His life is in danger?

589
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:05,510
Take it.

590
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,400
Watch out.

591
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:16,310
Hold it.

592
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:16,880
Okay.

593
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:18,710
Qin Yixian.

594
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,790
Ning.

595
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,510
You are finally here.

596
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:24,230
Put it there.

597
00:27:24,750 --> 00:27:25,710
If you don't come,

598
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:26,440
I will

599
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:27,550
be dying.

600
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:28,680
What happened?

601
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,070
I was called by Princess Ruyue

602
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:31,360
early this morning

603
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,270
to repair the roof.

604
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,270
It's been a whole day.

605
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:35,360
She still felt that the beams

606
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,440
repaired by the workers
are crooked.

607
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,360
I had no choice

608
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,030
but to invite you over.

609
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,840
You asked me here.

610
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,230
But I can't fix beams.

611
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,880
I really have something to do today.

612
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,600
I'll find someone else for you.

613
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,230
Ning. Ning.

614
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,360
Ruyue said that

615
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:52,550
you are the most upright in Haifang.

616
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,600
Your vision is the best.

617
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:55,880
So she insists that

618
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:56,840
you come and fix the roof.

619
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:57,470
She is now

620
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,840
Princess Ruyue.

621
00:27:59,030 --> 00:28:00,680
I really can't do anything with her.

622
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,360
Mr. Ning.

623
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:08,960
Princess Ruyue.

624
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,120
It's good that you are here.

625
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,990
Princess Ruyue.

626
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,230
Mr. Qin

627
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,070
asked someone to repair the roof
for a day.

628
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,600
But the beams

629
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,230
are still crooked.

630
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:20,030
Mr. Ning, as the person in charge

631
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:21,400
of the Imperial Supplier Contest

632
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,230
and the magistrate of Haifang,

633
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,960
you have to carefully inspect

634
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,030
and repair them.

635
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,710
Isn't it all good?

636
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:29,640
Where is it crooked?

637
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,880
Mr. Qin, do you mean that

638
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:34,310
I got you wrong?

639
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:35,360
Ning.

640
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,070
Mr. Qin.

641
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,550
Princess is right.

642
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:40,310
Every beam has problems.

643
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:41,920
What's going on?

644
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,600
Princess.

645
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,510
I think the problem with Joy Cosmetics

646
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,920
is that

647
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,710
the upper beams are not straight,

648
00:28:54,270 --> 00:28:54,920
which causes the other beams

649
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,160
to be skewed.

650
00:28:57,030 --> 00:28:58,310
But don't worry.

651
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:58,990
As the person in charge

652
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:00,510
of the Imperial Supplier Contest,

653
00:29:00,510 --> 00:29:01,550
I'll definitely have them

654
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,400
straighten the beams.

655
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,920
Thank you, Mr. Ning.

656
00:29:06,070 --> 00:29:06,750
You are welcome.

657
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,440
However, it is not necessary for Mr. Ning

658
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,270
to personally do something
as repairing the roof.

659
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:12,790
Instruct them

660
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,160
and then let's have tea.

661
00:29:14,310 --> 00:29:15,030
No need.

662
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:17,600
I still have something to do.

663
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,880
What are you doing?

664
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,120
Take a look at

665
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,440
where else can be repaired.

666
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,310
Sure.

667
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,270
Move.

668
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:26,790
Check it out.

669
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:29,960
Be careful.

670
00:29:30,470 --> 00:29:30,920
Here.

671
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,510
Here.

672
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:32,840
Go up and have a look.

673
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:33,360
Hold tight.

674
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,400
Ling Jianxing is about the same age

675
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,270
as Ning Yuxuan.

676
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,880
He shouldn't know so much

677
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,360
about the Tea Gang.

678
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:48,600
Could there be

679
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,880
other forces behind him?

680
00:29:53,510 --> 00:29:54,200
Mr. Huang.

681
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,160
Check it out.

682
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,030
Let's see how much he knows.

683
00:29:59,200 --> 00:29:59,990
We have to

684
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,790
get rid of his coercion
as soon as possible.

685
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:02,990
Yes.

686
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,310
Lang.

687
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,360
There is no need to worry about this.

688
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:12,070
In this Imperial Supplier Contest,

689
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,400
many foreign merchant ships

690
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,840
are my friends.

691
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,120
I will find a few trustworthy ones

692
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,680
and let them cooperate
with the Dragon Gang

693
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,160
to stage a failed robbery scene,

694
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:23,990
so that you can report to Ling Jianxing.

695
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:26,880
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

696
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:30,680
That's the only way now.

697
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:34,360
Pendants.

698
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,680
Your Ladyship, are we really not

699
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:37,120
waiting for His Lordship anymore?

700
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,270
He may have been trapped
by something.

701
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,030
It's too late if we don't go.

702
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:42,120
It's the same with you.

703
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,510
Joy Cosmetics.

704
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:47,270
Why are there so many people
around here?

705
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,400
(Joy Cosmetics)
Isn't it Ruyue's place?

706
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,360
My Lady, let's go to take a look.

707
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,710
Mr. Ning personally came over

708
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,120
to repair the roof for Princess Ruyue.

709
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:03,990
Sir.

710
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,790
What happened here?

711
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:08,270
I heard that there is a serious problem

712
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,550
with the beam structure

713
00:31:09,550 --> 00:31:10,310
of Princess Ruyue's

714
00:31:10,310 --> 00:31:11,310
Joy Cosmetics,

715
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:13,510
and it may collapse

716
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:14,550
at any time.

717
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,840
Thank goodness.

718
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:18,470
Justice will be done.

719
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,990
Such a good thing is happening.

720
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,310
She deserves it.

721
00:31:21,310 --> 00:31:22,160
Great.

722
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:23,790
Let's go.

723
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,680
Mr. Ning, you put down
your official duties

724
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,270
to repair my house.

725
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,030
- Isn't that His Lordship?
- Thank you so much.

726
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,200
It's really him.

727
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:33,680
Isn't he going to collect medicine

728
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:34,510
with Her Ladyship?

729
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,750
Right.

730
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:37,310
Why is he here?

731
00:31:37,310 --> 00:31:38,400
My Lady.

732
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,030
Mr. Ning and Princess Ruyue

733
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,550
are really a perfect match.

734
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,230
They are so sweet.

735
00:31:43,790 --> 00:31:44,600
Doesn't Mr. Ning

736
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,160
have a wife?

737
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,120
So what?

738
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,840
With the noble status

739
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:49,750
of Princess Ruyue,

740
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,550
it is easy for her

741
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,550
to abolish

742
00:31:53,550 --> 00:31:54,400
his principal wife.

743
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,790
- What's more...
- What are they talking about?

744
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,960
I heard that

745
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,070
Mr. Ning

746
00:31:58,070 --> 00:31:59,550
has conflicts with

747
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:00,600
his wife recently.

748
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,880
Maybe

749
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,790
he wanted to divorce her long ago.

750
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,230
My Lady.

751
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,640
Let's go. Or it would be too late.

752
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,270
Nonsense!

753
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:25,400
Ning.

754
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:27,680
Tonight, I have an appointment

755
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:28,640
with Lianxue, Mr. Tao and Miss Qingyun

756
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,880
to have dinner at Jingshui Restaurant.

757
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,030
Would you like to come?

758
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:34,990
Only the four of you?

759
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:37,710
Then why should I be there?

760
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,470
All right.

761
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:44,990
Mr. Ning.

762
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,400
The house has been repaired

763
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,360
for a day.

764
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:54,640
I think

765
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,790
there should be no problem.

766
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,510
Hard work for you.

767
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,270
Sirs.

768
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,440
I specially set up a banquet

769
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,360
in the restaurant

770
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,550
to express my thanks.

771
00:33:02,990 --> 00:33:03,840
I have an appointment.

772
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I'm afraid I can't make it.

773
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,030
Mr. Ning,

774
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:07,880
are you free tonight?

775
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,990
No.

776
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,310
You have to eat anyway.

777
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,270
How about I ask them

778
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,160
to bring the food here

779
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:14,230
and let's eat together?

780
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:15,360
Thank you, Princess,
for your kindness.

781
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,600
I don't think it's necessary.

782
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,550
Goodbye.

783
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:19,440
I think there is something wrong

784
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,230
with the house.

785
00:33:22,070 --> 00:33:23,470
You are not allowed to leave

786
00:33:24,400 --> 00:33:25,400
without my acceptance.

787
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:33,640
Just now you said that

788
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,200
there is no problem
after repairing for a day.

789
00:33:35,550 --> 00:33:37,120
What's the problem now?

790
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:44,440
If you say there is a problem,

791
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,360
there is a problem.

792
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,680
How about I let them

793
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,160
continue to repair

794
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,710
tomorrow?

795
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,710
Tomorrow?

796
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:52,680
I can't wait that long.

797
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:54,840
It's being late.

798
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,030
What are you going to do?

799
00:33:56,030 --> 00:33:58,920
I can do whatever I want.

800
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:00,880
Listen.

801
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,920
Now everyone go up and check.

802
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,550
If there is any problem,

803
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,120
I will punish you severely.

804
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,280
Okay.

805
00:34:08,550 --> 00:34:09,030
Come on.

806
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,990
Come on.

807
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,190
Go up.

808
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:20,240
This...

809
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:22,990
We were anxious to

810
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,360
check the problem for you,

811
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,880
so everyone rushed to the roof.

812
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,070
We hit hard

813
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,590
and the roof leaked.

814
00:34:28,630 --> 00:34:29,400
You!

815
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:30,960
My herbs!

816
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,030
Someone.

817
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:34,030
Pull them out and
punish them by flogging.

818
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,070
Princess, spare us.

819
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:35,760
Princess.

820
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:37,800
We flocked to repair the roof

821
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,510
because we were afraid of
being punished by you.

822
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,070
Please punish us.

823
00:34:41,070 --> 00:34:41,670
Princess.

824
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:43,630
I seem to have heard just now that

825
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,190
you let them go up.

826
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:47,400
They did make a mistake.

827
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,150
But they don't need to be
punished by flogging.

828
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,760
All of you.

829
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:53,960
Starting tomorrow,

830
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,630
word hard to repair the roof
for Princess,

831
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,840
and don't do this again.

832
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:58,550
- Yes.
- Yes.

833
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:00,360
It will take at least a month

834
00:35:02,470 --> 00:35:03,990
to repair such a big hole.

835
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:05,630
One month?

836
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:07,400
How can I

837
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
do business?

838
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,070
Wait, you...

839
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:11,110
Did you do it on purpose?

840
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:11,960
What?

841
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,990
Nie Sangyu lost to me last time,

842
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,070
so you intentionally

843
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,110
harmed Joy Cosmetics

844
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,990
to let her win, right?

845
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:19,320
What does this have to do

846
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,240
with my wife?

847
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:22,590
Princess Ruyue.

848
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,670
Today it was you who said
there was a problem with the house,

849
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:25,760
and you asked Mr. Qin to come over

850
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,880
and fix it all day.

851
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,550
You said that I have a good vision
and let me come over.

852
00:35:28,550 --> 00:35:29,190
And I took people

853
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:30,720
to repair it for so long.

854
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,320
Now

855
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:32,840
if you are going to involve my wife,

856
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,280
I can't take it.

857
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:43,670
Let's do this.

858
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:44,920
Continue to repair the roof

859
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:46,760
for Princess tomorrow.

860
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,720
Fix it till the end.

861
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,510
Yes.

862
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:53,280
Goodbye.

863
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,800
Qingyun.

864
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:27,720
Sangyu.

865
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,920
Why are you here?

866
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:35,840
Come and take a seat.

867
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,190
I have something to tell you.

868
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,510
What's up, Mr. Tao?

869
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:54,990
Sangyu.

870
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,150
Shall we

871
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,630
have a good chat

872
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,800
as classmates today?

873
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,550
Mr. Tao.

874
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,280
We have always been classmates.

875
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,840
So today

876
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,510
I also want to know your inner thoughts.

877
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:13,070
Do you really not want to get married

878
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,590
or not to get married so soon?

879
00:37:15,990 --> 00:37:17,590
This is very important to Qingyun,

880
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:19,150
and to me.

881
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,840
I, Tao Siwei, will only be with
one person in my life.

882
00:37:29,030 --> 00:37:30,360
If I make a promise,

883
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,440
it will never change.

884
00:37:34,150 --> 00:37:35,470
Qingyun made a right choice.

885
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:36,960
You are right.

886
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:39,960
Marriage is serious.

887
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,840
It means more responsibility

888
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:42,840
for the future

889
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,880
of the couple.

890
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:47,920
Passion and rampage

891
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,990
cannot solve the problem.

892
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:54,510
The two will encounter

893
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:56,550
many problems.

894
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
So

895
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:00,470
you and Mr. Ning also encountered

896
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:01,630
a lot of problems, didn't you?

897
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,800
You sacrificed a lot

898
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,800
for him.

899
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:11,510
He also

900
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,800
sacrificed for me.

901
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,110
I realized until now that

902
00:38:16,550 --> 00:38:18,150
two sincere hearts

903
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:19,920
are not enough to get a happy ending.

904
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,670
Sometimes fate is like this.

905
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,440
So when fate

906
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,550
comes to you,

907
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,400
don't escape.

908
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:37,960
Qingyun is a good girl.

909
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,800
Although she is

910
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,190
sometimes childish,

911
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,470
I can tell that

912
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:44,360
she has changed a lot for you.

913
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:45,760
Everyone can see

914
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,840
how serious she is to you.

915
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:47,990
Why are you still hesitating?

916
00:38:48,150 --> 00:38:48,960
Sangyu.

917
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,110
Then do you know

918
00:38:51,110 --> 00:38:52,590
what's on my mind?

919
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,630
I know

920
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:55,550
you just don't have the guts

921
00:38:55,550 --> 00:38:56,280
to take this step.

922
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,030
So do you really want us

923
00:38:57,030 --> 00:38:57,920
to get married?

924
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,150
Of course.

925
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:02,760
She is my sister.

926
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:04,360
You are my best friend.

927
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,550
I wish you two

928
00:39:05,550 --> 00:39:06,470
a happy life together.

929
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,840
I can feel happy too.

930
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:16,990
(Qingyun is indeed a good girl.)

931
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,840
(In that case,)

932
00:39:20,550 --> 00:39:21,840
(it's time for me to let go)

933
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,590
(and cherish the one by my side.)

934
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,440
I will

935
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:30,110
marry Qingyun.

936
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,840
I will treat her well,

937
00:39:33,550 --> 00:39:35,110
protect her all the life,

938
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,760
and prevent her from being wronged
in the slightest.

939
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,590
And

940
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,280
I will only marry her in my life,

941
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:45,320
never take a concubine.

942
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,280
Is that true?

943
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,400
Qingyun.

944
00:40:00,110 --> 00:40:01,720
Are you really going to marry me?

945
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:06,110
My sister is here.

946
00:40:06,590 --> 00:40:08,150
You can't lie.

947
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,800
Sangyu.

948
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,190
I knew.

949
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:29,590
I knew

950
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:31,070
you would definitely like me.

951
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,510
Your Lordship, you have
worked hard all day long.

952
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,400
Go to bed early.

953
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,240
Both Muxu and Sang Shen are back.

954
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,150
Why is she still outside?

955
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:01,630
Isn't she afraid of danger?

956
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:06,110
Your Lordship, are you going to
pick Her Ladyship up?

957
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:15,670
No.

958
00:41:17,070 --> 00:41:18,190
You should go back to rest.

959
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:19,670
I can't sleep

960
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:20,920
and I want to sit here

961
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,320
for a while.

962
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:47,720
You came back so late.

963
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,960

974
00:42:12,670 --> 00:42:13,550
I know everything.

975
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:15,880
You don't have to explain.

976
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:24,840
