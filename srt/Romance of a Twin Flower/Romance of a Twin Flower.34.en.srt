2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 34=

3
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,730
She looks so much like her.

4
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,500
The resemblance is uncanny.

5
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:54,060
Except for parents and immediate family,

6
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,090
no one can tell

7
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:56,700
the difference between them.

8
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,700
Even I

9
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,980
have a hard time telling the difference.

10
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:03,140
Looking at Man

11
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,340
is like looking at Sangyu.

12
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,980
It's such a pity

13
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:11,140
that she died so young.

14
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,490
Nie,

15
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:16,010
don't feel too bad.

16
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,010
It was her destiny.

17
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,700
But sadly,

18
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:22,570
I didn't get

19
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,420
to see her before she died.

20
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,450
I am

21
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,010
such a bad father.

22
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:33,220
Mr. Nie,

23
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:34,940
please don't say something like that.

24
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:36,420
If…

25
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,380
If she was still alive,

26
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:39,980
she would not want

27
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,010
to see you like this.

28
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,890
Mr. Nie,

29
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,770
does Qingyun know that you came?

30
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,980
How about I take you to see her?

31
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,980
I wrote her a letter a few days ago.

32
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:56,420
Didn't she tell you?

33
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:57,540
No, she didn't.

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,220
Maybe she's been too

35
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
busy with her betrothal,

36
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
so she forgot.

37
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,140
Betrothal?

38
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,820
With whom?

39
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,900
(Magistrate's Residence)

40
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:15,170
Dad, Dad.

41
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,980
How do I look?

42
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:18,420
Sangyu dressed me up,

43
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,980
but I don't feel right.

44
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,570
Qingyun,

45
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,940
if you had dressed like this before,

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:24,860
you

47
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,610
would have been married long ago.

48
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,330
Really?

49
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,660
Do I look good in this?

50
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:31,140
Your sister has good taste.

51
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,330
Qingyun, don't you worry.

52
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:33,980
We will

53
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,290
take care of your betrothal.

54
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:36,450
General Tao is here.

55
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,100
They are here.

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:39,860
Qingyun.

57
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,820
She's here.

58
00:03:43,260 --> 00:03:43,860
Sir.

59
00:03:47,450 --> 00:03:48,260
General Nie.

60
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,980
Sangyu.

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,050
Good.

62
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,050
Sit.

63
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,490
We are gathered here

64
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,860
to talk about the betrothal

65
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,290
between General Tao and Qingyun.

66
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,170
Qingyun.

67
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,220
Qingyun.

68
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,860
Stop looking at General Tao.

69
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,860
You'll spend the rest
of your lives together.

70
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:24,220
Yuxuan, stop making fun of me.

71
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,250
General Tao,

72
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,690
I have always admired you,

73
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,980
though you're young.

74
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,050
And as fellow martial artists,

75
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:37,050
we are straightforward people.

76
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,490
After I came to Haifang,

77
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,050
I heard that you and my daughter

78
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,900
are fond of each other,

79
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,900
and I couldn't

80
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,370
be happier.

81
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,540
If you two

82
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,290
are officially betrothed,

83
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,100
I will be

84
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,860
so relieved.

85
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:55,660
Come on.

86
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,490
Let's have a drink.

87
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,170
Cheers.

88
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:21,540
Qingyun

89
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,980
is a good girl.

90
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:24,580
She's very nice to me.

91
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:42,810
The hairpin is an heirloom of mine.

92
00:05:43,690 --> 00:05:44,460
Tonight,

93
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:48,050
I give it to you.

94
00:05:51,170 --> 00:05:51,780
I…

95
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:17,780
General Tao,

96
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,220
are you sure?

97
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,290
I have made up my mind.

98
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:25,460
I will cherish the one before me.

99
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:26,690
I will marry you.

100
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:29,780
Great.

101
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:32,930
I, too, prepared a gift for you.

102
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:34,780
But it's not as valuable as yours.

103
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,250
I have worked on it for a long time.

104
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:38,300
Hope you like it.

105
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,820
(Tao)

106
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,370
General Tao,

107
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,340
you will be responsible

108
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,130
for Qingyun moving forward.

109
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:47,370
You must not fail her.

110
00:06:58,690 --> 00:06:59,610
OK.

111
00:07:02,690 --> 00:07:03,420
I say,

112
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,900
we make

113
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,220
their betrothal official.

114
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,980
You will move on
to the following procedures

115
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,250
as soon as possible.

116
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,290
Sure, Dad.

117
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:11,900
Come on.

118
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,660
Here's a toast

119
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:14,540
to General Tao

120
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,420
and Qingyun.

121
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,460
General Tao,

122
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:18,900
Qingyun,

123
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,730
I give you my best wishes.

124
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:23,660
Thanks, cheers.

125
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:35,540
Both my daughters

126
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,170
are with

127
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,930
a good man.

128
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,860
There will be

129
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,100
no regrets for me.

130
00:07:43,690 --> 00:07:44,370
Dad.

131
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,540
I am happy.

132
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,610
I'll have another drink.

133
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,170
Are you okay, General Nie?

134
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:55,730
Have some tea to sober up.

135
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:02,860
I'm fine.

136
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,340
It's just

137
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,980
I feel sorry for Sangyu.

138
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,130
It looks like you have already known.

139
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,540
It is

140
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,490
my fault.

141
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,540
It's my fault

142
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,930
for spoiling her.

143
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,930
She always got her way,

144
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,690
so she was arrogant and domineering.

145
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,730
It's all

146
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:28,730
my fault.

147
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,730
If

148
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,170
I had been a little stricter,

149
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,460
it wouldn't…

150
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:35,940
It wouldn't have

151
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,010
ended up like this.

152
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,610
On the cliff,

153
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:41,100
I didn't know

154
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,250
that it was Ji Man who I saved.

155
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:44,890
I thought

156
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,010
I saved Sangyu.

157
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,250
If I had been more careful,

158
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:50,010
it would…

159
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:56,220
I failed to protect her.

160
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,770
It was rather peculiar.

161
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,530
It wasn't your fault.

162
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:02,220
You didn't know

163
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,580
that they were twin sisters.

164
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,610
For what is worth,

165
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,220
Sangyu and I

166
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,490
were still married.

167
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:11,130
After knowing the truth,

168
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:13,220
I built an altar for her

169
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:15,130
in an old temple.

170
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:20,410
Please tell me the location.

171
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:21,980
I will

172
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,130
go visit her.

173
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,730
The dead is gone,

174
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,860
the living still lives.

175
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:31,220
When I saw

176
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:33,580
Ji Man earlier,

177
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,860
I felt like

178
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,580
I saw Sangyu for a moment.

179
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:40,730
But Sangyu

180
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,250
was not as lucky as Ji Man.

181
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,460
You two love each other so much.

182
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,940
I have to say

183
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,010
that fate

184
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:51,060
has played a prank

185
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:53,820
on all of us.

186
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,370
Oh, right.

187
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:01,650
How are you

188
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,460
going to handle the relationship

189
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,060
between you and Ji Man?

190
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:08,010
It's old story.

191
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:10,300
I don't want this thing

192
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,860
to further hurt Ji Man anymore.

193
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:20,700
(Nie Sangyu is dead.)

194
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,940
(I always thought
that Nie Sangyu had changed.)

195
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,180
(It turns out it wasn't that.)

196
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:29,980
(She's just dead.)

197
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,530
(That person's name is Ji Man.)

198
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,940
(How can it be like that?)

199
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:41,440
(Autumn Moon Cold River)

200
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,220
Watch out, Qingyun.

201
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,340
I'm so happy, Sangyu.

202
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,410
Yeah, yeah.

203
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,010
Watch out for the steps.

204
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:51,410
- I'm now General Tao's…
- Easy.

205
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:54,890
I'm General Tao's wife now.

206
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:56,460
Sang Shen, hold her.

207
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:58,730
Where's General Tao?

208
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:00,940
Sangyu.

209
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:03,890
Mr. Tao.

210
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,340
Be careful.

211
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,060
Qingyun.

212
00:11:06,490 --> 00:11:07,650
I have something to say to you.

213
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:09,580
Qingyun's drunk.

214
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:09,980
I'll…

215
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,250
You take her back to her room.

216
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,730
Why?

217
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:16,650
Come on.

218
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:17,490
Sang Shen, Muxu.

219
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:18,530
Be careful.

220
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:19,370
Take it easy.

221
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:20,410
Sangyu.

222
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:21,820
- I'll be back soon.
- Now, go back to your room.

223
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,460
- You go first.
- Take it easy.

224
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,180
Slowly. Come.

225
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,650
Mr. Tao, what is the matter?

226
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,490
It's my happy day.

227
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:35,490
I am getting

228
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:36,890
quite nostalgic.

229
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:37,770
How about

230
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,460
you have some more drinks with me?

231
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,650
Sangyu,

232
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:49,530
we were classmates for years,

233
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,060
and now, we both have our own family.

234
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:52,730
How time flies.

235
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:54,130
Am I right?

236
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,700
Do you remember

237
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:56,890
how we talked about

238
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,580
what the future would be like?

239
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,580
Fortunately,

240
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,820
our dreams have come true.

241
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:02,580
You

242
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,730
have become a boss lady

243
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,370
as you intended.

244
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:08,980
Yes.

245
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,340
Although the journey was bumpy,

246
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,820
luckily,

247
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,700
we have got what we wanted.

248
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,250
Hold on.

249
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,340
I remember

250
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:21,060
your wish

251
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,530
was to marry the one you love the most.

252
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,370
Was it?

253
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,980
Well,

254
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:32,130
people change.

255
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:33,370
Yes.

256
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,220
You have changed.

257
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:37,410
You are different from before.

258
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:38,180
You

259
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:43,980
are now getting
more and more endearing.

260
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,250
I give you and Ning

261
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,180
my best wishes.

262
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,100
Sangyu, have you noticed

263
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,340
that Ning's personality and yours

264
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,490
are alike?

265
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,010
You're both strong-minded.

266
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,250
You don't want to lose.

267
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,610
I remember

268
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,980
one time, we skipped school

269
00:13:08,980 --> 00:13:10,300
and went to fly a kite by the river.

270
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:11,130
The kite accidentally

271
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:12,130
got stuck on a tree.

272
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:14,220
I proposed to get it for you,

273
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,650
but you said no.

274
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,490
In the end,

275
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,700
you personally took the kite…

276
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,300
Mr. Tao,

277
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:24,940
I said to you earlier

278
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:26,530
that there are

279
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,730
certain things

280
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,100
that I cannot tell you at the moment.

281
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:30,730
When the time is right,

282
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,370
I will make myself clear.

283
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,010
But I sincerely hope

284
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,130
that you and Qingyun get married.

285
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,650
It is her biggest wish.

286
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:41,700
Also mine.

287
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,700
Do you understand?

288
00:13:44,130 --> 00:13:45,130
Thank you, Sangyu.

289
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:46,860
I, too, wish you and Ning Yuxuan

290
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,940
an everlasting marriage.

291
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,130
It's late.

292
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,250
I'm going back to my room.

293
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,580
You should go to bed, too.

294
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,460
It has been

295
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,340
a long day for you.

296
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,530
Well, it hasn't been
easy for you, either.

297
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,650
You had

298
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:26,890
to play a role in my show.

299
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:29,220
You scratch my back, I scratch yours.

300
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,730
Don't thank me.

301
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,940
There's something

302
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,460
that I think

303
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,460
you should know.

304
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:43,340
What?

305
00:14:50,410 --> 00:14:51,980
I think General Tao knows

306
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,410
that I'm not Nie Sangyu.

307
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:53,980
How?

308
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:58,130
How did he find out?

309
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,700
I don't know.

310
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,250
But…

311
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,730
But the tone

312
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:05,060
he talked to me with,

313
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:06,490
the attitude he had,

314
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,650
the way he looked at me,

315
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,490
it felt completely different.

316
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:10,700
I think

317
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:11,490
he must have known something.

318
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,250
Do you think he…

319
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,340
General Tao and I
have been friends for years.

320
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,370
He's a decent man.

321
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:18,220
I don't think he'll try

322
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,180
to jeopardize us.

323
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,060
I hope so.

324
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:27,820
Anyway,

325
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:29,250
my identity

326
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,010
has to be kept a secret.

327
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:31,580
It mustn't be disclosed.

328
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:32,370
Got it.

329
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,940
We will be very discreet.

330
00:15:42,490 --> 00:15:43,300
I…

331
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,940

00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,580
Blue bead.

389
00:19:40,370 --> 00:19:41,860
You almost fully recovered.

390
00:19:42,130 --> 00:19:42,970
Several days later,

391
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:44,170
you will be able to move freely.

392
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,410
I tried many medications before,

393
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,340
but nothing worked so efficiently
like this.

394
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,540
But you are not

395
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,450
allowed to walk around
at the moment.

396
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,410
Do you hear me?

397
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,500
Do you have anything

398
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,340
to say to me?

399
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:06,780
Thank you for taking care of me

400
00:20:08,650 --> 00:20:09,890
in the last couple of days.

401
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:18,170
I should be the one

402
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:20,650
who says thank you.

403
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:25,020
I'll be healed soon.

404
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,100
I…

405
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:27,500
I…

406
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,930
You are going back
to look after His Lordship?

407
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:32,890
Well,

408
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:33,780
I'll redress

409
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,740
your wound for the last time,

410
00:20:34,930 --> 00:20:35,610
and then, you can go back to him.

411
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,650
But remember,

412
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:39,410
you will need to change
your dressings on time.

413
00:20:43,890 --> 00:20:45,410
If you can't do it on your own,

414
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,100
just come to me anytime.

415
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:54,820
Miss Shui,

416
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:58,210
take this injury for example.

417
00:20:59,020 --> 00:20:59,690
It's probable

418
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,930
for me to lose my life anytime.

419
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:01,860
I…

420
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,930
I cannot provide you a steady life.

421
00:21:11,650 --> 00:21:12,610
I know that.

422
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:15,260
But I don't care.

423
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,610
I don't care about your status,

424
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,450
and neither do I

425
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,650
care about what a life you live.

426
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,500
All I care about

427
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,610
is if you love me.

428
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,370
Mr. Yuan.

429
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,860
Man.

430
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,450
Man.

431
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,780
How much did you drink?

432
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,410
Not much.

433
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,210
Come on.

434
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:03,820
Drink with me.

435
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,210
Stop drinking, please.

436
00:22:09,130 --> 00:22:10,130
I'll pour you some tea.

437
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,650
No.

438
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,410
Drink this.

439
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:44,780
Man.

440
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,610
Do you know this?
When you were little,

441
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,740
you were very naughty.

442
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:53,970
You would cry

443
00:22:54,450 --> 00:22:55,650
and make a scene all the time.

444
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,060
Mr. Cai would take you to me,

445
00:22:59,210 --> 00:23:00,820
and I'd calm you down.

446
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:04,970
This is the funny part.

447
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,930
As soon as I held you in my arms,

448
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,860
and I would swing,

449
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,020
swing,

450
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:12,300
swing.

451
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,170
And you'd stop crying.

452
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:23,890
Just stop drinking.

453
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:31,860
Man,

454
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,100
would you forgive someone

455
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:38,580
after he made a mistake?

456
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,860
Can you tell me

457
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:46,780
what's wrong with you?

458
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,860
Why do you get

459
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,780
yourself so drunk?

460
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,410
What happened to you?

461
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,260
Just tell me,

462
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:57,260
okay?

463
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,100
What is it?

464
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,970
Yes, there is something.

465
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:12,930
And I must

466
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,690
tell you about it.

467
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,450
It's been a lengthy torment.

468
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:18,820
The truth is…

469
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:28,100
What are you doing, Mr. Yuan?

470
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:29,970
What's the matter with you?

471
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,820
Just let me know.

472
00:24:42,410 --> 00:24:43,170
I must

473
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:44,450
let you know this tonight.

474
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,020
- My dad…
- Man.

475
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:47,990
Man.

476
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,300
Dad.

477
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,410
You're here, too, Lang.

478
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,210
What?

479
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,580
You didn't invite me to drink with you.

480
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:03,410
Hi, Mr. Ji.

481
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,020
Oh, am I interrupting you? I'll…

482
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,260
If you need a chat,

483
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:15,690
go on, then.

484
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:23,100
Mr. Yuan.

485
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:25,540
- Take it easy. Don't drink too much.
- I…

486
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:29,540
What's the matter with him?

487
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,210
I don't know.

488
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,820
He's been acting like this
for the past few days.

489
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,410
At a loss and in a trance.

490
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:38,410
I, too, have noticed

491
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:39,690
that he's not being himself.

492
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:41,860
He keeps avoiding me.

493
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,260
Man,

494
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:47,580
you are the one

495
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:49,890
that concerns me.

496
00:25:50,210 --> 00:25:51,610
Your identity

497
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:54,020
is a large secret.

498
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,020
Ling Jianxing is on the watch.

499
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,650
He mustn't

500
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:00,650
acquire any information.

501
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:04,340
Don't worry, Dad.

502
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:06,450
I will tread very lightly.

503
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:12,970
You have nailed

504
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,020
all the ceramic kilns?

505
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:15,450
Yes, I have.

506
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:17,130
No matter what Nie Sangyu

507
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,260
is capable of,

508
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,930
it will not be possible

509
00:26:18,930 --> 00:26:20,210
for her to gather

510
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,740
so many bottles in such a short time.

511
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,650
So,

512
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,260
she can make however much

513
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,610
Feiwan Face Cream she wants,

514
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:27,650
but she will have no containers.

515
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,340
Good.

516
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:32,970
General Tao, please don't.

517
00:26:32,970 --> 00:26:34,020
- You can't go in there.
- General Tao.

518
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:34,780
Out of my way.

519
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:50,410
What an unsolicited visit.

520
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,930
What's the matter, General Tao?

521
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,780
I have something
to say to you in private.

522
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,020
Will you ask them out

523
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,890
or will I do it?

524
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,780
Nie Sangyu is dead.

525
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,580
That's not the real Mrs. Ning.

526
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,650
General Nie and Ning Yuxuan

527
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:20,820
are working on a plan.

528
00:27:22,450 --> 00:27:23,410
Tao Siwei,

529
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:24,580
do you honestly think

530
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:26,890
that you can fool me

531
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,610
with such absurdity?

532
00:27:31,130 --> 00:27:31,970
Do you have any evidence?

533
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,860
If you don't believe me,

534
00:27:34,610 --> 00:27:35,930
you can kidnap

535
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,370
Mrs. Ning's servants

536
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,130
and interrogate them.

537
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,540
She may wear a perfect disguise,

538
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,740
but she has

539
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,060
to reveal her true colors
to her close ones.

540
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,860
I will be expecting you.

541
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,340
Tao Siwei and Ning Yuxuan

542
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:13,370
are really good mates.

543
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:15,740
Given that he just disclosed

544
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:17,500
a major secret,

545
00:28:18,260 --> 00:28:19,300
I suspect

546
00:28:19,690 --> 00:28:21,130
something happened between them.

547
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,340
He turned against Ning Yuxuan,

548
00:28:26,690 --> 00:28:28,340
I find it rather strange.

549
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,020
I will send my men
to keep an eye out on them.

550
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:33,860
Do you believe

551
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,740
what Tao Siwei said?

552
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:35,580
I do.

553
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,370
Why are you so sure?

554
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:41,060
I heard rumors

555
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,450
when I was in Ning's Mansion.

556
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:44,370
They said Nie Sangyu

557
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:45,060
had become

558
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,100
a completely different person.

559
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:47,930
And for someone who grew up
in a rich family,

560
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,690
it's weird

561
00:28:48,690 --> 00:28:49,690
that she personally makes face cream

562
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,930
and opens up a shop to sell it.

563
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,970
It is not the first time I suspect

564
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:53,540
that she is not

565
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,740
the real Nie Sangyu.

566
00:28:55,450 --> 00:28:57,450
With Tao Siwei's information,

567
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,690
although I lack firm evidence,

568
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,340
I still believe

569
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:03,300
that the person we're talking about

570
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:04,890
now is not the real Nie Sangyu.

571
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,210
It's amazing

572
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:12,370
that someone looks

573
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:14,100
identical as Nie Sangyu.

574
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:16,610
Who is

575
00:29:16,610 --> 00:29:17,610
this "Nie Sangyu" then?

576
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:21,260
In this case,

577
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,690
Tao Siwei isn't lying.

578
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,210
I thought

579
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,580
our plan

580
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,930
worked out perfectly.

581
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:31,930
But Ning Yuxuan is

582
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:33,740
unimaginably bold.

583
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:35,970
Too bad, Nie Xiangyuan

584
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:37,100
has left Haifang

585
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,170
to receive His Majesty.

586
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,970
Or else, I should really

587
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,450
have a good conversation with him.

588
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:44,780
Other than Nie Xiangyuan,

589
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,130
there's another person
that we can talk to.

590
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,500
Good to see you,

591
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,060
Mr. Ling.

592
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,690
Here.

593
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:58,740
Drink some tea.

594
00:29:59,450 --> 00:30:01,260
I have always admired you, sir.

595
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,970
I hope I'm not disturbing you,

596
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,650
Guihai Warrior.

597
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,860
I'm only a minor merchant.

598
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,210
I wonder what's your visit about,

599
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,580
Mr. Ling?

600
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:11,690
Here's the thing.

601
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:14,610
The reason why His Majesty chose

602
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:16,260
Haifang for the Imperial
Supplier Contest

603
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,540
is that he sees

604
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,610
its traffic advantage,

605
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:20,210
and its position as a trading center.

606
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,210
You are a seasoned

607
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:23,100
businessman and captain.

608
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,300
So

609
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:25,860
I thought I could come

610
00:30:26,650 --> 00:30:27,450
and ask you

611
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,780
about your thoughts

612
00:30:30,410 --> 00:30:31,370
on the contest.

613
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:32,610
Mr. Ling, I'm really flattered.

614
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:35,690
It is a big contest,

615
00:30:35,970 --> 00:30:37,690
and the participants
are all elite businessmen.

616
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,500
Also,

617
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:40,540
with you and Mr. Ning

618
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,610
seeing to the event,

619
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:43,740
I don't think my thoughts matter.

620
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,890
Oh, right.

621
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:48,690
I have heard

622
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,370
you have a daughter.

623
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,500
Why didn't she sign up for the contest?

624
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,540
You have experience

625
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,300
and a whole fleet.

626
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:56,500
I believe

627
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:59,020
she will win the first place.

628
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:00,210
I didn't

629
00:31:00,450 --> 00:31:01,930
expect my family business

630
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,300
to draw your attention, Mr. Ling.

631
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
My daughter has a poor health.

632
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:08,740
She's now in recuperation at home

633
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,650
in the south.

634
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:10,540
So

635
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,690
I never bring her to any public places.

636
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:14,970
What illness is she stricken with?

637
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:17,300
I know many doctors in the capital.

638
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,500
Get her here,

639
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:20,340
and I'll make sure she's cured.

640
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:22,020
I appreciate it, Mr. Ling.

641
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,540
But it's dry in the capital city,

642
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,340
it may not be an ideal environment
for my daughter,

643
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:28,130
and it may worsen her condition.

644
00:31:28,450 --> 00:31:31,020
I think it's best that she stays at home.

645
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,930
So you put more energy

646
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:34,500
in your foster daughter.

647
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,740
I have heard that Nie Sangyu

648
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,930
now calls you Godfather.

649
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,650
She's Ning Yuxuan's wife,

650
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,580
and one of the contestants.

651
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,500
The citizens are talking about

652
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,340
the possibility of nepotism,

653
00:31:45,650 --> 00:31:48,690
and questioning the fairness
of the contest.

654
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,060
Well, I can't deny that.

655
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,340
But

656
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,370
Princess Ruyue

657
00:31:57,690 --> 00:31:58,860
participates in the contest

658
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,540
as a member of the royal family,

659
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:03,340
do people not

660
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:06,210
question that?

661
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,970
Sir.

662
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,500
Sir, we need to ship the goods.

663
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,100
Mr. Ling,

664
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,580
I've got work to do.

665
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:28,930
I will visit you

666
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,300
some other day.

667
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,130
Try this one.

668
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,020
Be sure to come again if you like it.

669
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,100
Alright, let me try it on you.

670
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,820
OK.

671
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:42,890
Here.

672
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:43,540
It smells so good.

673
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:44,970
Man.

674
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,300
Dad.

675
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:46,860
Come.

676
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:48,930
Very moist, right?

677
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,540
What's up?

678
00:32:51,130 --> 00:32:52,060
What happened?

679
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:53,780
It's very unexpecting.

680
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:56,540
Your identity may have been disclosed.

681
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,540
What?

682
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,540
Today,

683
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:00,060
Ling Jianxing came and visited me

684
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,860
on Ship Guihai.

685
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:02,060
He started with

686
00:33:02,210 --> 00:33:03,610
the Imperial Supplier Contest,

687
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,450
but what he's really after

688
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:05,890
is who you really are.

689
00:33:05,890 --> 00:33:06,740
Ling Jianxing?

690
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:07,300
Yes.

691
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,580
How did he know that?

692
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,260
There's no point

693
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,610
in finding out how he knew it.

694
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:13,170
Now that your disguise has been blown up,

695
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:14,300
you

696
00:33:14,540 --> 00:33:15,820
and everybody around you,

697
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,340
including Ning Yuxuan, will be in danger.

698
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,340
I know.

699
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:26,100
But what about my shop?

700
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:26,410
If I just…

701
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:27,130
It's not important.

702
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,410
Nothing matters more

703
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:29,890
than your life at the moment.

704
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,300
You leave tonight.

705
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,370
It's urgent.

706
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,990
You must leave tonight.

707
00:33:52,970 --> 00:33:54,100
What is it?

708
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:55,740
Your Lordship,

709
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:58,860
you've been staring at the bead
for the whole morning.

710
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,930
Her Ladyship has left.

711
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,580
I think you should

712
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,210
just throw it away.

713
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:12,180
I know

714
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:13,490
that you and Her Ladyship

715
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,300
still miss each other.

716
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:16,570
No, I don't.

717
00:34:16,890 --> 00:34:17,410
Your Lordship,

718
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:18,340
I just…

719
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,050
Your Lordship.

720
00:34:22,410 --> 00:34:22,970
Your Lordship.

721
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:24,660
An emergency letter from Miss Sang Shen.

722
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,370
Let me see.

723
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,340
(Miss Ji's identity
may have been exposed.)

724
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,780
(Her father will take)

725
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,660
(her to Yunzhou immediately.)

726
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:36,700
(Sang Shen.)

727
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:43,340
(Haifang Wharf)

728
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:44,370
Man,

729
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:45,660
forgive me.

730
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:48,180
For you and Ning Yuxuan's safety,

731
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,050
we must leave.

732
00:34:54,410 --> 00:34:55,410
Trust me.

733
00:34:55,970 --> 00:34:57,970

what will you do?

753
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,220
It is my fault.

754
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,050
You are not responsible

755

for the past.

756
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,820
I'm not leaving.

757
00:36:58,890 --> 00:37:00,340
I will not leave.

we will face it together.

And we will

763
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:20,970
find a time to have a serious

00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:21,860
conversation about the Tea Gang.

765
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,890
I always feel

766
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:24,740
that something isn't quite right.

767
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:26,570
Not right?

768
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:28,820
Man.

769
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,530
Mr. Yuan,

770
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:37,620
what are you doing here?

771
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,970
Man,

772
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,860
I thought you were leaving.

773
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:42,860
So I came to bid you farewell.

774
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,340
I'm not leaving.

775
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:49,700
In the future,

776
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,860
no matter what happens,

777
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:53,140
I will face it together with him.

778
00:37:59,180 --> 00:37:59,930
Man,

779
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:02,490
since you have made up your mind,

780
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,050
I respect your decision.

781
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,220
I'd like to talk to you

782
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:08,700
about some old story of the Tea Gang.

783
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,660
Follow me.

784
00:38:15,220 --> 00:38:16,180
The Tea Gang?

785
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:20,260
Let's go check it out.

786
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,340
Mr. Yuan,

787
00:38:33,530 --> 00:38:34,930
you have finished the second
bottle of wine.

788
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:36,340
Can you please

789
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:37,780
start talking now?

790
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,140
People say

791
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:47,780
alcohol is the cure for all sorrows.

792
00:38:49,370 --> 00:38:51,410
But how come it doesn't
solve any of my problems?

793
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,050
Mr. Yuan,

794
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,740
I have noticed

795
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:56,890
that you've been in a trance
these days.

796
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,700
Are you in trouble?

797
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,930
Just let us know.

798
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,410
We'll try and help you.

799
00:39:01,410 --> 00:39:02,010
Is that okay?

800
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,340
No one understands me.

801
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,620
I am

802
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,180
a complete joke.

803
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:28,090
Do you know this?

804
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:29,820
Ning Yuxuan,

805
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,140
you should've reconciled

806
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:33,370
a long time ago.

807
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,220
I have been

808
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:37,260
holding something back from you.

809
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,780
There's no feud

810
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:43,740
between you two.

811
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,780
It was my dad who

812
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:51,140
caused the tragedy.

813
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:54,660
What do you mean?

814
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,370
Ning Yuxuan,

815
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:02,180
it wasn't Cai Wenzheng

816
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,140
who murdered your dad.

817
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,260
It was my father, who disguised
as Cai Wenzheng, that did it.

818
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,300
So I am your target.

819
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,340
If you wish to seek revenge,

820
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:30,820
come at me.

821
00:40:37,090 --> 00:40:37,860
Mr. Yuan,

822
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:38,820
get up.

823
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,300
Just get up, Mr. Yuan.

824
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:41,410
Kill me.

825
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,410
Get up.

826
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,220
Get up, now, Mr. Yuan.

827
00:40:48,490 --> 00:40:49,570
Why do I

828
00:40:49,570 --> 00:40:50,140
tell you the truth?

829
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,890
Do you know?

830
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,740
I did it for Man.

831
00:41:02,890 --> 00:41:03,780
I always thought

832
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,180
that all the officials

833
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:07,370
were arrogant and greedy,

834
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:09,740
that all they cared about
is their own interest,

835
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,780
that they saw the civilians as dust.

836
00:41:14,370 --> 00:41:15,820
Whether they offer amnesty

837
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,660
or implement a reform,

838
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,010
it's but a pretext

839
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:22,260
to enslave the refugees.

840
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,700
You, however, are different.

841
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:30,490
You are competent, visionary,

842
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,530
and wise.

843
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:33,780
You are capable

844
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,660
of providing a good life
for the citizens.

845
00:41:36,530 --> 00:41:37,930
You are a good official.

846
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,260
Your dad

847
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:49,220
killed my father?

848
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:52,300
Yes.

849
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,700
And I'm the one

850
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:59,180
who attempted to assassinate you

851
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,010
twice in the capital.

852
00:42:02,090 --> 00:42:03,260
I am Lang.

853
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:07,410
I know that.

854
00:42:15,010 --> 00:42:16,410
But as I watched you

855
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:17,860
take the Dragon Gang on the right track,

856
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,820
I wanted to let you off.

857
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:21,490
But now you…

858
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,890
Why?

859
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,860
Ning Yuxuan, let him go.

860
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,410
Let him go, Ning Yuxuan.

861
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:35,490
We haven't found out
about what actually happened,

862
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:36,490
just control yourself.

863
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,140
Don't act on impulse.

864
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:42,530
Mr. Yuan,

865
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,220
get up first.

866
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:45,410
Kill me.

867
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,300
Get up.

868
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:00,050
We haven't

869
00:43:00,050 --> 00:43:00,890
got to the bottom of it.

870
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,140
We must stay calm.

871
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,180
No matter

872
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:03,860
what Yuan Dingshan did,

873
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,410
Yuan Lang was no part of it.

874
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,180
Also,

875
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:12,050
the feud from the last generations

876
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:12,820
has troubled you

877
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:13,740
for so many years.

878
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,370
Does it have to be passed on

879
00:43:15,370 --> 00:43:17,220
