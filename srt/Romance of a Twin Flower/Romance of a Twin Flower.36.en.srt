=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 36=

3
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,860
If Princess Ruyue

4
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,650
has a clear conscience,

5
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,570
let's verify it on the spot.

6
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,810
If there is no problem,

7
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,810
your innocence will be proved.

8
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:57,810
Mr. Qin.

9
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,340
Do you have

10
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,450
the product of Joy Cosmetics?

11
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:08,770
Mrs. Ning.

12
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,420
This is Joy Cosmetics' new product

13
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,330
Qingfeng Cream.

14
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:13,890
In fact,

15
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:15,450
it is quite simple

16
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:16,290
to verify the mercury content in it.

17
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,220
All I need is stone sulfur
and a heating furnace,

18
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:18,820
and I can get

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,380
what the ancients called the red elixir.

20
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:22,100
Elixir?

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:22,610
Yes.

22
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:23,450
It is actually

23
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,890
the cinnabar in Chinese herbal medicine.

24
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,330
So I only need

25
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:27,730
stone sulfur and a heating furnace

26
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,260
to verify on the spot.

27
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,420
Your Highness,

28
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:31,890
what do you think?

29
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,220
Mr. Qin.

30
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,940
Please.

31
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:49,610
The new product has been presented
to the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

32
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:51,450
How much confidence

33
00:02:52,450 --> 00:02:53,770
do you have this time?

34
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,290
Don't just stand.

35
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,050
Sit.

36
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:20,820
Why don't you speak?

37
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:22,330
Are you afraid of losing?

38
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,490
No.

39
00:03:23,770 --> 00:03:24,660
If everything goes well,

40
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,660
my Qingfeng Cream

41
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,820
will definitely win in the final.

42
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,660
I will do my best

43
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,980
to win the game.

44
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,050
Sir.

45
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,100
Could it be that

46
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:48,540
the real purpose of this contest

47
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:51,770
is not to win the first place,

48
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:55,610
but to

49
00:03:57,050 --> 00:03:58,980
get rid of Ning Yuxuan and his wife?

50
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,140
Your Majesty.

51
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,980
Mercury is a common ingredient

52
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,220
in face creams.

53
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,220
I didn't know

54
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,250
mercury would be poisonous

55
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,460
when used in excess.

56
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,100
I admit defeat

57
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,130
in this Imperial Supplier Contest.

58
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,860
Princess Ruyue, stand up.

59
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:39,540
It is not surprising that

60
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:41,730
mercury powder

61
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:43,100
is commonly used

62
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:45,100
in face creams.

63
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,610
But I would like to know

64
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,810
if there is not any mercury powder

65
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,730
added to the products

66
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,980
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

67
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,730
Your Majesty.

68
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:56,420
All the products of Haoxue Cosmetics

69
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,690
are formulated from

70
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:58,610
natural Chinese herbal medicines,

71
00:04:58,810 --> 00:04:59,980
because only this way

72
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:01,580
is the safest

73
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,730
for women's delicate skin.

74
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:06,490
It seems that

75
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:08,930
Haoxue Cosmetics is the real champion

76
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:11,980
in the competition of face creams.

77
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,340
Your Majesty.

78
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:17,860
I think

79
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,050
you held the Imperial Supplier Contest

80
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:19,810
in Haifang this time

81
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,050
not to

82
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,610
decide a winner,

83
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,050
but to take this opportunity

84
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,290
to promote the development
of new products

85
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:28,780
and the entire guild.

86
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,250
So Haoxue Cosmetics decided

87
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,370
to make

88
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,290
all of its product formulas public.

89
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,020
All cosmetic shops

90
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:36,540
can use my formula

91
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,690
to develop new products,

92
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,250
and also use it as a basis

93
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,780
to develop better formulas.

94
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,130
Have you made up your mind?

95
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,130
If you

96
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,610
make public the formula,

97
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,660
from now on,

98
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,050
the same product

99
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,860
will be available

100
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,170
in all shops.

101
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,340
Your Majesty, the reason why you
approved maritime trade back then

102
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,540
was to make people's lives

103
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,540
more prosperous,

104
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:57,810
not to benefit only a few people.

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,290
If this move

106
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:00,460
can promote Haifang's

107
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,420
cosmetic industry,

108
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,980
even if it is only
a little bit of progress,

109
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,730
Haoxue Cosmetics is duty-bound.

110
00:06:09,730 --> 00:06:10,690
Consul Ning.

111
00:06:11,290 --> 00:06:13,810
Is this your idea?

112
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,130
Your Majesty.

113
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:20,250
It's my wife's idea.

114
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,170
Good.

115
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:25,420
I really admire

116
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,540
Mrs. Ning's breadth of mind.

117
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,340
I already have

118
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,610
a candidate for

119
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,730
the chairman of
the Sea Trade Guild in Haifang.

120
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,810
Your Majesty.

121
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,020
Mr. Ning.

122
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:47,170
Mrs. Ning.

123
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,290
General Nie.

124
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,690
Today,

125
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,130
Mrs. Ning won

126
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:55,780
the championship of face cream.

127
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,980
I also have a great gift

128
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,250
for you all.

129
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:00,420
Zheng.

130
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,250
Bring me the gift.

131
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,220
Mr. Ning.

132
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,370
This is my gift to you.

133
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,060
(Spirit Tablet of
the Deceased Daughter Nie Sangyu)

134
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:38,730
Your Majesty.

135
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,580
When I first arrived at Haifang,

136
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:42,290
I found that Mrs. Ning

137
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,290
was very different from before.

138
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,900
I was worried that

139
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,290
someone would pretend to be

140
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:48,020
the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate,

141
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,660
so I secretly sent someone

142
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:50,930
to search for clues.

143
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,780
As expected,

144
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,540
after following General Nie,
I found the spirit tablet of Ning Sangyu,

145
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:57,900
the first wife of Consul Ning,

146
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,780
in a temple.

147
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:10,220
Consul Ling.

148
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:12,780
Pretending to be the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate

149
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:14,490
is something serious.

150
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:15,980
Don't talk nonsense

151
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,720
without evidence.

152
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:22,050
Your Majesty.

153
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,460
As the daughter of a general

154
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:24,460
who has always lived in the boudoir,

155
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,860
she doesn't speak or talk

156
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,780
like a young rich lady,

157
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:29,980
but she also has a deep understanding

158
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:30,930
of the common people.

159
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,130
It's really suspicious.

160
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:34,770
Your Majesty.

161
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:37,650
To prove whether it's true,

162
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,890
please send someone to
search the Ning's Mansion.

163
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:42,220
More evidence will surely be found.

164
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
General Nie.

165
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,860
Consul Ning.

166
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:46,650
Do you two

167
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:48,700
have something to say?

168
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,100
Your Majesty.

169
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,180
This matter is complicated.

170
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:55,890
Please let me

171
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,650
tell you in detail.

172
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,220
So

173
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,460
what Consul Ling said

174
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:05,490
is true?

175
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,010
Your Majesty, my wife...

176
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:07,860
Your Majesty.

177
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:11,180
This woman

178
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:14,410
is definitely not Nie Sangyu.

179
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:16,490
Nie Sangyu was good at painting,

180
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,370
but this woman

181
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:18,890
knew nothing about painting.

182
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,300
Nie Sangyu has studied regular script
all year round,

183
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,460
but her fonts

184
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,650
are lively and vigorous.

185
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,580
Nie Sangyu has a gloomy personality,

186
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,010
and the servants are quite afraid of her.

187
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,860
But after Banxia was left
with the plum blossom mark

188
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:31,860
by Nie Sangyu

189
00:09:32,060 --> 00:09:33,890
and deliberately set fire
to revenge on you,

190
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:36,130
you abolished the family rules
of the Ning's Mansion.

191
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:37,940
Isn't that true?

192
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,130
All signs indicate that

193
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,460
she's definitely not Nie Sangyu.

194
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,940
Qian Lianxue,

195
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:44,980
who lives in
the Magistrate's Residence,

196
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,370
can testify to the authenticity

197
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:46,980
of what I said.

198
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,220
Although I don't know

199
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,700
what crooked ways this woman used

200
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,530
to confuse everyone,

201
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:53,060
as long as the Court of Judicial Review

202
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,180
conducts a rigorous interrogation,

203
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:56,100
the truth will definitely be revealed.

204
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:02,130
Your Majesty.

205
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,490
I have known Nie Sangyu since childhood.

206
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,130
Based on what I know about her,

207
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,010
I can guarantee with my life that

208
00:10:11,010 --> 00:10:11,770
she is

209
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,820
definitely not Nie Sangyu.

210
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,820
I'll take this woman
to the Court of Judicial Review

211
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,980
and subject her to severe torture.

212
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,410
I will definitely find out the truth.

213
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,820
Guards.

214
00:10:30,010 --> 00:10:31,820
Take her to
the Court of Judicial Review

215
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:33,250
and subject her to severe torture.

216
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,890
Your Majesty, this...

217
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:36,300
I'm guilty.

218
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:38,980
Your Majesty.

219
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,530
I'm not

220
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,130
Nie Sangyu.

221
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:52,100
You...

222
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,250
But it has nothing to do

223
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,940
with Consul Ning,

224
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,980
my father

225
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,730
and everyone in Ning's Mansion.

226
00:10:56,010 --> 00:10:57,490
I should bear it alone.

227
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,250
Princess Ruyue.

228
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:11,250
You went out of your way to set the trap.

229
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,130
What?

230
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,530
Don't you dare to

231
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:15,820
admit your identity now?

232
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:19,130
You are not Princess Ruyue,

233
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:21,580
but Wen Wan

234
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:23,300
of Ning's Mansion,

235
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,530
right?

236
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:28,300
Wen Wan?

237
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,010
The concubine of Ning's Mansion?

238
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,300
But isn't she

239
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,770
already dead?

240
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:36,650
Princess Ruyue,

241
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,460
why do you know everything

242
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,820
about the Ning's Mansion?

243
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:41,370
I...

244
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,180
Your Majesty.

245
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:43,530
Don't be fooled

246
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,130
by this liar.

247
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,060
Obviously she's pretending
to be Nie Sangyu.

248
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,890
But instead she planted the blame

249
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:48,100
on Princess Ruyue.

250
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,130
Put her in jail

251
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,180
and subject her to severe torture.

252
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:51,610
Yes.

253
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:52,530
Stop!

254
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,180
Ling Jianxing!

255
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:55,250
Ning Yuxuan!

256
00:11:55,410 --> 00:11:56,370
How dare you!

257
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:58,860
Ning Yuxuan.

258
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,940
Let me ask you.

259
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,180
Is the dead Nie Sangyu

260
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,220
your wife?

261
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:05,340
Your Majesty.

262
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:07,860
Yes.

263
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:09,460
One more question.

264
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,180
Is Princess Ruyue

265
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:13,180
the concubine

266
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,060
of your mansion?

267
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,370
Yes.

268
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:22,770
Guards.

269
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,460
Here.

270
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,980
Take the two of them out

271
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,060
and flog them to death.

272
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:27,940
Yes.

273
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:29,940
Your Majesty.

274
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,180
Let me go.

275
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:34,300
Piss off.

276
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,340
Mr. Ling.

277
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,100
Let me go.

278
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,010
Mr. Ling.

279
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:38,220
Mr. Ling, save me.

280
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:40,770
Let me go.

281
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:43,180
So...

282
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:44,490
You lied to me.

283
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:45,820
You are Wen Wan!

284
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,220
You vicious woman!

285
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:48,410
When you rescued me

286
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:49,060
from the prison

287
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:50,940
and asked me to pretend
to be Princess Ruyue

288
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:52,650
to frame Ning Yuxuan,

289
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,410
you said that

290
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,490
you would definitely keep me safe.

291
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:55,300
Mr. Ling.

292
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,250
You vicious woman!

293
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,300
Don't slander me.

294
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,370
You pretend to be Princess Ruyue.

295
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:01,180
I see.

296
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,980
You must have teamed up
with Ning Yuxuan

297
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,370
to frame me.

298
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,060
No.

299
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:08,370
I don't want it.

300
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:09,980
I can't

301
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,100
go back to that place again.

302
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:12,820
I can't go back to that place

303
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,940
even if I die.

304
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:14,860
Ning Yuxuan.

305
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:15,490
Ning Yuxuan.

306
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,460
Could you save me?

307
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:20,770
Listen.

308
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,700
Listen. Listen.

309
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,650
Ning Yuxuan.

310
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,130
As long as you save me,

311
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,340
I will tell you

312
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,770
everything I have done

313
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:26,980
in detail, okay?

314
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:28,300
Just save me.

315
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:30,300
What a criminal.

316
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,890
How dare you listen to Ling Jianxing

317
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,100
and pretend to be my niece?

318
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:33,460
You!

319
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:34,340
You

320
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,340
played me around.

321
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,340
Lord Tan.

322
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:41,460
What you have done...

323
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,100
Take her away

324
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,180
and flog her to death.

325
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:43,980
- Yes.
- Yes.

326
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,250
Ling...

327
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,610
- Go.
- Mr. Ling!

328
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:50,060
Lord Tan!

329
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,650
Ning Yuxuan!

330
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:57,100
Save me!

331
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:01,700
Ling Jianxing

332
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,010
colluded with a criminal

333
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,820
and deceived the emperor,

334
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,610
which is an unpardonable crime.

335
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:09,890
Arrest Ling Jianxing as well.

336
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:10,730
Yes.

337
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:16,890
Hold on.

338
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,370
Your Majesty.

339
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:20,770
Your Majesty.

340
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,980
I am indeed guilty of deceiving

341
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:23,730
Your Majesty and Lord Tan.

342
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,940
But Ning Yuxuan
and this criminal woman

343
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,490
should also be executed.

344
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:29,530
Not only is she pretending
to be Nie Sangyu,

345
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,580
but she is also the daughter

346
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,530
of the court's criminal, Ji Ming
of the Tea Gang.

347
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:35,980
The two of them conspired
to obtain the title of

348
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,220
second-rank lady with imperial mandate.

349
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,580
Their intention is execrable.

350
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,100
What did you say?

351
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,410
The Tea Gang?

352
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:43,180
Your Majesty.

353
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:43,700
Your Majesty.

354
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,060
If you want

355
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,010
more evidence,

356
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,940
ask General Tao to
search the Magistrate's Residence.

357
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,610
There would be new evidence.

358
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,340
Your Majesty.

359
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:57,220
I would like to take up the assignment.

360
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,410
Please allow me

361
00:14:58,410 --> 00:14:59,730
to personally lead the search,

362
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:01,610
so that no one with evil intentions

363
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,180
will get in the way.

364
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,100
Okay.

365
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:07,370
You have to search carefully

366
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,010
and not play favouritism.

367
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:09,860
Understand?

368
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:10,770
Yes, sir.

369
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,860
The Imperial Supplier Contest

370
00:15:28,130 --> 00:15:30,060
ended up like this.

371
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:32,890
The whole country

372
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,060
will laugh at me.

373
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:37,650
Guards.

374
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,060
Detain Ling Jianxing and
this criminal woman

375
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,660
in the Magistrate's Residence's prison.

376
00:15:41,770 --> 00:15:42,550
Yes.

377
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,130
Go.

378
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,460
Step aside!

379
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,730
Sorry.

380
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,730
Protect yourself.

381
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,580
Your Majesty.

382
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,410
You promised me before...

383
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:48,180
Ning Yuxuan!

384
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:06,410
Ning Yuxuan,

385
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,410
come with me.

386
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:35,980
(Magistrate's Residence)

387
00:18:12,170 --> 00:18:13,100
Sir, nothing found.

388
00:18:18,410 --> 00:18:19,650
Sir, nothing found.

389
00:18:24,690 --> 00:18:25,780
Sir, nothing found.

390
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,210
Sir, look.

391
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,910
(Snow melted in the frontier, the soldiers
returned by horse are playing the Qiang flute.)

392
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,940
(Where is the plum blossom full of lovesickness?
It falls all over the mountain with the wind.)

393
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,970
Sir.

394
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:40,820
Here is the ironclad proof.

395
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,450
Look.

396
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:54,180
(Here proved, Ning Yuxuan and Ji Man)

397
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,860
Ji Man.

398
00:18:56,930 --> 00:18:58,610
Ning Yuxuan.

399
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:03,540
It's time to

400
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,780
pay off your debts.

401
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:14,060
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

402
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,100
Why haven't they come back yet?

403
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:20,970
We are so anxious waiting.

404
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,970
Why did the conferment banquet
take so long?

405
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,820
Isn't it just to announce the ranking?

406
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:25,540
Exactly.

407
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:25,860
I wonder

408
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,610
how Muxu is going.

409
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:28,130
It's announced.

410
00:19:28,130 --> 00:19:28,740
Muxu.

411
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,610
It's announced.

412
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:30,410
How is it?

413
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:30,970
Ruyue's trick

414
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:32,100
was exposed by Her Ladyship
on the spot.

415
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,020
Haoxue Cosmetics
won the championship.

416
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,690
Really?

417
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:39,210
- Great!
- Great!

418
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:41,580
We have to

419
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:42,370
celebrate it.

420
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:42,610
Yes.

421
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:43,100
We should

422
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:43,930
have a big meal.

423
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,890
Let's have a big meal to celebrate.

424
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:46,780
Gui Bai.

425
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:47,930
Gui Bai.

426
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,300
Why are you here alone?

427
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,340
- Exactly, where is Her Ladyship?
- Where are they?

428
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,300
Something happened

429
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,690
to Her Ladyship.

430
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:55,930
What happened?

431
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:56,580
What?

432
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:57,610
After the result was announced,

433
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,540
His Lordship dismantled Ruyue's identity,

434
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,060
and Her Ladyship's identity

435
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,300
was also exposed by Ling Jianxing.

436
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,820
His Majesty ordered someone
to send her back to the residence,

437
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,860
where she's temporarily imprisoned.

438
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,820
Is she in custody?

439
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,610
What about my cousin?

440
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,740
Did he go to save her?

441
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,650
- Right.
- Did he?

442
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:13,170
His Lordship has his own arrangements.

443
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:14,540
With him around,

444
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,780
it is impossible for anyone
to hurt Her Ladyship.

445
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,820
- This...
- So

446
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,020
you don't have to worry about this.

447
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:22,340
Well...

448
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:24,300
Well...

449
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,370
How could she be imprisoned?

450
00:20:28,650 --> 00:20:29,820
What to do?

451
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,580
I was ordered to search
the Magistrate's Residence,

452
00:20:36,650 --> 00:20:37,580
and found these things

453
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,930
in the rooms of Ning Yuxuan

454
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,860
and Nie Sangyu respectively.

455
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:42,450
This is the regular script

456
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,930
written by Nie Sangyu

457
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:45,020
when she was in school
many years ago.

458
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,060
Your Majesty, please take a look.

459
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:47,930
The verses in this painting

460
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,500
are exactly the same
as that in this regular script,

461
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,500
but the handwriting

462
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,148
(Snow melted in the frontier,)
is completely different.

463
00:20:52,148 --> 00:20:52,780
(and the soldiers returned by horse.)
is completely different.

464
00:20:57,650 --> 00:20:58,300
Mr. Ning.

465
00:20:58,780 --> 00:21:00,690
Is there anything hidden in this?

466
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:02,580
How could

467
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,650
she be Nie Sangyu?

468
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:06,740
If not,

469
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,780
where is

470
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
the real Nie Sangyu?

471
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,100
Your Majesty.

472
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,450
What else did you find?

473
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,300
Your Majesty.

474
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,410
In addition,

475
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,170
I also found a marriage contract.

476
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:32,140
(Marriage Contract)

477
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,940
(Here proved, Ning Yuxuan and Ji Man)

478
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:41,610
Ning Yuxuan.

479
00:21:42,690 --> 00:21:44,260
Ji Man.

480
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,100
Alright.

481
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:00,690
Leave us

482
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:01,820
alone.

483
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,340
Yes, sir.

484
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,970
Ning Yuxuan.

485
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,500
Is there anything else

486
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,580
you want to tell me?

487
00:22:22,580 --> 00:22:23,340
Your Majesty.

488
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,020
She is

489
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,450
indeed not Nie Sangyu.

490
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:29,780
She is the daughter of Cai Wenzheng,

491
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:30,890
the chief of the Tea Gang.

492
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,860
What?

493
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,610
She's really the daughter
of Cai Wenzheng?

494
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:36,260
I had planned to
report to you personally

495
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,500
after returning to the capital.

496
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:38,450
I didn't expect others

497
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,340
to be one step ahead.

498
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:46,170
That's why

499
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,020
you asked me

500
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:48,740
for a reward earlier?

501
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,260
After you arrived at Haifang,

502
00:22:56,450 --> 00:22:57,410
you not only managed it

503
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,890
in an orderly manner,

504
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,650
but also established
the Shipping Department,

505
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,260
setting an example

506
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,450
for the imperial court to rectify taxes.

507
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,130
You also solved

508
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,300
my biggest trouble.

509
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:10,820
I

510
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:12,820
did choose the right person.

511
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,020
Thank you, Your Majesty,
for your compliment.

512
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,300
Just get to

513
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:22,740
the point.

514
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,210
I want to ask for a reward

515
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,020
for my wife.

516
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,340
Ask for a reward?

517
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,300
Ning Yuxuan.

518
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,780
It's not like something you would do.

519
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:40,020
My wife is reckless by nature.

520
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,100
I'm afraid that

521
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,170
she will make a big mistake

522
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:45,300
in the future.

523
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:46,930
So...

524
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:49,690
Do you think your wife is reckless?

525
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,300
But I think she understands

526
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,100
the common people very well.

527
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:54,540
I found that

528
00:23:54,690 --> 00:23:56,100
after you came to Haifang,

529
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,610
you've become much more cheerful

530
00:23:57,610 --> 00:23:58,690
than before.

531
00:23:59,300 --> 00:23:59,780
Okay.

532
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,690
I promise you.

533
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,690
If your wife

534
00:24:03,690 --> 00:24:05,020
makes any mistakes

535
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,340
in the future,

536
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,410
I will do my best

537
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,100
to keep her safe

538
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:11,540
under the premise of being fair,

539
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:13,130
how about it?

540
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:15,130
Thank you, Your Majesty.

541
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:20,860
I'm guilty

542
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:22,540
and you can punish me at will.

543
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:23,970
But please keep your words

544
00:24:23,970 --> 00:24:25,210
and don't blame Ji Man.

545
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,500
What?

546
00:24:27,210 --> 00:24:28,260
Do you still have the guts

547
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,650
to bargain with me now?

548
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:31,610
I dare not.

549
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:33,740
All I did

550
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:36,060
was trying to keep my wife safe

551
00:24:37,210 --> 00:24:38,860
as a husband.

552
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,100
Besides, there's something else hidden

553
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,370
about the Tea Gang case back then.

554
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:52,780
(Three days later)

555
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:59,780
(Haifang)

556
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,210
What happened?

557
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:25,020
Your Highness, someone is
blocking the way.

558
00:25:29,650 --> 00:25:30,500
Yuan Lang.

559
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,100
Why are you in my way?

560
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,740
Lord Tan, you know me.

561
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:37,780
Please get off the carriage.

562
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,890
You are just a vulgar person.

563
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,970
What qualifications do you have
to talk to me?

564
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,370
Get out of the way.

565
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,970
Don't you think I'm qualified?

566
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,890
Step back.

567
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,410
What do you want to do?

568
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,210
Lord Tan.

569
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,300
I have already checked out

570
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,820
what happened back then.

571
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,450
It was you who found someone

572
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:38,970
to send false news to my father

573
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,860
to deliberately sow discord,

574
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,690
causing the tragic death
of the two of them.

575
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,930
I don't understand
what you are talking about.

576
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:52,210
You took advantage of my father's

577
00:26:52,210 --> 00:26:53,500
reluctance to submit

578
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,100
to deliberately deceive him,

579
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:57,020
saying that you would give
the Tea Gang a new path.

580
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,690
That's why my father
readily believed you

581
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:00,300
and pretended to be Cai Wenzheng

582
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,890
to meet Ning Zhongtian.

583
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,610
As soon as Ning Zhongtian
arrived at the scene,

584
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,410
you set fire

585
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,100
to burn Ning Zhongtian

586
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,650
and my father to death.

587
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:09,970
Yes

588
00:27:10,930 --> 00:27:11,970
or no?

589
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,300
Don't slander me.

590
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:16,610
I have with me

591
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:18,020
the secret letter
you wrote to my father.

592
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:21,540
Why do you still refuse to admit?

593
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,860
Do you think these letters

594
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,020
were burned?

595
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:33,410
Thank goodness.

596
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,170
The letters were preserved.

597
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,970
No way.

598
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,260
I saw these letters burnt

599
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,970
with my own eyes.

600
00:27:49,130 --> 00:27:50,260
So you did

601
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,740
write secret letters to my father?

602
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,610
You are cheating me.

603
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,820
These letters are all fake.

604
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:59,020
Fake...

605
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Most of them are fake.

606
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:04,450
But I didn't

607
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,930
lie to you.

608
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,740
One of the letters

609
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,540
was with my father.

610
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,860
And my father

611
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:17,170
was the only survivor

612
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:18,580
of the fire.

613
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:23,650
Right.

614
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,780
I was the one who planned

615
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,210
to eliminate the Tea Gang back then.

616
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,580
But so what?

617
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:38,370
You want to take me away?

618
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:40,300
So naive.

619
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,260
I'm going to make you

620
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,060
disappear with these letters.

621
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:45,890
All of you!

622
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,540
Take this traitor down.

623
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,650
Stop!

624
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:05,260
Who is the traitor

625
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,340
will soon be determined.

626
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:12,020
Lord Tan.

627
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,100
Why did you

628
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:17,170
ask me here today?

629
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,860
Under the circumstances,

630
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:22,060
what's your plan?

631
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:26,500
Maybe that sounds like

632
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,340
sophistry to you.

633
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:29,450
But I have inner thoughts

634
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,580
to tell you.

635
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,060
I am not reconciled to the fact that

636
00:29:35,060 --> 00:29:35,580
you all conclude

637
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
my father did everything

638
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:37,210
based on

639
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,580
Ling Jianxing's statement

640
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,370
and my father's reaction.

641
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:43,500
And I don't believe it.

642
00:29:44,210 --> 00:29:45,170
I have to

643
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:47,170
find out the truth.

644
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,610
I didn't expect that

645
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,100
one day the two of us

646
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,690
would be on the same side.

647
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,020
What do you mean?

648
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,780
Have you ever thought that

649
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:03,820
your father must have

650
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,340
done those things in secret
back then,

651
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:07,890
but how did Ling Jianxing

652
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:08,370
know it so clearly

653
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:09,860
after so many years?

654
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,610
The only possibility is that he

655
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,450
or someone close to him

656
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:17,970
was in the game.

657
00:30:20,820 --> 00:30:21,610
Right.

658
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:24,210
I've been having someone check it out.

659
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:24,970
When your father

660
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:26,170
confiscated the Tea Gang,

661
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:28,410
Lord Tan

662
00:30:33,370 --> 00:30:35,300
seemed to be sick for a few days
and didn't go to court.

663
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,610
For Lord Tan,

664
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,580
if the Tea Gang became

665
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,820
a chivalrous organization,

666
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,020
it would be

667
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,500
a threat instead.

668
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:52,340
Your father Ning Zhongtian

669
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:54,820
was a strong enemy of Lord Tan.

670
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,370
My father and the Tea Gang

671
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,580
were wiped out overnight.

672
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,740
No one would benefit
more than Lord Tan.

673
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:09,210
But with that said,

674
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,540
we have no solid evidence to prove

675
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,130
that Lord Tan was involved in this matter.

676
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,650
Have you ever thought about

677
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:19,780
how Lord Tan

678
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,060
got in touch with your father

679
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,540
without leaving the capital

680
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,740
all these years?

681
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,540
But after so many years,

682
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,020
I'm not sure

683
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,610
if there are any secret letters left.

684
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,890
But as long as there is
still a glimmer of hope,

685
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:49,650
I will never give up.

686
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,300
Mr. Ning.

687
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:55,610
Do you have any countermeasure?

688
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,650
Do not alarm the enemy

689
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,260
until you find the letter.

690
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,500
Mr. Ning.

691
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,170
Thank you so much.

692
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,540
Besides, there's something else hidden

693
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:16,890
about the Tea Gang case back then.

694
00:32:17,650 --> 00:32:18,610
20 years ago,

695
00:32:19,210 --> 00:32:20,740
my father Ning Zhongtian was ordered

696
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:21,970
to subdue the Tea Gang.

697
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:23,820
It was Lord Tan who
added fuel to the fire behind

698
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:25,130
and sabotaged the peace talks.

699
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,370
Your Majesty, please check it out.

700
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:34,500
So what proof

701
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,170
do you have now?

702
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:36,740
I already have

703
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:37,820
secret letters from Lord Tan.

704
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,970
I guess

705
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,210
after today,

706
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,410
Lord Tan will definitely kill Ling Jianxing.

707
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:45,300
I have sent Gui Bai to protect him.

708
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,930
If I can get the testimony of Ling Jianxing,

709
00:32:48,860 --> 00:32:50,020
I am confident that

710
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,300
I'll wipe out Lord Tan's adherents.

711
00:33:10,890 --> 00:33:11,890
This case

712
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:14,020
will be your sole responsibility.

713
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:16,690
In view of Lord Tan's special status,

714
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,130
if there is any disobedience,

715
00:33:19,690 --> 00:33:21,140
he can be summarily executed.

716
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,180
(Token)

717
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

718
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:32,780
So the two of you

719
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,540
have been in collusion for a long time.

720
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,690
How can it be called in collusion?

721
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,300
You colluded with the Dragon Gang

722
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,340
and joined forces with Wang Jinyao

723
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,740
to control the Sea Trade Guild.

724
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,540
There is ironclad evidence

725
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:45,060
for everything you did.

726
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,100
Ning Yuxuan.

727
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:48,780
Don't frame me

728
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:51,170
just because of His Majesty's favor.

729
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,860
According to

730
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,690
His Majesty's verbal instructions,

731
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,650
(Token)
if Lord Tan refuses to cooperate,

732
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,020
those who disobey the order

733
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:00,260
will be executed.

734
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:07,610
Lord Tan.

735
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,740
Please.

736
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:17,340
Good for you, Ning Yuxuan.

737
00:34:19,930 --> 00:34:20,860
Let's cast accounts

738
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:21,860
in front of His Majesty.

739
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:04,260
Mr. Ning.

740
00:35:05,490 --> 00:35:06,410
Thank you

741
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:07,660
for today.

742
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,410
You are welcome.

743
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,090
His Majesty already knew

744
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:10,970
the grievances of the Tea Gang.

745
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,530
After Lord Tan is convicted,

746
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,970
His Majesty
will vindicate the Tea Gang.

747
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:20,140
My dream

748
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:21,410
has always been to

749
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,860
promote good and eliminate evil

750
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,300
together with those of the Tea Gang,

751
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,450
and do more things that

752
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,410
benefit the common people.

753
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:29,660
Back then, when Cai Wenzheng

754
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,860
yielded to the court,

755
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,340
the late emperor

756
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,220
promised him a position.

757
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,180
If you have the intention,

758
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,410
I will bring it up to His Majesty.

759
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:41,970
I'm used to being free.

760
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,620
Thank you

761
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:44,620
for your kindness.

762
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:49,660
The safety of Haifang in the future

763
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,490
is up to you.

764
00:35:58,530 --> 00:35:59,340
That's what I should do.

765
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:02,570
I am leaving.

766
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,180
Mr. Yuan.

767
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,860
See you.

768
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:19,890
Ning Yuxuan.

769
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,370
If you dare to bully Man,

770
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:31,860
I won't let you go.

771
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,090
Take care.

772
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:37,180
Take care.

773
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,500
(Haifang Prison)

774
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,050
Your Highness, time to eat.

775
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,570
Take the crap away.

776
00:37:17,930 --> 00:37:19,180
I want to see His Majesty.

777
00:37:22,050 --> 00:37:23,140
Did you hear me?

778
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:25,780
I am Lord Tan.

779
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:27,340
I want to see His Majesty.

780
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,570
Here comes His Majesty.

781
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:05,820
Greetings to

782
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,490
Your Majesty.

783
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,340
Uncle.

784
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:14,820
Hope that you are well.

785
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:16,700
Please get up.

786
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,220
Thank you, Your Majesty.

787
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:22,570
Your Majesty.

788
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:24,370
Ning Yuxuan colluded
with the rebel party

789
00:38:24,370 --> 00:38:25,780
and intended to frame me.

790
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:27,820
Please uphold justice

791
00:38:28,090 --> 00:38:29,220
for me.

792
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:32,890
Ning Yuxuan.

793
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,450
Is everything my uncle said true?

794
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:37,140
Your Majesty.

795
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,530
Over the years,

796
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:39,780
Lord Tan has been forming cliques
for private gain

797
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:40,740
and persecuting the faithful and honest.

798
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,010
Every word is true.

799
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,890
Please check it out.

800
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:47,180
What evidence do you have?

801
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,220
Lord Tan.

802
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,780
Do you remember

803
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:55,860
this letter?

804
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,220
If Cai Wenzheng submits
to the imperial court,

805
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:06,890
he won't be put in an important position.

806
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:08,490
I know you don't want
to surrender either.

807
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:10,620
If you are willing to
stop it with me,

808
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,490
after the deed is done,

809
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,780
I will help the Tea Gang prosper

810
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:15,970
and give your men a good life.

811
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:19,490
Your Majesty, please take a look.

812
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:29,300
Uncle.

813
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,050
The handwriting matches yours.

814
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:33,890
Do you have anything else to say?

815
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,860
Your Majesty.

816
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,740
I have never written this letter,

817
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:41,860
nor have I been in touch

818
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,780
with the Tea Gang.

819
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:43,970
Ning Yuxuan.

820
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:45,930
Don't think that

821
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:47,370
a random forged letter

822
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:48,570
can be used as evidence.

823
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:49,740
You know better than anyone else

824
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,340
whether it's forged or not.

825
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,370
How can you prove it?

826
00:39:52,570 --> 00:39:53,450
Ning Yuxuan.

827
00:39:54,970 --> 00:39:56,620
What Uncle said makes sense.

828
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,660
Letters can indeed be forged.

829
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,090
Do you have any other evidence?

830
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,220
Your Majesty.

831
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:10,050
In addition to physical evidence,

832
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:13,050
I also have testimony of a witness.

833
00:40:14,490 --> 00:40:15,090
Good.

834
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,370
Bring the witness here.

835
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:37,970
Greetings to Your Majesty.

836
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,090
Get up.

837
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,860
Thank you, Your Majesty.

838
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,490
Lord Tan.

839
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:10,050
Why are you so surprised?

840
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:16,780
Did Lord Tan send you

841
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,410
to rescue me?

842
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:17,820
Yes.

843
00:41:18,010 --> 00:41:19,260
Lord Tan sent me here.

844
00:41:19,410 --> 00:41:20,180
I know that

845
00:41:20,450 --> 00:41:21,620
he didn't give up on me.

846
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,090
What are you doing?

847
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,010
Let me out.

848
00:41:24,050 --> 00:41:25,490
