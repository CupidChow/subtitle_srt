00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 38=

3
00:01:51,290 --> 00:01:52,010
Mr. Ji.

4
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:53,780
Go back to have a rest.

5
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,290
Take care of yourself.

6
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,540
Man's life is uncertain.

7
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,540
I am so worried.

8
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,500
Mr. Ji.

9
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,980
Our people are always searching.

10
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,650
They will report

11
00:02:03,650 --> 00:02:04,860
as soon as there is news.

12
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,290
Yes.

13
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,900
We went to
Magistrate's Residence yesterday.

14
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,500
His Lordship said that

15
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,890
he had been sending people to search,

16
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:10,540
and he would definitely find her.

17
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,730
I have to find her

18
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:17,570
whether she's alive or dead.

19
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:20,100
Why is she missing?

20
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:22,290
Her Ladyship is lucky.

21
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,730
She must have survived.

22
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:24,330
- Right?
- Yes.

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,260
Right.

24
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:26,010
Dad.

25
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:28,540
- My Lady!
- Your Ladyship!

26
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,100
My Lady, you are back!

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:30,570
Man.

28
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,290
You are back.

29
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:31,770
Man.

30
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,420
Dad, I'm sorry to

31
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,420
keep you worrying.

32
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,260
Get up.

33
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:35,890
My Lady.

34
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:36,490
Man.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:37,860
Where have you been?

36
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,050
Why are you hurt like this?

37
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:40,450
Dad.

38
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:41,220
Don't worry.

39
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:41,980
I am fine.

40
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,610
Okay, thankfully you are back.

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,420
Come on.

42
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,220
Take a seat.

43
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,450
Take a seat, My Lady.

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,890
It's good that you are back.

45
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:49,700
Man.

46
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,820
I've been worrying about you

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,420
all these days.

48
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,980
Ning Yuxuan

49
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,140
sent people to look for you every day.

50
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:03,260
It's good that you are back.

51
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
I heard that

52
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,490
His Majesty ordered him

53
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,860
to go to the capital immediately

54
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,940
to assume the position of Prime Minister.

55
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,170
Man.

56
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,420
You are just back.

57
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,260
Go to him

58
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,490
after recuperating.

59
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,260
Sang Shen, Muxu.

60
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,940
Go.

61
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:24,730
Tell Mr. Ning

62
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:25,700
that

63
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,420
Man is back safely.

64
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:28,050
Okay.

65
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:28,890
No need.

66
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,420
Dad.

67
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,570
Don't tell Ning Yuxuan

68
00:03:31,570 --> 00:03:32,730
about my return.

69
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
Why?

70
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,820
Someone exposed my identity in public

71
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,700
during the Imperial Supplier Contest
earlier.

72
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,170
The fact that I replaced Mrs. Ning

73
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,770
is now known to all.

74
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,730
He'll soon be

75
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,010
the prime minister.

76
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:46,700
There must be many people

77
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,660
keeping an eye on him

78
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,290
in the capital.

79
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,330
So if he gets involved with me
at this moment,

80
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,890
it will definitely be detrimental to him

81
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:54,100
and put him in danger.

82
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:56,570
The so-called background

83
00:03:56,890 --> 00:03:58,490
is all nonsense.

84
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:01,010
Man, as long as you've figured it out,

85
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,330
I will take you away.

86
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,660
I will support you all my life.

87
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,220
Dad.

88
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:18,780
I know that

89
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,050
no matter where I go,

90
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,580
you are always

91
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,540
my most solid backing.

92
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,100
But

93
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,900
I have to grow up.

94
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,730
I can't be under your protection
all the time.

95
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:33,290
So

96
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,250
I'd like to make a career.

97
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,170
Are you leaving me?

98
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:40,020
I've thought about it.

99
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:40,690
I will

100
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,580
go to Yunzhou to find
some business opportunities first,

101
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,780
and then see if there is any chance

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,370
to do something

103
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:45,580
to benefit the common people.

104
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,540
My Lady, I will go with you.

105
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,290
I will never leave you again.

106
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,130
I am also going.

107
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,540
But what about Haoxue Cosmetics

108
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,100
after we leave?

109
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,610
My Lady.

110
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:05,900
With my current status,

111
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:07,130
my return to Haoxue Cosmetics

112
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,660
will cause trouble for everyone.

113
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,730
So

114
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,860
in the next few days,

115
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,340
you should sort out the list of suppliers

116
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:16,460
and the turnover funds,

117
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,660
then hand them over to Miss Shui.

118
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,730
With her there,

119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,860
I believe that Haoxue Cosmetics

120
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,340
will continue to thrive.

121
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,660
Okay.

122
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:26,610
Don't tell her about

123
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:27,810
my return for now.

124
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,130
I don't want to

125
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,660
make things difficult for her.

126
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,810
Man.

127
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,730
You are leaving me again.

128
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,340
Dad.

129
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,420
I promise you that

130
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,980
I will be your pride

131
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:55,860
when I come back.

132
00:05:58,490 --> 00:05:59,130
Man.

133
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,780
You have always been my pride.

134
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:43,580
(Ning's Mansion, Capital)

135
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:49,370

136
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:50,900
(Haifang has entered autumn.)

00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:52,810
(Foreign merchant ships came
in an endless stream.)

Your Lordship's entrustment.)

00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,610
(to search for Her Ladyship,)

142
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:02,420

Mr. Prime Minister.

161
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,100
Here comes this month's letter
from Haifang.

162
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,250
An urgent one.

163
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,300
I didn't dare to delay,

164
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:29,580
(To Your Lordship)
and brought it to you as soon as it arrived.

165
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:30,940
Letters are sent from Haifang

166
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,730
every month.

167
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,820
Hope this news

168
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,250
is what you want.

169
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:35,340
(Your Lordship.)

170
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:37,610
(Times are tough and
the people are suffering.)

171
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,130
(Due to the inundation in Haifang,
grain and rice are cut off.)

172
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,300
(The waves of the sea cut off
the possibility of shipping.)

173
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,340
(The dead bodies of the starved
are everywhere.)

174
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,580
(My wife and I can't sleep at night.)

175
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,860
(So I ask you for help
to save people's lives.)

176
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:48,700
(Yours faithfully, Gui Bai.)

177
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,010
Let's set off

178
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:52,060
for Haifang tomorrow.

179
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,460
Sir, you have a lot of work
in the capital.

180
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,940
And it's a long way to Haifang.

181
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,410
Do you really have time?

182
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,460
Set off tomorrow.

183
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:00,940
Yes, I will be on it.

184
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,460
(Ji Man.)

185
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:08,890
(Haifang is full of our memories.)

186
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:11,770
(Because of this,)

187
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,940
(I have been afraid to go there
even once)

188
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,180
(in the past year.)

189
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,300
(But now Haifang is in trouble.)

190
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
(It's where we put)

191
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,580
(all our hard work.)

192
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,460
(Due to the inundation in Haifang,
grain and rice are cut off.)

193
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,300
(I absolutely cannot watch people)

194
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,940
(get into trouble.)

195
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:27,100
(In view of the public
and personal concerns,)

196
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,610
(I have to go to Haifang)

197
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:30,370
(to protect the city.)

198
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:50,420
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

199
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:30,490
Apply it like this.

200
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:31,770
Once every morning and evening.

201
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,580
I'll pack it for you.

202
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,890
Take a try.

203
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:36,220
This is our new product.

204
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,010
I'd also like to try.

205
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,610
Here, take it.

206
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Apply it every day.

207
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,860
And it will work well.

208
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,610
I'll pack it for you.

209
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,530
Done.

210
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,530
Gui Bai. Gui Bai.

211
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:12,860
Your Lordship.

212
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:13,890
Your Lordship.

213
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,250
Sir.

214
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,250
Gui Bai.

215
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,130
You can try all these.

216
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,220
It really smells good.

217
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:25,980
Smells good.

218
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:28,730
Now I understand that

219
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,920
the scene evokes memories of the past.

220
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:31,980
Your Lordship, it must be hard for you.

221
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:36,980
How are you doing?

222
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:38,650
Pretty good.

223
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,370
By the way,

224
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,060
tell me about the food.

225
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:42,820
It just so happens that

226
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:44,340
your old acquaintance is also here.

227
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,300
Mr. Ning.

228
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:50,300
Mr. Yuan.

229
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,300
Long time no see.

230
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,410
This is the old acquaintance
I mentioned.

231
00:12:54,770 --> 00:12:55,300
Your Lordship.

232
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:56,530
Chief Yuan was just now

233
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,250
discussing with us

234
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:57,860
about grain transportation.

235
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,940
Thanks to the conscientious help

236
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,220
of the Dragon Gang

237
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,250
for this disaster.

238
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,060
Thank you so much.

239
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,610
What is the situation of the victims

240
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,940
in this disaster?

241
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:07,700
Things are looking blue.

242
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:10,730
Let's sit down and talk.

243
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,180
Okay.

244
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:15,730
Now that Mr. Ning is here,

245
00:13:15,730 --> 00:13:16,490
let's hurry up

246
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,410
to find a way

247
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,980
to solve the problem

248
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,060
for the people of Haifang.

249
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,220
I have informed His Majesty

250
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,220
of this matter

251
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,940
before setting off.

252
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,860
The government's
disaster relief funds and food

253
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:26,010
should arrive in a few days.

254
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,490
We cannot wait any longer.

255
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:28,980
There are already

256
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,060
many hungry people.

257
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:30,860
If the food problem for these few days

258
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
is not resolved,

259
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,060
some people may...

260
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,100
May starve to death.

261
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,340
Your Lordship, you have no idea.

262
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,100
After the flood in Haifang this time,

263
00:13:39,380 --> 00:13:40,690
the grain output isn't enough at all.

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,220
But the storm at sea continued,

265
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,220
and ships outside

266
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:44,490
couldn't enter at all.

267
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:45,770
We can only rely on land transportation.

268
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,610
I have some taels with me.

269
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:49,610
Shall we buy food

270
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:50,340
from surrounding towns?

271
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:51,730
The Dragon Gang takes root
in the marketplace.

272
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:52,770
I have sent my men

273
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,820
to scout around.

274
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:55,460
But the disaster is widespread.

275
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:56,490
Even if you have money,

276
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,220
it is hard to buy enough food.

277
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,890
Make arrangements like this first.

278
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:10,010
Now we can only

279
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,460
do our best.

280
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,730
It occurred to me that

281
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:21,100
half a month ago

282
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,100
I received a letter

283
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,410
from Ma Hongzhu,

284
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:25,370
the owner of Ma's Firm.

285
00:14:25,610 --> 00:14:27,010
He said he was willing to help Haifang

286
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,820
and send food for free,

287
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,010
and that he's on the way.

288
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,220
Ma's Firm?

289
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,730
Yes.

290
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,610
I heard that Ma's Firm

291
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:34,100
is a firm raised in Hengdu,

292
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,100
specializing in grain, rice and noodles.

293
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:37,940
Boss Ma

294
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,530
is warm-hearted.

295
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,100
Hengdu is some distance away
from Haifang.

296
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,460
But he should

297
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:43,770
be near Haifang

298
00:14:43,770 --> 00:14:44,940
these days.

299
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,340
I'll send my men on guard
outside the city

300
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,490
and ask them

301
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,770
to escort them into town.

302
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:51,340
Make sure that this batch of grain

303
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,890
can enter Haifang smoothly.

304
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,770
Someone is coming.

305
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:22,820
Please show mercy.

306
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,180
Give us some food.

307
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,580
Give us some food.

308
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,130
Please show mercy.

309
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:29,770
Please show mercy.

310
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,770
Give us some food.

311
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,250
Please show mercy.

312
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,820
Give us some food.

313
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:38,980
Please show mercy.

314
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,980
Stop.

315
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,730
Stop.

316
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:43,980
(Ma's Firm)
Please show mercy.

317
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:46,130
Give us some food.

318
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,340
Please show mercy, good man.

319
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,940
Please show mercy
and give us some food.

320
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:50,940
Please show mercy.

321
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,940
Please show mercy
and give us some food.

322
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:55,610
Boss Ma, what's the matter?

323
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,410
What's wrong, Boss Ma?

324
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,370
Get them some food.

325
00:15:59,490 --> 00:15:59,980
Okay.

326
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,580
- Go.
- Okay.

327
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,130
Okay.

328
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:05,580
Here.

329
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:06,370
Thank you.

330
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:06,980
Thank you.

331
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:07,340
Here.

332
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,060
Here.

333
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:08,980
Thank you, you are so kind.

334
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,300
Here.

335
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:11,370
One by one. Take it.

336
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,490
- Thank you.
- Yours.

337
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:13,220
Here.

338
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:13,820
Thank you.

339
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:15,010
- Here.
- Here.

340
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:15,940
No worries.

341
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,530
Take it.

342
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:18,460
Everyone can get it.

343
00:16:18,530 --> 00:16:19,250
Take your time.

344
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,580
Take your time.

345
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,370
Thank you.

346
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:21,820
Take your time.

347
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,250
Here you are.

348
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,460
Take your time.

349
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:26,940
Here, take it.

350
00:16:27,650 --> 00:16:28,370
Take your time.

351
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,010
Everyone can get it.

352
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,300
Here.

353
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:31,940
Here.

354
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:35,610
Take some water.

355
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:39,250
Take your time.

356
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,650
Thank you.

357
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,130
We haven't eaten for three days.

358
00:16:56,460 --> 00:16:58,010
Thank you for your food.

359
00:16:58,650 --> 00:16:59,610
Thank you.

360
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,340
Eat it.

361
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,410
With you here,

362
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,450
Haifang will be saved.

363
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:06,130
You are our benefactor.

364
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,500
Thank you.

365
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,410
There is more.

366
00:17:21,650 --> 00:17:22,690
Be careful of choking.

367
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,580
Here.

368
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:27,450
Boss Ma.

369
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,450
The rations were all distributed.

370
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,370
Ahead is Haifang.

371
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:34,780
It's been a year.

372
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,540
I didn't expect it

373
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,690
to look like this now.

374
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,020
Chief.

375
00:17:57,860 --> 00:17:58,820
Many cases of food robbery and wounding

376
00:17:58,820 --> 00:17:59,820
occurred outside the city.

377
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:01,300
Some even robbed the victims

378
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,370
of the last remaining food.

379
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:04,890
What?

380
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,340
Robbery!

381
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,060
There are bandits.

382
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,500
Protect the food!

383
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,970
The robbers have all been subdued.

384
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:57,410
Boss Ma, don't panic.

385
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,100
Boss Ma?

386
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,650
Sir.

387
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,540
Boss Ma knew someone
was going to rob the carriages

388
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,210
and set up a trap.

389
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:35,100
These carriages

390
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,170
are designed to confuse the robbers.

391
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:37,540
The carts transporting grain

392
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:38,820
have already entered Haifang.

393
00:20:52,970 --> 00:20:53,370
Here.

394
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:54,690
Here you are.

395
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:55,300
Thank you.

396
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,410
Thank you.

397
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:57,450
Thank you.

398
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,340
Thank you.

399
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:58,930
Thank you.

400
00:20:58,930 --> 00:20:59,610
Be careful.

401
00:20:59,610 --> 00:21:00,450
Here.

402
00:21:00,450 --> 00:21:02,210
Thank you, sir.

403
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,450
You are so kind. Thank you.

404
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:05,930
Here.

405
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,130
Here you are.

406
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,210
Thank you.

407
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,100
Thank you.

408
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:12,300
Thank you.

409
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:15,690
Isn't this Mr. Ning?

410
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:16,780
Mrs. Yang.

411
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:18,690
Mrs. Zhou.

412
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,210
When Mrs. Ning

413
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:21,610
participated in
the Imperial Supplier Contest,

414
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,650
we helped make

415
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,610
Feiwan Face Cream together.

416
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,170
Yes.

417
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,370
I heard that you've been promoted
and returned to the capital,

418
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:27,890
and this time you are here
for disaster relief.

419
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,500
Is Mrs. Ning here?

420
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:31,500
Why bother to ask?

421
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,580
Of course she's here.

422
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:34,650
Mr. Ning and Mrs. Ning

423
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,650
are very deep in love.

424
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,130
We envy you

425
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,340
so much.

426
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,690
Yes.

427
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,410
- Indeed.
- We envy you so much.

428
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,100
Thank you.

429
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,340
Thank you.

430
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:44,860
Take care.

431
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:45,860
Put it here.

432
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,100
Everyone.

433
00:21:47,450 --> 00:21:48,060
Today, Ma Hongzhu,

434
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:50,130
the owner of Ma's Firm,

435
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,500
came to distribute food to everyone.

436
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,100
Those who haven't received food,

437
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:53,970
please come to our side.

438
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,410
Come here.

439
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:56,260
Here, open it.

440
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,100
What?

441
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,860
Ma Hongzhu?

442
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,060
What a strange name.

443
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:03,540
It should be Ma Hongzhu.

444
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:05,690
I heard that

445
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:07,820
- this rich man came from other places
- No worries.

446
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:10,300
- to provide disaster relief.
- Everyone can get it.

447
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,020
No worries, everyone can get it.

448
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:12,970
Never mind his name.

449
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,170
It's good to have food.

450
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:15,370
Boss Ma Hongzhu.

451
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,970
You are so kind.

452
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:17,890
Thank you, Boss Ma.

453
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,410
- Thank you, Boss Ma.
- Thank you, Boss Ma.

454
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,260
Thank you, Boss Ma.

455
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:21,820
Thank you, Boss Ma.

456
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,690
Here, everyone can get it.

457
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:23,210
Here.

458
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:23,740
Here.

459
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,650
Thank you.

460
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:25,970
Take it.

461
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:28,500
You gave me another life.

462
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,260
Here you are.

463
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:31,930
No worries.

464
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,020
Take it.

465
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,410
Thank you.

466
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:31,210
It's been a year.

467
00:23:33,340 --> 00:23:34,060
Yes.

468
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,580
It's been a year.

469
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,130
Are you all right?

470
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,130
Yes.

471
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:55,650
What about you?

472
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,260
I'm fine.

473
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,020
I had a lucky escape

474
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,260
after falling off the cliff.

475
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:14,540
Later

476
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,740
I went to my father.

477
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:20,260
In fact, I also went
to the Magistrate's Residence.

478
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,650
Sorry.

479
00:24:43,020 --> 00:24:44,930
I am the one who should apologize.

480
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,170
It's been a year.

481
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:52,860
I owe you an explanation.

482
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,130
In fact, back then His Majesty

483
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,260
went to see me in the prison.

484
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:03,740
And

485
00:25:04,890 --> 00:25:05,580
I knew long ago that

486
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,930
you would be the prime minister.

487
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,580
So...

488
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,930
So I had to leave.

489
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:22,970
Later, I told my father

490
00:25:22,970 --> 00:25:23,740
that

491
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:25,820
I had been living

492
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:27,370
under his protection

493
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,540
for so many years.

494
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:30,410
It was time for me

495
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:34,410
to make a living on my own.

496
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,690
Looking back now,

497
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,020
everything was worth it.

498
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,130
I have no regrets.

499
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:52,450
It seems that

500
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:54,370
you have had a really good year.

501
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,170
I changed my name, you know?

502
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:04,650
My name is Ma Hongzhu now.

503
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,130
I know.

504
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:09,970
Funny?

505
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:29,210
Ma Hongzhu.

506
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:50,650
Yes.

507
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,170
Ma Hongzhu.

508
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,820
It's just a name.

509
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,860
Why are you crying?

510
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:05,740
Why are you crying?

511
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,740
I am not crying.

512
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,340
It is more windy here than
in the capital.

513
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:32,610
Have a try.

514
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:34,690
Come on.

515
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,650
The sea wind is so strong.

516
00:28:04,370 --> 00:28:05,580
- Eunuch Cao.
- Eunuch Cao.

517
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,820
Your Majesty.

518
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,820
Your Majesty.

519
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:23,130
There is news from Haifang.

520
00:28:23,990 --> 00:28:25,740
Mr. Ning has distributed

521
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,060
all the relief funds.

522
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,850
The dilemma in Haifang was solved,

523
00:28:28,990 --> 00:28:30,460
and the common people were saved.

524
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,170
The news said that the storm in Haifang

525
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,510
will subside soon.

526
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:40,020
Ning Yuxuan recommended himself

527
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,060
to Haifang.

528
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,170
It seems that he really

529
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,500
cares about Haifang.

530
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,930
After all, Mr. Ning

531
00:28:46,930 --> 00:28:48,210
made great achievements in Haifang.

532
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:49,500
When Haifang is in trouble,

533
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,130
it is only natural for him
to be anxious.

534
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,860
One more thing.

535
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:57,130
Mr. Ning teamed up with

536
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,340
a businessman named Ma Hongzhu

537
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,210
for this disaster relief.

538
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:05,100
Ma Hongzhu?

539
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,100
This person is the owner of Ma's Firm,

540
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,610
and has gained a good reputation
among folks

541
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:12,890
for food business in the past year.

542
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:14,370
According to the informant,

543
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,690
Your Majesty

544
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,860
has met this person before.

545
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,130
It's Ji Man.

546
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,340
Ji Man?

547
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,060
It seems that Ning Yuxuan

548
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,650
gained a lot from this trip.

549
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:43,500
Pass on my will

550
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:47,210
to let both Ning Yuxuan and Ma Hongzhu
come to the capital.

551
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,930
I'm going to reward them

552
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,740
for their contributions in Haifang.

553
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:53,540
Yes.

554
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:15,020
Greetings to

555
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:16,860
Your Majesty.

556
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,610
I am relieved.

557
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:21,300
Any rewards you want?

558
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:23,580
This is what I should do.

559
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,130
I don't need any rewards.

560
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,690
I found that you have

561
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,740
lost a lot of weight recently.

562
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:31,020
You have been busy

563
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,410
this year,

564
00:30:32,610 --> 00:30:34,020
and no one in your mansion

565
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,130
can take care of you.

566
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,210
I'm used to it

567
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,690
and don't feel tired anymore.

568
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:42,930
You cannot

569
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,690
live in the past all the time.

570
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,540
Recently,

571
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:48,820
I found a well-conducted

572
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,060
folk woman

573
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,970
who does good everywhere,

574
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:53,500
and cares about the common people.

575
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:55,130
I think the two of you

576
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,370
are a perfect match.

577
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,170
I have given her the title

578
00:30:59,170 --> 00:31:00,650
of Lady Dehui.

579
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:01,890
I have decided

580
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:02,890
to grant a marriage

581
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,610
to you.

582
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:09,780
Your Majesty.

583
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,020
I

584
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,500
have no intention of getting married
at the moment.

585
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:15,260
What?

586
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,020
Do you really want to
live alone forever?

587
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:19,020
Your Majesty.

588
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:21,610
During my visit to Haifang this time,

589
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:22,860
I met a businesswoman

590
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,100
named Ma Hongzhu.

591
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,580
It was she who brought food to Haifang

592
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:27,210
and solved the food problem

593
00:31:27,210 --> 00:31:28,450
of the victims.

594
00:31:28,970 --> 00:31:29,740
And this businesswoman...

595
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:31,740
I know about this.

596
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,170
Ma Hongzhu

597
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,370
made great contributions
to disaster relief in Haifang.

598
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:37,930
I have passed down a decree

599
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,210
to reward her with
five hundred taels of silver.

600
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:45,210
Your Majesty, there is one thing
you don't know.

601
00:31:46,370 --> 00:31:47,500
This businesswoman

602
00:31:49,170 --> 00:31:50,740
is Ji Man who disappeared back then.

603
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:53,130
This time when Haifang was in trouble,

604
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:54,170
she went to help.

605
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,370
And I didn't expect to meet her.

606
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,890
It's her.

607
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:00,860
Yes.

608
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,500
So she's alive.

609
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:04,300
Yes.

610
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:07,370
So no matter how good

611
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:09,020
Lady Dehui is,

612
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,970
she is no match for Ji Man

613
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,210
in my heart.

614
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:16,740
I...

615
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:27,690
I don't want to marry anyone else.

616
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:29,860
Your Majesty, please recall the order.

617
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:32,610
Are you trying to defy me?

618
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:33,970
Your Majesty, if you want to punish me,

619
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,130
I have no complaints.

620
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,100
But please

621
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,260
don't blame Ji Man.

622
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,100
You've really

623
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,890
let me down.

624
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,650
You have to marry

625
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,370
Lady Dehui.

626
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,450
Go back yourself.

627
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,170
You are not allowed to go out

628
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:57,060
until your wedding.

629
00:33:00,170 --> 00:33:00,970
Go.

630
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:10,300
(Ning's Mansion)

631
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:26,650
Each bead here

632
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:27,890
represents 100 taels.

633
00:33:27,890 --> 00:33:28,650
The blue beads are yours.

634
00:33:28,650 --> 00:33:29,580
The red ones are mine.

635
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,410
Whoever does something nice

636
00:33:30,410 --> 00:33:31,740
for the other

637
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:32,690
will put a bead

638
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:33,500
into this box.

639
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:34,890
And whoever does
something wrong to the other

640
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:36,130
will take out a bead

641
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:36,860
from the box.

642
00:33:37,410 --> 00:33:38,170
So many.

643
00:33:38,170 --> 00:33:38,610
This is your reward

644
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:39,970
for saving my reputation.

645
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:41,890
I'll give you a blue bead.

646
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:43,410
Let me hug you.

647
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,210
(A red bead for you.)

648
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,860
(The two stars alternate)

649
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:56,170
(and never meet.)

650
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,100
(This is their destiny.)

651
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:07,210
Yuxuan.

652
00:34:08,010 --> 00:34:08,780
Your Lordship.

653
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,340
Ning.

654
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,370
Yuxuan.

655
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:12,370
Your Lordship.

656
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:14,450
Ning.

657
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,620
Yuxuan.

658
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,220
He's there.

659
00:34:18,010 --> 00:34:18,700
Take care.

660
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:22,180
Your Lordship.

661
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:22,700
Here.

662
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:23,370
Your Lordship.

663
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:27,660
Why are you here?

664
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:30,260
How could we be absent

665
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:32,050
from your wedding?

666
00:34:32,370 --> 00:34:33,090
Right.

667
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:37,570
You came just in time.

668
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:39,620
For the past few days,

669
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:40,700
I have been trapped in the mansion

670
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:41,340
and cannot get out.

671
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,530
Who could change clothes with me?

672
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,780
I'm not going to

673
00:34:53,890 --> 00:34:54,970
get married.

674
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:00,860
Your Lordship.

675
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:03,740
Are you going to give up your ambition

676
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,300
and career

677
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,820
because of this marriage?

678
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:09,490
Career?

679
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:14,780
Just let it go.

680
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:17,820
If His Majesty calls to account,

681
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,660
Ji Man will definitely be implicated.

682
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:21,780
Have you thought about it?

683
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:23,820
Your Lordship.

684
00:35:24,410 --> 00:35:25,820
Please set store by overall interests.

685
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:27,860
Yuxuan.

686
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:30,300
After all, it's a marriage bestowed
by His Majesty.

687
00:35:30,370 --> 00:35:30,970
We...

688
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:33,300
We can't help you

689
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:34,220
run away from it.

690
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,530
Do you really want me

691
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,660
to marry someone else?

692
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:42,260
Mr. Ning.

693
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,970
We have no choice.

694
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,740
Are you going to
defy the imperial edict?

695
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,530
I inquired about it.

696
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:48,970
I heard that Lady Dehui

697
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:49,700
is beautiful

698
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:51,010
and has done good deeds
in various places.

699
00:35:51,010 --> 00:35:52,050
She is highly valued by His Majesty.

700
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,300
That's why you were bestowed
a marriage.

701
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:54,180
Your Lordship.

702
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:55,930
Get changed.

703
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,300
We are running out of time.

704
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:58,370
Yes.

705
00:35:58,970 --> 00:35:59,780
Yuxuan.

706
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:00,620
Your Lordship.

707
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:04,090
I won't get changed.

708
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,180
And I'm not going to

709
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,570
get married.

710
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:20,890
Ning Yuxuan.

711
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:23,050
Are you sure you don't want
to marry me?

712
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:48,410
So no matter how good

713
00:36:48,890 --> 00:36:50,050
Lady Dehui is,

714
00:36:50,930 --> 00:36:51,970
she is no match for Ji Man

715
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,140
in my heart.

716
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:56,740
You have to marry

717
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,530
Lady Dehui.

718
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:01,660
Go back yourself.

719
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:04,370
You are not allowed to go out

720
00:37:05,090 --> 00:37:07,300
until your wedding.

721
00:37:10,410 --> 00:37:11,090
Go.

722
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:05,860
Your Majesty.

723
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,180
Did you hear

724
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,410
what he said just now?

725
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,410
Ning Yuxuan even defied me

726
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,300
for you.

727
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:16,140
Your Majesty.

728
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,300
For such a long time,

729
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,530
I have never

730
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,180
dared to forget

731
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:25,570
the promise I made to you before,

732
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:28,090
so that one day

733
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,970
I can justifiably

734
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:33,930
stand by his side.

735
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:42,700
Please allow me, Your Majesty.

736
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:46,970
I have allowed you

737
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:49,090
to do so.

738
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,490
Lady Dehui

739
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:54,010
is the title I conferred to you.

740
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:00,450
Thank you, Your Majesty.

741
00:39:00,530 --> 00:39:01,970
You didn't let me down.

742
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:03,370
So I

743
00:39:03,740 --> 00:39:04,970
have a big surprise

744
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:06,740
for you two.

745
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,570
What?

746
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,820
You don't want to marry me?

747
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,260
You are not touched

748
00:40:01,010 --> 00:40:02,260
by such a beautiful bride.

749
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,740
You promised me before.

750
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,930
You said that

751
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,660
we would be together through life.

752
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:17,620
Don't go back on your word.

753
00:40:22,660 --> 00:40:23,570
I won't.

754
00:40:38,890 --> 00:40:40,340
Let's never be apart again,

755
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:41,090
shall we?

756
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:46,140
We will never be apart again.
