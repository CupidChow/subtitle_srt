00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:50,500
Ji Man!

4
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,170
Ji Man!

5
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,420
Ji Man!

6
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,370
Ji Man, are you all right?

7
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:01,930
How do you feel?

8
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,490
How long are you going to avoid me?

9
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,570
If I don't come to you,

10
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,770
are you going to hide from me

11
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:17,770
for the rest of your life?

12
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,570
It was you who left without
saying goodbye.

13
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,170
Shouldn't you give me an explanation?

14
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,700
I have nothing to explain.

15
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,100
Forget me.

16
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,010
How can I forget you?

17
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,770
In this life,

18
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:38,820
you will be the only one

19
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,540
in my heart.

20
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,540
My dad won't allow us

21
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,820
to be together.

22
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,260
He won't allow me

23
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,380
to be with someone

24
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,540
who lives in hatred all the time.

25
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,260
I...

26
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,290
So the best ending

27
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,890
for us

28
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,860
is to start over

29
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,940
on our own.

30
00:03:09,050 --> 00:03:10,660
You still love me.

31
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,860
Right?

32
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,420
Why don't you believe me?

33
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,450
Believe me.

34
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,100
There is no future.

35
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,140
But why?

36
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,770
Because my biological father
is Cai Wenzheng.

37
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:38,420
What did you say?

38
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:41,170
Because my biological father
is Cai Wenzheng!

39
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,260
The Chief of the Tea Gang, Cai Wenzheng!

40
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:54,660
Even if you don't want to see me,

41
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,540
there's no need to make such a joke.

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,380
I'm not kidding you.

43
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,140
Nie Sangyu and I

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,330
are both Cai Wenzheng's
biological daughters.

45
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,730
It's just that we were
placed into foster care

46
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:11,570
by different people

47
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,420
as soon as we were born.

48
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,170
I was fostered by Ji Ming.

49
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,220
And she was sent

50
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,130
to Nie Xiangyuan.

51
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:18,610
So everything happened

52
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,290
after you met me

53
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,220
can be sorted out, right?

54
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,170

How long have I been asleep?

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,760
Two days.

73
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,320
Two days?

74
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,640
So it's not a dream.

75
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,470
Your Lordship.

76
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:45,830
Your injury...

77
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,790
Never mind.

78
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,520
Her Ladyship went back
to Ship Guihai.

79
00:05:50,710 --> 00:05:51,710
Do you want me to inform her?

80
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:52,320
No need.

81
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,680
She will never come back.

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,120
In the past, the quarrels
between the two of you

83
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:59,120
can be resolved soon.

84
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,470
But some things

85
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:06,880
are arranged by fate.

86
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,230
I don't quite understand.

87
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,790
Her father is Cai Wenzheng.

88
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,440
You get it?

89
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:18,830
It's impossible.

90
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,000
Your Lordship.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,120
Is there any misunderstanding?

92
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,390
Remove

93
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,590
everything related to her

94
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,520
from the house.

95
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,320
And also

96
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,120
the cook.

97
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,910
Yes, sir.

98
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,390
Your Ladyship.

99
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,440
Miss Xue.

100
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:03,320
Why didn't you go back?

101
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:05,680
I just went back to the Magistrate's
Residence and you weren't there.

102
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,560
I'm here to take you home.

103
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,080
I haven't finished

104
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,030
sorting out the herbs here.

105
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,320
You should go back first.

106
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:28,230
Your Ladyship.

107
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,590
Did you quarrel with Yuxuan?

108
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,640
Why are you not even willing to

109
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:35,270
go back to the Magistrate's
Residence now?

110
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:37,830
No.

111
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:39,790
You think too much.

112
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,230
Do you treat me as an outsider,

113
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,790
so you don't want to

114
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,880
tell me anything?

115
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:03,960
I just want to do something

116
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,910
for Haoxue Cosmetics before leaving.

117
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,080
Are you leaving?

118
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,440
Why?

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,200
What happened?

120
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,320
Miss Xue.

121
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:24,790
There's something

122
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:27,520
I haven't had time to tell you.

123
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:37,040
Actually, I am not Nie Sangyu.

124
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,960
What are you talking about?

125
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,710
My name is Ji Man.

126
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,400
My real identity is the daughter

127
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,230
of Guihai Warrior.

128
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,680
Back then,

129
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:48,440
I entered the Marquis's Mansion
by mistake

130
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,830
because I lost my memory
after falling into the water.

131
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,280
Wait.

132
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,830
Are you kidding me?

133
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,510
It's true.

134
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,400
That is to say,

135
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,440
Guihai Warrior is not your godfather.

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:04,590
He's your...

137
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:08,280
So Ning Yuxuan and I

138
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,400
shouldn't be a couple,

139
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,200
and we shouldn't be together.

140
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,800
Due to my status as

141
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,320
the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate,

142
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:24,440
this matter

143
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,200
cannot be made public yet.

144
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,800
When the time comes,

145
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,710
I will completely be back to Ji Man,

146
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:33,110
someone

147
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,680
who has nothing to do

148
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,440
with Ning Yuxuan.

149
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,750
Your Ladyship.

150
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:48,920
Miss Ji.

151
00:09:50,710 --> 00:09:51,830
We all know

152
00:09:51,830 --> 00:09:52,680
how difficult it is

153
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,470
for you two to get to this point.

154
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,200
In my cousin's heart,

155
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,470
no one

156
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,470
can replace you.

157
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,750
In the past, he was always
serious in speech and manner.

158
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:06,750
But

159
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,080
from a certain moment,

160
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:10,470
as long as you are by his side,

161
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,440
he is sometimes as happy

162
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,750
as a child.

163
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,560
Because of you,

164
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,230
he became different from before.

165
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:20,990
Because of you,

166
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,350
the atmosphere in the whole mansion

167
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,200
is not as depressing as before.

168
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,230
Do you remember

169
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,470
when you fell into the water

170
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:31,400
before,

171
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,920
he was by your side

172
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:33,920
all day and all night?

173
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,750
He was afraid that
you would be in any danger.

174
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,470
I've never seen him

175
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,830
learn to cook

176
00:10:38,830 --> 00:10:40,400
for anyone either,

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,560

I'm really busy.

181
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,280
You'd better go back.

His Majesty is going to Haifang

216
00:14:11,710 --> 00:14:13,230
to attend the Imperial Supplier Contest.

for Haifang today

to deploy defenses

220
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,350
to protect His Majesty.

221
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:19,750
Pack up the luggage.

222
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:20,680
Let's set off immediately.

223
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,750
Yes, sir.

Hold on.

225
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,320
Send two letters for me,

226
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,280
to tell Qingyun and the others

227
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,710
my itinerary to Haifang.

228
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:30,590
Yes, sir.

229
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:35,780
(His Majesty is going to Haifang in person
to attend the Imperial Supplier Contest in these days.)

230
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,350
How long does it take?

231
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:08,750
Less than half a day.

232
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,280
Have you contacted

233
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,750
those merchants yet?

234
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,160
I have contacted most of them.

235
00:15:15,470 --> 00:15:16,830
Most of them

236
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,960
are old friends of Lord Tan and you,

237
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,230
so they promised readily.

238
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:22,230
Only Haoxue Cosmetics

239
00:15:22,350 --> 00:15:24,560
dominates the cosmetics industry.

240
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,680
Don't forget that

241
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:31,590
we have the ace in the hole.

242
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:33,800
It's a risky move.

243
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,110
The hit

244
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,080
will definitely defeat them.

245
00:15:37,710 --> 00:15:39,080
And the game

246
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,470
will be quite interesting.

247
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:43,990
Sir, you do have foresight.

248
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:46,040
One more thing.

249
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:47,710
I heard that

250
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,830
Ning Yuxuan and Nie Sangyu

251
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,920
have been at odds with
each other recently.

252
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:51,800
Arrange a restaurant

253
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,320
when we arrive.

254
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,870
I'd like to meet

255
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,440
my old friend.

256
00:15:58,710 --> 00:15:59,510
Yes.

257
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,990
Your Ladyship, why did you

258
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,080
ask me here today?

259
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,320
Is Ning Yuxuan feeling
better recently?

260
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:12,990
Thank you for saving His Lordship

261
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,110
that day.

262
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:01,870
Ning Yuxuan!

263
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:03,560
Ning Yuxuan!

264
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,550
Hold on.

265
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:32,750
To be honest,

266
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,030
His Lordship's old illness relapsed.

267
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:35,840
He had soaked in ice water

268
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,070
for two hours

269
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,070
the night before.

270
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:40,600
How come?

271
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:45,640
Is his medicine enough?

272
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,440
If not,

273
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,680
I'll go get him some more.

274
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,640
There is still a lot of medicine left.

275
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:50,680
But after using it a few times,

276
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,680
it had little effect,

277
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,750
so he stopped using it.

278
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,160
Your Ladyship.

279
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,840
It shouldn't be up to me

280
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,200
to say something.

281
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:06,840
It's his secret trouble.

282
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,510
The way to save him

283
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,880
is not just medicine.

284
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,550
Although I'm just a bodyguard

285
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,270
with a humble status,

286
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,230
I can tell how much

287
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,440
His Lordship cares about you.

288
00:18:22,790 --> 00:18:24,120
Please think about it twice.

289
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:29,440
I see.

290
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,440
There is one more thing
I don't understand.

291
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:38,200
Say it.

292
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:41,270
Since you saved him that day,

293
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,750
why didn't you let me tell him?

294
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,230
Perhaps it is the best choice

295
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,310
for us not to meet each other now.

296
00:18:59,550 --> 00:19:00,510
It's good for him

297
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,120
and for me.

298
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:19,680
Put it here.

299
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,470
You should get to work.

300
00:19:20,470 --> 00:19:21,160
Okay.

301
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:31,030
Qingqing.

302
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,160
How are you doing?

303
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,070
Qian Yiming?

304
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:45,310
No wonder.

305
00:19:46,470 --> 00:19:48,360
So you're the one

306
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:49,960
following me these days, right?

307
00:19:50,070 --> 00:19:51,470
I mean no offense.

308
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:53,960
(Qian Yiming)
Seeing that you are living well

309
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,790
and have your own business,

310
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:58,120
I am really happy for you.

311
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,990
Qingqing.

312
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:02,600
Let's talk privately.

313
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,230
No need.

314
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,960
Just say it here.

315
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,510
Qingqing.

316
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,840
Three years have passed

317
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
since our parting in the capital.

318
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,230
In the past few years,
I have been thinking that

319
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,640
if I hadn't been

320
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:16,510
so obedient

321
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,270
to my mother,

322
00:20:19,070 --> 00:20:20,840
maybe I wouldn't have hurt you.

323
00:20:23,550 --> 00:20:24,550
I've been in pain

324
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:27,230
all these years.

325
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:30,270
This time I came to Haifang

326
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,230
for another chance

327
00:20:32,230 --> 00:20:33,600
from you

328
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:34,990
to prove that

329
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,230
I love you.

330
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:38,680
Qingqing.

331
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:41,640
I love you.

332
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,790
Qian Yiming.

333
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:49,680
Stop acting.

334
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:51,400
Your acting skills have regressed,

335
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,470
and you didn't even shed tears.

336
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,440
I still have work to do.

337
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:56,360
Leave here yourself.

338
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:58,600
Qingqing, don't leave me.

339
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,990
Qingqing.

340
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,270
Don't call me

341
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:04,680
Qingqing anymore.

342
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,310
It makes me sick.

343
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,120
Qingqing.

344
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:09,600
I really love you.

345
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:10,160
You...

346
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:10,710
Do you like

347
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,960
someone else now?

348
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:12,990
Qingqing.

349
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,840
I love you, Qingqing.

350
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,030
Qingqing.

351
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,880
I love you!

352
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,440
Mr. Ning.

353
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,990
I haven't seen you for a long time

354
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,920
since we parted in the capital.

355
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,640
Today I see you are

356
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:34,990
as elegant as ever.

357
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:37,790
Let me propose a toast

358
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,960
to you.

359
00:21:46,070 --> 00:21:47,310
I'm on official business,

360
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,550
and I can't drink.

361
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,510
But I'm

362
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,310
curious

363
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,200
why Mr. Ling came to Haifang

364
00:21:57,030 --> 00:21:58,030
to supervise me so early.

365
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,120
Look at what you said.

366
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,600
I'm here today

367
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:04,070
not to discuss business with you,
only to talk about our old days.

368
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:05,440
Then we have nothing to talk about.

369
00:22:07,310 --> 00:22:09,030
Mr. Ning, you are so funny.

370
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,840
A moment like this

371
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,920
reminds me of

372
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:12,790
our days in the capital.

373
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:13,400
Stop.

374
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:16,920
Do not bring up memories.

375
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,550
Just get to the point.

376
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,200
Okay.

377
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,710
My visit to Haifang this time

378
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,310
is entrusted by His Majesty

379
00:22:26,510 --> 00:22:28,920
to visit the lady with imperial mandate.

380
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,440
I also prepared her some gifts.

381
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,600
But

382
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,550
I also invited her.

383
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,200
Why didn't she

384
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,120
come with you?

385
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,640
She is busy with

386
00:22:49,790 --> 00:22:50,680
the Imperial Supplier Contest.

387
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,880
How could she be so busy?

388
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,270
Yes.

389
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,230
She doesn't even have time
for a meal?

390
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,270
No.

391
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,120
Okay.

392
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,440
That being the case,

393
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
I have to pay her a visit in person

394
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,070
in your residence

395
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,640
as a show of courtesy.

396
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:06,400
Mr. Ning.

397
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,230
Don't make any excuses.

398
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:11,310
This is the entrustment of His Majesty.

399
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:15,750
Please.

400
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:28,620
(Magistrate's Residence)

401
00:23:33,790 --> 00:23:34,550
Mr. Ling.

402
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,510
What's wrong, Mr. Ning?

403
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:40,400
We are already at the gate.

404
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,550
Won't you invite me in?

405
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,440
I'll at least

406
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,920
greet Her Ladyship.

407
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,160
What's wrong?

408
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:51,400
Could it be that

409
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,440
she won't go home tonight?

410
00:23:58,030 --> 00:23:58,880
Mr. Ling.

411
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:01,120
Please.

412
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,030
Mr. Ling.

413
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,120
Mr. Ling is here.

414
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:16,640
Mrs. Ning.

415
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,030
Darling.

416
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:21,750
What's up?

417
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,550
Isn't it enough to see me every day?

418
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,640
I invited Your Ladyship
to a banquet today.

419
00:24:31,790 --> 00:24:33,400
Why didn't you come?

420
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,160
Mr. Ling.

421
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,880
I was so busy

422
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,120
with the business.

423
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,070
You...

424
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,470
You won't blame me, will you?

425
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,600
Never mind.

426
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:45,510
Fortunately, I have met Mrs. Ning.

427
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,270
His Majesty specifically entrusted me

428
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,270
to pay a visit to you

429
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:52,230
when I come to Haifang.

430
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,510
I also

431
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:56,200
prepared some presents.

432
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,270
Look.

433
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:00,270
Thanks to His Majesty for his concern.

434
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:01,750
But we won't accept

435
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,510
the presents.

436
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:08,790
Mr. Ling, you must have been

437
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:09,400
exhausted from a long travel.

438
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,510
Come in and have a cup of tea.

439
00:25:11,550 --> 00:25:12,640
Yes, Mr. Ling.

440
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,750
Didn't you want to come in?

441
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,030
What about...

442
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,790
If you

443
00:25:17,790 --> 00:25:18,710
don't want to,

444
00:25:19,270 --> 00:25:19,960
we won't

445
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,120
force you.

446
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,270
I see.

447
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:26,750
Let's go, darling.

448
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,880
Wait.

449
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:32,920
The taste of food in Haifang

450
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,710
is different from that
in the capital.

451
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,230
Be careful not to
cause an upset stomach.

452
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,200
Darling.

453
00:25:41,310 --> 00:25:41,960
Let's go.

454
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:53,400
Did you see Gui Bai just now?

455
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:54,880
No.

456
00:25:55,030 --> 00:25:56,200
After coming out of the restaurant,

457
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,750
he left alone.

458
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:00,960
Keep an eye on Nie Sangyu.

459
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:03,070
Let's see what tricks they're up to.

460
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:03,710
Yes.

461
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,440
Thank you.

462
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:26,270
No need.

463
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,880
Your Ladyship.

464
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:30,030
Gui Bai.

465
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,030
His Lordship is in trouble.

466
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,270
Ling Jianxing has come to Haifang.

467
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:43,120
Right now he is rushing to

468
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:43,920
the Magistrate's Residence
with His Lordship,

469
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:45,750
saying that he wants to see you.

470
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,270
I was afraid...

471
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:56,270
I was afraid that if Ling Jianxing

472
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,120
found out that we were at odds,

473
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,360
he would take advantage of it.

474
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:00,790
It would be bad

475
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,640
if Haoxue Cosmetics was dragged down.

476
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:06,510
The play is over.

477
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:07,960
I am leaving.

478
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,120
Wait.

479
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,990
They may still be out there.

480
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,550
You'd better

481
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,230
not leave now.

482
00:27:18,310 --> 00:27:19,400
I'll take you back

483
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:20,920
later.

484
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:25,960
No need.

485
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:27,840
I will leave myself.

486
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:30,310
Okay.

487
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:46,260
(Magistrate's Residence)

488
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,310
I already told you

489
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,960
I was immature at that time.

490
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,510
So childhood likes

491
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:24,680
don't count.

492
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,360
But are you

493
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,750
admitting that

494
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,310
you liked me

495
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:30,200
very early on?

496
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,030
I saw with my own eyes

497
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,400
that after leaving
the Magistrate's Residence,

498
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,710
Nie Sangyu went to Ship Guihai

499
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:26,640
and didn't return all night.

500
00:29:26,920 --> 00:29:27,710
It appears

501
00:29:28,030 --> 00:29:28,920
she had no intention of

502
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:29,880
spending the night at
the Magistrate's Residence at all.

503
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,600
Isn't it enough to see me every day?

504
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,920
Mr. Ling, you must have been

505
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:37,510
exhausted from a long travel.

506
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:38,640
Come in and have a cup of tea.

507
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,310
If you

508
00:29:40,310 --> 00:29:41,230
don't want to,

509
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,470
we won't

510
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:43,640
force you.

511
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,920
Ning Yuxuan and this lady
with imperial mandate

512
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,310
are considered a perfect match
by His Majesty.

513
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:58,160
If they only have the name
of a couple,

514
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,070
but are actually at variance,

515
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:02,640
it's a serious crime
of deceiving the Emperor.

516
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:06,750
Zheng.

517
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,920
Continue to

518
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,880
keep an eye on Nie Sangyu

519
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,710
to see how far they are at odds,

520
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,550
and then report to me in time.

521
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:13,270
Yes.

522
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:14,750
Sir.

523
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,160
Princess Ruyue

524
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:17,360
should be here soon.

525
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:32,360
Right.

526
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,470
We've been waiting for a long time.

527
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,510
How long have we been waiting?

528
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:37,710
So long.

529
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,960
Mr. Ling.

530
00:31:00,510 --> 00:31:01,550
It's time to begin.

531
00:31:06,510 --> 00:31:08,230
Everyone, please be patient.

532
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,400
A distinguished guest hasn't come yet.

533
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:13,400
A distinguished guest?

534
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:14,440
Who's that?

535
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:16,230
A distinguished guest?

536
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,960
So many people are waiting
for this one person.

537
00:31:22,710 --> 00:31:24,070
That person must have a high status.

538
00:31:24,310 --> 00:31:25,400
Why hasn't that person
come here for so long?

539
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,030
What distinguished guest?

540
00:31:26,030 --> 00:31:26,880
The distinguished guest of Mr. Ling.

541
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,960
We'd better wait.

542
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,680
So arrogant.

543
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,310
The least etiquette...

544
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:35,400
Why hasn't that person come yet?

545
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:47,270
Coming. Look.

546
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,510
Look.

547
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,270
Really?

548
00:31:50,270 --> 00:31:50,990
Coming.

549
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,880
What a scene.

550
00:32:56,510 --> 00:32:57,790
She is dressed so grandly.

551
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,680
It's not as if she is here to
participate in a competition,

552
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,070
but to receive an award.

553
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:38,440
Everyone.

554
00:33:38,990 --> 00:33:40,470
During this Imperial Supplier Contest,

555
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,960
in addition to local businessmen,

556
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:44,440
we have invited

557
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,440
businessmen from all corners
of the state.

558
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,440
Among them,

559
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:50,640
there is a distinguished guest.

560
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,960
Princess Ruyue.

561
00:33:54,270 --> 00:33:54,920
Princess?

562
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:55,550
Princess?

563
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,710
Princess Ruyue.

564
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,030
She's really a distinguished guest.

565
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,030
Yes.

566
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,840
Sorry to keep you waiting.

567
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:48,110
Hard work for you.

568
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:53,320
How could it be her?

569
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,880
Thank you, Mr. Ling, for your invitation.

570
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:56,720
As Mr. Ling said,

571
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,240
I came to Haifang this time

572
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,720
not only as a princess,

573
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:00,840
but also as a businesswoman

574
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:02,960
who participated in
the Imperial Supplier Contest.

575
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:03,720
I brought

576
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,510
a self-developed face cream,

577
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:06,990
and my goal

578
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:09,360
is to stand out

579
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,630
and win first prize.

580
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:22,880
Princess...

581
00:35:25,510 --> 00:35:26,280
Mr. Ling.

582
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:28,440
This is a felon

583
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:30,190
of the imperial court.

584
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,150
How did she become

585
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,320
Princess Ruyue?

586
00:35:35,550 --> 00:35:36,440
General Tao.

587
00:35:37,070 --> 00:35:38,440
I'm afraid you misunderstood.

588
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:39,960
This is

589
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,880
Princess Ruyue,

590
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,630
Lord Tan's niece.

591
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:46,030
It's just that

592
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,280
she may have a slight resemblance

593
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,030
to that felon of the imperial court.

594
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:54,920
If she receives poor treatment,

595
00:35:55,510 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm afraid we will offend Lord Tan
and the Emperor.

596
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:04,240
Everyone.

597
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,800
I came to Haifang in the order
of His Majesty.

598
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,280
His Majesty pays close attention
to public opinion.

599
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,110
And Haifang

600
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,800
is an important wharf of our country.

601
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,240
So His Majesty attaches
great importance to it.

602
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:21,470
As a result,
this year's Imperial Supplier Contest

603
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,030
is scheduled to be held in Haifang.

604
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,590
Mr. Ning.

605
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:51,240
I hereby announce

606
00:36:51,510 --> 00:36:52,590
the official establishment

607
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,510
of the Shipping Department today.

608
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,320
The Imperial Supplier Contest
is officially starting.

609
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:01,960
It's on.

610
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:03,960
Great.

611
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,190
(Shipping Department)
Good!

612
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,720
- Great!
- Great!

613
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:07,880
Awesome.

614
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:09,670
Awesome.

615
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:10,190
Nice.

616
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:10,760
Good.

617
00:37:45,420 --> 00:37:46,140
Wen Wan!

618
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:48,100
Watch your manner!

619
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,180
Miss.

620
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,140
You got the wrong person.

621
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,260
Aren't you in the
Court of Judicial Review?

622
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:04,300
Miss.

623
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,380
What do you mean?

624
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,700
Stop acting.

625
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,420
You have done so many bad things.

626
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,380
How dare you come back?

627
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,220
How dare you disrespect the princess?

628
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,220
Take her down.

629
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:13,980
Wait.

630
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,460
Princess Ruyue.

631
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,180
One might cover up the past

632
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,020
if made any mistake.

633
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,580
But now you are the princess.

634
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,740
If you do

635
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:26,020
anything outrageous,

636
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,980
it will reach the Emperor's ears.

637
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:29,460
Think about it twice.

638
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:31,380
Reach the Emperor's ears?

639
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:34,420
My uncle Lord Tan

640
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,900
watched me grow up since childhood.

641
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:39,060
Even the Emperor
held me in his arms once.

642
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:43,700
What right do you have to remind me?

643
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,380
Someone.

644
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:49,420
Take them down.

645
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,220
- You!
- You!

646
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,780
Stop!

647
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,460
Princess.

648
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,500
I didn't have a chance
to introduce you just now.

649
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,140
This is

650
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:12,580
Mr. Ning Yuxuan,

651
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,540
Magistrate of Haifang,

652
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,540
also the current Left Consul.

653
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,340
This is

654
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,900
his wife,

655
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,780
also the lady with imperial mandate.

656
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,460
This is my first time to Haifang.

657
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:27,020
Please take care of me

658
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,300
from now on,

659
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,220
Mr. Ning

660
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,180
and Mrs. Ning.

661
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:39,580
Was there any misunderstanding

662
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,580
between the lady
with imperial mandate and Princess?

663
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,780
I just arrived at Haifang.

664
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,300
I don't know

665
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:46,700
when I offended Mrs. Ning.

666
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,700
She seems

667
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,900
quite hostile to me.

668
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:57,340
Princess, you just arrived at Haifang?

669
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,980
Haifang is rich in products.

670
00:40:01,060 --> 00:40:02,460
You should walk around.

671
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,340
It's just since the Imperial
Supplier Contest is approaching,

672
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,020
Haifang has been quite a mixed bag.

673
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,340
But with Mr. Ling around,

674
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,500
there shouldn't be any problems.

675
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:16,460
I have long heard that the people of Haifang
are simple and honest,

676
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,300
and they are hospitable to guests.

677
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,620
Now I understand that

678
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:22,980
seeing is believing.

679
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:24,660
Alright, everyone.

680
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,500
Princess is exhausted
from the long journey

681
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,020
and has to go back to rest.

682
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,420
Princess.

683
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,220
Mr. Ning.

684
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,460
Mrs. Ning.

685
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,300
See you.

686
00:40:58,660 --> 00:40:59,540
She's up to nothing good.

687
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,740
Be careful.

688
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,220
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

689
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,780
Wen Wan is back.

690
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,500
So weird.

691
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:25,580
Right.

692
00:41:27,460 --> 00:41:28,900
Who is she exactly?

693
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:31,420
This vicious woman

694
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,740
has done so many shameful deeds.

695
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,900
How dare she come back?

696
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,380
We finally made Wen Wan

697
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,820
pay the price.

698
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,380
I don't know

699
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,700
what tricks she played again.

700
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,780
Now she turned into

701
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:43,420
Princess Ruyue.

702
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,980
And she has something to do
with Lord Tan.

703
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,580
So I guess

704
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,420
the story behind it

705
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:50,500
must be far more complicated

706
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,420
than we imagined.

707
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,300
Now that

708
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,180
she staged a comeback,

709
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:59,060
we have to be careful in the future.

710
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,700
Sangyu.

711
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:02,380
Don't care about the princess.

712
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,860
Since she dares to compete with us,

713
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,460
let's defeat her

714
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,620
and make her fall on her face.

715
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:08,900
Then let's tear off her mask.

716
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:10,100
Right, beat her hard.

717
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:10,820
Exactly.

718
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,460
Compete with her.

719
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,260
Beat her hard.

720
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,700
I'm going to convince my dad

721
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,900
to leave later.

722
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,620
In this situation,

723
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:19,940
I cannot leave the responsibility

724
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,780
of Haoxue Cosmetics

725
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,580
to you.

726
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:23,660
I will fight side by side

727
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,460
with you.

728
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,260
Really?

729
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,140
Then we have

730
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:29,020
a better chance of winning.

731
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:30,340
Yes.

732
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:31,820
Let's work together

733
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,540
to defeat that Ruyue.

734
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,820
- Defeat her!
- Defeat her!

735
00:42:37,860 --> 00:42:38,620
Don't worry.

736
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,900
Well done.

737
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,900
You didn't show your slip.

738
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,300
How does it feel

739
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,820
to let Mrs. Ning suffer?

740
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:52,900
It's so satisfying to

741
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,900
watch them getting mad

742
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:57,180
but not being able to do anything to me.

743
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,100
I have never let

744
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,860
Nie Sangyu suffer before.

745
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,460
The more depressed she is now,

746
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:02,700
the happier I am.

747
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,060
I will definitely not let

748
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,580
her and Ning Yuxuan have an easy time.

749
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:07,740
I will make them repay me

750
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,220
for the pain

751
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,260
they have caused me.
