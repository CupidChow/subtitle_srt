=Episode 28=

3
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:51,140
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

4
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,210
You came.

5
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:53,170
Shush.

6
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:53,900
Wait.

7
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:56,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

8
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,420
See what

9
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:07,340
I brought you.

10
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:10,050
What is it?

11
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,820
Almond crisp.

12
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,540
You take the first bite.

13
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:23,100
Look at the mess you made.

14
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,860
Things have been busy
at the shop lately?

15
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,140
Kind of.

16
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,700
When the Imperial Supplier Contest is on,

17
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,700
it will be busier.

18
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,260
But of course,

19
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,700
the credit

20
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,860
belongs to you.

21
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,570
Good work, my dear.

22
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,730
If you need any help,

23
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:45,450
just let me know.

24
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:54,050
I asked you to go to the riverside

25
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,380
that day to…

26
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,770
What?

27
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,220
I wanted to…

28
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:08,660
Propose to me.

29
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,660
Just level with me, okay?

30
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,980
How did you find out?

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,100
I even saw the wedding robe.

32
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:18,890
But you didn't know

33
00:03:18,890 --> 00:03:19,860
my size,

34
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:22,010
how did you have it tailored?

35
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,170
I…

36
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,380
I went to

37
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,770
Miss Shui

38
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,140
and asked her to try on the robe.

39
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,450
No wonder

40
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:33,980
she's been acting weird

41
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,100
in front of me these days.

42
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,380
Ji Man,

43
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,380
marry me, please.

44
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:48,730
What?

45
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,420
I didn't hear you.

46
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,660
What did you say?

47
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:54,860
I said, marry me!

48
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,660
And you will be

49
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:57,290
the happiest woman in the world.

50
00:03:57,290 --> 00:03:58,100
All right.

51
00:03:58,660 --> 00:03:59,260
Keep it down,

52
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,330
or people will hear you.

53
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,980
Stop it.

54
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,860
Your Ladyship.

55
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,140
Your Ladyship.

56
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:10,140
Muxu. Muxu.

57
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:10,770
Your Ladyship.

58
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,290
What?

59
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,100
Your dad's coming.

60
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:13,050
Who?

61
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:13,450
Shush.

62
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,260
Your dad.

63
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,050
My dad?

64
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:16,930
I…

65
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:19,100
I'm going in.

66
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:19,900
You'll leave from the backdoor.

67
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,290
Wait.

68
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,220
What's he doing here?

69
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:44,130
I don't know.

70
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,340
Sang Shen has been acting weird today.

71
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,100
Who is this?

72
00:04:59,250 --> 00:04:59,730
Father.

73
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:00,900
Father?

74
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:01,980
Father?

75
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,020
Godfather.

76
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:05,490
Godfather?

77
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,220
Godfather?

78
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,610
What are you doing here?

79
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:09,980
What did you call me?

80
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:14,290
Let me introduce.

81
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:16,490
This is the world-famous

82
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,420
Guihai Warrior,

83
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,490
Mr. Ji Ming.

84
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,810
I hired him

85
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:22,490
as Haoxue Cosmetics' consultant

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,290
for the Imperial Supplier Contest.

87
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,690
I feel like we really share
a lot in common,

88
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,100
so I would like

89
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,340
you to be my godfather.

90
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,170
You are a renowned businessman
in Haifang, Mr. Ji.

91
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:35,660
I really admire you.

92
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:37,220
So this is why

93
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,580
you were away for days.

94
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,980
You got us an excellent consultant.

95
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,130
With Mr. Ji's support,

96
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:45,730
I think we are very much

97
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,660
likely to win

98
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,860
the first place in the
Imperial Supplier Contest.

99
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:49,220
What?

100
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,460
The Imperial Supplier Contest?

101
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,610
Yes, Godfather.

102
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:54,170
Haoxue Cosmetics will participate
in the Imperial Supplier Contest.

103
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:54,980
And I tell you what,

104
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,130
if I win the first place,

105
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:56,780
I will be appointed

106
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,420
as the chairwoman
of Haifang's Sea Trade Guild.

107
00:05:58,610 --> 00:05:59,250
Don't worry,

108
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,780
I will make you proud.

109
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:03,730
Are you serious?

110
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,730
Sure.

111
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:07,860
What?

112
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,290
You don't believe me?

113
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,290
I do.

114
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,540
Of course, I do.

115
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,020
I have long heard

116
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,660
that Ms. Nie of Haoxue Cosmetics

117
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:19,900
has her own style

118
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,690
and characteristics.

119
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,690
I wanted to come
and see for myself,

120
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,420
and I have been convinced.

121
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,170
Well, thank you, Godfather.

122
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,610
Now that you're here,

123
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,860
how about I show you around?

124
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,690
Good, I would love that.

125
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:46,290
Mr. Ji.

126
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:48,540
You came at last, Lang.

127
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:51,050
It's been a busy day.

128
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,020
The Imperial Supplier Contest draws near.

129
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,370
My former partners

130
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,490
wanted to talk business with me,

131
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,930
but now,

132
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,220
I'm really not in the mood.

133
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,900
How's Man doing?

134
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:07,020
She constantly attempted to see

135
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,980
Ning Yuxuan in secret,

136
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:10,250
I prevented that.

137
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,170
But she never stops giving
me headaches.

138
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,730
She has signed up for the
Imperial Supplier Contest,

139
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,610
and aims

140
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:18,780
to win the first place.

141
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,460
I know her.

142
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:22,460
She's committed and persistent.

143
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,050
If she wins the first place

144
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:25,860
and becomes the chairwoman,

145
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,220
she will be in a more
dangerous situation.

146
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,340
You're correct, Mr. Ji.

147
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,580
Once someone finds out

148
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,540
that she's the daughter
of a Tea Gang member,

149
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,980
trouble immediately ensues.

150
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,250
Lang,

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,980
you prepare some supplies for me.

152
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:41,130
I have decided

153
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:43,540
to take Ji Man on my ship
and set sail.

154
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,660
We will be away for half a year.

155
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,900
Away from Haifang,

156
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,580
and Ning Yuxuan.

157
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,980
That's one solution.

158
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,490
But what if

159
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,100
she disobeys you?

160
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,490
It doesn't matter.

161
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,170
She will live on the ship.

162
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:58,690
I will tie her up if I have to.

163
00:07:59,100 --> 00:07:59,690
That's…

164
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:01,610
This is the

165
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,900
last resort.

166
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,020
No other option.

167
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:06,100
This is the end between her
and Ning Yuxuan.

168
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:11,860
Your dad said

169
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:13,220
his last resort would be

170
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,490
taking you away from Haifang

171
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,980
so you will not see His Lordship anymore.

172
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:17,860
He did?

173
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,370
So cruel.

174
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,490
Right.

175
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:24,730
Muxu.

176
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,130
Thank you for

177
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,220
your very important information.

178
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,170
I would do

179
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:29,860
anything for you, Your Ladyship.

180
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,490
Well, well, well.

181
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:35,730
I can't believe my dad
would be so heartless.

182
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:37,370
Fine.

183
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,250
Now that he's taking his action,

184
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,940
I will take mine.

185
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,890
My Lady, what will you do?

186
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,250
I haven't decided yet.

187
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,860
How about

188
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,730
fake pain?

189
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:01,700
Fake pain?

190
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:02,490
Right.

191
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,410
My dad loves me so much

192
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,370
that he'd feel bad

193
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:05,940
even if

194
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,010
I just cut my finger.

195
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:08,610
If I pretend to be sick

196
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,100
and stay in bed,

197
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:11,820
he will be softened

198
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,340
and give up going to sea.

199
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:14,580
Great idea.

200
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,860
Perfect idea.

201
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:17,730
I will pretend to be sick.

202
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,820
Before my dad comes in,

203
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,890
I will heat up my forehead.

204
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:21,220
Go get me a warmer,

205
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:22,730
and some croton seeds.

206
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,980
My dad is not a fool.

207
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:25,340
It has to
be perfectly convincing.

208
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,700
My Lady.

209
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:32,250
My Lady.

210
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,940
I feel terrible.

211
00:09:39,410 --> 00:09:40,820
My Lady.

212
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:43,940
What's going on?

213
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:44,890
I feel so ill...

214
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,100
Mr. Ji.

215
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:46,730
Man.

216
00:09:46,730 --> 00:09:47,580
Dad.

217
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,100
Having a fever?

218
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,130
So hot.

219
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:54,980
I feel like I'm on fire.

220
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:56,530
I…

221
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,860
It is hot.

222
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:03,370
Take it.

223
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,250
What,

224
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,060
Dad?

225
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,460
How many times have you
gone to the toilet today?

226
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:11,980
What do you mean?

227
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,100
Man.

228
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,580
My head aches.

229
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,820
Still this many croton seeds.

230
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:26,010
If you are to put on a show,

231
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:29,010
you should make it look real.

232
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,730
Or else,

233
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,250
I wouldn't be convinced.

234
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:33,820
I…

235
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:42,180
He's really good.

236
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,100
One failure won't beat me.

237
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:48,010
I will try something else.

238
00:10:48,010 --> 00:10:49,370
My Lady, what?

239
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,820
Now that I'm a rich girl,

240
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:51,820
I will just

241
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,470
buy a boat and run away.

242
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:57,180
Sang Shen,

243
00:10:57,370 --> 00:10:57,940
you go

244
00:10:58,010 --> 00:10:59,410
buy me a boat.

245
00:10:59,650 --> 00:11:01,130
If my dad goes to sea,

246
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:01,980
you ask the boatman

247
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,940
to stay close,

248
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,650
and I will find an opportunity
to escape from Ship Guihai

249
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,460
and return to Haifang in my boat.

250
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,530
I will make sure she can't
even afford an oar.

251
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,460
My Lady, sorry.

252
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,370
Your dad ordered us

253
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,650
to take all the valuables

254
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,700
away from you.

255
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,490
Your Ladyship,

256
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,060
we can't even

257
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:30,370
afford an oar now.

258
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:33,130
Why does it keep happening?

259
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,460
How come my dad always

260
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,730
beats me?

261
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:39,060
Your Ladyship,

262
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:41,010
could it be possible
that your dad planted a mole?

263
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,940
No, no way.

264
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:44,700
A mole?

265
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,010
How does…

266
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,220
Some people

267
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,860
claim to care about me,

268
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:04,180
but in reality,

269
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,490
they don't care about
how I feel at all.

270
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,300
It hasn't been easy for me

271
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:09,010
and Ning Yuxuan,

272
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,410
and they wouldn't give up
breaking us apart.

273
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,490
I surely cannot be happy
about it, can I?

274
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,980
Sang Shen,

275
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:14,340
am I right?

276
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,940
My Lady.

277
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,610
My Lady, I'm sorry.

278
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,650
You are the mole, aren't you?

279
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,820
You…

280
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:37,100
You…

281
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,700
After you went to see Mr. Ning
that day,

282
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:40,820
Mr. Ji ordered me

283
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:42,130
to report to him.

284
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,650
I'm just a maidservant.

285
00:12:45,410 --> 00:12:46,370
I mean,

286
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:47,770
I do whatever

287
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,220
my boss tells me to do.

288
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,060
But in recent days,

289
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,860
I have witnessed your anxiety,

290
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,890
and I heard what you said.

291
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,300
I don't think what I'm doing is right.

292
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,860
I'm sorry, My Lady.

293
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:00,300
All right.

294
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,730
You silly girl.

295
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:04,060
What I said

296
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,250
was just a test.

297
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,610
But I really meant

298
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,820
what I said.

299
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:11,180
It really has not been

300
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,580
easy for me and Ning Yuxuan.

301
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,940
Now,

302
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,490
we really love each other.

303
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:16,770
And no one

304
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,890
can break us apart.

305
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,700
I shall never leave him.

306
00:13:20,010 --> 00:13:21,490
I got it, My Lady.

307
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:23,460
I swear I won't betray you.

308
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:25,700
Sang Shen, silly you.

309
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,180
I had served in
the Ning's Mansion for years.

310
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,700
His Lordship barely wore
any smile on his face

311
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:31,580
before Her Ladyship showed up.

312
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,940
Her Ladyship won't leave him,

313
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,460
and His Lordship won't leave her, either.

314
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,220
Alright, Muxu.

315
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:38,100
Let's think about

316
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:39,820
how we can let Ning Yuxuan

317
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,250
know that my dad

318
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,220
plans to go to sea.

319
00:13:46,770 --> 00:13:47,980
My Lady, I will do it.

320
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,060
I promise you

321
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:50,220
that I won't snitch.

322
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,700
Good girl.

323
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:55,730
Listen,

324
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:57,770
tomorrow,

325
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:59,300
my dad will dine with his friends.

326
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:00,580
You will tell Ning Yuxuan

327
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,650
to meet me at the wharf.

328
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:05,890
Sir,

329
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,770
all Miss Ji's

330
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:08,700
valuables have been collected.

331
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,730
Nothing left.

332
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:10,820
I got it.

333
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,820
Step down.

334
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,650
Yes.

335
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,180
Man,

336
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,730
don't blame me.

337
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,010
If you have to blame someone,

338
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,890
just blame

339
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,220
your destiny.

340
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,010
Ning.

341
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,980
I think

342
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,890
you're very important to His Majesty.

343
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,300
I was appointed

344
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,770
as the registrar
of the Imperial Supplier Contest,

345
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:48,860
and Mr. Tao

346
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:50,980
was appointed
as the director of the Contest.

347
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,100
All he did

348
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,490
is to put the ones

349
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,700
you trust around you

350
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,530
to make things easier for you.

351
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:57,820
I have heard that Ling Jianxing

352
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,370
would arrive in Haifang soon.

353
00:14:59,890 --> 00:15:00,580
Ning,

354
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,490
you must stay alert.

355
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:05,890
Ling Jianxing

356
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,220
will not come unprepared.

357
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:09,860
Lord Tan, who he answers to,

358
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:10,890
will not let the Contest

359
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,300
go smoothly.

360
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,700
Anyway,

361
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,700
we will stay on guard.

362
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,860
Don't worry.

363
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,300
Ling Jianxing

364
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:22,940
has never won you once.

365
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,250
And you just brought down

366
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,460
two major forces in Haifang.

367
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:27,940
I bet Ling Jianxing

368
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,060
is taking a desperate move.

369
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,180
It concerns Haifang's marine trade.

370
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,130
We will be careful.

371
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,410
Get to work.

372
00:15:37,490 --> 00:15:38,010
Alright.

373
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:38,940
I'll be off.

374
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:41,300
Oh, right.

375
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,300
I remember Her Ladyship

376
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,060
has signed up

377
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,300
for the Imperial Supplier Contest,

378
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
how come I don't see her lately?

379
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,940
She's…

380
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:54,530
She locks herself in her room
to study Feiwan Face Cream.

381
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,650
I, too, wish to see her.

382
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,730
How's she holding up?

383
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:01,370
She's fine.

384
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:02,940
Good to hear.

385
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:03,980
Your Lordship.

386
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:05,940
Ning,

387
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,370
see you around.

388
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,010
Your Lordship, good news.

389
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:10,530
What is it?

390
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:11,220
Miss Sang Shen

391
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,130
had a letter sent over

392
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:12,940
that says Mr. Ji

393
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,180
is out on business,

394
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,770
and Her Ladyship is waiting
for you at the wharf.

395
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:17,460
Gui Bai,

396
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,460
she likes flowers.

397
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,340
Go buy out

398
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:19,890
the flowers from the flower stand.

399
00:16:19,890 --> 00:16:20,460
Yes, sir.

400
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,100
Your Ladyship,

401
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,410
the flower

402
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:27,980
really adds to your cuteness.

403
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,100
Another one.

404
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:36,460
Too many?

405
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,860
Yeah, too many.

406
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,530
Well, forget it.

407
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:42,940
You look so pretty.

408
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:44,250
His Lordship

409
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:45,860
will be charmed by you.

410
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,130
Muxu,

411
00:16:50,130 --> 00:16:51,100
go check

412
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,890
if my dad has left.

413
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,530
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

414
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,980
Man.

415
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,890
Your Ladyship, Your Ladyship.

416
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,060
Man.

417
00:16:59,490 --> 00:16:59,940
Dad.

418
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:02,060
Y-You are still here?

419
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,260
Look at you.

420
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,820
Look how pretty you are.

421
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,820
Since you have all spruced up,

422
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,210
you will join me

423
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,410
in my lunch

424
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:10,370
with my old friends.

425
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:13,450
I'll pass.

426
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,610
Why would I join you

427
00:17:15,610 --> 00:17:16,690
in your lunch with your friends?

428
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:17,820
No.

429
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:19,020
No?

430
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,610
You think I don't know

431
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,860
what you are dressed up for?

432
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,260
You listen to me.

433
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,020
You will follow me

434
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,890
wherever I go

435
00:17:25,890 --> 00:17:26,930
before we leave Haifang.

436
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:27,860
You…

437
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:30,650
Servants.

438
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,410
Sir.

439
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:35,500
Take her out.

440
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:36,690
Yes.

441
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,930
Dad.

442
00:17:37,930 --> 00:17:38,740
Dad what?

443
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,100
See you next time.

444
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,650
OK. Thanks.

445
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:50,740
Ma'am.

446
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:52,650
I will buy out

447
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,690
all your flowers.

448
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,610
I'm sorry, sir.

449
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:57,580
But that lady has paid

450
00:17:57,580 --> 00:17:58,650
for all the flowers.

451
00:18:00,860 --> 00:18:01,780
I don't like it.

452
00:18:02,170 --> 00:18:02,740
Thanks.

453
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,100
Come and check out the jewelry.

454
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:07,170
Gui Bai?

455
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:09,370
Gui Bai.

456
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,740
What are you doing here?

457
00:18:12,410 --> 00:18:14,060
His Lordship ordered me to

458
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,130
buy flowers for Her Ladyship.

459
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,820
His Lordship

460
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,210
sounds like a romantic man.

461
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:20,930
He really loves

462
00:18:20,930 --> 00:18:22,580
Mrs. Ning, doesn't he?

463
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,340
What do you think?

464
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,970
You're right, Miss Shui.

465
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,780
What about you?

466
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,580
Will you love

467
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:32,170
your girl

468
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,020
the way His Lordship does?

469
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:38,450
I've got work to do.

470
00:18:38,690 --> 00:18:39,370
Goodbye.

471
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,170
You are buying flowers,
aren't you?

472
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:52,540
I really like these flowers,

473
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:54,410
but His Lordship

474
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:55,610
has moved me.

475
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:56,970
You can have the flowers.

476
00:18:58,540 --> 00:18:59,820
That won't be necessary.

477
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,130
I will buy flowers elsewhere.

478
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,210
You don't know any other flower stand.

479
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:05,500
How about

480
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:06,780
I

481
00:19:06,970 --> 00:19:07,970
go with you?

482
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:08,740
No, thanks.

483
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,650
Gui Bai,

484
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,100
how much longer

485
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,130
will you keep avoiding me?

486
00:19:17,410 --> 00:19:18,930
You've kept away from me

487
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,020
since the night I danced for you.

488
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,100
Do you take me for a fool?

489
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,100
You think I can't tell?

490
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:25,210
Yes,

491
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,340
I crossed the line that night.

492
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,060
I made you feel uncomfortable.

493
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,300
And I'm sorry for that.

494
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,690
But I have thought it through.

495
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,780
Forced love

496
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:35,820
is not healthy.

497
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:37,930
Since you have no

498
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:39,100
feelings for me,

499
00:19:39,890 --> 00:19:40,860
well, that's fine,

500
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,260
let's just be friends

501
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,890
like we used to.

502
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,060
So you don't have to feel awkward

503
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,060
and avoid me all the time.

504
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:49,370
Don't worry.

505
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:50,860
My love

506
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,170
was unrequited,

507
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,500
but I will stop

508
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:56,970
doing that.

509
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,780
Miss, your flowers.

510
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,450
Miss.

511
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:10,580
Sir,

512
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,650
you can take these flowers.

513
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:18,780
Everybody,

514
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:20,890
I have gathered you here

515
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,500
in Haifang

516
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,820
to attend the Imperial Supplier Contest,

517
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,060
and I'm really happy.

518
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,060
Yes, us too.

519
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,060
Today,

520
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:30,820
we also have a new friend here.

521
00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:32,540
This is Yuan Lang,

522
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,540
the chief of the Dragon Gang.

523
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:35,780
Here's

524
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,260
a toast to all of you.

525
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,060
- Please, please.
- Sure, sure.

526
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,500
Brothers.

527
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:47,580
Yuan Lang

528
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,970
may look young,

529
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,780
but he's a fine lad.

530
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:52,060
Ever since he

531
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,100
took over the Dragon Gang,

532
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,650
the Gang has been regulated

533
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:56,650
and become a decent organization

534
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,890
that abides by the laws.

535
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,260
It took him a lot of effort.

536
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:03,970
Mr. Yuan and I share a strong bond.

537
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,740
We are close friends.

538
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,500
Now that the ban on sea transportation

539
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,370
in Haifang will be canceled,

540
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,890
I believe you'll be doing

541
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,450
business here in the city.

542
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:14,780
How about you let the Dragon Gang

543
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,500
handle the transportation?

544
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,820
It will be safe,

545
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,170
time-saving, and at a reasonable price.

546
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:26,260
Mr. Yuan, am I right?

547
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:28,780
Thank you for your support,

548
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:29,260
Mr. Guihai Warrior.

549
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,130
The Dragon Gang

550
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:33,690
shall be responsible for

551
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,890
securing your goods.

552
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,690
Since Guihai Warrior trusts him,

553
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:38,260
so will we.

554
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:40,340
Cheers.

555
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:41,650
Thanks.

556
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:43,500
Cheers. Cheers.

557
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:46,970
Mr. Ji.

558
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,780
Chief Yuan and Man

559
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,450
seem like a good match.

560
00:21:51,930 --> 00:21:54,650
Are you still single, Chief Yuan?

561
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,130
I've been doing business
by myself for years,

562
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:57,930
so I'm not married yet.

563
00:21:57,930 --> 00:21:59,340
Chief Yuan's a good man.

564
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,130
The chief of the Dragon Gang

565
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:03,500
and the daughter
of Guihai Warrior.

566
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,970
It will be a perfect match.

567
00:22:05,970 --> 00:22:07,170
A perfect match, indeed.

568
00:22:07,970 --> 00:22:08,780
Yes, yes.

569
00:22:08,890 --> 00:22:10,340
Yes, yes.

570
00:22:18,690 --> 00:22:19,650
Chief Yuan,

571
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,130
when were you born?

572
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:21,890
When…

573
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:24,370
I…

574
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,500
I need to use the bathroom.

575
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:33,060
Brothers,

576
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:35,690
I wish you good fortune.

577
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:36,540
Here.

578
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:38,170
Cheers.

579
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,410
Cheers. Cheers.

580
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,210
My Lady.

581
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,130
What?

582
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:48,930
My Lady.

583
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,130
Mr. Ji said

584
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,450
that you can't leave the restaurant.

585
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:55,970
My dad was joking.

586
00:22:55,970 --> 00:22:56,650
Don't take it seriously.

587
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,170
- My Lady.
- My Lady.

588
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,370
Please don't make it difficult for us.

589
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:00,500
We are only doing our job.

590
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:02,610
I need to use the bathroom.

591
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,210
Well, am I going to…

592
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,970
I see a beauty,

593
00:23:07,130 --> 00:23:08,370
and I never forget her.

594
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,130
If one day I don't see her,

595
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,690
I miss her like crazy.

596
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,130
Ning…

597
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,130
Fine.

598
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:21,370
I'll sit here.

599
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,100
- Thank you, My Lady.
- Thank you, My Lady.

600
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,540
Am I living in a dream?

601
00:23:32,890 --> 00:23:34,020
It is you.

602
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,580
It is you. It is really you.

603
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:36,820
How did you get here?

604
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,690
How on earth…

605
00:23:37,690 --> 00:23:39,020
It is me.

606
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,540
How on earth

607
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:42,690
did you get here?

608
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,130
They are up there?

609
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,540
Yeah, they are.

610
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:47,060
Seriously,

611
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,260
how did you find me?

612
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,100
Your smell.

613
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,260
I followed your smell

614
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,370
and found the place.

615
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,740
Stop it.

616
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:56,060
What are you, a dog?

617
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,210
I heard that you were

618
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,970
brought to this restaurant
in the Magistrate's Residence,

619
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:02,740
so I rushed here,

620
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,650
and waited.

621
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,820
Look at you.

622
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:13,130
It's only been a day,

623
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:14,020
and you have already lost weight.

624
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,860
Because your dad

625
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,100
doesn't let us see each other,

626
00:24:17,210 --> 00:24:18,370
so yeah, I have lost weight.

627
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,410
Please stop here, Mr. Ji.

628
00:24:22,410 --> 00:24:22,930
This is it.

629
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,300
Gentlemen, goodbye.

630
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:25,100
Goodbye.

631
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:41,690
Mr. Ji,

632
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,210
Man is stuck deep in the relationship.

633
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,130
She should be told the truth
sooner rather than later,

634
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:46,740
or else…

635
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,650
Lang,

636
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:52,410
does the debt from the last generation

637
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:54,020
have to

638
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,540
be passed on to the next?

639
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,370
Mr. Ji,

640
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:06,580
have you ever thought about this?

641
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:08,130
If Ning Yuxuan

642
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,370
was told the truth,

643
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:10,890
all these years,

644
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,260
he's been fighting
against the Tea Gang

645
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:13,970
in a bid to avenge his dad,

646
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:15,610
once he finds out

647
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,410
that Man is the daughter
of the man who killed his father,

648
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:19,610
I'm worried

649
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:20,650
that Man will be in greater danger.

650
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:23,690
This is not a small matter.

651
00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:25,780
It mustn't be disclosed

652
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,300
to the public.

653
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:28,740
The later she knows,

654
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,610
the better for her.

655
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:32,860
Man and Ning Yuxuan

656
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,410
are predestined to not be lovers.

657
00:25:36,650 --> 00:25:38,540
They don't get to choose.

658
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,650
Oh, right.

659
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:53,610
I've got a tricky problem.

660
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,890
My dad plans to take me
away from Haifang

661
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:56,340
to completely break us apart.

662
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,260
Once and for all?

663
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:58,610
Yeah.

664
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:01,170
Your dad is callous.

665
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:04,260
I didn't see

666
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,610
this coming, either.

667
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:07,540
I mean, why does he not like you?

668
00:26:07,610 --> 00:26:08,610
Yes, you are

669
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:09,580
bad-tempered,

670
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
and eccentric,

671
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,540
and extremely stern,

672
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,410
but you are now

673
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:15,300
the kindest

674
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:16,340
and sweetest man

675
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:17,650
who understands me the most.

676
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,020
How do I let him know this?

677
00:26:21,450 --> 00:26:22,130
Wait, I…

678
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,540
You are making

679
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,340
quite a contradictory comment.

680
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:24,690
I

681
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,060
somehow feel like…

682
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,100
Whatever.

683
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,930
Now, the key problem is

684
00:26:32,170 --> 00:26:33,780
how to take you out of here.

685
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:34,930
It's pointless.

686
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:36,500
I tried everything,

687
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,540
but none of that worked.

688
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,260
He's unreasonable.

689
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,890
I tried my best.

690
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:45,020
I have an idea.

691
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,100
I tell you what…

692
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:49,930
Miss,

693
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:53,060
I have noticed the bright

694
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:54,500
and spirited look on your face.

695
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,780
You are certain to be a noble.

696
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:57,780
(Fortunetelling)
How about I tell your fortune?

697
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,060
We are having a conversation here.

698
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:00,970
Go, go, go.

699
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,780
Oh, my eyes.

700
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,450
This is bad.

701
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:08,610
Forget it.

702
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:10,540
You two take care.

703
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:12,210
Wait.

704
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:15,210
Sit.

705
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:21,820
Uh…

706
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,890
Sir, what were you going to say?

707
00:27:24,890 --> 00:27:26,780
Why don't you finish it?

708
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,370
I…

709
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,100
Uh…

710
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:31,450
Sir,

711
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,610
from your appearance,

712
00:27:32,930 --> 00:27:33,780
you are

713
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,740
the incarnation of misfortune.

714
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:38,500
You bring misfortune to your parents,

715
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,610
wife and children.

716
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,540
Even a stranger would be in bad luck

717
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,690
after taking a glimpse of you.

718
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:43,580
What nonsense are you talking about?

719
00:27:43,690 --> 00:27:44,650
I am not.

720
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:45,450
You are a total charlatan.

721
00:27:45,450 --> 00:27:45,820
I…

722
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,740
Beat it.

723
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:48,970
Sir, correct me if I'm wrong.

724
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,210
Your parents are gone,

725
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:53,890
and your wives are in misery.

726
00:27:59,890 --> 00:28:00,970
How can his fate be changed?

727
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:05,130
Uh…

728
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,650
Hey…

729
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:12,500
Wait.

730
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,410
Fine.

731
00:28:14,170 --> 00:28:15,340
I believe you can do it.

732
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Um…

733
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,860
His fate

734
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,580
is not all bad.

735
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,820
If you concentrate on your career,

736
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:28,060
you will be in high places.

737
00:28:28,170 --> 00:28:29,740
It is possible for him

738
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:30,930
to be a high-ranking official.

739
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:32,020
Really?

740
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:33,450
Mr. Prime Minister, huh?

741
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,890
But you are not

742
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:38,020
to be involved in marital affairs,

743
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:39,580
or else…

744
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,820
Or else…

745
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,540
- Or else what?
- Or else what?

746
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,820
Or else you'll live

747
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,340
a difficult and tough life,

748
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:53,130
your family will be broken,

749
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,100
and experience mishaps.

750
00:28:58,930 --> 00:28:59,540
Sir,

751
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,580
have you foreseen

752
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,650
a mishap of yours

753
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:05,340
in recent days?

754
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:08,610
Well…

755
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:09,450
Well,

756
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:11,210
here it comes.

757
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:12,370
Beat it.

758
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:12,820
You…

759
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:14,300
Rude!

760
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:16,300
What was that nonsense?

761
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,340
Parents are gone.

762
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,930
Wives are in misery.

763
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:20,060
Just ridiculous!

764
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:21,930
Calm down.

765
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:24,820
I'm sorry.

766
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:26,060
I…

767
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:27,890
I didn't mean to mention it.

768
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,020
It's okay.

769
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:33,130
He reminded me.

770
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:36,060
A difficult

771
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:37,500
and tough life.

772
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,170
Broken family.

773
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,450
Unexpected mishaps.

774
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:47,740
He was right about those.

775
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,540
I experienced them all.

776
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:56,820
No matter

777
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:58,370
how many setbacks

778
00:29:58,500 --> 00:29:59,610
and difficulties you may face
in the future,

779
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,170
I will always be by your side.

780
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:02,650
OK?

781
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,300
Don't worry.

782
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,650
I have experienced

783
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,410
so many hardships.

784
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,300
With you by my side,

785
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,740
I'll make sure

786
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,690
you live a happy life.

787
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,170
But now,

788
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,930
how do we be together?

789
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,650
I came up with a solution,

790
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:29,300
but

791
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,540
that guy interrupted me.

792
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,210
What is it?

793
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,970
What's done cannot be undone.

794
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:47,930
What's done cannot be undone.

795
00:30:48,130 --> 00:30:49,020
What do you mean?

796
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:50,300
I mean.

797
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,370
Just…

798
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,300
It's just that…

799
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:54,860
We need to speed it up.

800
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:55,300
And

801
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,260
if you marry me,

802
00:30:57,780 --> 00:30:58,650
your dad will

803
00:30:58,650 --> 00:31:00,020
not oppose us being together.

804
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,500
Y-You don't

805
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,410
propose to a girl at a restaurant.

806
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:10,740
I…

807
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:26,420
(Haifang Wharf)

808
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:31,500
Her Ladyship didn't come back

809
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,170
along with Mr. Ji?

810
00:31:32,370 --> 00:31:33,890
How am I supposed to know?

811
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,820
Where is she?

812
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,740
I don't know.

813
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:36,410
How can I know?

814
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:37,580
What are you mumbling about?

815
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,060
Go ask Ning Yuxuan.

816
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,650
- Mr. Ji.
- Mr. Ji.

817
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,370
What are you doing?

818
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,860
You didn't steal

819
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,820
my daughter.

820
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:45,890
Get up.

821
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,690
Yes.

822
00:31:52,930 --> 00:31:53,740
What now?

823
00:31:53,930 --> 00:31:55,100
Where is she?

824
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,260
Dad.

825
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:05,970
You're home.

826
00:32:10,410 --> 00:32:12,260
When did you come home?

827
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,740
I waited for you

828
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,780
out there for a long time.

829
00:32:15,970 --> 00:32:17,780
I was so worried.

830
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:20,970
You two were

831
00:32:20,970 --> 00:32:22,210
having a sweet meetup.

832
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:24,500
I didn't want to disturb you.

833
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:31,610
We…

834
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:34,650
We just ran into each other.

835
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:35,740
So,

836
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,610
we had a small chat.

837
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:40,170
I don't care if it's a small chat

838
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:41,860
or a serious vow.

839
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,210
Now,

840
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:44,450
you pack up your things,

841
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,540
and we will set off
tomorrow morning.

842
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:48,260
Pack up my things?

843
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,690
Where are we going?

844
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,170
I haven't prepared anything.

845
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:52,610
What preparations?

846
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:53,820
Stall any longer,

847
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:54,500
and you will become

848
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:55,580
his legal wife.

849
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,580
Man,

850
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,300
remember what I told you?

851
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:06,820
There are so many good men out there.

852
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,210
Why do you have

853
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,650
to be with Ning Yuxuan?

854
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:10,690
Dad,

855
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:14,450
what's so bad about him?

856
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:15,500
Why can't you just

857
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,170
let us be together?

858
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:17,690
He…

859
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,650
He's nothing.

860
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:21,450
Dad,

861
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:23,130
he's the nicest

862
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,020
to me.

863
00:33:24,210 --> 00:33:25,650
Not only that,

864
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:26,820
he also helped the stricken ones,

865
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:27,650
and suppressed the bandits.

866
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:29,100
He's done so many good things.

867
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,540
I'm sure you're aware.

868
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
H-He suppressed the bandits?

869
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,580
Yes.

870
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:34,540
Man,

871
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,100
you know nothing.

872
00:33:37,610 --> 00:33:38,930
Yeah, I know nothing.

873
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:42,100
But I know

874
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,100
that you hired

875
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:44,100
the fortuneteller.

876
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,610
You!

877
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,560
I knew it.

878
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:49,580
You know

879
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,780
that his parents died when he was little,

880
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,060
why did you plot that?

881
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,610
You just put salt

882
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:54,340
on his wound.

883
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,130
Why must you

884
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:56,370
bring up his painful past?

885
00:33:56,690 --> 00:33:58,100
His painful past?

886
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,860
You grew up in
a well-off environment.

887
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:02,130
You have no idea

888
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,340
what real pain is in life.

889
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,300
Maybe I have no idea

890
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:05,500
what real pain is in life.

891
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:06,260
But what I know

892
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,650
is that he suffered a lot
when he was little.

893
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:08,660
I want to protect him.

894
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,450
I want to be with him.

895
00:34:09,450 --> 00:34:10,450
I want to make him happy
for the rest of his life.

896
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,180
Shut up.

897
00:34:12,410 --> 00:34:13,450
You listen to me,

898
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,410
Man,

899
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:16,570
you will not be happy together.

900
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,010
He will not make you happy.

901
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:19,860
You and him

902
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,370
are nothing but a mistake.

903
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,260
Dad,

904
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,300
if you don't fully convince me,

905
00:34:33,930 --> 00:34:35,010
I will not leave.

906
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,340
You can leave if you want.

907
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:37,340
You!

908
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,740
Are you going to hit me?

909
00:34:48,410 --> 00:34:49,530
Now,

910
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,300
you are willing

911
00:34:51,490 --> 00:34:52,820
to betray your family for this man.

912
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:53,780
In the future,

913
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,700
I can't imagine
what you'll be capable of.

914
00:34:58,780 --> 00:34:59,890
Sang Shen, Muxu,

915
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,570
help her pack up her stuff.

916
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:02,780
We'll set off tomorrow morning.

917
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:04,180
You will not

918
00:35:04,450 --> 00:35:06,220
step on the land of Haifang
in this lifetime ever again.

919
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,010
Dad,

920
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,530
I will not go!

921
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,970
You listen to me.

922
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:16,010
As long as I'm still alive,

923
00:35:16,860 --> 00:35:17,930
you will never

924
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,410
be together with Ning Yuxuan!

925
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:27,260
Dad,

926
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,660
but why?

927
00:35:58,890 --> 00:35:59,570
Sang Shen.

928
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:01,780
My Lady.

929
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:05,660
I have made up my mind.

930
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,300
This is completely safe.

931
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,660
My Lady, are you out of your mind?

932
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:13,050
- Your Ladyship.
- Please don't do anything crazy.

933
00:36:13,220 --> 00:36:14,050
Your Ladyship, you…

934
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,570
What are you talking about?

935
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,660
This is sleeping drug.

936
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:19,050
Relax.

937
00:36:19,410 --> 00:36:20,660
12 hours in tea,

938
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,820
and one will fall into a coma
after drinking it.

939
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:23,700
But within the 12 hours…

940
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,010
Are you going to drug your dad?

941
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,140
This is my only option.

942
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,890
After Ning Yuxuan and I

943
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:32,260
get married,

944
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,660
it will be too late
for my dad to separate us.

945
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,370
But

946
00:36:34,570 --> 00:36:36,300
how can you do it, My Lady?

947
00:36:36,450 --> 00:36:37,410
My Lady, you…

948
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:39,780
My Lady.

949
00:36:40,410 --> 00:36:40,970
Sang Shen,

950
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,090
it has to work.

951
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:42,890
There's no turning back.

952
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,180
This is your chance

953
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,260
to make amends.

954
00:36:58,490 --> 00:37:00,370
I will watch Mr. Ji

955
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,370
drink the tea,

956
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,370
and stay by his side.

957
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:11,860
I hope Dad will forgive me.

958
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,180
After all,

959
00:37:14,490 --> 00:37:15,300
Ning Yuxuan and I

960
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,340
have walked so long

961
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:17,180
to get this far.

962
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,220
It really hasn't been easy for us.

963
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:22,180
Your Ladyship, don't feel pressured.

964
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,740
When you and His Lordship

965
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,860
live a happy life
as husband and wife,

966
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,450
your dad…

967
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,220
Your dad will forgive you.

968
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,530
Your Lordship,

969
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,180
a word of advice.

970
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:41,490
Don't be nervous.

971
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:48,930
You've put so much effort into it.

972
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,930
Will Her Ladyship come?

973
00:37:51,090 --> 00:37:52,700
She will.

974
00:37:57,370 --> 00:37:58,340
Ning Yuxuan.

975
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,660
Ning Yuxuan.

976
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:06,940
(Wedding)

977
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:25,780
You

978
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,620
don't like it?

979
00:38:49,050 --> 00:38:49,970
What's the matter?

980
00:38:50,490 --> 00:38:51,410
I don't know.

981
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,090
I-I don't know.

982
00:38:54,090 --> 00:38:54,780
I'm just kind of…

983
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,890
I'm only…

984
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,890
Only a little nervous.

985
00:38:57,890 --> 00:38:59,740
I-I'm scared.

986
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:02,970
It's okay.

987
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:04,890
Don't be nervous.

988
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,570
You've got me.

989
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,620
Nothing will scare you.

990
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:15,890
It will be OK.

991
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:22,140
You set it all up?

992
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:27,660
I…

993
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,930
What I thought was,

994
00:39:30,930 --> 00:39:32,010
I set it up first,

995
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,340
and we can get married

996
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,660
right after you come.

997
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:38,340
Don't be scared.

998
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:39,340
I will tear it all down.

999
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,730
You idiot.

1000
00:39:44,770 --> 00:39:45,130
I…

1001
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,540
I like it.

1002
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:52,460
You bought the flowers?

1003
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,290
Yes.

1004
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:09,820
You chose this one?

1005
00:40:11,060 --> 00:40:11,690
Yes.

1006
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,420
Does it look good on me?

1007
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,690
Sure.

1008
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,900
What is it?

1009
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:26,770
Well,

1010
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:27,860
you are supposed to

1011
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,380
wear it under your neck.

1012
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:32,610
Oh no. Something's wrong.

1013
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:34,690
Impossible.

1014
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:36,020
I checked everything.

1015
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,130
Let me see…

1016
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,730
The fiancée is not supposed

1017
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:40,060
to see the fiancé
before getting married.

1018
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:46,020
I'll leave.

1019
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:47,460
Wait.

1020
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,460
Give me a minute.

1021
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,650
I said, give me a minute.

1022
00:41:04,650 --> 00:41:05,820
Do you hear me?

1023
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,090
How do I look?

1024
00:41:29,090 --> 00:41:29,820
Perfect.

1025
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:31,340
You look so pretty

1026
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:32,090
in your wedding dress.

1027
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:33,420
After tonight,

1028
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,170
you will be the real Mrs. Ning.

1029
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:36,380
I'm so happy

1030
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:37,610
at the thought

1031
00:41:37,610 --> 00:41:38,980
of the lively

1032
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,540
and joyful future life
in the Mansion.

1033
00:41:44,250 --> 00:41:44,940
Your Ladyship,

1034
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:46,460
you are not happy?

1035
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:49,770
I'm okay.

1036
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,540
I just…

1037
00:41:53,170 --> 00:41:54,090
Just what?

1038
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,690
(I just don't)

1039
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:57,210
(have my father's blessing.)

1040
00:41:59,130 --> 00:42:01,290
It's the first time
I wear a wedding dress.

1041
00:42:01,610 --> 00:42:02,610
I'm kind of nervous.

1042
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:05,210
You are now the most

1043
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:06,340
beautiful woman in the world.

1044
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,690
Let me comb your hair.

1045
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,650
First stroke till the end

1046
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:13,130
erases worries in life.

1047
00:42:13,130 --> 00:42:14,460
Second stroke till the end

1048
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,730
brings health and longevity.

1049
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:17,420
Third stroke till the end

1050
00:42:17,570 --> 00:42:19,290
ensures an everlasting marriage.

1051
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:23,570
(Ning Yuxuan,)

1052
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:25,170
(marrying you)

1053
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,460
(is a dream that I have had
for so long.)

1054
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,340
(I hope we'll live)

1055
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,340
(a simple,)

1056
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:33,980
(peaceful, and happy life.)

1057
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,500
(Dad will understand)

1058
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:40,250
(how much we love each other,)

1059
00:42:41,290 --> 00:42:42,940
(and give us his best wishes.)

1060
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:49,130
Who is it?

1061
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:52,730
What are you doing here?

1062
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:53,570
Mr. Yuan.

1063
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:55,130
Glad that I made it.

1064
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,540
No mistake is made.

1065
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:58,250
