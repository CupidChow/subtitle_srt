3
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,290
The feud from the last generation

4
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,140
has troubled you

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,140
for so many years.

6
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,780
Does it have to be passed on

7
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,620
to our generation?

8
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:06,090
Ning Yuxuan.

9
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,660
What do you think?

10
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,220
I'll look into this matter.

11
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,330
Before that,

12
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,260
act as if nothing happened.

13
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:55,300
(Ship Guihai)

14
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:06,260
Mr. Ji.

15
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,140
Miss Ji...

16
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,330
Man left?

17
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,220
Yes.

18
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,570
This time we followed your request

19
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,610
and didn't force her to stay.

20
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,050
But Mr. Ji,

21
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:18,890
I don't understand one thing.

22
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Why did you let her go back

23
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:22,330
this time?

24
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,660
Since this is her choice,

25
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,660
as her father,

26
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:30,170
I should do something for her.

27
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,450
Turn the bow

28
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,610
and go back to Haifang.

29
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,100
Pass my order.

30
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,940
Do your best to protect her.

31
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,290
Yes.

32
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,860
Turn the bow and go back to Haifang.

33
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,570
Yes.

34
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,050
Here.

35
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:43,700
Here.

36
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:45,100
Hurry up.

37
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:15,380
I thought about it again and again,

38
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:17,100
and I always felt that there was a lot

39
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,290
behind what happened back then.

40
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,460
If Yuan Dingshan

41
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,460
pretended to be your father,

42
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,980
who set the fire?

43
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:23,810
As the second chief

44
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:24,900
of the Tea Gang,

45
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,420
how could Yuan Dingshan

46
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:26,690
kill his own men?

47
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,580
Right?

48
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,020
Exactly.

49
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,540
So there must be something wrong.

50
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:33,980
Who could it be?

51
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,220
Lord Tan.

52
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,050
The reason why my father insisted
on sending me away

53
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,580
was because Ling Jianxing

54
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:43,690
had already discovered my identity.

55
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:44,690
Then it's very dangerous

56
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,460
for you to stay.

57
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,130
Not only because of
Nie Sangyu's affairs,

58
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,780
but also because of my identity
as the descendant of the Tea Gang,

59
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,050
so

60
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:56,050
whether I leave or not,
I will be in great danger.

61
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,580
I decided to stay

62
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:00,340
and face it with you.

63
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,220
I will definitely protect you.

64
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,220
Ji Man.

65
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,730
I've been wanting

66
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,780
to tell you something.

67
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,340
Marry me.

68
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,780
Be my real wife.

69
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,660

136
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,100
Ask Yuan Lang

137
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,610
to keep none of them in.

138
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:29,530

185

192
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,820

00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,580
after the Imperial Supplier Contest
is over.

194
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:00,940
Yes.

195
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:01,610
Go.

196
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:07,370
Your Highness.

197
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:08,530
What's wrong?

198
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,130
Your Highness, look.

199
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:12,860
How could this happen?

200
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,010
Your Highness.

201
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,460
I tried the face cream before.

202
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,130
And my face became like this.

203
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,300
Take her away.

204
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:21,340
Yes.

205
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:24,250
Something must have

206
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,100
gone wrong.

207
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:25,700
Your Highness.

208
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,300
We made it with

209
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,410
Mr. Qian's formula.

210
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,340
Ask him here.

211
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:31,980
Yes.

212
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,060
Mr. Qian.

213
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,100
This is the face cream

214
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,890
you promised me?

215
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,220
Rosin, camphor, frankincense, catechin.

216
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:48,300
Your Highness.

217
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,410
There is nothing wrong
with my formula.

218
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,250
How can it be sold?

219
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:57,530
Could it be that there is a problem

220
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,370
with the dosage and ratio?

221
00:12:58,490 --> 00:12:59,460
Give me some time.

222
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:00,770
I will work on it.

223
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:02,730
We are running out of time.

224
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,730
If it goes on like this,

225
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,490
it will be all over.

226
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:11,580
Your Highness.

227
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,940
I have another way.

228
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,580
There is a strong medicine,

229
00:13:14,770 --> 00:13:15,770
the more you use it,

230
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,100
the more obvious the effect will be.

231
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:17,820
It can not only

232
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:19,010
improve the effect quickly,

233
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,700
but also improve the colour and lustre

234
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,860
of the face cream.

235
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:22,530
It's just that

236
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,610
if it is used for too long,

237
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:26,860
it will produce much toxicity.

238
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:31,580
I don't care.

239
00:13:31,770 --> 00:13:32,580
I have to

240
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,460
win this game.

241
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:37,180
Add

242
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,580
whatever it is.

243
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,300
Yes.

244
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:42,490
I am on it.

245
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:54,890
What to do?

246
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,730
Why haven't the bottles arrived yet?

247
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:58,060
It will be too late

248
00:13:58,060 --> 00:13:59,250
if we don't bottle them now.

249
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,860
If we can't finish

250
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,010
making 1,000 bottles
of Feiwan Face Cream in the afternoon,

251
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,490
we will be disqualified.

252
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:04,370
Didn't they say

253
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,180
the bottles would arrive in the morning?

254
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:07,130
The ship must have landed.

255
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,060
Right.

256
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:10,890
Why hasn't it arrived?

257
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:11,490
No worries.

258
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:12,730
Maybe it was delayed on the way.

259
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,940
Let's wait for a while.

260
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,300
My Lady!

261
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:23,180
My Lady!

262
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,490
How is it going?

263
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,340
My Lady.

264
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,340
Where are the bottles?

265
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:28,940
Our bottles...

266
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:29,860
Arrived?

267
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,490
Our bottles were all robbed.

268
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,770
Robbed?

269
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,940
Originally, our ship

270
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:34,980
had been offshore

271
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,370
and was about to dock soon.

272
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,250
But a group of pirates

273
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,410
appeared from nowhere

274
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:40,180
and snatched all the bottles.

275
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,130
It must be

276
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:41,730
Wen Wan's trick again.

277
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:42,580
No worries.

278
00:14:42,770 --> 00:14:43,340
Let's think about

279
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,100
what to do next.

280
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,650
If there is no bottle,

281
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,490
we will be considered forfeited the game.

282
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,060
So much of our hard work

283
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,650
cannot be wasted.

284
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:50,300
What to do?

285
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:52,060
What to do?

286
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,250
Let me think.

287
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:54,460
Let me think.

288
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,250
What to do?

289
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,940
What to do?

290
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:19,980
Your Highness.

291
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,410
No matter how capable she is,

292
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,130
she won't make it to the contest.

293
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,610
Sir, qualified.

294
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:48,580
Joy Cosmetics

295
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,730
delivered goods on time and in quantity.

296
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:51,820
Qualified.

297
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:13,700
Why hasn't Mrs. Ning

298
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,220
been here yet?

299
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,340
Hasn't she

300
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:19,370
finished it yet?

301
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,980
The incense is still burning.

302
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:23,610
Mr. Ling.

303
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,700
You are still as impatient as ever.

304
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:29,610
Mr. Ning.

305
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,100
At present, only Joy Cosmetics

306
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,890
can deliver such a quantity of goods

307
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,980
in Haifang,

308
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,250
and there is no one else.

309
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,370
Is it that you're not making a decision

310
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,100
because you want to favor Mrs. Ning?

311
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
After the incense burns out,

312
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,460
I will naturally announce
the disqualification of

313
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:47,100
Haoxue Cosmetics from the contest.

314
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:50,010
But before that,

315
00:16:51,130 --> 00:16:53,220
everyone has to obey the rules.

316
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:58,410
Princess Ruyue.

317
00:16:58,700 --> 00:16:59,730
No worries.

318
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,610
Just wait until the incense burns out.

319
00:17:28,170 --> 00:17:30,450
Mrs. Ning has strong self-esteem.

320
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,970
I'm afraid she's going

321
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,130
to hold you back this time.

322
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,890
My wife will never let me down.

323
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,540
Do you trust your wife that much?

324
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,060
The higher the expectations,

325
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:43,860
the greater the disappointment.

326
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,500
Of course I believe her.

327
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,690
After you get married,

328
00:17:51,260 --> 00:17:52,410
you will understand

329
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:54,930
what trust between a couple is.

330
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:22,690
Mr. Ning.

331
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:24,020
The incense is almost

332
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:25,650
all burned out.

333
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:28,690
You!

334
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:37,610
Selection officer.

335
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:39,930
Is it now possible to conclude that

336
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:42,300
Joy Cosmetics is the only one qualified

337
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,130
in this contest?

338
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:04,210
I hereby announce that

339
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:05,610
in this round, Joy Cosmetics...

340
00:19:05,610 --> 00:19:06,820
Hold on.

341
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:16,410
Go.

342
00:19:17,970 --> 00:19:18,890
Hold on.

343
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,260
Hurry up.

344
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:41,890
Put them here.

345
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,060
Sir.

346
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,780
Haoxue Cosmetics delivers on time.

347
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,930
Please check it out.

348
00:19:46,690 --> 00:19:48,170
Haoxue Cosmetics delivers on time.

349
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,210
Selection officer.

350
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,340
Check it now.

351
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,130
If the products are qualified,

352
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,170
they will compete together.

353
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:32,410
Sir.

354
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:33,170
Qualified.

355
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,410
Ms. Nie.

356
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,170
You didn't show up

357
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,650
until the last moment.

358
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,580
Mr. Ling.

359
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,060
I'm not the one to wait

360
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,210
until the last minute.

361
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,580
We signed the goods
with the porcelain kilns very early,

362
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:53,860
but before we received the goods,

363
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:55,820
we were told that someone

364
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:58,370
suddenly took over all
the porcelain kilns in Haifang.

365
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,820
So

366
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:02,890
in desperation,

367
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,500
we could only transfer

368
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,340
a batch of goods from the sea.

369
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,340
But the ship was robbed by pirates

370
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,820
before it docked.

371
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:09,930
Mr. Ling.

372
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:11,450
Don't you think it's a coincidence?

373
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,580
We almost missed it.

374
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:17,890
What to do?

375
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,130
What to do? What to do?

376
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,100
How to...

377
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,650
Muxu.

378
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,580
Go get me a brush and paper.

379
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:33,890
Hurry up.

380
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:35,580
Okay.

381
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,340
Those who have purchased
Feiwan Face Cream

382
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,890
can get

383
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:45,970
a face cream exchange voucher

384
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:47,170
with the used bottle in our store,

385
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,890
only before 1:00 p.m. today.

386
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,170
Will it work?

387
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,500
We have to make every possible effort.

388
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:52,890
Just take a try and we'll know.

389
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,930
Sang Shen, Muxu.

390
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,930
Take everyone

391
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,860
to paste it all over the gate.

392
00:21:56,970 --> 00:21:57,580
Okay.

393
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:58,820
Hold on.

394
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,260
And all over the streets and lanes.

395
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,970
Got it.

396
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,610
Okay, let's go.

397
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:03,930
Go.

398
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:05,060
Let's go.

399
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,820
Go.

400
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,500
Go.

401
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,500
Will it work?

402
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,740
Why hasn't anyone come yet?

403
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:17,300
Right.

404
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:18,890
Hasn't anyone come yet?

405
00:22:18,890 --> 00:22:19,890
Not yet.

406
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,100
If we wait any longer,

407
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:22,370
it will be too late.

408
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,210
We are running out of time.

409
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,260
(Voucher)

410
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,170
What to do?

411
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,020
Let's wait.

412
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,370
Is there really

413
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:39,930
no other way?

414
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:47,020
(Voucher)

415
00:22:54,610 --> 00:22:55,170
My Lady.

416
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,450
Look.

417
00:22:58,970 --> 00:22:59,690
Come on.

418
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:00,740
Let's go.

419
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,370
Ask them.

420
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,060
Ask them.

421
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:10,740
May I ask

422
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,860
if the empty bottle

423
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:12,690
can be exchanged?

424
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:17,890
Yes.

425
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,410
I also want it!

426
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,580
Everyone can get it.

427
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,820
No worries.

428
00:23:21,890 --> 00:23:22,890
No worries.

429
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:25,300
Everyone can get it.

430
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:26,500
No worries.

431
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:26,970
Thank you.

432
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,130
Everyone can get it.

433
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:28,890
We will give everyone it.

434
00:23:28,890 --> 00:23:29,500
Everyone can get it.

435
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,300
One by one.

436
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:39,610
No worries.

437
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:40,820
Everyone can get it.

438
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:41,740
Fortunately,

439
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:44,130
all the guests of Haoxue Cosmetics

440
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,970
are our strongest backing.

441
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:47,450
So

442
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,210
with everyone's help,

443
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:52,020
we accomplished

444
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,580
the impossible task.

445
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:58,860
Ms. Nie, well done.

446
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,970
The situation is quite clear.

447
00:24:01,450 --> 00:24:03,450
Only two shops completed the task.

448
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,650
I think

449
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:07,060
it's time to announce it.

450
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,450
This round

451
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,930
is about production capacity.

452
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:11,970
Qingxin Cosmetics

453
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:13,410
failed to deliver the products on time.

454
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,410
Out.

455
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,100
Joy Cosmetics

456
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:19,370
and Haoxue Cosmetics entered the final.

457
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,130
Great.

458
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,260
Awesome!

459
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,100
Awesome!

460
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,540
Princess Ruyue.

461
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:41,450
Are you satisfied with the result?

462
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,300
It's not the final yet.

463
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:45,930
None of us will know

464
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,740
what the outcome will be.

465
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,450
Okay.

466
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,930
See you in the final.

467
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,020
We were about to manage it.

468
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,370
I didn't expect this vicious woman

469
00:25:11,370 --> 00:25:13,020
to save the day.

470
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,610
Don't worry, sir.

471
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:16,740
I will definitely do my best

472
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:18,820
to prevent Joy Cosmetics

473
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,060
from losing to Haoxue Cosmetics.

474
00:25:21,450 --> 00:25:23,100
You'd better make it.

475
00:25:25,060 --> 00:25:25,890
Sir.

476
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:29,500
Have you found out about

477
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,860
that fake Nie Sangyu?

478
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:34,340
Don't ask

479
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,300
about things

480
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,860
you shouldn't ask.

481
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,060
Sir.

482
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:47,930
Go prepare yourself.

483
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:48,930
Yes.

484
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:54,930
Sir.

485
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,780
I have been following Nie Xiangyuan

486
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,650
and seen him enter a temple.

487
00:25:58,970 --> 00:25:59,890
Then I saw him

488
00:26:00,370 --> 00:26:01,780
put this in it.

489
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:08,100
(Spirit Tablet of
the Deceased Daughter Nie Sangyu)

490
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:18,370
Eunuch Li.

491
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:19,210
This is

492
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,300
the new product Wrinkle Decrease Cream

493
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:21,820
that Haoxue Cosmetics will use
in the finals.

494
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,860
Please.

495
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,020
Okay.

496
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:29,820
(Sealed until the finals
of the Imperial Supplier Contest)

497
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,970
I wish Ms. Nie

498
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:33,210
good results in the finals.

499
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:34,930
Thank you for your lucky words.

500
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:36,450
Ms. Nie.

501
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:37,970
See you.

502
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,340
I heard that the assessment
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs

503
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,410
is quite strict.

504
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,690
Pharmacology, effect, cost and price

505
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,170
will all be considered as criteria.

506
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,890
The stricter the standards,

507
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,970
the better for us.

508
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,450
Wrinkle Decrease Cream worked well

509
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,130
this time around.

510
00:26:58,610 --> 00:27:00,930
We will definitely be able to
win the championship.

511
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,540
Thanks for your formula

512
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,170
this time.

513
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,860
I want to see

514
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:07,820
what new tricks Ruyue

515
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,100
can come up with.

516
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,650
Whatever she's up to,

517
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,100
the Emperor

518
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,260
is coming to Haifang soon.

519
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,340
And you are the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate

520
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,370
appointed by him.

521
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:16,410
No matter how powerful she is,

522
00:27:16,410 --> 00:27:17,890
she can't do evil

523
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:18,780
under the nose of the Emperor.

524
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,580
Done.

525
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,130
My painting skills are poor.

526
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:50,610
See if there is any resemblance.

527
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,170
Siwei.

528
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,300
The person in the painting

529
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,690
is much prettier than me.

530
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,060
In my mind,

531
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,060
the painting

532
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,780
is less than one-tenth of yours.

533
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,100
I didn't expect

534
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:11,970
General Tao,

535
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:12,930
who was so dull before,

536
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,610
to be so touching when
talking about lover's prattle.

537
00:28:16,930 --> 00:28:17,540
I'm usually

538
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:18,780
not that well-spoken.

539
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:20,970
But I think the painting

540
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:22,690
goes well with a poem.

541
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:24,860
What poem?

542
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:28,540
The snow melted in the northwest frontier,
and the soldiers returned on horseback.

543
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:31,540
Under the bright and clear moon, the soldiers
in the outpost are playing the Qiang flute.

544
00:28:31,930 --> 00:28:34,170
Where is the plum blossom
full of lovesickness?

545
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,450
It seems to fall all over the mountain

546
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,610
with the wind.

547
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,930
The poem sounds a bit sad.

548
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:44,060
Why does it match this painting?

549
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:47,260
I have been fighting all year round,

550
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:48,580
and I am used to

551
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,370
seeing people displaced by war.

552
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,210
Whenever this time came,

553
00:28:53,210 --> 00:28:54,820
I would think of this poem.

554
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:57,930
At that time, I was thinking that

555
00:28:58,060 --> 00:28:58,690
I had to

556
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,060
abandon my family

557
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:02,130
to protect the safety
of the common people.

558
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,410
Until your appearance,

559
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:08,500
I gave up

560
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:09,820
my original oath

561
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,690
and decided to start a family with you.

562
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:12,780
But don't worry.

563
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:14,410
I will do my best to protect

564
00:29:15,930 --> 00:29:17,890
both the common people
and our family.

565
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,580
I remember your sister

566
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:32,300
loved this poem
when we were in school.

567
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,370
Why don't you ask your sister

568
00:29:36,370 --> 00:29:38,100
to write the poem on this painting

569
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,130
as a blessing

570
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:40,410
to us?

571
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,860
Okay.

572
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,610
My Lady.

573
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,500
Have some water.

574
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:02,500
Okay, put it here.

575
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,410
Sangyu.

576
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,410
Qingyun.

577
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:10,970
Why are you here?

578
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:11,540
Sangyu.

579
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:12,450
Sangyu, look.

580
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,820
This is my portrait

581
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,610
Siwei painted for me.

582
00:30:14,890 --> 00:30:16,210
Is it prettier

583
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:17,610
than me?

584
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:19,740
Let me see.

585
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,820
Good painting skills.

586
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:25,060
But

587
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,020
the painting is far worse
than my sister.

588
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,020
Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.

589
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,500
It is enough that you like it.

590
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,060
I am relieved to see

591
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,060
you are so happy now.

592
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:38,930
Sangyu.

593
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:40,300
I came to you today

594
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,930
to ask you to write a poem

595
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,890
on this painting.

596
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,060
Later on,

597
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,130
I will put it

598
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:46,820
in the bedroom of me and Siwei

599
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,650
and appreciate it from time to time.

600
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,780
Write a poem?

601
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,580
Are you assured of entrusting me

602
00:30:54,780 --> 00:30:56,410
with such an important task?

603
00:30:56,610 --> 00:30:58,020
Of course.

604
00:30:58,340 --> 00:30:58,740
You are

605
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,450
the matchmaker of me and Siwei.

606
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,610
Your blessing

607
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,410
means a lot to me.

608
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,300
Well...

609
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:09,580
Okay.

610
00:31:11,650 --> 00:31:13,540
Tell me what should I write.

611
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:19,210
The snow melted in the northwest frontier,
and the soldiers returned on horseback.

612
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:22,020
Under the bright and clear moon, the soldiers
in the outpost are playing the Qiang flute.

613
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:24,500
Where is the plum blossom
full of lovesickness?

614
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,860
It seems to fall all over the mountain
with the wind.

615
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,260
This is Siwei's

616
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,690
favorite poem.

617
00:31:30,610 --> 00:31:30,930
Sangyu.

618
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:31,690
Just write it down,

619
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:32,450
okay?

620
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:34,930
Okay.

621
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,130
After I finish my work
with your brother-in-law,

622
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,610
I will write it after I get back today.

623
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,060
Thank you, Sangyu.

624
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:43,370
Look at you now.

625
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,450
As I came to Haifang all the way,

626
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,450
I found that the scene here

627
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,930
is different from before.

628
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:08,060
In just a few months,

629
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,970
Ning Yuxuan completely

630
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:11,210
changed Haifang's appearance.

631
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:16,780
Ling Jianxing.

632
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,340
Ling Jianxing!

633
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,540
You...

634
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,130
Your contribution

635
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:28,820
is no less than that of Ning Yuxuan.

636
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:33,890
The previous mistakes in Haifang

637
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,540
were indeed my fault.

638
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,060
But for this final,

639
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:40,210
I am

640
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:41,260
fully prepared.

641
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:50,210
I've got solid evidence

642
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:52,100
of that counterfeit.

643
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,260
This time,

644
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:56,340
Ning Yuxuan

645
00:32:57,170 --> 00:32:58,580
is definitely doomed.

646
00:33:05,410 --> 00:33:06,210
Remember.

647
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,450
In the battle of Imperial Supplier Contest,

648
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,300
only one of you and Ning Yuxuan

649
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,450
can survive.

650
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,780
I will

651
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:33,860
follow the instruction.

652
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:13,180
After wearing the robe,

653
00:34:13,570 --> 00:34:14,300
you are more and more like

654
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:15,300
the second-rank lady
with imperial mandate.

655
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,050
I learned it from you.

656
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:20,740
Dad.

657
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:21,490
General Nie.

658
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:23,620
Go.

659
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,660
Here.

660
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:30,450
Mr. Ning.

661
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:33,450
Mr. Ling.

662
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:35,860
Mr. Ling.

663
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:40,180
Mr. Ning.

664
00:34:40,490 --> 00:34:42,450
You don't look well.

665
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:44,930
Are you being afraid that

666
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,010
your wife will lose completely

667
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,740
in a while?

668
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:48,490
Really?

669
00:34:48,740 --> 00:34:49,530
Mr. Ling.

670
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,300
Did you know the result
in advance again?

671
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,570
Mr. Ning, don't slander me.

672
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,780
The quality and reputation of a shop

673
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:56,930
cannot be achieved

674
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:57,970
in a day or two.

675
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,570
I am just predicting

676
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,340
the champion of each category.

677
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,930
The quality?

678
00:35:03,890 --> 00:35:04,340
So

679
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,180
Mr. Ling is also optimistic
about Haoxue Cosmetics.

680
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,930
Nonsense.

681
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,890
We'll see

682
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:13,340
who is the final champion.

683
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,660
Here comes Lord Tan.

684
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:41,890
Greetings to Lord Tan.

685
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,340
You are...

686
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,530
This is Ruyue.

687
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,930
Greetings to Uncle.

688
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,050
You are Ruyue.

689
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,660
You were born in the desert,

690
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,890
and you have been weak since childhood.

691
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,860
When your mother went back
to the capital to visit relatives,

692
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:56,220
unfortunately I wasn't at home

693
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,220
and didn't see you.

694
00:35:57,450 --> 00:35:57,890
I didn't expect you

695
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,930
to be so beautiful.

696
00:36:00,970 --> 00:36:02,490
How are your parents?

697
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:03,450
They are good.

698
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,220
They know that I can see you

699
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:05,970
during my visit to Haifang this time,

700
00:36:05,970 --> 00:36:07,050
so they asked me to greet you.

701
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,700
I heard recently that

702
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:09,970
you are also going to be in the finals

703
00:36:09,970 --> 00:36:11,370
of the Imperial Supplier Contest.

704
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:12,490
I thought

705
00:36:12,490 --> 00:36:14,140
it was just a joke.

706
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:14,860
I didn't expect that

707
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:17,140
we would actually meet here.

708
00:36:17,490 --> 00:36:18,180
Good.

709
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,220
Females are as excellent
as their male peers.

710
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,340
But

711
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,930
it's the Imperial Supplier Contest.

712
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,820
And a fair competition is a must.

713
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:27,700
I can't do you any favor.

714
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,620
I participated in
the Imperial Supplier Contest this time

715
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:31,260
to prove to the world that

716
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,180
I can stand out

717
00:36:32,180 --> 00:36:34,260
and honor my ancestors

718
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,220
regardless of the status

719
00:36:35,220 --> 00:36:36,370
of my uncle

720
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:37,660
and parents.

721
00:36:37,970 --> 00:36:39,010
Good.

722
00:36:43,010 --> 00:36:45,140
Isn't it Consul Ning?

723
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,260
I was so busy catching up

724
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,740
with my niece just now

725
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,570
that I didn't notice

726
00:36:50,570 --> 00:36:52,450
Consul Ning and Mrs. Ning.

727
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:54,370
My eyesight

728
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,050
is getting worse day by day.

729
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:57,890
Not at all.

730
00:36:58,450 --> 00:36:59,660
Greeting to Lord Tan.

731
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:01,780
Is Mrs. Ning also going to participate

732
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:03,050
in the finals
of the Imperial Supplier Contest?

733
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,300
Ruyue.

734
00:37:07,090 --> 00:37:09,180
Mr. Ning's wife

735
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,930
is a well-known figure

736
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,450
both in the capital and in Haifang.

737
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:18,620
Watch out this time.

738
00:37:18,970 --> 00:37:20,220
Don't worry, Uncle.

739
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,970
I will definitely

740
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,370
try my best to

741
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,820
compete with Mrs. Ning.

742
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:33,220
It looks like

743
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,620
a tough fight.

744
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:39,370
Don't worry.

745
00:37:40,370 --> 00:37:41,570
We'll win.

746
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:58,010
Here comes His Majesty.

747
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:17,090
Long live Your Majesty.

748
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:20,660
Please stand up.

749
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:23,180
Thank you, Your Majesty.

750
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,890
Please take a seat.

751
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,780
I visited Haifang

752
00:38:33,890 --> 00:38:36,090
a few years ago.

753
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,570
At that time, it was deserted

754
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:40,090
and unfrequented.

755
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:41,570
But now Haifang

756
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,370
is prosperous.

757
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,930
This is all thanks to you.

758
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:48,410
I will keep it in my mind.

759
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,370
This Imperial Supplier Contest

760
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:52,180
should have been supervised
by the Ministry of Internal Affairs.

761
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,860
But I insisted on coming.

762
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,740
This is related to our country,

763
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,890
and it is also the first
Imperial Supplier Contest

764
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,090
since the establishment
of the Shipping Department.

765
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,220
I hereby announce

766
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,450
the official start

767
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,300
of the Imperial Supplier Contest's

768
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,970
award banquet.

769
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,660
The award banquet officially starts.

770
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,090
Ever since His Majesty

771
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:30,260
ordered the establishment
of the Shipping Department,

772
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:32,050
Haifang has enjoyed peace,

773
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,370
prosperity

774
00:39:34,370 --> 00:39:36,890
and developed trade.

775
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:39,010
Today's general election
for the Imperial Supplier Contest

776
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:40,260
shows His Majesty's intention to

777
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,780
enhance the communication

778
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,180
between the royal family
and the common people,

779
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:45,660
and select the best from all walks of life

780
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:47,260
to become the new imperial suppliers.

781
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,410
The imperial suppliers

782
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:49,860
will elect a winner

783
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:52,010
as the chairman of the Sea Trade Guild.

784
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:54,370
After the unanimous approval
of the Ministry of Internal Affairs,

785
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:55,620
the final champions of each category

786
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,700
have been determined.

787
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,860
It will be up to me

788
00:39:59,050 --> 00:40:00,260
to announce

789
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:03,260
the final champion
of the face cream category.

790
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:07,300
In the face cream category,

791
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,780
Haifang Joy Cosmetics
and Haifang Haoxue Cosmetics

792
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:11,820
were shortlisted for the finals.

793
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,700
The champion is

794
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,140
Joy Cosmetics.

795
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:47,890
Thank you, Your Majesty.

796
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,180
Mrs. Ning.

797
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:03,570
Thank you for letting me win.

798
00:41:05,620 --> 00:41:06,890
Congratulations to Princess Ruyue.

799
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:14,180
Why are your hands

800
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:15,530
festering so badly?

801
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,490
Nothing.

802
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,970
Your Majesty.

803
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:34,780
I have something to say.

804
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,220
Sure.

805
00:41:36,490 --> 00:41:37,490
Just now I saw

806
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:38,490
Princess Ruyue's hands

807
00:41:38,490 --> 00:41:39,300
were severely festered.

808
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:40,620
So I thought of

809
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,860
Feiwan Face Cream,

810
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,930
which can reduce swelling
and relieve pain.

811
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:44,090
May I gift Princess Ruyue

812
00:41:44,090 --> 00:41:45,780
a few of them?

813
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,450
Thank you, Mrs. Ning,

814
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,260
for your consideration.

815
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,860
If I'm right,

816
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,860
Joy Cosmetics' products

817
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:04,490
also have the effect
of reducing swelling and relieving pain.

818
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:06,570
Your Highness, why didn't you try?

819
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,820
Mind your own business.

820
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:14,140
Don't you dare use it,

821
00:42:14,530 --> 00:42:15,570
or

822
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:17,220
is there any problem with the product?

823
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:19,570
Mrs. Ning.

824
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:22,260
Don't venomously slander me.

825
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,660
Your Majesty.

826
00:42:24,820 --> 00:42:26,530
I have been developing
Scar Recovering Cream for many years,

827
00:42:26,530 --> 00:42:27,090
so

828
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:28,410
I know well

829
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:29,220
about the ingredients of
the face creams in the market.

830
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:31,780
In fact, most face creams

831
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:33,340
contain a small amount
of mercury powder

832
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,220
because it can

833
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:36,050
make the skin more white

834
00:42:36,050 --> 00:42:36,890
and translucent.

835
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:37,700
However,

836
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,140
excessive mercury powder

837
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,490
can cause poisoning.

838
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:42,860
So

839
00:42:43,010 --> 00:42:45,050
I wonder if Princess Ruyue's hands

840
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,820
are like this because of...

841
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:47,260
On my hands are just

842
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:49,140
normal flower pink rashes.

843
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:52,180
Pollen rashes only cause redness,

844
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:53,530
not ragged skin.

845
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,570
This is obviously

846
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:55,890
a manifestation of
mercury powder poisoning.

847
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:59,300
So I boldly guess that

848
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,660
Princess Ruyue's hands

849
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:02,370
became like this

850
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:04,370
because of poisoning caused

851
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,180
by excessive mercury powder.

852
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:06,970
Nie Sangyu.

853
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,410
How dare you make irresponsible remarks

854
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,370
in front of His Majesty?

855
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:12,820
Your Majesty.

856
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:15,340
This has nothing to do with
winning or losing.

857
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,490
It's just that

858
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:18,370
if Haifang's face cream industry

859
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:19,700
takes the championship product this time

860
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,410
as a benchmark

861
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,890
and uses a large amount
of mercury powder,

862
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:22,970
the consequences in the long run

863
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:24,090
will be disastrous.

864
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,370
So

865
00:43:26,370 --> 00:43:27,410
I propose that

866
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:29,340
if Princess Ruyue

867
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,140
has a clear conscience,

868
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,050
let's verify it on the spot.

869
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:32,300
If there is no problem,

870
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:34,300
your innocence will be proved.
