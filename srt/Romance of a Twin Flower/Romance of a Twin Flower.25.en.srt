00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:49,140
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

4
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:04,820
Your Ladyship.

5
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,110
Your Ladyship, sorry.

6
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,540
Sorry.

7
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,940
(Bank notes)

8
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,860
Your Ladyship.

9
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:20,980
I...

10
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,300
I have no choice.

11
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,190
I will definitely pay back the money
as soon as possible.

12
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,190
Your Ladyship, sorry.

13
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,140
Sorry.

14
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,820
I will definitely pay back the money
as soon as possible

15
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,820
Miss Xue.

16
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:43,390
Why haven't you gone home yet?

17
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,420
Miss Wen.

18
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,260
Why are you here?

19
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:50,260
I was very worried that

20
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,180
you didn't return late at night,

21
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,740
so I came to pick you up.

22
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,060
I didn't expect you

23
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,660
to be doing something like this.

24
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:03,220
Well.

25
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,100
Her Ladyship asked me

26
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,260
to get her some bank notes.

27
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,220
I see.

28
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:14,500
Then let me give them to her for you.

29
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,140
No need.

30
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,300
What's up, Miss Xue?

31
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,860
Miss Wen, it's my fault.

32
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,980
I am begging you.

33
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,940
Don't tell Her Ladyship, okay?

34
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,300
Miss Wen, it's my fault.

35
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
I shouldn't have taken the money.

36
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,380
I was temporarily obsessed.

37
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:33,700
Miss Wen, I'm begging you.

38
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,340
I'm begging you.

39
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,460
Don't tell anyone else.

40
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:36,740
Miss Xue.

41
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,420
We are family.

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,100
If you have any difficulties,

43
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,260
just let me know.

44
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,700
I can help you.

45
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,340
I...

46
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,300
Miss Wen, here's the thing.

47
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,460
I have a brother

48
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,700
who is a good-for-nothing.

49
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,220
He owes a lot of money

50
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,620
to others.

51
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:52,140
We really need

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,780
a lot of money right now

53
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,500
to pay off the debts.

54
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,580
Miss Wen, I'm begging you.

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,540
I will definitely pay back the money

56
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,540
as soon as possible.

57
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,260
Miss Wen, I'm begging you.

58
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,220
So that's the thing?

59
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:06,740
I can help you

60
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,100
with money problems.

61
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:11,100
I will pretend not to see

62
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,260
what happened today.

63
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,860
I...

64
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:18,700
Thank you, Miss Wen.

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
It's just that

66
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,420
I also need a little favor

67
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,660
from you.

68
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,540
What favor?

69
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,300
It's not time yet.

70
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:34,900
I will come to you

71
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,540
when needed.

72
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:41,860
Sit down.

73
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,780
What's going on?

74
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,100
What are you going to give me?

75
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,540
For you.

76
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:52,820
What's this?

77
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,060
It is said to be a crystal from overseas.

78
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,980
So nice.

79
00:05:02,060 --> 00:05:02,900
Put it on me.

80
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,460
Okay.

81
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:05,020
The shopkeeper said that

82
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:05,780
the crystal

83
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,300
has a special meaning.

84
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:10,300
What?

85
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,540
A lifetime

86
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:16,860
of the two.

87
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,060
But it's three of us.

88
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:25,740
Don't forget Miss Wen.

89
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:30,180
Why did you

90
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,420
marry her?

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,380
I knew

92
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:33,580
you were going to ask that
sooner or later.

93
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:35,580
Miss Wen and I...

94
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
In fact, Wen Wan and I

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:40,820
have neither a marriage certificate
nor bride-price,

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:42,980
so we are not a real couple.

97
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,140
I took her into the Mansion

98
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,860
just to give her

99
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,740
a place to stay.

100
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:46,940
Don't ask for

101
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,700
the specific reasons.

102
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,860
You only need to believe that

103
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,980
I've never betrayed you.

104
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:56,460
Alright.

105
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,420
I trust you.

106
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,220
Miss Wen.

107
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,740
Miss Wen.

108
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,060
I want to see Qian Lianxue.

109
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,140
Yes, Miss Wen.

110
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,180
(See you in the garden
at 11 o'clock tonight)

111
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,180
Miss Wen.

112
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,460
Miss Xue, here you are.

113
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,580
Take a seat.

114
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:03,260
Miss Xue.

115
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,300
Do you remember

116
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,620
you are going to do me a favor?

117
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,620
Yes.

118
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,740
Her Ladyship has been

119
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,740
riding on the crest of success lately.

120
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,580
Not only is she favored by His Lordship,

121
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,540
but her business

122
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:18,060
is also thriving.

123
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,860
I really envy her.

124
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:23,180
Miss Wen.

125
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,500
What do you want me to do?

126
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,380
I heard that

127
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:31,420
there is an extremely rare drug

128
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,940
in the black market in the east of the city.

129
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,940
Once one takes it,

130
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,820
it will make him twitch

131
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,220
and hard to control himself.

132
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,100
Twitch?

133
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,180
Miss Wen.

134
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,620
You want me to hurt someone?

135
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,260
Sorry, Miss Wen.

136
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,500
I can't make it.

137
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,060
Whose life is more important,

138
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,540
your brother's or Nie Sangyu's?

139
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,780
Come on.

140
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,660
Sit.

141
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,620
Listen carefully.

142
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,300
Since I can buy your brother's life

143
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,940
with one thousand taels,

144
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,540
I can also easily

145
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,860
destroy him.

146
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:21,780
How do you know

147
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,860
it is one thousand taels?

148
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:32,660
It's you!

149
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,500
You sent someone

150
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,820
to take my brother to the casino.

151
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,500
Miss Xue.

152
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,220
You let me down.

153
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,420
Just a casino?

154
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:46,540
Why don't you think about

155
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:50,740
why your younger brother

156
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:53,220
came to Haifang

157
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,660
soon after you just started working
in Haoxue Cosmetics?

158
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:58,740
You!

159
00:08:59,380 --> 00:09:00,860
To tell you the truth,

160
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,420
The letter from the casino to you

161
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,980
was arranged by me.

162
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,060
And I'm the one

163
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,900
who invited your brother here.

164
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,140
Wen Wan.

165
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,020
Why are you so vicious?

166
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,580
You now have two options.

167
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,820
One.

168
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:29,180
Wait to collect your brother's body.

169
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:31,860
Two.

170
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,940
Take my money

171
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:36,860
to save your brother.

172
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
Alright.

173
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,740
When to take actions?

174
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,340
Of course the sooner the better.

175
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:55,940
I hope to

176
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,620
hear good news from you tomorrow.

177
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,820
After all,

178
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,820
I want to save your brother soon.

179
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,140
Your Ladyship.

180
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,620
Your Ladyship.

181
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,260
The poison.

182
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:27,740
Miss Wen.

183
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,980
What else do you have to say?

184
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,460
What's wrong,

185
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,420
Sangyu?

186
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,580
Why haven't you rested yet?

187
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,460
Wen Wan.

188
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:44,940
Stop acting.

189
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,660
I hate it most when someone

190
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,620
uses my brother to threaten me.

191
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,380
I will hand over the drug

192
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,820
to His Lordship.

193
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,580
This is the evidence

194
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,900
that you want to hurt Her Ladyship.

195
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,780
Your Lordship.

196
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,220
Ning Yuxuan.

197
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:05,180
What's going on?

198
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:10,740
Her Ladyship and Miss Xue...

199
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:13,740
Something's wrong.

200
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,860
Yuxuan.

201
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:17,540
Wen Wan threatened me

202
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,580
to poison Her Ladyship.

203
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,460
Don't...

204
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,580
This is the poison.

205
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:25,100
Your Lordship, I was wronged.

206
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,500
I didn't.

207
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,780
Stop quibbling.

208
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,260
We have both human testimony
and material evidence.

209
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,260
What else do you have to say?

210
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,380
I never thought of

211
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,820
poisoning Her Ladyship.

212
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,460
You keep saying that

213
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,580
this is evidence.

214
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,300
But here is the reishi powder

215
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,780
that I worked so hard

216
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,180
to get,

217
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,940
not poison at all.

218
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:43,500
Wen Wan.

219
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,460
How can you

220
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:45,220
reverse black and white?

221
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,700
You!

222
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,500
Miss Wen.

223
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:48,020
Since this is reishi powder,

224
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:48,740
I'll take it.

225
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,500
Whether it is poison or medicine

226
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,580
will be known once tested.

227
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,700
Gui Bai.

228
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,300
Go get a doctor.

229
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,780
Yes.

230
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,940
No need.

231
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,620
Ning Yuxuan.

232
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,220
I got Miss Wen wrong.

233
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,020
Sorry to

234
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,980
have misunderstood your kindness.

235
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,500
Since you are out of kindness,

236
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,500
you can give it to Sangyu
in a fair manner,

237
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,140
why did you give it to Qian Lianxue

238
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:16,980
in the middle of the night?

239
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:21,180
Her Ladyship misunderstood me before.

240
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:23,980
I dare not bring it to you in person,

241
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,540
lest you think

242
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,340
I am ill-intentioned.

243
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,100
Besides, the reishi powder
is not easy to come by.

244
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
I gave one portion to Her Ladyship

245
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,180
and another to Your Lordship.

246
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:41,900
But I'm afraid

247
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,500
it was put in the corner

248
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:44,620
by you long ago.

249
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,220
Miss Wen did

250
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:47,420
give it to you before.

251
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,540
No.

252
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,020
It's not like this.

253
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,460
You clearly threatened me

254
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,300
with my brother's life

255
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,060
just now.

256
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,140
Why are you so good at acting?

257
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,460
It is good news that

258
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,140
your brother is here.

259
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,140
Why didn't you tell us?

260
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,020
You!

261
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,140
Your Lordship, do you know?

262
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,220
Enough.

263
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,540
That's all for now.

264
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,700
Go back.

265
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,180
It was our oversight.

266
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
Let's talk about it later.

267
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,460
Miss Wen, you are really astute.

268
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,540
Otherwise,

269
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,260
we'd definitely be caught red-handed

270
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,620
by Nie Sangyu.

271
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:51,020
Fortunately, I went to the casino before.

272
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,020
Otherwise,

273
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:57,020
I would have lost completely.

274
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,380
The man was ransomed?

275
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,540
Yes.

276
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:03,100
A man surnamed Qin

277
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,700
ransomed him with money.

278
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,620
A man surnamed Qin?

279
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,660
Qian Lianxue

280
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:13,620
must have told

281
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,660
Nie Sangyu

282
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,820
and Qin Yixian everything.

283
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,420
Miss Wen.

284
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:18,580
What shall we do

285
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:19,620
next?

286
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:25,460
Just let it be.

287
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,820
Miss Wen.

288
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,940
After this incident,

289
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,340
His Lordship may never

290
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,900
trust them again.

291
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,860
It doesn't matter

292
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,420
whether he believes them or not.

293
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,700
Only when Nie Sangyu disappears
from now on

294
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,220
will His Lordship

295
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,380
truly belong to me.

296
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,740
So it's true that Qian Bingyan
is in debt?

297
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,580
And it's also true that

298
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,500
Wen Wan threatened Qian Lianxue?

299
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,500
But what I don't understand

300
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,660
is why there is no poison

301
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,300
in that drug.

302
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,260
Could it be that the news of

303
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,500
Qian Bingyan's rescue was leaked,

304
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,620
so she changed it temporarily?

305
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:17,420
Miss Xue.

306
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,380
Your Ladyship.

307
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,700
What's wrong?

308
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,700
Nothing.

309
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,380
I may be a little tired.

310
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,100
I'm going back to rest.

311
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,740
Miss Xue.

312
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,500
Did anything

313
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,020
happen to you?

314
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,820
How come?

315
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:44,740
I'm fine.

316
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,260
Are you sure?

317
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:47,220
It's getting late.

318
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,220
Go back to rest.

319
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,140
Miss Xue.

320
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,300
We have worked together for so long.

321
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,660
Can't you trust me?

322
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:04,700
If you trust me,

323
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,300
just tell me

324
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,340
what happened to you.

325
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:08,820
Then I can figure out a way

326
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:10,220
to work it out with you.

327
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,900
Your Ladyship, sorry.

328
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,100
What?

329
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:21,780
I...

330
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,340
I was possessed last night

331
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,980
and almost took all the money

332
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,900
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

333
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,740
Did something

334
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,980
happen to your family

335
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:36,780
and you need a lot of money?

336
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,420
My... My brother...

337
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,420
Somehow, my brother

338
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,700
arrived at Haifang out of a sudden.

339
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,500
And he owes a lot of money.

340
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:51,420
They asked me to pay back the money

341
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:52,220
within three days,

342
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,340
otherwise my brother will be...

343
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,100
- I see.
- Sorry, Your Ladyship.

344
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,620
Got it.

345
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,660
I really had no choice.

346
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:57,980
Your Ladyship.

347
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:58,540
Listen.

348
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,500
Take all the money

349
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,580
of Haoxue Cosmetics.

350
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,500
If it is not enough,

351
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,540
let's find a way to raise money.

352
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,460
In short,

353
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,660
get your brother out first.

354
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:05,140
Okay?

355
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:09,020
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

356
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:11,020
Look at you.

357
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,300
Let me know

358
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,140
if something like this happens again.

359
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,740
By the way,

360
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:23,700
there is another very strange thing.

361
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,940
Yesterday I went to Haoxue Cosmetics

362
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,740
in the middle of the night.

363
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,420
But I met

364
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,740
Miss Wen.

365
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:30,420
Miss Wen?

366
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,980
Yes.

367
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,180
She said she would
keep it secret for me,

368
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:34,420
but I had to

369
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,060
do her a favor

370
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,220
in the future.

371
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,540
Miss Wen appeared at Haoxue Cosmetics

372
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:40,980
in the middle of the night,

373
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,540
and happened to see you?

374
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,900
There must be something wrong.

375
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,060
Let's do this.

376
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:52,140
Agree to her request first,

377
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:53,100
and then

378
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:53,940
see what she

379
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,020
wants you to do.

380
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,260
We...

381
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:57,700
We can

382
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,980
go to Qin Yixian for help

383
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,420
and ask him to redeem
your brother first

384
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,500
to ensure his safety.

385
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:05,260
Thank you, Your Ladyship.

386
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:08,940
Miss Xue.

387
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,860
I hope you can

388
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,740
think of me

389
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:14,660
no matter what difficulties
you encounter in the future.

390
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,380
I will definitely

391
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
face it together with you.

392
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,940
I don't know

393
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,460
what she will do next.

394
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:25,980
I'll send someone to
keep an eye on her.

395
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,260
Also,

396
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,460
the fire in the warehouse

397
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,780
of Haoxue Cosmetics

398
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:39,020
may also have something
to do with her.

399
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,740
What?

400
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,980
Do you have any clue?

401
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,220
Not yet.

402
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,740
But don't worry.

403
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,500
I will definitely find out the truth

404
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:50,740
and give you an explanation.

405
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,220
I believe in you.

406
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,860
(Haifang Wharf)

407
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:03,940
- Come on.
- Hurry up.

408
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,380
Excuse me. Excuse me.

409
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,900
Excuse me.

410
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,020
Let's go.

411
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,980
Watch your steps.

412
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:10,500
Take care.

413
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:10,940
Take care.

414
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:12,620
All there.

415
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,540
Mr. Yuan.

416
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:29,380
Miss Sang Shen.

417
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:30,460
How is Miss Ji

418
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:31,540
recovering recently?

419
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,660
I haven't visited her yet.

420
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,180
Pretty good.

421
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,340
Thanks to falling into the water
this time,

422
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,620
her memory was restored.

423
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:37,580
What are you talking about?

424
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,580
She regained her memory?

425
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:50,180
Your Ladyship.

426
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,620
The goods were all brought back.

427
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,820
Good.

428
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,100
Mr. Yuan.

429
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,500
Long time no see.

430
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,540
Why are you here today?

431
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,060
Miss...

432
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,100
Ms. Nie.

433
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,980
I haven't seen you

434
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,340
since the last time
you fell into the water.

435
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,660
How are you?

436
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,220
I am much better.

437
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,380
I am fine

438
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,100
after resting for a while.

439
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:12,660
Don't worry.

440
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:13,780
That's good.

441
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,660
I have something to tell you.

442
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:17,660
Say it.

443
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,540
Leave us alone.

444
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,020
Leave us alone.

445
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:27,380
Let's go.

446
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:30,740
Take a seat.

447
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,780
What's up?

448
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,700
I heard Sang Shen say that

449
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:40,980
you regained your previous memories

450
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,340
after falling into the water?

451
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,540
Yes.

452
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,220
I got

453
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,460
all my memories back.

454
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,340
Then what do you remember?

455
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,820
I remembered...

456
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:05,580
I remembered many things.

457
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,500
For example,

458
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,820
I went to sea with my dad

459
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,860
when I was a kid.

460
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,580
I often acted up

461
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:12,420
and made him angry.

462
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,340
And when I was a kid...

463
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:14,420
What about what happened
even before?

464
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:16,260
Even before?

465
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:16,940
Yes.

466
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,220
When you were a baby.

467
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,660
When I was a baby...

468
00:21:29,620 --> 00:21:31,420
How could I possibly remember this?

469
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,620
That was too long ago.

470
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,020
Mr. Yuan.

471
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:44,740
Mr. Yuan.

472
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,580
What's wrong with you?

473
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,940
I'm fine.

474
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,180
Ms. Nie.

475
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,380
Actually in childhood, we...

476
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,180
My Lady.

477
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,260
My Lady.

478
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,820
Mr. Ji sent a message!

479
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:59,100
Mr. Ji sent a message!

480
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:01,260
A message from my dad?

481
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,020
What's it?

482
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,860
Mr. Ji is on his way back to Haifang.

483
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,300
Really?

484
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Guihai Warrior is coming back?

485
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:08,380
Mr. Yuan.

486
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,300
I'll introduce you to each other

487
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,420
when my dad comes back.

488
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,460
Okay.

489
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,100
I've long been looking forward to
meeting Guihai Warrior.

490
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,340
And

491
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:16,260
I have something to ask him.

492
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,020
Okay.

493
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:19,220
Great.

494
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:19,780
My Lady.

495
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:22,020
He's finally back.

496
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,940
Come on.

497
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,820
Bingyan!

498
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,540
Bingyan!

499
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,460
Step aside! Step aside!

500
00:22:33,460 --> 00:22:34,140
Qian Lianxue.

501
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,660
Qin Yixian, have you seen my brother?

502
00:22:36,660 --> 00:22:37,380
He's inside.

503
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,180
Don't worry.

504
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,460
How can I not be worried

505
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,580
at this moment?

506
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,340
Listen.

507
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,860
Don't come out for a while

508
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,620
no matter what happens.

509
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,460
Leave it to me.

510
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,860
Sai! Sai! Sai!

511
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,460
Sai! Sai! Sai!

512
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:08,580
I won!

513
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:10,580
You are far from qualified

514
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,740
to win me over.

515
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,500
Mr. Qian.

516
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,900
You're on a lucky day.

517
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,620
Mr. Qin.

518
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,700
Why are you also here?

519
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:17,700
You also like it?

520
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,420
Mr. Qian.

521
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,220
I'd like to play it with you alone.

522
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,380
Are you

523
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:22,820
interested?

524
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:28,940
Sure.

525
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,820
Everyone.

526
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,260
These two made a reservation here.

527
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,940
Please move to another table.

528
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,620
My Lady, look if it's done.

529
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,820
Wait for a while longer.

530
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,020
Your Ladyship.

531
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:51,740
Have some tea and take a rest.

532
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,220
I'm not tired. It's okay.

533
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,620
What's up, My Lady?

534
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,300
Look.

535
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,220
Why is the paste

536
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,100
a little darker this time?

537
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,020
Exactly.

538
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,420
My Lady, is it because

539
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,740
you developed a new formula,

540
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:19,500
so

541
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,900
the color is a little different?

542
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,980
It makes sense.

543
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,780
Call everyone over.

544
00:24:27,940 --> 00:24:29,660
Then let's study

545
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:30,500
how to sell these

546
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:31,180
new products.

547
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,540
Place the bet.

548
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,340
I won.

549
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:46,220
One more round.

550
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,660
One more round.

551
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,700
Go ahead.

552
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,700
Tai!

553
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,380
Go ahead.

554
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:59,340
I won again.

555
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,220
One more round.

556
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,220
I won them all.

557
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,900
It's all mine. I won!

558
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,020
One more round.

559
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,180
What about

560
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:17,660
a jackpot?

561
00:25:17,660 --> 00:25:18,180
A jackpot?

562
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,860
Sure, come on.

563
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,020
How much?

564
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,380
All in.

565
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,700
Come on.

566
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,980
Triple.

567
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,180
Collect the money.

568
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,220
Mr. Qin.

569
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,940
I am begging you.

570
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,820
Lend me some more money.

571
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,860
Don't take away all the money.

572
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,620
Don't take away all the money.

573
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,380
Mr. Qin.

574
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,820
Mr. Qin, I am begging you.

575
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:09,060
Lend me some more money.

576
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,420
I will definitely get my money back.

577
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:11,460
You still want to continue?

578
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:15,020
Okay.

579
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,180
You cheated.

580
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,220
Give me back the money.

581
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,180
Don't worry.

582
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:45,740
Let me show you.

583
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:52,820
Take a good look yourself.

584
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:56,340
Come on. Tai.

585
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:57,140
Tai.

586
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,460
Sai! Sai! Sai!

587
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,340
Make it Tai.

588
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:01,420
Tai.

589
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,540
Sai! Sai! Sai!

590
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:08,100
Tai! Tai! Tai!

591
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,540
Tai! Tai! Tai!

592
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,420
See?

593
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,660
This is the real casino.

594
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:19,020
There must be fraud in every bet.

595
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:21,460
They manipulate your wins

596
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,340
and losses.

597
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,900
They've set a trap long ago,

598
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
just waiting for someone like you

599
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,700
to fall into it.

600
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:29,460
Gambling

601
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:30,860
is like an abyss,

602
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,460
it will only make you sink
deeper and deeper

603
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,860
to the point where
you cannot control yourself,

604
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,820
until you have nothing left.

605
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,940
Qian Bingyan.

606
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,740
Do you still want to

607
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,580
continue to indulge in it like them?

608
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,460
What bad luck today.

609
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,540
I want to continue.

610
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,980
I still have money.

611
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,300
Don't pull me away.

612
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:07,660
It's mine!

613
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,340
No.

614
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,340
Alright.

615
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:25,860
I will arrange for you to go to Huangzhou

616
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,940
to work and earn money now,

617
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:28,180
and stay away from this casino.

618
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:28,780
Huangzhou?

619
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,260
Also,

620
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,220
never see your sister again

621
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,020
until you turn over a new leaf.

622
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:37,460
If I find you

623
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:38,420
asking her for money again,

624
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,660
don't blame me
for being rude to you.

625
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,900
Mr. Qin.

626
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,420
Do I still have a chance to
be a good person?

627
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:50,940
Yes.

628
00:28:52,420 --> 00:28:53,220
As long as you are willing to.

629
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,460
Take him to the wharf.

630
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,180
Mr. Qin.

631
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,620
Mr. Qin.

632
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,220
Tell my sister that

633
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,340
I know it's my fault.

634
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,340
Please let her forgive me.

635
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,620
Go.

636
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:29,220
Bingyan.

637
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,940
Bingyan.

638
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:32,940
Stay here.

639
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:35,100
Or all the previous efforts
will be wasted.

640
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,300
Is Bingyan really going to Huangzhou?

641
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:38,180
You spoiled him

642
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,100
too much before,

643
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,420
which made him

644
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,340
become like this step by step.

645
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,580
I'm sending him

646
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,500
to suffer a little bit

647
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,420
so that he can learn some skills.

648
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,860
It's good for him.

649
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,660
I will send someone to follow him.

650
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,860
He'll be fine.

651
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:50,420
Don't worry.

652
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,100
Thank you.

653
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,300
- I...
- I...

654
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,580
You first.

655
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,420
Lianxue.

656
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,260
I know that

657
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,980
we would quarrel every time we met

658
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,780
and we disliked each other before.

659
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:23,980
But then

660
00:30:24,100 --> 00:30:25,260
I suddenly found that

661
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,460
I wasn't used to it if
I didn't quarrel with you for a day.

662
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,180
All I can think about is you.

663
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,620
I miss you when I eat,

664
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:32,980
when I walk,

665
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,460
when I drink,

666
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,340
even...

667
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,180
Even when I dream.

668
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:42,060
I...

669
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,180
I like you.

670
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,300
Really?

671
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,020
I...

672
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,380
I always thought you didn't like me.

673
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,020
I was afraid I was just
being self-sentimental.

674
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:11,220
So I never told you.

675
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:12,660
You...

676
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:15,180
You've spoken out

677
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,140
all my inner thoughts.

678
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,300
I didn't know you liked me

679
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,260
because you've always been...

680
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,140
Before...

681
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,060
I used to sneer at you

682
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,660
every day before.

683
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,020
But when I saw you

684
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,380
teaching Bingyan a lesson today,

685
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,780
I found that you are sometimes serious

686
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,580
and you treat me well.

687
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:40,420
Lianxue.

688
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:43,540
Would you like to

689
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,180
be with me?

690
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:02,260
- Good!
- Good!

691
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,620
- Good!
- Good!

692
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:09,720
♪Who has noticed
their feelings for each other♪

693
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:11,180
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

694
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,060
Miss Shui.

695
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:20,740
How is the new product
development going?

696
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:21,900
I'm about to give you a try.

697
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:22,420
Here.

698
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,300
I added borneol

699
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:25,860
in it,

700
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,180
which can not only
be used for skin care,

701
00:32:27,180 --> 00:32:28,180
but also refresh yourself.

702
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,740
Really?

703
00:32:29,460 --> 00:32:30,340
Take a try.

704
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:32,620
How is it?

705
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:34,220
Indeed.

706
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,580
It is no worse than the previous
Feiwan Face Cream.

707
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,860
I feel more at ease when you say that.

708
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,180
Let me see.

709
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,740
Your Ladyship.

710
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,340
Here you are.

711
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:48,380
My brother's matter is settled.

712
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:48,980
Really?

713
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,380
That casino was also sealed up.

714
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,260
Great!

715
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,340
Thanks to

716
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,900
Mr. Qin.

717
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,620
Easy.

718
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,420
The two of you...

719
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,140
Miss Shui.

720
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,980
Look at them.

721
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,460
You should hurry up.

722
00:33:20,820 --> 00:33:21,300
I...

723
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,460
Is this the new product?

724
00:33:28,180 --> 00:33:29,740
I was about to tell you this.

725
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,020
I hope

726
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:32,220
we can discuss

727
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,420
how to sell

728
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,220
the new product.

729
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,580
In my opinion,

730
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,300
there are countless businesses
in the world.

731
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:38,820
But they are essentially the same.

732
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:39,780
To sell well,

733
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,740
you need to

734
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,420
find the knack for making money.

735
00:33:43,540 --> 00:33:45,140
What's the knack for making money?

736
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:48,860
Me.

737
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,060
Ms. Nie, if you don't mind,

738
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,860
I would like to

739
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:53,580
do my best

740
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,700
for Haoxue Cosmetics.

741
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,380
Look.

742
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,180
Mr. Qin.

743
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:57,900
I really don't know

744
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:59,460
how to thank you.

745
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,980
No need for that.

746
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,980
Just give her a raise

747
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,780
later on.

748
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:08,660
The air

749
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,100
is full of

750
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,780
the smell of love.

751
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,300
No idea.

752
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,980
A little jealous, a little sweet.

753
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:16,300
I just can't stay here any longer.

754
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,060
I will leave

755
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:18,860
the rest to you.

756
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:19,780
I am going to take a rest.

757
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:23,500
No problem.

758
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,580
Miss Xue.

759
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:29,860
You!

760
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:31,700
Get to work.

761
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,060
Get to work. Get to work.

762
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,260
Muxu.

763
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,460
What is Miss Wen doing recently?

764
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:40,100
She's been behaving herself recently.

765
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,540
I am familiar with the cook

766
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:42,220
and maidservants in the yard.

767
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,420
I asked them to keep an eye on her.

768
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,620
Since what happened last time,

769
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,380
Sang Shen and I

770
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,460
have paid close attention to her,

771
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,300
especially your diet.

772
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,380
From buying to cooking,

773
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:51,860
we all do it ourselves

774
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,700
and dare not involve anyone else.

775
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,700
Since her fake move

776
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,420
last time,

777
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,940
I've always felt uneasy.

778
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,260
Uneasy?

779
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:07,700
What's wrong, My Lady?

780
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:09,740
Why is the paste

781
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,300
a little darker this time?

782
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:14,140
Muxu.

783
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,860
Let's go back to Haoxue Cosmetics.

784
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,460
Sang Shen.

785
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:20,860
My Lady.

786
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:21,900
Where are Miss Shui and the others?

787
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:23,660
Mr. Qin said that

788
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,340
since it's the Feiwan Face Cream
for everyone,

789
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:25,940
they should sell it

790
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,820
in the market

791
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,380
in order to build up

792
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,540
the reputation of it.

793
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:33,700
What's wrong, My Lady?

794
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,740
Any problem?

795
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:36,620
Well.

796
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,660
Go get a doctor.

797
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,420
Muxu.

798
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:39,460
Ask Ning Yuxuan here.

799
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,460
Go.

800
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,460
Why get a doctor?

801
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,660
Who is sick?

802
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,780
No idea. Let's go.

803
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,860
What's going on?

804
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,460
Something's wrong with the color.

805
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,580
What happened?

806
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,060
Someone tampered with
the medicinal materials.

807
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,020
Your Ladyship.

808
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,380
It's Qianji Powder.

809
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:17,580
Qianji Powder?

810
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,820
According to the reaction
of medicinal materials,

811
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:21,100
the amount of poisoning is little.

812
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,500
Normal skin

813
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,300
will not be affected.

814
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,100
Toxicity only occurs

815
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,220
if the skin

816
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:27,460
is injured.

817
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,700
In mild cases,

818
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,540
one would convulse all over his body
and become paralyzed.

819
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,340
In severe cases,

820
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,540
one would foam at the mouth
and died immediately.

821
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,380
It's not to destroy

822
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,420
Haoxue Cosmetics's reputation,

823
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:37,740
but to kill people.

824
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,580
Your Ladyship,

825
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,700
we have been keeping an eye on
this batch of goods

826
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,660
since the material was imported.

827
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:42,180
Could it be that the material merchant

828
00:36:42,180 --> 00:36:43,020
poisoned it?

829
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,100
Withdraw that batch of

830
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:48,460
Feiwan Face Cream from sale.

831
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:48,980
Hurry up!

832
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:49,900
Your Ladyship.

833
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:50,540
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

834
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,260
Right.

835
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,500
Gui Bai.

836
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:55,940
Dig into it.

837
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,740
Don't let any workers

838
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:58,700
and medicine dealers go unnoticed.

839
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,260
Yes.

840
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:00,740
Hold on.

841
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,700
Ask Yuan Lang to check

842
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,460
if there is anything suspicious

843
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:05,540
about the workers at the wharf.

844
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:06,580
Go.

845
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:07,020
Yes.

846
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,380
Take a look.

847
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:17,300
Welcome to try.

848
00:37:17,420 --> 00:37:18,260
Let me try.

849
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,740
Only 30 bottles left.

850
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:20,900
Order now.

851
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,980
Order now.

852
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,500
Smell it.

853
00:37:22,500 --> 00:37:23,140
It smells so good.

854
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,580
Then buy it.

855
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:25,380
Give me one.

856
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,420
Please try it.

857
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,740
Here, okay.

858
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:29,020
Put the money here.

859
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:31,780
Excuse me.

860
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:33,060
Excuse me. Everyone, hold on.

861
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,780
Stop selling it.

862
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,980
I'll recycle your Feiwan Face Cream

863
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,420
at five times the price.

864
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,340
Five times?

865
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:37,940
Yes.

866
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,060
Come over.

867
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,260
What happened?

868
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,500
We are selling at a loss.

869
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:42,740
Why did you spend so much money

870
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,260
buying them back?

871
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,100
There is something wrong with them.

872
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:44,940
I don't have time to
explain it to you now.

873
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:45,860
Let's talk about it later.

874
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,100
Five times? Really?

875
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:49,980
Yes.

876
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,420
I will sell it to you.

877
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:51,820
Okay.

878
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:52,740
Here, Muxu, pay her.

879
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,260
This is your money.

880
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,500
They really paid.

881
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,260
I will also sell it to you.

882
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:57,700
Okay.

883
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,740
Okay, here.

884
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:01,740
And me.

885
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:02,900
Your money. Take it.

886
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:04,260
Next.

887
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:04,780
Come on.

888
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:05,460
Is there any more Feiwan Face Cream?

889
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,700
Take your money.

890
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:08,100
Take your money.

891
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:08,580
Here.

892
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,180
For you.

893
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:09,820
Take it.

894
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,500
Take it.

895
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,140
Here.

896
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,060
It's yours.

897
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:13,700
Take it.

898
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:14,580
Here.

899
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:15,900
Anyone has it?

900
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:16,820
Just put it here.

901
00:38:16,940 --> 00:38:17,620
Okay.

902
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,140
What happened?

903
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:22,980
Feiwan Face Cream was poisoned.

904
00:38:47,060 --> 00:38:48,340
How about it? Is there any less?

905
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,580
We got

906
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,220
all of them back.

907
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:52,740
Really?

908
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:53,340
Yes.

909
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,700
This person did something with

910
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,180
such disregard for others' lives.

911
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,380
Who is behind it?

912
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:02,380
It should be her.

913
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,140
But I don't have any proof yet.

914
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,380
It must be her.

915
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,300
She failed the poisoning last time,

916
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:09,300
and this time she poisoned
Feiwan Face Cream.

917
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,780
My Lady, I can't stand it anymore.

918
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,980
Let's come after her.

919
00:39:11,980 --> 00:39:12,700
I won't let her go.

920
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,980
Now that we think of it,

921
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,180
Ning Yuxuan can definitely
think of it too.

922
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:18,900
He should be

923
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,260
dealing with it by now.

924
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:37,420
Your Lordship.

925
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,260
Your Lordship, here you are.

926
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:39,980
Take a seat.

927
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,820
No need.

928
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,380
Your Lordship, look.

929
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,060
This is the veil

930
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,300
I just embroidered for you.

931
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,180
I will give it to you

932
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,020
as a gift later.

933
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,580
What a coincidence.

934
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:52,380
I also have a gift for you.

935
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:54,780
Really?

936
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,540
Haoxue Cosmetics'
new Feiwan Face Cream.

937
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,300
I heard it works well.

938
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,340
So I brought you one.

939
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,820
I have always admired

940
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,060
Her Ladyship's craftsmanship.

941
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:07,060
But face creams

942
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,180
work differently

943
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,580
on different people.

944
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:12,220
And I have

945
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,940
my own face cream.

946
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:15,300
