=Romance of a Twin Flower=

2
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,980
=Episode 21=

3
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,130
It's so cozy here.

4
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,800
The people here are really friendly

5
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,770
and hospitable.

6
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:01,080
The simpler the person,

7
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,690
the more grateful he is.

8
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:09,490
I think

9
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,400
one is easy to get drunk

10
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:13,520
with the wine here.

11
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,330
My head

12
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,290
is dizzy

13
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:19,570
now.

14
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,010
Is it because of the wine?

15
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:23,010
When did you drink
without getting drunk?

16
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,920
What do you mean?

17
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,730
When have I ever been drunk?

18
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,170
Who came to my room

19
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,080
in the middle of the night

20
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,490
drunk last time?

21
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,920
It wasn't me.

22
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:45,120
I don't know who it was.

23
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:46,330
It wasn't me anyway.

24
00:02:46,330 --> 00:02:46,960
I didn't do it.

25
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,920
It doesn't matter even if it was you.

26
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,920
Take care.

27
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,360
While drinking, we should...

28
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,640
Let's play a game.

29
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,730
Play a game?

30
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:00,360
Yes.

31
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,450
Listen.

32
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:02,680
I played a game before

33
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,400
that was really fun.

34
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,170
It's called Truth Or Wine.

35
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:06,080
Would you like to try?

36
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,170
How?

37
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,010
Here's the rule.

38
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:08,640
Let's play

39
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,730
rock, paper, scissors.

40
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,640
Whoever loses

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,240
has to choose to drink

42
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,290
or tell a truth.

43
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,800
Do you dare?

44
00:03:18,490 --> 00:03:20,120
Why not?

45
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:21,240
Okay.

46
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,210
Let me tell you.

47
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,290
Remember that

48
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:24,330
I won't let you win.

49
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:25,210
You have to admit defeat.

50
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,890
Then don't let me win.

51
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:27,730
Okay.

52
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:28,210
Come on.

53
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,840
Rock, paper,

54
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,490
scissors.

55
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,360
Miss.

56
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,010
What would you choose?

57
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,960
You don't give ground to me at all.

58
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,120
I choose the truth.

59
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:51,800
Just ask.

60
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,120
No matter what you ask me,

61
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,010
I will tell you

62
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,920
the truth.

63
00:03:59,050 --> 00:03:59,570
Come on.

64
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:00,920
Do you have someone you like?

65
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,840
Yes.

66
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,930
Who?

67
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,520
That's the second question.

68
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,600
You have to win again to ask that.

69
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,400
Come on.

70
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:29,770
Once again.

71
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,890
Rock, paper,

72
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,010
scissors.

73
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,570
Say it.

74
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,080
Truth or wine?

75
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:46,960
Truth.

76
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,890
Okay.

77
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,130
Do you have someone you like?

78
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:57,720
Yes.

79
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,520
Who?

80
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,810
That's also the second question.

81
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,040
One more round.

82
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,010
Rock, paper,

83
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:21,930
scissors.

84
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:23,600
Alright.

85
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,720
Now you can tell me who she is.

86
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:32,800

Are you confessing to me now?

93
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
Right.

Why did you tell me so late?

102
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,570
This is the third question.

103
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:36,810
Can't I ask you one more question?

104
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,720
Admit defeat.

105
00:06:38,330 --> 00:06:39,770
You are so mean.

106
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,890
The moon is beautiful tonight.

107

(Liu's Village)

108
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,690
- Good people.
- Good people.

109
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:15,010
They are good people.

110
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:16,960
Right.

111
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,770
I don't want them to leave.

112
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,010
They have been busy all the time.

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,160
Just go back.

114
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:21,960
No need to see us off.

115
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:23,450
I will visit you often.

116
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:25,040
Thank you.

117
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,450
Take care.

118
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,520
Sir, Miss.

119
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,770
Come back to see me.

120
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:30,080
I will miss you.

121
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:32,160
Xiaobao.

122
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,640
I will definitely come to see you

123
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:34,890
when I have time.

124
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:36,840
Mrs. Zhang.

125
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,130
It was my first time repairing the kiln.

126
00:07:38,130 --> 00:07:38,770
If it's broken,

127
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:39,770
I'll fix it for you next time.

128
00:07:39,770 --> 00:07:42,010
Okay, thank you. Come back often.

129
00:07:42,010 --> 00:07:43,010
- Alright, go back.
- Go back.

130
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,690
Go back.

131
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:45,840
Okay.

132
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,890
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

133
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:47,250
Right.

134
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,330
Come back to see us.

135
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:51,370
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye. Goodbye.

Come back often.

137
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:57,960
Come back often.

138
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:00,080
Remember to come back.

139
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:02,690
Good people.

140
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,570
Remember to come back.

141
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,960
Don't forget us.

142
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:10,810
Don't forget to come back.

143
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,160
Take care.

144
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,250
Why did you follow me home?

145
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,160
Didn't you ask us here?

146
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,330
When did I ask you here?

147
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,080
You were watching us

148
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,810
secretly just now,

149
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,690
and we were watching you too.

150
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,130
The look in your eyes just now

151
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,360
clearly meant that you
had something to say to me.

152
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,570
Do you believe

153
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:37,650
what a crazy old woman says?

154
00:08:39,290 --> 00:08:40,120
You are not crazy.

155
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,530
It's just that no one believes

156
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,810
what you say.

157
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,410
If I'm right,

158
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,450
it's about those who went to sea.

159
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,760
How do you know?

160
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,760
Granny.

161
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,210
Yesterday those in the village said that

162
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,240
their husbands left the village

163
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,330
and went to Yunzhou.

164
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,810
And we found that something went wrong.

165
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:13,840
Because

166
00:09:14,050 --> 00:09:15,650
from the establishment of the dynasty
to the present,

167
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:16,650
we have no boats

168
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:17,240
leading to Yunzhou.

169
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,690
Since we don't do business with Yunzhou,

170
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,410
those people

171
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
couldn't be there.

172
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:25,170
A bunch of fools.

173
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:28,810
They don't even know that

174
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,080
their husbands are dead.

175
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,050
Dead?

176
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,600
Dead?

177
00:09:41,930 --> 00:09:43,170
Granny, take your time.

178
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:44,330
No worries.

179
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:47,480
My son Gen and I

180
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,360
have depended on each other.

181
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,760
Gen is very filial.

182
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,050
He was worried that
I would be afraid alone,

183
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,480
so even if everyone else
went to the sea,

184
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:03,690
he never did so.

185
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,880
Take your time.

186
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,480
Mom.

187
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
I am going to work.

188
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,330
Okay.

189
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,120
Come back early.

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,930
I'll make you
dried bamboo shoots with meat.

191
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:16,600
I am leaving.

192
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,570
Come back early.

193
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:23,760
Don't worry, Mom.

194
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:26,570
But that night,

195
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,760
Gen sent word that

196
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:32,810
he had gone to sea with others,

197
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,360
and never came back

198
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,120
since then.

199
00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:41,960
After that, you never

200
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,360
heard from him again?

201
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
- (I've received his money and letter once.)
- Have you seen my son Gen?

202
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:48,120
(It's written in the letter that)

203
00:10:49,170 --> 00:10:51,650
- (he's doing well on the boat.)
- Have you seen my son Gen?

204
00:10:51,650 --> 00:10:52,340
That tall.

205
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,360
(He didn't specify)

206
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,240
- (where he had gone)
- Have you seen my son Gen?

207
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:58,050
(or what ship he was on.)

208
00:10:58,450 --> 00:11:01,930
(I only got that one letter.)

209
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,050
(It's been four years.)

210
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,080
(Even ordinary crew members)

211
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:06,450
(can take leave)

212
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,650
(and go home once a year.)

213
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,530
Gen.

214
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,760
Where is my Gen?

215
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,480
Where is my Gen?

216
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,330
Piss off.

217
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,650
What a crazy woman.

218
00:11:15,650 --> 00:11:16,290
Gen!

219
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:17,690
(That mace pendant)

220
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:19,880
- (was put on Gen)
- Where is my Gen?

221
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:22,170
by my dead husband himself.

222
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,650
I'm sure about it.

223
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,210
What else?

224
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,360
Any other findings?

225
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,080
I found nothing

226
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:32,080
on the wharf.

227
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,000
But when

228
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,690
I went back to the village,

229
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:36,330
I ran into Mr. Wang's men

230
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,530
providing porridge in the village.

231
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,450
It occurred to me that

232
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,240
a few days before Gen left,

233
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,810
his men were also

234
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,760
providing porridge in the village,

235
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:51,530
and had a chat with Gen.

236
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,810
He knew that

237
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,530
we only had each other.

238
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,720
Later,

239
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,960
the more I thought about it,
the more I felt something was wrong.

240
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,570
There are many men

241
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:02,450
in the village who go to sea.

242
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:03,880
But none of those who went to sea

243
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:05,930
after Mr. Wang's men

244
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:08,760
providing porridge

245
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,600
come back.

246
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:15,810
Something must have happened.

247
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,360
I told them that

248
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:21,210
your husbands were all dead

249
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,810
and couldn't come back.

250
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,720
But none of them

251
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,840
believed me.

252
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,450
How could I

253
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,960
be joking with

254
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,210
my own son's life?

255
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:39,450
You are rich people

256
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,240
from Haifang.

257
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,480
You must know

258
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,840
a lot of officials.

259
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:44,880
I am begging you

260
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:48,600
to ask the official

261
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,570
to find out the whereabouts of Gen.

262
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:53,290
Granny.

263
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:55,450
Is he dead or still alive?

264
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,720
My Gen

265
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,210
must have been killed by someone.

266
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:01,760
Granny.

267
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,410
Granny Liu, don't worry.

268
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:07,050
In fact, I am the magistrate of Haifang.

269
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:09,570
I will definitely take care of

270
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,080
Gen's grievances.

271
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,070
You are the officer!

272
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:15,440
- Granny.
- Granny, get up.

273
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:16,780
Get up, please.

274
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,240
Granny, don't worry.

275
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,410
Trust him

276
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,760
on this matter.

277
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:28,080
We will definitely check it out

278
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,760
and give you an explanation.

279
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:34,240
Okay, thank you.

280
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,210
Thank you.

281
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,810
Thank you.

282
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:43,620
(Magistrate's Residence)

283
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,670
In the name of the best,

284
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,060
he does the worst.

285
00:13:48,570 --> 00:13:50,000
Wang Jinyao.

286
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:53,530
Your days of lawlessness

287
00:13:53,530 --> 00:13:54,840
should be over.

288
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,570
Recently, I have been wondering

289
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,400
why the pirates in Haifang

290
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:01,800
can't be eliminated.

291
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:03,690
After today,

292
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,000
I seem to have an answer.

293
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,080
You also thought of it?

294
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,690
I didn't dare to think about it before.

295
00:14:10,690 --> 00:14:12,080
Did Wang Jinyao really use

296
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,760
the people of Liu's Village
to make up the number?

297
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,170
I checked the files.

298
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:17,570
Whenever there is a major case

299
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:18,960
that will be held accountable by the court,

300
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,240
pirates will immediately

301
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,330
come forward to take the blame.

302
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,360
Pirates don't grow

303
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
out of the soil.

304
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,240
How could they be everywhere?

305
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,530
It doesn't seem to be the first time

306
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:34,410
Wang Jinyao has played this trick.

307
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,290
He is horrible.

308
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,290
How dare he

309
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,450
do that?

310
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:40,650
Why can't anyone else

311
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:41,530
see through his trap

312
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,330
except Granny Liu?

313
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:43,930
That's the trick point.

314
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,180
He would never look for people

315
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:46,300
in the same village,

316
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,060
but from the surrounding villages,

317
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,300
he looked for ordinary people

318
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:50,940
who were deserted,

319
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,540
introverted, and would never resist.

320
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:56,180
These people

321
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,700
are like dust in his eyes,

322
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,780
once blown into the wind,

323
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,540
they will disappear immediately.

324
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,660
So those

325
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,300
who went to sea in Liu's Village

326
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,540
will never come back, right?

327
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:27,660
Ning Yuxuan.

328
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,180
No one else should die anymore.

329
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,300
No one else should sacrifice

330
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:31,180
in Wang Jinyao's trap.

331
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,180
You have to find a way

332
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:32,780
to get justice

333
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,180
for them.

334
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,620
I will.

335
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:45,300
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

336
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,620
Mr. Qin.

337
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,780
What's up?

338
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,420
Qian Lianxue.

339
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,940
Why do you keep avoiding me recently?

340
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,780
I don't.

341
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,780
You do.

342
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,300
Is it because of the bank notes?

343
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,180
Thank you for your generous help

344
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:10,420
last time.

345
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:11,540
But don't worry.

346
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,180
I will definitely

347
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:13,660
return the money to you
as soon as possible.

348
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,140
Who do you think I am?

349
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,140
We are friends.

350
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,020
Now that my friend is in trouble,

351
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,260
how can I not help?

352
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,820
I just want to ask

353
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:24,660
if you have solved

354
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:25,900
that problem.

355
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,180
Yes.

356
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,660
What happened exactly?

357
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:34,780
Can you tell me?

358
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,260
I hope you can trust me.

359
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,140
I...

360
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,780
Although I live in my cousin's house

361
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,300
all year round,

362
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:47,380
this matter

363
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,900
is my own family affair.

364
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,540
I hope you will allow me

365
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,820
to retain the dignity.

366
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,060
Alright.

367
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,660
If you

368
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,180
need my help

369
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,260
in the future,

370
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:01,900
feel free to let me know.

371
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,060
Thank you, Mr. Qin.

372
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,660
Big Mouth.

373
00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:07,180
Why call me Mr. Qin?

374
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,660
Why are you treating me

375
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,460
like an outsider?

376
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,180
I'm used to you

377
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,740
calling me by my nickname.

378
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,420
Your Ladyship. Your Ladyship.

379
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,900
Congratulations, Sangyu.

380
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,900
What's the happy event?

381
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,180
I heard that you and my brother-in-law

382
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,260
rekindled lost love with a kiss
in the mountain village,

383
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:31,380
and are in love as before,

384
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,660
making others envious.

385
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:36,060
Don't talk nonsense.

386
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:38,940
Sangyu, my brother-in-law
was so deeply in love that

387
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,740
he couldn't help himself.

388
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,060
After you lost your memory,

389
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,180
you became more proficient

390
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,820
at controlling your husband.

391
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:45,980
I don't care.

392
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,060
You have to teach me a few tricks.

393
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:49,620
I don't know anything.

394
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:50,740
Don't always think about...

395
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:55,620
Do you have

396
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,620
someone you like?

397
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:05,900
Let me guess.

398
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:07,060
The one my sister likes

399
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:10,100
must be

400
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,620
a brave and mighty general.

401
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,860
He should be called...

402
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:17,900
Stop it.

403
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,220
I will blush

404
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,660
at the mention of his name.

405
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:23,100
I didn't expect my tough sister

406
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,420
to be so shy.

407
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,420
Sangyu.

408
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,420
I will definitely conquer General Tao.

409
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,980
Our parents will be very happy

410
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,660
to know that we both

411
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,740
have a good marriage.

412
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,620
Muxu.

413
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,500
Do you think

414
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,620
I really look like

415
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
Nie Sangyu?

416
00:18:59,260 --> 00:19:00,500
My Lady, to be honest,

417
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:01,700
you look exactly the same

418
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,380
as the First Lady.

419
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:08,060
Exactly the same?

420
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,460
It's a pity that our destinies
are totally different.

421
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,500
She was really miserable.

422
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:22,420
If General Nie knew that

423
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,420
she was

424
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,340
no longer alive,

425
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,460
he would definitely feel very sad.

426
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,500
Don't worry.

427
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,420
His Lordship will definitely

428
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,060
handle this properly.

429
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,340
I grew up without sisters.

430
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,980
But getting along with Qingyun

431
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,500
these days

432
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,180
makes me feel very close to her.

433
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,700
If

434
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,740
I could take good care of Qingyun,

435
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,180
Nie Sangyu

436
00:19:56,180 --> 00:19:57,820
would feel more at ease, right?

437
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
Yes.

438
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:03,900
If the First Lady knows,

439
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,580
she will be very happy.

440
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:09,940
But, My Lady,

441
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:10,940
ultimately

442
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,660
Ship Guihai is our home.

443
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,820
I know.

444
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,420
Is there any news about

445
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,620
when my dad will come back?

446
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:18,860
My Lady, don't worry.

447
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:19,660
I have ordered someone

448
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,820
to go to the capital to find him.

449
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:21,740
Within half a month,

450
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,580
you will definitely meet Mr. Ji.

451
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,980
Really?

452
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,820
Don't lie to me.

453
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,580
Of course I won't.

454
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,180
What did you say?

455
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:39,340
Sangyu is dead?

456
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:43,900
Is there any basis

457
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,660
for your statement?

458
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,060
There is a village

459
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:48,460
not far from where Her Ladyship
fell into the water.

460
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,660
Several villagers

461
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:51,900
saw a female corpse by the river.

462
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,500
It couldn't be Sangyu.

463
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,260
They felt sorry for her,

464
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:58,060
so they built a grave for her.

465
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,500
No way.

466
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:06,420
No way.

467
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,180
I'm going to check.

468
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,180
I'm going to check.

469
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,180
Master.

470
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,380
Master.

471
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,500
My condolences.

472
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:18,420
In order to confirm the identity
of Her Ladyship,

473
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:20,100
the jade pendant that
she had been wearing

474
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,660
since she was a child

475
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,140
was indeed found

476
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,980
on the female corpse.

477
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,740
The jade pendant...

478
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,060
Did you see exactly

479
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,060
Sangyu's jade pendant?

480
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,260
Are you sure?

481
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:40,580
Yes.

482
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,340
No way.

483
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,900
No way.

484
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:47,940
Master.

485
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,740
Sangyu!

486
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:06,420
My poor Sangyu!

487
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,860
Master, my condolences.

488
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,820
Sangyu

489
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:19,060
was afraid of being alone
since she was a child.

490
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:22,420
Yet she ended up

491
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,900
dying alone.

492
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,860
My poor child!

493
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,180
Master.

494
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,500
One more thing.

495
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,940
The locals said that

496
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,620
not long ago, someone also went to

497
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,340
inquire about the whereabouts
of Her Ladyship.

498
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,660
Ning Yuxuan.

499
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,940
He must have sent someone

500
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:53,180
to inquire about Sangyu's whereabouts.

501
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:54,820
Since Ning Yuxuan knew that

502
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,220
my daughter was dead,

503
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,220
why did he keep it from me?

504
00:23:01,820 --> 00:23:02,820
I also

505
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,660
find it odd.

506
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,620
Since Her Ladyship is gone,

507
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,820
who is the First Lady

508
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,220
of the Ning's Mansion now?

509
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,860
Ning Yuxuan.

510
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,100
Okay.

511
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,820
Good.

512
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:31,580
Great.

513
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,220
It's good that you found her.

514
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,860
I am bound to

515
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,340
be worried about

516
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,900
this girl.

517
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,860
After you return to Haifang,

518
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,380
you can see Miss Ji.

519
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,220
By then,

520
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,180
you will be reunited.

521
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:55,660
I hope

522
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:57,420
she will stop

523
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:59,260
causing trouble for me.

524
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:05,860
(Zuixiao Restaurant)

525
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,140
Nice wine.

526
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:14,740
The Mid-Autumn Festival is coming soon.

527
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,740
This is the first Mid-Autumn Festival

528
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,740
since our cooperation.

529
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,420
I'd like to

530
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,180
give you a great gift.

531
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:25,700
Mr. Wang, you are so generous.

532
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:27,340
Could you tell me anything

533
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:29,180
about the gift?

534
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,900
In Haifang, the 15th day of the eighth month
of the lunar calendar

535
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,340
is the day when the Tael Ship
enters the capital

536
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,580
to contribute taels.

537
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,700
What do you think

538
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:39,940
the gift would be?

539
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,340
Official taels?

540
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,060
Mr. Wang.

541
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:48,220
This is a capital crime

542
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,940
that the whole family
will be implicated in.

543
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:51,580
Have you thought about

544
00:24:51,580 --> 00:24:52,660
how to get out

545
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,900
after robbing the official ship?

546
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:57,580
Mr. Yuan, you must be confused.

547
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,180
How can the two of us

548
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,380
rob the official ship?

549
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:01,900
As far as I know,

550
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,220
pirates are rampant around Haifang

551
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,660
and often do unrighteous things.

552
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:09,380
It will be them
who rob the official ship.

553
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,420
What does it have to do with us?

554
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,220
If something goes wrong,

555
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:18,740
a few common people will
be handed over to take the blame.

556
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,820
Don't worry.

557
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,220
We've been doing that

558
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,740
for years.

559
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,700
What?

560
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:31,140
Are you afraid?

561
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:35,500
I'm not afraid.

562
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:37,620
Since you have thought of

563
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,660
a coup to escape,

564
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,500
why would I be afraid?

565
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,420
It's just...

566
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,820
What else?

567
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,900
I'll charge in front,

568
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,660
and you'll enjoy the benefits
in the back.

569
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,220
It's kind of unfair.

570
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,860
Do you know that

571
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,500
I coped with the aftermath

572
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,380
of all the trouble
that the Dragon Gang has made

573
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:54,580
these years?

574
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,220
What do you mean?

575
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,940
What I mean is that

576
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,860
I had to take care of

577
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,140
what Xiajiu House

578
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,900
didn't do well before.

579
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,100
In short,

580
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,580
we cannot let Haifang

581
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,900
fall into the hands of others.

582
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,940
Since you and I have the same goal,

583
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:21,700
why not let me

584
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,180
give you

585
00:26:23,180 --> 00:26:24,220
a great gift this time?

586
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,740
Except for the taels

587
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,380
contributed to manage the superiors
on the Tael Ship,

588
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,740
we will each get

589
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,740
half of the rest.

590
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:35,100
Shen Liancheng didn't get

591
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,740
so much before.

592
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:41,380
Okay, deal.

593
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:43,700
Now that Mr. Wang is so righteous,

594
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,900
how could I say no?

595
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,500
Here, cheers.

596
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,500
Okay.

597
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:52,980
Cheers.

598
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,340
Tomorrow is the 15th day
of the eighth month.

599
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,820
Is the Tael Ship ready?

600
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:08,860
Yes.

601
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:12,060
Go and check again

602
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,180
to avoid any omissions.

603
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,420
Yes, Your Lordship.

604
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,700
Ning Yuxuan.

605
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,500
Why are you here?

606
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,380
What's this?

607
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,100
I just went to Ship Guihai

608
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,220
to get you something.

609
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:32,100
What's it? Why so mysterious?

610
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,700
A talisman.

611
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,420
Only a piece of wood.

612
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,900
You tell me it's a talisman?

613
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,220
My dad always takes it

614
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:45,220
before going to sea.

615
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,740
This is called touch the wood
to stay safe, understand?

616
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:49,420
Touch the wood to stay safe.

617
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,580
Okay, I will take it.

618
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,580
Don't pretend

619
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,620
as if nothing happened.

620
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,620
I'm so anxious.

621
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:02,660
Wang Jinyao

622
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:03,900
is so despicable and cunning.

623
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:04,900
What if

624
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,220
he plays any tricks?

625
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,180
Don't worry.

626
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:08,860
I have my own countermeasures.

627
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,180
Really?

628
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,220
Keep it well

629
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,100
and come back safely.

630
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:31,220
Ask Mr. Ling to rest assured.

631
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:32,620
On the 15th day
of the eighth month,

632
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:33,620
Ning Yuxuan will

633
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,940
personally escort the taels.

634
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,860
Since he's courting death in a hurry,

635
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,820
let him disappear into the sea

636
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,020
with those taels.

637
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,380
Are you sure of your success
this time?

638
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,220
Since it is a major event
to escort the taels,

639
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,180
Ning Yuxuan will definitely
let the elite soldiers aboard.

640
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,860
Can those under your command

641
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,060
compete with them?

642
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:01,020
I've made arrangements.

643
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,100
A sharp knife

644
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,940
can deal with Ning Yuxuan.

645
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,100
A sharp knife?

646
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,340
Yuan Lang,

647
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,380
the new chief of the Dragon Gang.

648
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,140
He robbed a merchant ship
smuggling goods

649
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,820
for me before.

650
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:20,060
And he did a good job.

651
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:23,330
He has always been against
Ning Yuxuan.

652
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,380
Ning Yuxuan's men have

653
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,140
also kept an eye on the Dragon Gang,

654
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,100
preventing him
from doing something big.

655
00:29:28,220 --> 00:29:30,100
Yuan Lang has the same goal as ours,

656
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:32,060
which is to get rid of Ning Yuxuan.

657
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,540
That being the case,

658
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,780
don't let me down again

659
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,060
this time.

660
00:29:40,060 --> 00:29:41,340
Don't worry, sir.

661
00:29:41,620 --> 00:29:43,260
Ning Yuxuan can never

662
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,780
turn the tide in Haifang.

663
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:48,020
His days are numbered.

664
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,620
(Wharf)

665
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:56,500
Mr. Ning.

666
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,220
Mr. Wang.

667
00:29:57,220 --> 00:29:58,300
Mr. Ning.

668
00:29:59,310 --> 00:29:59,980
Mr. Wang.

669
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,260
Recently, pirates have been rampant

670
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,300
in the waters around Haifang.

671
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,340
I specially brought a few

672
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:05,700
skilled guards

673
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:06,540
in the hope that

674
00:30:06,780 --> 00:30:08,580
we can send the taels
to the capital safely this time.

675
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:09,460
Great.

676
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,100
I can't thank you enough

677
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:13,540
for your help.

678
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,740
To be honest,

679
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:16,780
in the past few years,

680
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,810
I personally led my people

681
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,620
from the Sea Trade Guild

682
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,060
to escort the taels.

683
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,500
Life on the sea is never peaceful.

684
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,700
If I don't do my job well,

685
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,220
I'll lose my life.

686
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:28,100
Now with Mr. Ning's help,

687
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,260
I feel relieved.

688
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,780
I have prepared

689
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:32,460
everything on board.

690
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,540
All the taels

691
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,860
have been sealed last night

692
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,100
and put into the warehouse.

693
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,060
My men

694
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:38,780
have been guarding the perimeter
of the ship.

695
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,060
As long as you issue an order,

696
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,300
we can set sail.

697
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:42,260
Before it's too late,

698
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,700
let's get on board.

699
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,740
Sure, please.

700
00:30:44,740 --> 00:30:45,300
Please.

701
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,460
Your Lordship.

702
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,380
Your Lordship, wait for me.

703
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,460
You...

704
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:54,980
Mr. Ning.

705
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,060
I'll be on board first.

706
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,060
I have prepared something

707
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:02,060
for traveling for you,

708
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,580
and I brought them here
specially for you.

709
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,060
Ning Yuxuan.

710
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:09,940
Why are you here?

711
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:12,100
Didn't you say you wouldn't
come to see me off last night?

712
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,540
I'd like to...

713
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:15,060
I will leave you two alone.

714
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:16,340
I'll take the things

715
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,540
to the ship first.

716
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:24,340
About Miss Wen...

717
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,540
I'm not talking about this.

718
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:26,940
I want to say that

719
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:28,460
even though you made preparations

720
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,340
last night,

721
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,340
I am still worried.

722
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,340
No worries.

723
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,820
It will be fine.

724
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,980
Take care.

725
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,220
Just put it here, right?

726
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:44,820
Trust me.

727
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,100
Wait here for my return.

728
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,140
One more.

729
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:48,260
Take care of yourself.

730
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,620
- There is more.
- Be careful with everything.

731
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:50,580
I will.

732
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:53,650
I am leaving.

733
00:31:58,820 --> 00:31:59,620
Put it here?

734
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:00,540
Come on, here.

735
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,100
Your Ladyship, don't worry.

736
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,540
Come on, watch out.

737
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:08,540
Order carefully.

738
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:20,220
Excuse me. Excuse me.

739
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:41,740
Our ships

740
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:42,580
are all ready.

741
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:43,500
We brought

742
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,700
the best of the best.

743
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,060
But, Chief,

744
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,300
have you made up your mind?

745
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:50,700
Neither Ning Yuxuan nor Wang Jinyao

746
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,300
can be trusted.

747
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,580
Ask everyone to be vigilant.

748
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,220
Wait for the opportunity to act at sea.

749
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,060
Yes.

750
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:05,580
Sirs, take care.

751
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,340
Muxu.

752
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,100
I always feel anxious

753
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,100
and at a loss.

754
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:16,500
Why did Wang Jinyao

755
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:19,100
agree to cooperate with Ning Yuxuan

756
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,500
so easily?

757
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,860
Well...

758
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,540
Shall we go back and have a look?

759
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:31,780
Okay.

760
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,300
Let's go.

761
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,780
Muxu.

762
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,300
We'll split up in a while.

763
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:37,820
If you find anything suspicious,

764
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:38,620
come to me immediately.

765
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:39,260
Yes.

766
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,060
Miss Wen?

767
00:34:22,900 --> 00:34:24,340
Why hasn't she disembarked yet?

768
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:37,980
Miss Wen.

769
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,140
Why are you still here?

770
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:41,020
Muxu.

771
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,460
Why are you here?

772
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,500
Her Ladyship said that

773
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:44,580
you have to disembark.

774
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,420
This is His Lordship's room.

775
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,740
Why should I disembark?

776
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,620
Muxu, why are you on board?

777
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:56,340
Your Lordship.

778
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,100
Your Lordship.

779
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,660
Miss Wen hasn't disembarked yet.

780
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,980
Her Ladyship asked me
to come and find her.

781
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,180
I'd like to talk

782
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:03,620
to Your Lordship along the way.

783
00:35:04,470 --> 00:35:05,420
Isn't it good?

784
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:06,740
I said that

785
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,900
I am here for business.

786
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,260
Muxu.

787
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,340
Take Miss Wen off the boat.

788
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,180
Yes.

789
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,420
I promise that I will

790
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:15,620
send Miss Wen back to the Mansion safely.

791
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,620
Miss Wen, please.

792
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:51,900
What's this?

793
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,620
It's the smell of petroleum.

794
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:32,980
Here.

795
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,180
Okay. Go.

796
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,220
Go.

797
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,140
Here.

798
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,100
Watch your steps.

799
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:39,020
Where is Her Ladyship?

800
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,580
Her Ladyship?

801
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,740
Her Ladyship

802
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,620
got on board with me.

803
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,700
Maybe His Lordship

804
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:45,540
asked her to stay.

805
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,220
Carry it. Go.

806
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,180
You let me off the boat,

807
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,740
but she went away herself.

808
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:57,100
Did you arrange this

809
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,140
on purpose?

810
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,660
Miss Wen, that's not true.

811
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:01,620
Who stays and who goes

812
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:03,260
is up to His Lordship.

813
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,780
And it was His Lordship
who let you disembark.

814
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,500
How could we arrange this?

815
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,460
Excuse me. Excuse me.

816
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,460
The ship sailed away.

817
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,740
Miss Wen.

818
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,820
Let's go back.

819
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,540
Your Lordship.

820
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,620
Miss Wen has disembarked.

821
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:47,620
Wen Wan really

822
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:49,220
doesn't care about priorities.

823
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:50,340
She's not like Her Ladyship

824
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,100
who is on the same page as you.

825
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:56,020
Your Lordship.

826
00:37:56,500 --> 00:37:57,940
I looked around on the ship.

827
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,580
In addition to the handymen
on the ship,

828
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,700
Wang Jinyao has about ten people.

829
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:03,740
Four guard the warehouse.

830
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,340
Four patrol the deck.

831
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:06,420
The remaining two

832
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:07,310
work beside

833
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,210
Wang Jinyao.

834
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:09,140
I see.

835
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,460
Well done.

836
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:11,220
You...

837
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,320
Mr. Ning.

838
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:14,420
Mr. Wang invited you

839
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:15,530
to play chess in his room.

840
00:38:15,990 --> 00:38:17,260
Play chess?

841
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,500
Okay, I see.

842
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,900
Ask our men

843
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,900
to wait on deck.

844
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,020
Notify me immediately

845
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
of any changes.

846
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:28,980
Yes, sir.

847
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,180
Coming.

848
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,260
Mr. Ning.

849
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:44,580
This journey would take a long time.

850
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:46,660
I was afraid that

851
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,700
you would be bored,

852
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,500
so

853
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,020
I brought the chessboard.

854
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,500
How about it, Mr. Ning?

855
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,300
Would you like to try?

856
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:56,020
Mr. Wang is a master at chess.

857
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,940
Alright, let's do it.

858
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,460
Okay.

859
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,620
I'm just playing it for fun.

860
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,580
Mr. Ning.

861
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,900
Anything on your mind?

862
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:22,780
I really can't hide it from Mr. Wang.

863
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,060
This is my first time going to sea.

864
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,620
I hope everything goes well

865
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,500
and the taels

866
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,620
can be delivered safely.

867
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,620
As I expected.

868
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,500
What's Wang Jinyao up to?

869
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:03,620
Everyone knows that Mr. Ning

870
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:05,100
has rectified the Dragon Gang

871
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:07,820
and subdued Shen Liancheng,

872
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:09,060
the former chief of it.

873
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:10,700
Speaking of the Dragon Gang,

874
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,100
Mr. Wang, what do you think of

875
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,340
the new chief?

876
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:16,780
I haven't had time

877
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:18,420
to get acquainted

878
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,100
with this person.

879
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:23,460
But since he was elected as the chief,

880
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,740
he must have

881
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:27,140
something he excels in.

882
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,420
Mr. Ning.

883
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,620
I'm going to

884
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,100
take this.

885
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:37,300
Mr. Wang,

886
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,300
what a clever move.

887
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,900
It was my mistake

888
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,540
to arrange the pieces here.

889
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,300
Playing chess

890
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,220
is like appointing people.

891
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:52,020
You have to put it

892
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,660
in the right position

893
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:56,100
to play its value.

894
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,060
So...

895
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,220
Chief Yuan

896
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,780
has got the Guild's badge

897
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,500
and can enter and exit the Guild freely.

898
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,740
It seems that Mr. Wang

899
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,260
is going to make good use of him.

900
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,300
Mr. Ning,

901
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,900
your men are all over Haifang.

902
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:10,940
Nothing escapes your eyes.

903
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,020
It's not about

904
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,340
if anything can escape my eyes.

905
00:41:14,780 --> 00:41:16,420
But what's so special about Chief Yuan

906
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:19,620
that impressed you?

907
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,620
Recently, several foreign merchant ships

908
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,180
were robbed in Haifang.

909
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,580
We haven't found out
the details of the pirates yet.

910
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:29,980
As for the background of Chief Yuan...

911
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,500
My bad.

912
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,460
Mr. Wang, just be careful.

913
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,420
Mrs. Ning's cargo

914
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:46,220
is among the lost cargo ships.

915
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,700
Mrs. Ning cares about the poor
in Haifang,

916
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,900
so she specially shipped herbs
from other places.

917
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:53,620
She's really well-intentioned.

918
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:56,900
But

919
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:59,140
I heard that

920
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,020
Yuan Lang

921
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,620
and Mrs. Ning

922
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,620
were old acquaintances.

923
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:07,220
Presumably the matter of pirates

924
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,780
has nothing to do with him.

925
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:11,220
I hope so.

926
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:21,780
I am afraid

927
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,900
you are going to lose this.

928
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,100
Mr. Wang, hold on.

929
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,540
Victory or defeat

930
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,780
is not yet

931
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,460
