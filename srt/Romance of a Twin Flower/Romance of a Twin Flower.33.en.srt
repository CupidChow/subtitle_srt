according to my source,

he hasn't succeeded once.

38
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,050
And every time he was at it,

39
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:56,050
he was quite half-hearted.

40
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,450
With the Dragon Gang's strength,

41
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,570
it's impossible for them

42
00:03:58,570 --> 00:03:59,660

00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:03,860
it's time for you to face the music.

46
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:07,420
Yes.

47
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:18,810
We failed.

48
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,930
There'll be no charge.

49
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,100
I heard the Tea Gang was quite capable,

50
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,420
and that your father Yuan Dingshan

51
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,900
was the right-hand man

52
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,780
of Cai Wenzheng.

53
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,860
People say "Like father like son".

54
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,980
I don't believe

55
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,370
that you are incapable of doing it.

56
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,420
My father and the Tea Gang

57
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,900
are history now.

58
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,810
I only want to lead the elders

59
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,930
to live a peaceful life.

60
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,100
You want peace,

61
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,020
but the others won't grant you peace.

62
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,580
If Ning Yuxuan

63
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,130
finds out the truth,

64
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,460
he'll kill you for sure.

65
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,220
I'm a descendant of the Tea Gang.

66
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,540
Ning Yuxuan will find out

67
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,730
my identity sooner or later.

68
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:09,290
But I've prepared

69
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:11,020
to fight him to the end.

70
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:13,980
There's more

71
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:16,020
to the truth.

72
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,250
What do you mean?

73
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
Your father

74
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:22,130
is not only Ning Yuxuan's enemy

75
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,930
but also the entire Tea Gang's.

76
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,250
That's nonsense!

77
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:30,130
Back then, Cai Wenzheng
and Ning Zhongtian

78
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,860
agreed to submit to the court together.

79
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,170
But your father was against the idea.

80
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,020
So, he disguised himself as Cai Wenzheng,

81
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,420
met with Ning Zhongtian

82
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,810
and killed him.

83
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:40,690
Therefore, your father

84
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:43,130
is the sinner of the entire Tea Gang.

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,610
No one can slander

86
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,370
my father.

87
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,020
Ling Jianxing,

88
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,460
if you dare to insult him again,

89
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,810
I'll kill you right now.

90
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,730
Did I say anything wrong?

91
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,100
I'm only telling the truth.

92
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,730
You can investigate it
if you don't believe me.

93
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,290
Yuan Lang,

94
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,810
Ning Yuxuan's father

95
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:07,020
was killed by yours.

96
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,370
So, obeying me unconditionally

97
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,250
is your only way out.

98
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,660
Otherwise, I'll be more than happy

99
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,250
to tell those elders of the Tea Gang

100
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:15,780
who

101
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,220
was the real traitor

102
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,930
that made them homeless.

103
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:37,050
It matters to your father's reputation.

104
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:39,250
Think carefully.

105
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:49,900
Bamboo basket.

106
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,050
Check it out.

107
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:51,900
It's quite strong.

108
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,220
Man,

109
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,660
why have you been looking sad

110
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,930
since you came back this time?

111
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:58,610
You can tell me anything.

112
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,660
I'm fine, Dad.

113
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:05,810
Don't worry.

114
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,980
You have me.

115
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,540
No matter you need money or people,

116
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,810
I'm ready to help.

117
00:07:12,290 --> 00:07:13,370
Since I support you

118
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,540
to participate in
the Imperial Supplier Contest,

119
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,220
I'll have your back all the way.

120
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,370
Tell me.

121
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:24,860
It's the second round

122
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,050
of the contest now.

123
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:26,860
We need to make

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,050
1,000 bottles of Feiwan Face Cream.

125
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:31,420
But my shop is extremely

126
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,250
shorthanded.

127
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,170
If I need

128
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,460
to hire some people whom I can trust,

129
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:36,490
I…

130
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:39,460
I wonder

131
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,540
if I can hire the boatmen

132
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,580
of Ship Guihai.

133
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,460
The boatmen of Ship Guihai

134
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,540
are indeed trustworthy,

135
00:07:48,810 --> 00:07:49,660
but they are all

136
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,050
strong sailors.

137
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,170
I'm afraid they aren't the best fit

138
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,930
for such fine work as making face cream.

139
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,170
It did

140
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:02,610
cross my mind.

141
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:04,460
But

142
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:05,930
I still have time

143
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:06,980
before the deadline.

144
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:07,930
So,

145
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:10,020
if I take some time to teach them

146
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:11,780
and let them practice,

147
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,730
maybe

148
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:14,370
they'll be able to do it well.

149
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,370
Alright,

150
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,580
then let's give it a try.

151
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,290
Thank you, Dad.

152
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,370
Let's go.

153
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,460
Mr. Yuan.

154
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:29,780
Chief Yuan.

155
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:31,940
- Chief Yuan.
- Yuan…

156
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,980
Mr. Ji.

157
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:36,060
What's wrong?

158
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:39,940
Why are you so absent-minded?

159
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,250
I'm fine.

160
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,010
You are fine?

161
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:46,860
Mr. Yuan,

162
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:48,940
you don't look fine.

163
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:50,130
- Yeah.
- Are you…

164
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,180
I have things to do.

165
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:52,730
I've got to go, Mr. Ji.

166
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,130
Mr. Yuan.

167
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,490
What's wrong with him?

168
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:15,130
Your Lordship.

169
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,060
How's Man

170
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,820
doing?

171
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,370
She's been busy

172
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:23,980
managing her shop

173
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,580
as usual.

174
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:28,130
But she went to the wharf

175
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,010
and visited Mr. Ji today.

176
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,410
Visited Mr. Ji?

177
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,180
She went to him for help, I guess.

178
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,220
Now,

179
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,650
help me contact a few people.

180
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,100
Don't move.

181
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:22,370
Lang.

182
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,130
Put down your sword.

183
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,100
Put it down.

184
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,410
Dad.

185
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:31,820
I was teasing Wu.

186
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:32,460
That's rude.

187
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,460
Apologize to Wu.

188
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,250
Wu,

189
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,820
go back to work.

190
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,890
Yes.

191
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,540
I'm leaving.

192
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,250
Lang,

193
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:06,490
your sword

194
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,890
should be used to fight enemies.

195
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:12,770
You must remember

196
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:15,340
that no matter when,

197
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:16,940
you can never point

198
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,300
your sword at your fellow brothers.

199
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,130
Understood?

200
00:11:22,700 --> 00:11:23,410
Dad,

201
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,130
I'm sorry.

202
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,580
Line up, guys.

203
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:31,650
You'll all get one.

204
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,250
Thank you.

205
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:32,820
Here.

206
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,530
Take it.

207
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:36,610
Thank you. Thanks.

208
00:11:37,490 --> 00:11:38,580
Thank you. Thank you.

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,340
Thanks. Thank you.

210
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:40,820
Here.

211
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,820
You told me

212
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,820
not to betray

213
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:47,410
our fellow brothers.

214
00:11:52,340 --> 00:11:53,250
I've got

215
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,490
to find out the truth.

216
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,130
Lang,

217
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:32,250
what are you doing here?

218
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,130
Mr. Wu,

219
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,460
I want to see my father.

220
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,580
I thought we talked about this.

221
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,610
You can't come here

222
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,180
without my notice.

223
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:43,860
If your father's whereabouts

224
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,010
or your identity is exposed,

225
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:45,890
it'll be

226
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,340
a matter of life and death.

227
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,530
I have something to ask him.

228
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,300
I really need to see him.

229
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,490
Alright. Go ahead.

230
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:13,700
Father.

231
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:21,700
Father.

232
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,060
It's me,

233
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,530
Lang.

234
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,700
I came to visit you.

235
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:37,060
How have you been doing?

236
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,460
Father,

237
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,860
I came here today

238
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,530
because I have a question for you.

239
00:13:58,650 --> 00:13:59,980
Father, please look at me.

240
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:05,300
Father,

241
00:14:06,650 --> 00:14:07,700
I heard

242
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,650
an absurd story lately.

243
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:09,610
Would you like me

244
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,490
to tell you the story?

245
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,980
Tell a story.

246
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:17,820
Hear a story.

247
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,530
Lang liked me to tell him stories

248
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,060
when he was little.

249
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,730
Okay.

250
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,340
Tell me the story. I want to hear it.

251
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,580
Okay.

252
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,410
- Okay.
- Father,

253
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:39,610
here's the story.

254
00:14:40,530 --> 00:14:41,460
Once upon a time,

255
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,610
there was a group of people,

256
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,700
and they were good friends.

257
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,250
They fought against the evil

258
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:49,890
and helped the poor together.

259
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,940
They helped a lot of people.

260
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,980
But one day,

261
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,650
the second brother

262
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,820
betrayed the leader,

263
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,340
and this group of people

264
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:07,650
either died

265
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,100
or got caught.

266
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,370
This group of people had a name.

267
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,130
The Tea Gang.

268
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,980
Who are you?

269
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,580
Who are you?

270
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,340
Who are you?

271
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,580
Where's Lang?

272
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:00,890
Who on earth are you?

273
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:04,820
Father,

274
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,370
you disguised yourself as Mr. Cai,

275
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:08,770
killed Ning Zhongtian,

276
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:10,100
and betrayed the entire Tea Gang,

277
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:10,770
didn't you?

278
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,340
It was you, right?

279
00:16:12,610 --> 00:16:14,650
You betrayed the Tea Gang.

280
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:15,820
Lang.

281
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:16,890
Lang, Lang.

282
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:17,410
What did you say

283
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:18,370
to make him furious like this?

284
00:16:19,010 --> 00:16:19,610
Father,

285
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:22,890
I only want

286
00:16:22,890 --> 00:16:24,010
to hear you say no.

287
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,490
Lang, please leave.

288
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,490
Stop irritating your father.

289
00:16:26,490 --> 00:16:27,410
I'm not leaving!

290
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,220
I want him

291
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,530
to tell me the truth in person.

292
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,980
He's become like this.

293
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,410
What can he tell you?

294
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:38,410
Don't cause trouble anymore.

295
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:39,250
Father,

296
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,490
I don't believe it.

297
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,370
I don't believe

298
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:45,530
that you'd betray the Tea Gang.

299
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,130
Lang,

300
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:47,700
what are you talking about?

301
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:48,490
Get him out of here.

302
00:16:48,490 --> 00:16:49,650
Lang, please leave.

303
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,300
Come on.

304
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:53,460
I'm not leaving.

305
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,450
Wenzheng,

306
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:16,740
Tiger,

307
00:17:20,610 --> 00:17:21,540
it's my fault.

308
00:17:26,020 --> 00:17:27,740
I'm so sorry.

309
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:32,820
It's my fault.

310
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,260
My fault.

311
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,130
I'm really sorry.

312
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,210
I…

313
00:17:58,370 --> 00:17:59,860
I'm sorry.

314
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,300
(Haoxue Cosmetics)

315
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:06,860
Miss Shui,

316
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,100
I can do this.

317
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:09,450
Seriously.

318
00:18:09,450 --> 00:18:10,580
I can certainly do this.

319
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,690
Come on. Faster.

320
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:15,780
What have you done?

321
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,890
You broke it.

322
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,970
How come it's broken?

323
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,410
You said you could do it.

324
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,410
But now you broke it.

325
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:21,260
I really can do it.

326
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:22,610
It's not my fault that it's broken.

327
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:23,060
This…

328
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:23,780
Don't pretend that you can…

329
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:24,860
Don't you dare drag me.

330
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,020
- What are you doing?
- How dare you hit me?

331
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,170
You started it first.

332
00:18:27,170 --> 00:18:28,170
Did they hurt you?

333
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:29,340
Just stop it already.

334
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:30,260
It's okay.

335
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,340
Don't you hit me.

336
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:31,970
How arrogant you are.

337
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,260
The ingredients are all ruined

338
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,060
by you guys.

339
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,100
We didn't ruin anything.

340
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,210
Excuse me,

341
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,780
let's call it a day.

342
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:39,820
Please go back first.

343
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:40,820
Let's go.

344
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,410
Come on, let's go.

345
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,450
Stop blaming others.

346
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,540
Look at you.

347
00:18:43,610 --> 00:18:44,100
Sorry about it.

348
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,500
Stop it.

349
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:45,820
Sorry.

350
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:46,970
Let's go.

351
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,820
Stop showing off.

352
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,780
Are you worried about me?

353
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:05,690
Don't worry.

354
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:07,370
They may be short-tempered,

355
00:19:07,370 --> 00:19:08,780
but they are all very nice

356
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:09,970
and eager to learn.

357
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,580
Even if it'll take a little longer,

358
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,860
I'm sure they'll learn it eventually.

359
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,170
What brings you here, anyway?

360
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
I was just passing by.

361
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,690
I've got everything ready

362
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,820
as you asked, Your Lordship.

363
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:41,650
Besides,

364
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,370
Princess Ruyue has been recruiting

365
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:44,410
experienced female cosmetic formulators

366
00:19:44,410 --> 00:19:45,170
in Haifang with high pay.

367
00:19:45,890 --> 00:19:47,340
Those who are good at making face cream

368
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,890
have probably been hired by her.

369
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:53,130
She pulled the same old tricks again.

370
00:19:54,170 --> 00:19:54,970
Anything about

371
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:55,890
Ling Jianxing?

372
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,130
The spies

373
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:58,370
haven't shown up for days.

374
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,690
I guess

375
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,540
Ling Jianxing no longer suspects

376
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,170
you and Her Ladyship.

377
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,860
Then there's no need
for us to pretend anymore.

378
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:15,020
And there's no point for her

379
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:15,860
to keep staying here.

380
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,020
In that case,

381
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:26,540
we'll pack our stuff

382
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,580
these days

383
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:29,210
and leave the Magistrate's Residence.

384
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,500
That's not what I meant.

385
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:35,610
I mean,

386
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:38,020
since…

387
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,650
I want to go back to Ship Guihai.

388
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,500
Miss Ji,

389
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:50,820
there's something urgent that I need you

390
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:52,210
to help me deal with.

391
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:57,650
What is it?

392
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:01,020
Come with me.

393
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:25,610
You press too hard.

394
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,650
Be gentle.

395
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:27,540
You must be gentle,

396
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,060
so the powder will come out finer.

397
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:29,930
Got it?

398
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:30,860
Okay.

399
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:32,410
Ma'am,

400
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,100
it's

401
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,210
too much. Too much.

402
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:34,930
Take a little out.

403
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:35,370
Here.

404
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,780
Okay, take some out.

405
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:38,340
Put it here.

406
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:39,610
Okay.

407
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:40,690
There you are.

408
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:46,970
Just like that.

409
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:48,780
Good.

410
00:21:51,170 --> 00:21:51,580
Here.

411
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,740
Ms. Yang's family

412
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,170
is running a flower shop.

413
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,370
Ever since we let the Dragon Gang

414
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,500
take over the management of the wharf,

415
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,060
their flowers have arrived
every day on time.

416
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,300
Mrs. Ning, nice to meet you.

417
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,130
Your business is booming, right?

418
00:22:00,130 --> 00:22:01,060
Thank you, Mrs. Ning.

419
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:02,170
We are doing very well.

420
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,100
Ms. Zhou's husband

421
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,500
used to be a gambler.

422
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,610
Since we seized

423
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:15,340
Jiumu Casino,

424
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:16,690
her husband found

425
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:17,890
a job at the wharf.

426
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:19,780
He doesn't gamble anymore, right?

427
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:20,740
Not anymore.

428
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,650
Mrs. Ning is such a smart woman.

429
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,580
That day when you criticized
those men at the casino,

430
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,820
my husband happened to be there.

431
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,370
He was enlightened by your
wisdom and courage,

432
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:28,260
and he hasn't

433
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,580
gambled once ever since.

434
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,210
You found them all?

435
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:44,580
I borrowed Ruyue's method,

436
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,060
and I had Gui Bai

437
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,100
find them in secret.

438
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:48,450
Once they learned that you needed help,

439
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,890
they couldn't wait to come and help you.

440
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,930
I think these people

441
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,410
are more suitable

442
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:55,650
for making face cream

443
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,690
than those sailors.

444
00:22:56,690 --> 00:22:57,610
And Ruyue

445
00:22:58,210 --> 00:22:59,060
will never find this out.

446
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:01,930
Thank you.

447
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,410
You can put a little more

448
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,500
white poria cocos.

449
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,820
That's right.

450
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,690
And some more liquorice.

451
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,580
Okay.

452
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:27,780
I got it.

453
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,740
OK.

454
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:00,740
My Lady.

455
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:03,890
My Lady.

456
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:04,890
You are back.

457
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,300
There's a lot of stuff.

458
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,060
Muxu and I

459
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,130
aren't sure what to take.

460
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,610
We need you to make a decision.

461
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,450
It's okay. You decide.

462
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:32,940
(Practice Makes Perfect)

463
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,450
Everything's the same with Nie Sangyu.

464
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:38,740
I don't see any difference.

465
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:40,970
Tell me about it.

466
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,370
I'm also curious.

467
00:24:42,370 --> 00:24:43,610
Your Highness, you've recruited

468
00:24:43,610 --> 00:24:45,100
all the experienced female
cosmetic formulators in Haifang.

469
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,170
Where did she find

470
00:24:46,170 --> 00:24:47,170
so many helpers?

471
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,930
How come we know

472
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:49,500
nothing about it?

473
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:50,650
I bet it's Ning Yuxuan

474
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:51,650
who helped her in secret.

475
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,450
What a crafty and sly couple.

476
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,170
They are both troublemakers.

477
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,860
Then what should we do next?

478
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,170
Keeping looking into it, of course.

479
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:02,130
Also,

480
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,820
we can't let her get her way.

481
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,370
Since she managed to find helpers,

482
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:10,130
let's give her something else
to worry about.

483
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:11,500
Yes.

484
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:19,300
Put 5 maces of rose petals

485
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:21,340
and 5 maces of safflower petals.

486
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,930
Oh, don't forget to put

487
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,820
3 maces of…

488
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:26,540
Done.

489
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,580
Girls, you are all

490
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,540
talented and capable.

491
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,610
And you are so good

492
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,740
at making Feiwan Face Cream.

493
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,780
I'm sure we can deliver

494
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,210
our products on time.

495
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:33,890
That's right.

496
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,370
Be it Mingyue or Ruyue,

497
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:36,780
no one can compare to Her Ladyship.

498
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:37,370
Exactly.

499
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,130
Let me see.

500
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:44,060
Put a little bit more, it'll smell…

501
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:44,740
Mrs. Ning.

502
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:45,860
Okay. Alright.

503
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:48,300
Give me a second.

504
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:50,170
Careful.

505
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:51,210
That smells good.

506
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,820
What's up?

507
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:53,020
Bad news.

508
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:54,300
What happened?

509
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,340
I just went to the ceramic kiln house

510
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,610
to fetch the containers
for Feiwan Face Cream.

511
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,740
The owner told me

512
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:58,820
that Ruyue reserved

513
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:00,170
all the ceramic kilns in Haifang.

514
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:01,610
What?

515
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,210
She wouldn't leave me any chance.

516
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,300
I was being too careless.

517
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:11,130
Not just the ceramic kilns,

518
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,860
she even bought all the containers

519
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,100
from the retail stores.

520
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,970
I asked the store owners

521
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:15,860
who are close to us.

522
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,300
Their containers are all out of stock.

523
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:22,860
Well…

524
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,450
Mrs. Ning, will our Haoxue Cosmetics

525
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,410
really be defeated

526
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:27,860
because of the shortage of containers?

527
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,580
How could it be?

528
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:34,970
Let's figure out something else.

529
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,580
Are there any spare containers

530
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,060
or any substitutes?

531
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,540
Usually, it'll work.

532
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,370
But this is for
the Imperial Supplier Contest.

533
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:43,540
Without proper containers,

534
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,970
we'll be at a big disadvantage

535
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:45,500
in terms of packaging design.

536
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:48,450
You are right.

537
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:57,060
Sang Shen,

538
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:58,930
get my father here.

539
00:26:59,100 --> 00:26:59,540
Go.

540
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
Yes, My Lady.

541
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,410
Bro,

542
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,130
why did our chief

543
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:12,780
gather us all here suddenly?

544
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:13,450
Is he going to assign us

545
00:27:13,450 --> 00:27:14,020
some work?

546
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,450
Long,

547
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,210
what's going on with our chief lately?

548
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,260
He left Haifang in a hurry a while ago,

549
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:19,100
and then rushed back soon after.

550
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,970
And he's been acting weird

551
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:21,540
ever since he came back.

552
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,930
Did something happen?

553
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,580
Is everybody here?

554
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:26,580
They are all here.

555
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:26,970
Good.

556
00:27:26,970 --> 00:27:27,690
I also think

557
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,260
Chief has been acting weird.

558
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,340
Chief.

559
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,340
Chief,

560
00:27:40,930 --> 00:27:42,370
you gathered all of us here

561
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:43,370
in a hurry.

562
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,580
Is there anything

563
00:27:44,610 --> 00:27:46,340
you want us to do?

564
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:49,170
I gathered all the fellow brothers

565
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:50,540
of the Tea Gang here

566
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:54,610
because I want to atone
for my father's crime.

567
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:56,610
Crime?

568
00:27:57,060 --> 00:27:57,780
What crime?

569
00:27:58,780 --> 00:27:59,580
Crime of what?

570
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,370
It was my father who betrayed

571
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,410
the entire Tea Gang.

572
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,450
What?

573
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,890
Is that true?

574
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:09,300
How come?

575
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,930
Lang,

576
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,500
what are you talking about?

577
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,300
Why?

578
00:28:12,370 --> 00:28:13,340
My father was the one

579
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,820
who disguised himself as Mr. Cai
and killed Ning Zhongtian.

580
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,450
He betrayed the entire Tea Gang

581
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,540
and harmed our brothers.

582
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,860
He's responsible

583
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,500
for all the evildoings.

584
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:28,690
How's that possible?

585
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:30,860
It's not possible.

586
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:31,860
No,

587
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,410
there must be a misunderstanding.

588
00:28:33,410 --> 00:28:34,500
There's no misunderstanding.

589
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:37,820
It's the truth.

590
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:41,060
I've confirmed it

591
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,260
with my father.

592
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,780
As his son, I should pay his debts.

593
00:28:49,410 --> 00:28:50,930
I, Yuan Lang, am here today

594
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,930
to atone for my father's sin.

595
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,410
Fellow brothers, if you

596
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,130
want to avenge

597
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,130
your families,

598
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,410
just take it out on me.

599
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:00,580
Chief.

600
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,860
What are you doing?

601
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:22,020
Don't you dare!

602
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:26,340
Kill me if you want.

603
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,690
I will not fight back.

604
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,130
Chief.

605
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,210
Chief.

606
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,170
Back then, the second chief
made a mistake.

607
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,130
As a result, the Tea Gang was destroyed,

608
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,860
and we ended up homeless.

609
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,820
But today, you are the one

610
00:29:49,610 --> 00:29:51,210
who got us back together

611
00:29:51,410 --> 00:29:52,860
and gave us a new Tea Gang.

612
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:55,970
That's right.

613
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,820
Regardless of the grudge
of the last generation,

614
00:29:57,820 --> 00:29:58,370
Lang,

615
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:00,060
you saved us

616
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:01,020
and gave us

617
00:30:01,170 --> 00:30:02,650
a new home.

618
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,340
Under your leadership,
we help those in need

619
00:30:04,450 --> 00:30:05,820
and live a stable life.

620
00:30:06,820 --> 00:30:09,340
That's right, Chief.

621
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:30,060
Lang,

622
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,650
come on,

623
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:31,650
get up.

624
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:32,370
You too,

625
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,340
please get up.

626
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:33,930
Come on.

627
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:42,020
Let bygones

628
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
be bygones.

629
00:30:43,930 --> 00:30:44,580
Lang,

630
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,860
since our fellow brothers
are willing to follow you,

631
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:48,930
you'll be

632
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:50,890
our good brother,

633
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,130
as well as our good chief.

634
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:56,100
- Chief.
- Chief.

635
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,890
Chief.

636
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,740
My Lady,

637
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,060
Mr. Ji is here.

638
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:33,060
Dad.

639
00:31:33,610 --> 00:31:34,370
Man.

640
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:35,820
Why do you want to see me

641
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,690
in a hurry?

642
00:31:36,930 --> 00:31:38,370
I've got something important
to talk to you.

643
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:38,970
Here, have a seat.

644
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:40,780
Something important?

645
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,540
Is it about making face cream?

646
00:31:43,690 --> 00:31:45,650
I know nothing

647
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,210
about making face cream.

648
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,930
It's not about making face cream,

649
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,860
but the face cream bottles.

650
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,890
Bottles?

651
00:31:52,890 --> 00:31:53,650
Here's the thing.

652
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,930
My shop Haoxue Cosmetics

653
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:56,370
is going to participate
in the Imperial Supplier Contest,

654
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,130
and we need to produce

655
00:31:58,130 --> 00:31:59,170
1,000 bottles of Feiwan Face Cream.

656
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:00,500
But I didn't find out until today

657
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,060
that all the ceramic kilns in Haifang

658
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,540
have been reserved by someone else.

659
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:05,020
So, I have no other choice

660
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,260
but to ask you

661
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,930
for help.

662
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:08,930
You want me to help you

663
00:32:08,930 --> 00:32:10,210
ship bottles over by sea?

664
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:14,780
Time is pressing.

665
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,450
Shipping the bottles by sea

666
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:18,500
could take longer than you expect.

667
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:23,650
Dad,

668
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,300
please think of a way.

669
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,860
When it comes to sea transportation,

670
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,130
others may not be able to do it,

671
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:29,970
but you certainly can.

672
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,820
You are Guihai Warrior, after all.

673
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,450
Alright.

674
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,100
How can I let

675
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,170
my daughter down?

676
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:46,340
I'll send someone right now

677
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,500
to purchase the bottles for you by sea,

678
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:48,860
and I'll have them shipped back
as soon as possible.

679
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,260
Really?

680
00:32:50,410 --> 00:32:51,100
I promise

681
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,410
I'll have the bottles delivered

682
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,860
to you before the second round

683
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:56,130
of the contest.

684
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:57,740
That's great.

685
00:32:58,170 --> 00:32:59,300
That's great, Mr. Ji.

686
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:00,020
Awesome.

687
00:33:01,450 --> 00:33:02,820
I may know nothing

688
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,060
about making face cream,

689
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:05,780
but I've never

690
00:33:06,410 --> 00:33:07,100
failed

691
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:09,060
in delivering cargo by sea.

692
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,690
Dad,

693
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:12,340
you are doing me a big favor.

694
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:13,780
I knew you'd have a way.

695
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:15,410
Thank you so much.

696
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:16,890
No need to thank me.

697
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:18,060
You are my daughter.

698
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,370
Of course I'll help you.

699
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:20,300
Alright.

700
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:21,780
Dad,

701
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:22,820
we've cooked lunch.

702
00:33:22,820 --> 00:33:23,450
Please eat something before you go.

703
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,500
Yeah, please.

704
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,130
Maybe next time.

705
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,300
I'll go to the wharf right now

706
00:33:27,300 --> 00:33:28,500
and take care of the shipping thing.

707
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:29,970
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

708
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:30,780
Dad, you won't eat anything?

709
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,300
Thank you, Mr. Ji.

710
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,370
Business comes first.

711
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:34,930
That's great.

712
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,170
So great.

713
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:38,410
Guihai Warrior indeed

714
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,930
lives up to his reputation.

715
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:40,860
The bottle problem

716
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:41,890
was resolved so quickly.

717
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:42,860
Tell me about it.

718
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:45,370
Mr. Ji didn't even

719
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:46,500
have time for lunch.

720
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,930
Let's get him a gift to thank him.

721
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,340
Okay.

722
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,130
Let's go.

723
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:54,370
What's wrong with him?

724
00:34:54,570 --> 00:34:56,260
- What's wrong?
- What happened to him?

725
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,140
There's blood.

726
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,010
Why is he bleeding?

727
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:00,820
You'll be fine.

728
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,660
How's Gui Bai?

729
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:03,450
Your Lordship.

730
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:04,820
- Gui Bai.
- It's not looking good.

731
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:05,570
Where's the doctor?

732
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,930
Didn't you call the doctor?

733
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:07,860
The doctor is on his way over.

734
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,220
Gui Bai.

735
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:09,140
- You'll be fine.
- Gui Bai.

736
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:10,410
Gui Bai, you are safe now.

737
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:11,700
It's okay. It'll be fine.

738
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,700
How did he get hurt?

739
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:13,530
I'm not sure.

740
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,220
I took Muxu

741
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:16,410
to buy a gift for Mr. Ji.

742
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:17,930
And then I heard

743
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,050
someone got hurt.

744
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:19,970
When I walked over,

745
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,450
I found him fainted on the ground.

746
00:35:21,450 --> 00:35:21,970
Gui Bai.

747
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,220
Crossbow.

748
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:23,620
Gui Bai.

749
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,970
Gui Bai, wake up.

750
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:25,490
Gui Bai.

751
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:26,300
The shooting range
of crossbow is quite short.

752
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,410
He was ambushed.

753
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:31,490
Ambushed?

754
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:32,700
Ambushed…

755
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,570
Mr. Ning,

756
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:35,050
maybe he got hurt

757
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,180
because of me.

758
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,490
My former fiancé Qian Yiming

759
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,570
has been following me lately.

760
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:41,530
And Gui Bai has been

761
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,700
protecting me these days.

762
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:43,970
I think

763
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,660
it's Qian Yiming who hurt him.

764
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:46,620
It's got to be him.

765
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:47,860
Qian Yiming.

766
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:48,660
Gui Bai.

767
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:49,530
Gui Bai.

768
00:35:50,050 --> 00:35:50,490
Gui Bai.

769
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:51,700
Take good care of him.

770
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,780
I'll investigate it myself.

771
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:54,260
Gui Bai.

772
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:55,930
Gui Bai.

773
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,340
Gui Bai.

774
00:35:59,010 --> 00:35:59,450
You'll be fine.

775
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:01,050
Miss Shui, the medicine
has just been delivered.

776
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:01,930
It's all here.

777
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,410
You'll be fine, Gui Bai.

778
00:36:03,530 --> 00:36:04,180
You'll be fine.

779
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,180
Gui Bai. Gui Bai.

780
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:08,220
No.

781
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:09,860
This medicine is not working.

782
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:10,930
It's not working.

783
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:12,780
Then what do we do?

784
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:16,930
I have a formula.

785
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:22,860
Muxu,

786
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,090
please help me get the medicine.

787
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,300
Go.

788
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:27,570
Okay.

789
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:28,370
You are being followed.

790
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:28,740
Gui Bai.

791
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:29,220
Run.

792
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,010
- Run.
- Gui Bai.

793
00:36:30,010 --> 00:36:31,090
I'm here. I'm here.

794
00:36:31,530 --> 00:36:31,970
Gui Bai.

795
00:36:31,970 --> 00:36:33,050
You are not safe here.

796
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:34,820
Leave it to me.

797
00:36:34,890 --> 00:36:36,620
I'm here. I'm fine.

798
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:37,180
Run.

799
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,860
Gui Bai.

800
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:39,570
Run. Run.

801
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:40,370
- What did you say?
- Run.

802
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:41,970
Run.

803
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:43,620
As a shadow guard…

804
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,930
As a shadow guard,

805
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:47,780
I don't wish to be with you forever.

806
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:49,220
I only want

807
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:52,820
to protect you for a lifetime.

808
00:36:52,820 --> 00:36:54,620
Protect you for a lifetime.

809
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,450
Protect you for a lifetime.

810
00:36:56,930 --> 00:36:58,930
I want to protect you for a lifetime.

811
00:36:59,370 --> 00:37:00,490
Miss Shui,

812
00:37:00,970 --> 00:37:01,860
let me protect you for a lifetime.

813
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,820
You fool.

814
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,780
So what if you are a shadow guard?

815
00:37:06,410 --> 00:37:08,220
Love is love.

816
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:10,010
Let me protect you for a lifetime.

817
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,090
Shadow guards

818
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,260
don't deserve love and happiness?

819
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:14,930
A lifetime.

820
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:18,660
I want to protect you for a lifetime.

821
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:21,450
I know.

822
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:24,050
I know.

823
00:37:26,490 --> 00:37:28,300
I want to protect you for a lifetime.

824
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,090
Sir.

825
00:37:30,410 --> 00:37:31,620
Sir, I need to get some herbs.

826
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,410
Sure. What do you need?

827
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:33,740
30 maces of camphor,

828
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:34,490
30 maces of rosin,

829
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,010
3 maces of musk, 3 maces of mastic,

830
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:36,660
one mace of catechu,

831
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,530
and 3 maces of borneol.

832
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:38,490
Please hurry.

833
00:37:46,930 --> 00:37:48,180
Are you sure this formula

834
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:49,180
is correct?

835
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,820
You could remember it clearly

836
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,050
just by eavesdropping?

837
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:55,180
Your Highness, don't forget

838
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,300
that I'm from a family of pharmacists.

839
00:37:57,530 --> 00:37:58,780
I'm familiar

840
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,340
with all kinds of herbs

841
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,300
and I can recite them all.

842
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:03,620
I can tell the purpose of the medicine
just by hearing the formula.

843
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,100
(Traumatic Medicine Formula)

844
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:07,180
What do you think of this formula then?

845
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:08,220
This formula

846
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,530
is indeed special.

847
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:10,530
Looks like coming all the way

848
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,450
to Haifang is worth it.

849
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:12,450
Speaking of which,

850
00:38:12,450 --> 00:38:13,740
I should thank you for your plan.

851
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:15,570
Not only did you hurt Gui Bai

852
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,530
and help me vent my resentment,

853
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:19,860
but you also helped me

854
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,180
get the formula easily.

855
00:38:23,570 --> 00:38:25,300
But it's a formula for medicine.

856
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,570
Can I use it for my face cream?

857
00:38:28,930 --> 00:38:30,700
As long as the formula is correct,

858
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:32,180
it should work.

859
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:33,490
Fine.

860
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:35,570
Then I'll let you

861
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:36,930
confirm the formula

862
00:38:36,930 --> 00:38:38,260
and concoct the face cream.

863
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:40,930
Your Highness, rest assured.

864
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:42,050
I won't let you

865
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:43,220
and Mr. Ling down.

866
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:47,970
Put the vegetables here.

867
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:49,140
Over here.

868
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:49,570
Okay.

869
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:51,220
Here. Put them here.

870
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,410
About 5 catties of vegetables.

871
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,530
Put the vegetables and fruits here.

872
00:38:53,970 --> 00:38:54,490
Alright.

873
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,700
5 catties of apple.

874
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,450
Okay, put them here.

875
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,300
Okay.

876
00:38:59,340 --> 00:38:59,890
Man.

877
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:01,220
Dad.

878
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:02,890
Dad.

879
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:03,890
Man,

880
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:06,090
you don't have to be here and help me.

881
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:07,700
Just focus on the contest preparation.

882
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:08,620
What?

883
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,140
You helped me,

884
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,140
and I can't lend you

885
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,970
a hand?

886
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:14,530
You've

887
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:15,820
packed all your stuff, right?

888
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:18,570
When will you move back?

889
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:24,490
Almost done.

890
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm really worried

891
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,780
that you young people
will act on impulse

892
00:39:29,890 --> 00:39:31,530
and do something stupid.

893
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:34,490
The longer you stay with Ning Yuxuan,

894
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:36,490
the harder it is for you to leave him.

895
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,370
I know, Dad.

896
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:42,090
A new batch of provisions just arrived.

897
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:42,860
I'll go have a look.

898
00:39:43,370 --> 00:39:44,300
Man.

899
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:50,970
Ji Ming.

900
00:39:53,570 --> 00:39:54,620
Xiangyuan.

901
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:55,740
What brings you here?

902
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,260
His Majesty ordered me

903
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,490
to come to Haifang for some business.

904
00:40:00,410 --> 00:40:01,010
I see.

905
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:02,860
Man.

906
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:04,180
Coming, Dad.

907
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:05,660
What's up?

908
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,050
Say hi to Mr. Nie.

909
00:40:12,450 --> 00:40:13,180
Man.

910
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,450
Mr. Nie

911
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:16,370
has known about your situation.

912
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:21,340
Mr. Nie,

913
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:22,570
I'm sorry.

914
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,700
I fell into the water and lost my memory.

915
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,820
And I entered
the Marquis's Mansion by accident.

916
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:27,820
That's why…

917
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:31,050
That's why I kept my identity from you.

918
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,010
She looks so much like her.

919
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,780
The resemblance is uncanny.

920
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,340
Except for parents and immediate family,

921
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,370
no one can tell

922
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,970
the difference between them.

923
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,970
Even I

924
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:48,260
have a hard time telling the difference.

925
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,410
Looking at Man

926
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,620
is like looking at Sangyu.

927
00:40:53,050 --> 00:40:54,260
It's such a pity

928
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:58,410
that she died so young.
