[Main Dancer, KIM SUJUNG: But JIYOON doesn't know Part 10's dance.]

1664
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,980

00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,930
[Main Dancer, KIM SUJUNG:
It'll take a long time to memorize the moves because it's a solo.]

1666
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:28,150
[It's a solo, so it's hard to show immediately.]

[Part 11, MAI: If JIYOON takes Part 11,]

[After giving up the parts, the atmosphere turns tense]

I didn't know what to do.

1683

[Center, CHOI JUNGEUN: I want to tell everyone]

1695
00:55:58,660 --> 00:56:03,760
[Center, CHOI JUNGEUN: that there'll definitely be disappointment after parts change,]

1696

[Center, CHOI JUNGEUN: but the arrangement is for our team.]

1697
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:11,350
[There are only 12 parts. The 12 I-LANDERS can't all be satisfied.]

1698
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:09,840
So I think we should forget what we're feeling right now

1699
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,770
and focus on the part we'll do next.
