00:00:02,730 --> 00:00:04,460
Tonight...

2
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:09,820
is the semi-final, in which the 10 contestants who will join the final will be decided.

3
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:13,840
Out of 12 I-LANDERS, there are only 10 who can survive.

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,130
Only three contestants chosen by I-MATES and seven chosen by the producers can survive.

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:22,380
The candidates to be in the finals and the girl group produced by Teddy.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,060
Who will be in the final 10?

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:32,080
(I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN)

8
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,180
Each match glowed like a shooting star with her desperate dreams.

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:41,740
Perhaps the little match girl thought,

10
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,580
"As long as I keep dreaming, the flame within me will burn forever."

11
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,900
12 I-LANDERS, the protagonists of the story...

12
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:53,480
It will be strictly an individual match from now on.

13
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:56,000
- I won't lose.
- I have nothing but spite now.

14
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,600
- Because I'm desperate...
- A subtle mind game and battle.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,540
There's really no time left.

16
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:06,170
(The competition got more fierce with each test!)

17
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,120
After a fierce competition to survive...

18
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,300
1st place I-LANDER, Koko.

19
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,720
I can't believe it.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,350
This isn't where you belong.

21
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,060
I'll go back up.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,950
(The individual ranking changed after the Main Position Test)

23
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,700
Tonight,

24
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,970
Self-made?

25
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,010
It could be my last performance.

26
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:27,320
This is the last semi-final before the final.

27
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,110
I need to stand out more.

28
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:30,980
I couldn't tell who the center was.

29
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,860
Pick one thing. Do it properly.

30
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:37,900
Through the semi-final test tonight,

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,450
the final 10 contestants who will join the final will be determined.

32
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,480

34
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,680
Teddy, the world's top-class, will be the executive producer for this super girl group.

35
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:59,410
Tonight, the elimination that determines who will join the final will be aired live globally.

36
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,150

Hello, this is Sung Han Bin of ZEROBASEONE.

00:04:09,610 --> 00:04:13,580
Tonight, this is the last test of Part 2 and it's semi-final

56
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:17,130
that will determine the final 10 to enter the final.

and be in the super girl group produced by Teddy?

60
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,010
There are currently 12 I-LANDERS.

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,730
Two I-LANDERS will leave the I-LAND after this live show.

62
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:50,320
(Two contestants will be eliminated)

63
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,390
This is how the contestants to enter the final will be determined.

64
00:04:58,390 --> 00:05:03,950
I-MATE SAVE VOTE will determine three contestants to enter the final.

65
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:06,390
And the producers will choose seven.

66
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,930
There will be a total of 10 contestants.

67
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:14,940
Firstly, three contestants will survive according to the I-MATE SAVE VOTE.

The second round of preliminary save vote

69
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,240
and the live vote, which will start momentarily, will be combined

70
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,220
and the first to third-place contestants,

71
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:31,450
who got the highest scores will join the final.

72
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:37,550
Seven out of the remaining nine contestants will be saved by the producers.

73
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,760
The two contestants who weren't chosen will be leaving I-LAND.

74
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:51,400
Not just I-MATES, but their decisions will be crucial tonight.

75
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:56,910
They will determine the future of I-LANDERS in I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

76
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,110
These are the five producers.

Tonight, the producers will decide the I-LANDERS' fate.

82
00:06:26,090 --> 00:06:30,900
Taeyang, you must be feeling the pressure tonight.

83
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,670
Please say a word on behalf of everyone.

84
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,990
Being on I-LAND reminds me of the old days.

85
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:43,340
And most of all, I can feel your desperate desire for your dreams.

86
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:46,670
It makes me nervous and excited, too.

87
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:54,690
Tonight, you will be approaching a step closer to your dream.

88
00:06:54,690 --> 00:07:01,990
Since the producers need to make a big decision, we're feeling pressured, too.

89
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:09,500
Don't get nervous, and show us what you practiced tonight. Fighting.

90
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:14,190
Thank you for your words.

91
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:20,140

The first to third-place contestants of I-MATE SAVE VOTE

94
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,740
will go straight to the final regardless of the producers' decision.

95
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,970
You remember, right?

96
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:47,110
The vote from the live show today will be worth three times more

97
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:54,490
and the voting will end in about an hour after all the performances have ended.

98
00:07:55,620 --> 00:08:00,910
Who's the "I" you want to save?

99
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:03,380
The decision made by the I-MATES all over the world.

100
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:12,020
The second round of I-MATE SAVE VOTE, which will determine the Top 3, starts now.

101
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,120
In the second round of SAVE VOTE, which will determine the final contestants,

102
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:24,280
the votes we received from the second SAVE VOTE in advance and the live votes

103
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:27,480
we'll be receiving will be combined.

104
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:32,050
The votes during the live show will count three times more and

105
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:33,800
the voting will end during the live show.

106
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:37,940
On I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN's official platform, Mnet Plus app,

107
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:40,570

Then, press the "Vote" button at the bottom.

111
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,760
When the voting certificate appears, your vote is complete.

The voting result will be reflected in ratio of 50% from the Korean region,

113
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,790
and 50% from all the other global regions.

114
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:04,840
All counted votes will be converted into scores and applied accordingly.

115
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,400
Soon, the live vote will start.

116
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:13,750
Five, four, three, two, one.

117
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,780
Voting starts.

118
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,810

The live vote, which will determine their fates, started.

00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:39,450
You can save three I-LANDERS right now.

122
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:45,550
Whose hand will you hold? I hope you make the decision quickly.

123
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:48,310
The semi-final performances will start soon,

124
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:55,280
but I heard there was drama among I-LANDERS preparing for this round.

125
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,160
Let's see how they prepared for the semi-final now.

126
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,580
(Right before last week's Main Position Test announcement)

127
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,440
What do we do, Unni?

128
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:11,250
(Top 3 Bedroom)

129
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:13,790
(1st place bed)

130
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:15,380
We're switched now.

131
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,280
I can't believe it. What do we do?

132
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:21,310
(During the Main Position Test announcement)

133
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,600
(Koko made 1st place)

134
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:32,450
2nd place, Bang Jeemin.

135
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:34,390
What do we do, Unni?

136
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,190
Congrats, Koko.

137
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,050
Hold on.

138
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,250
(Why is she shutting the door?)

139
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,890
My gosh!

140
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,950
(Excited baby dinosaur)

141
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:54,110
Koko won 1st place.

142
00:10:54,110 --> 00:10:55,620
Yay!

143
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,880
I was so happy.

144
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,820
Lie down, Koko.

145
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,240
Get in that bed.

146
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,980
(She's excited down to her toes)

147
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,010
Gosh, Unni. I was so jealous each day.

148
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:09,580
Really?

149
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:13,040
(Exactly a week ago in the same place)

150
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,840
(She witnessed the power of the automatic bed)

151
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:18,530
(It stole Koko's heart)

152
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:19,620
Unni.

153
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,780
(Satisfied)

154
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,130
Wow.

155
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:26,550
The legs go up, too?

156
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,510
So fascinating.

157
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,820
I can't wait to use it.

158
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,390
(And now)

159
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,210
(Dreams come true)

160
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:38,530
(1st place bed is in operation)

161
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:43,130
The 1st place bed was incredible.

162
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,750
It moved so naturally.

163
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,550
It was so comfortable.

164
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,850
I switched spots with Koko.

165
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:53,790
I got jealous of her this time.

166
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:58,410
I felt a bit disappointed and sad.

167
00:12:00,310 --> 00:12:03,200
Hello, I'm your new roommate.

168
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,480
Hello.

169
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,660
(Nodding casually in American style)

170
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,970
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

171
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,720
- Who used to be here?
- Saebi.

172
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,300
Jeong Saebi's hair!

173
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:18,040
Jeong Saebi's hair!

174
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,010
(During the Signal Song Test)

175
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,250
Koko...

176
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,480
needs to practice more.

177
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,200
I think you need to practice your pronunciation a lot.

178
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,640
Okay.

179
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:34,910
Koko, I'd like you to practice rapping more.

180
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:37,420
Just focus on coming back up.

181
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:39,070
I'm not sure.

182
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:41,820
(Koko witnessed Jiyoon saying, "I'm not sure")

183
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,440
How could she?

184
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:48,510
Jiyoon is so scary. I got nervous.

185
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:50,470
(Originally was in 3rd place in Producer Assessment)

186
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:51,840
(Bedroom for fourth to sixth place)

187
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,300
Fuko, you're just one ranking away from joining them.

188
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,720
- Yes.
- Your eyes...

189
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,330
I'm not satisfied.

190
00:13:02,330 --> 00:13:05,170
3rd place, Fuko.

191
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:08,360
5th place, Fuko.

192
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,200
I'll do better in the next test and go up in ranking.

193
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:16,670
6th place is just one ranking away.

194
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:19,800
I thought I might get eliminated any time.

195
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,960
I was determined to go back up quickly.

196
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:29,340
I didn't have to remove everything.

197
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,050
(Juwon's route)

198
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:34,870
Going back and forth.

199
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,910
It's right in the front.

200
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,240
(Last week's route)

201
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,580
I didn't have to switch rooms at all.

202
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:46,980
I moved to the bed right in the front.

203
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:49,820
I'm back to the same bed.

204
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:54,460
(Bedroom for 7th to 9th place)

205
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,450
(Jeong Saebi already looks depressed)

206
00:14:02,860 --> 00:14:07,010
(Right before switching bedrooms)

207
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,430
I don't want to go.

208
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:12,990
(She was the only one who left the Top 3 bedroom)

209
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:16,520
Let's meet here again.

210
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:32,050
I'm more upset about how far I've fallen than not getting the debut badge.

211
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:35,890
I was in 1st place, 3rd place, and now in 7th place.

212
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,930
I'm so upset about that.

213
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,690
(The dramatic night ended)

214
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:53,420
Everyone, go to the lobby.

215
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,800
It's the semi-final round.

216
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,710
My heart is racing.

217
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:02,530
I really need to do well this time.

218
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:10,620
This is the last test that determines the final contestants.

219
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:13,060
Right after the performance,

220
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:20,140
there will be an elimination.

221
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:24,330
What if it ends up being my last performance?

222
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:28,430
My ranking is very low. I felt nervous and scared.

223
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,320
It's so cruel.

224
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:35,940
The number of eliminated I-LANDERS from this test will be...

225
00:15:40,010 --> 00:15:42,500
Will be...

226
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,740
two.

227
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,630
two.

228
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,810
Two?

229
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:50,570
Getting eliminated now would be...

230
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,250
I kept thinking, "Let's just not get eliminated."

231
00:15:57,250 --> 00:16:00,630
The final 10 contestants to join the final test.

232
00:16:00,630 --> 00:16:03,050
This is how they will be determined.

233
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:05,290
It won't be the same as before?

234
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:07,110
Out of the 12 I-LANDERS,

235
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:13,350
the Top 3 I-LANDERS who end up... in the 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote...

236
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:14,540
Three?

237
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,110
will survive regardless of the producers' decision.

238
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:21,500
And they will go straight to the final.

239
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,360
Must be nice.

240
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:26,820
I think Jeemin will be in 1st place.

241
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,400
Top 3 chosen by the I-MATES?

242
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:32,630
I thought, "It probably won't be me."

243
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:38,400
And out of the remaining nine, the producers will save seven of them.

244
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,280
The producers will decide?

245
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:45,110
10 I-LANDERS in total will enter the final.

246
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,680
You have to be chosen by the producers unless you're in the Top 3.

247
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,760
Since I entered Part 2 after being picked by the producers,

248
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:57,610
I want to be picked by them this time, too.

249
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:01,540
Honestly, I'm nervous about both.

250
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,630
It's so scary.

251
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:08,770
I'll reveal the third test now.

252
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,380
(Please)

253
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:13,570
It needs to be something I'm good at.

254
00:17:13,570 --> 00:17:14,820
(Self-made Test)

255
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,200
Self-made?

256
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,350
Self-made?

257
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,780
What does that mean?

258
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,350
Sounds like we're making something.

259
00:17:22,350 --> 00:17:23,700
Make what?

260
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:29,420
In the Self-made Test, the I-LANDERS have to create the performance on their own.

261
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:36,600
Song choice, members, stage and outfit concepts, and stage direction.

262
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:40,010
You're required to make decisions for all of them. - That's too hard.

263
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,280
I wasn't sure what to do.

264
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,870
I thought, "This is getting harder."

265
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,370
I've never seen a mission like this. - I didn't even imagine a mission like this.

266
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:54,580
I didn't think we'd have to create a performance from scratch.

267
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:56,670
My head is about to hurt again.

268
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,040
There will be two units of six contestants.

269
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:05,000
The two centers will decide the members.

270
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:11,940
Each unit's center can decide the song of her choice and the members to join her.

271
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,680
That's a great privilege. - That's a lot of pressure.

272
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:19,270
Each unit's centers will be announced now.

273
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:22,020
I think it'd be the 1st and 2nd place.

274
00:18:22,020 --> 00:18:24,070
Will it be?

275
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:29,200
The 1st and 2nd place contestants will be the centers.

276
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,930
(Koko & Bang Jeemin)

277
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:33,810
(Current 1st and 2nd place take the center for two units)

278
00:18:33,810 --> 00:18:35,770
I'm jealous.

279
00:18:35,770 --> 00:18:38,910
I've been wanting to be the center.

280
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:45,100
"The day is finally here," I thought.

281
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:48,900
Here are the test songs you need to practice.

282
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,460
(Koko and Jeemin will pick the test songs)

283
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:53,600
("Into the New World" by Girls' Generation)

284
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,180
"Into the New World!"

285
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,680
So many. So many.

286
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,800
(The test songs are flooding in)

287
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,550
There's "Fearless." I want "Fearless." - "Attention!"

288
00:19:08,550 --> 00:19:11,240
- I want "Fearless." - "Into the New World."

289
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,890
These groups changed the trend as they made the entrance.

290
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,430
They're the debut songs by the K-Pop groups that represent their generations.

291
00:19:18,430 --> 00:19:25,050
Pick one song you want, and picture the final debut group you want.

292
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:27,830
Wow.

293
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:32,290
- It's been so long.
- My dream started with Girls' Generation.

294
00:19:34,630 --> 00:19:36,350
This is straight out of a textbook.

295
00:19:36,350 --> 00:19:39,780
Every idol trainee performed this song at least once.

296
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,020
It's so legendary. Seriously.

297
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:46,560
"Into the New World" was the song I wanted to avoid.

298
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,180
Isn't this such a legendary debut song?

299
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:52,540
I watched this video so many times. - Me, too. I love it.

300
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,830
("DALLA DALLA" by ITZY)

301
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:56,820
It's so high-pitched.

302
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,950
(I like all the songs...)

303
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:17,590
("Latata" by (G)I-DLE)

304
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:20,780
I like "Latata," too.

305
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,410
It's all about the voice.

306
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:30,810
"Latata" by (G)I-DLE was my first choice.

307
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,730
This is so legendary.

308
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:39,050
("Attention" by NewJeans)

309
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,080
One, two, three.

310
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,020
(They checked out all nine songs)

311
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:55,150
I had about five or four songs I wanted.

312
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:02,540
Two centers, Koko and Bang Jeemin. Choose your members.

313
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,320
(Center: Bang Jeemin)

314
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,710
(Center: Koko)

315
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,900
Koko, who has a higher ranking, may choose a member.

316
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,790
Just one second.

317
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,090
So cute.

318
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,330
(1 minute left)

319
00:21:18,330 --> 00:21:20,020
Koko.

320
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,830
Hold on.

321
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,580
(Walking slowly)

322
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,240
Where are you going?

323
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,740
This is the hardest.

324
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:32,350
Choose the song and the members that suit the song.

325
00:21:32,350 --> 00:21:34,460
Choose the song first.

326
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,410
There were so many songs I wanted.

327
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:44,790
I wanted to do "Latata."

328
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:47,890
The vocalist who suits this song is Jiyoon.

329
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,200
And I want Sujung as the dancer.

330
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:55,100
(1st place, Koko gets to choose a member first)

331
00:21:55,100 --> 00:22:00,900
The first I-LANDER I'm choosing is...

332
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,380
Jiyoon.

333
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,980
(Koko picked the vocalist first, just like Jeemin)

334
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,570
(Her sky is falling down)

335
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,630
Thank you.

336
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,470
(Jeemin lost Jiyoon to Koko)

337
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:21,080
Bang Jeemin, choose a member.

338
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,440
This is so hard.

339
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,350
(Jeemin is torn after losing Jiyoon)

340
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,740
My gosh.

341
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,930
(Another member she wanted was Sujung)

342
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:34,310
The I-LANDER I'm choosing is...

343
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,360
Fuko.

344
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,520
Thank you.

345
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:42,310
I thought I should secure a vocalist first.

346
00:22:42,310 --> 00:22:45,680
(Jeemin chose Fuko as the vocalist)

347
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,770
(She didn't choose Sujung since she had to secure Fuko)

348
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:52,150
She can't want Sujung, too.

349
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,910
(Koko stands up)

350
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:59,920
The second I-LANDER I'm choosing is...

351
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:03,020
(Can it be?)

352
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,360
Kim Sujung.

353
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,710
Kim Sujung.

354
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,500
(Devastated)

355
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:19,130
(My goodness)

356
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,690
(No way)

357
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,890
(Twisting in pain)

358
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,070
(Which dancer will she choose?)

359
00:23:28,070 --> 00:23:33,480
The I-LANDER I'm choosing is Ryu Sarang.

360
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,040
Thank you.

361
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:38,240
(She chose Ryu Sarang, an all-rounder)

362
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,580
(Is it my turn again?)

363
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:43,450
Choose carefully.

364
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:45,580
You're scary!

365
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:48,270
(Yoon Jiyoon cheered her up)

366
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:49,830
Son Juwon.

367
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,170
Choi Jungeun.

368
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,630
Nam Yuju.

369
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,400
Jeong Saebi.

370
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,020
Mai.

371
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,790
Kim Gyuri.

372
00:23:58,790 --> 00:24:02,870
Both units have members now.

373
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:09,160
You'll be choosing the test songs soon.

374
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:13,390
Koko will choose a song first.

375
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:16,500
(There are 10 minutes to make a decision)

376
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:21,160
(After the meeting, the leaders will make a decision in the Decision Room.

377
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,420
If you just look at the songs,

378
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:27,670
I think "Latata" would suit us well.

379
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:29,570
(How will the members react?)

380
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:32,590
I also thought it'd suit us.

381
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,630
I thought...

382
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:37,900
none of us care about the concept too much.

383
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,480
But "Latata" involves rapping.

384
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:44,930
But "Latata" involves rapping.

385
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,200
"Latata" has six members. We don't have to change the formation.

386
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,550
(The same song?)

387
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:56,460
"DALLA DALLA" has a cool performance.

388
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,810
(As long as it's not "Latata")

389
00:24:58,810 --> 00:25:01,260
(Sujung is singing "Black Mamba")

390
00:25:02,090 --> 00:25:03,680
(Team Koko is mentioning many songs)

391
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,910
I like "Bad Girl, Good Girl."

392
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:11,220
(Jeemin is worried about which song Team Koko will choose)

393
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,970
It's time to decide on the test songs.

394
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,640
Have you decided?

395
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:24,550
(Choose the test song you want)

396
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:28,430
(The Decision Room)

397
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,530
Koko.

398
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,470
The song I chose is...

399
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:44,800
The song I chose is "Latata" by (G)I-DLE.

400
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,260
(Which song did they choose?)

401
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:54,460
I'll reveal the test songs the centers of each unit chose.

402
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,460
This is the test song Koko chose.

403
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,940
(Team Koko considered many songs)

404
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,380
(Which song did they choose?)

405
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:05,310
(Did they choose "Latata," Jeemin's first choice?)

406
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:09,220
(They were given nine options)

407
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,760
(Jeemin chose "Latata")

408
00:26:11,550 --> 00:26:13,310
(Did Koko make the same decision?)

409
00:26:13,310 --> 00:26:16,400
(What would be the result?)

410
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:19,790
Wow!

411
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:22,790
("Latata" by (G)I-DLE)

412
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,460
Nice!

413
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,270
Yay!

414
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:30,880
(What's our song, then?)

415
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,790
(The first I-LANDER chose this song. You cannot choose this song.)

416
00:26:37,790 --> 00:26:39,710
I knew it, Koko.

417
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,890
(Team Koko chose "Latata")

418
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,950
Which one should I choose?

419
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,440
Koko chose the members...

420
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:51,300
and song I wanted. I was at a loss.

421
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,260
The song I choose is...

422
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:57,570
I wonder what Jeemin chose.

423
00:26:57,570 --> 00:27:00,030
- I'm so nervous.
- What did Jeemin choose?

424
00:27:00,030 --> 00:27:03,140
(Team Jeemin is worried that it can't be "Latata")

425
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,170
I wish they didn't reveal it today.

426
00:27:06,170 --> 00:27:08,510
Why? Why?

427
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,680
(What did she choose?)

428
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,780
(Team Jeemin chose "Into the New World")

429
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,370
(Mai has never been so shocked)

430
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,980
(She's actually happy)

431
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:24,770
Well, I thought a lot about it.

432
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,840
(During the song choice meeting)

433
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,950
Is there a song you want?

434
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:32,830
I want "Into the New World."

435
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:36,100
"Into the New World" is so nice.

436
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:39,380
(Their second choice was "Into the New World")

437
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:42,220
Considering the general vibe of the team,

438
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:46,860
"Into the New World" was the one that'd suit everyone.

439
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,240
(Jeemin chose "Into the New World" for her unit)

440
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:55,850
To be honest, it wasn't a perfect concept for our unit.

441
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,480
I did the right thing, right?

442
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,200
(What results would their decisions bring?)

443
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,900
Let me ask you this first.

444
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,770
Koko, why did you choose us?

445
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:20,360
You're the people I wanted to practice with when we first met.

446
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,900
How fascinating.

447
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,510
(Oh, really?)

448
00:28:23,510 --> 00:28:26,800
(Fist bump attempt failed)

449
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,630
How about Sujung?

450
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:32,350
She wants to fist bump.

451
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,200
(Unit "Latata" isn't quite in sync yet)

452
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,320
To be honest, I didn't want to work with Yuju.

453
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,460
(Koko's attack on Yuju)

454
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:46,610
When we did "SPICY" together...

455
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,960
(Koko and Yuju had a fierce competition)

456
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,380
Let's fight! Let's fight!

457
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,140
I'm scared of Yuju. I don't like her.

458
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,530
(Come on)

459
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,940
We're the top members of each position.

460
00:28:58,940 --> 00:29:01,020
You're both main vocalists and...

461
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,020
(Main vocalist unit)

462
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,260
(Main rapper unit)

463
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,800
They're the main rappers and...

464
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,180
(Main dancer unit)

465
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:14,350
And we're the main dancers.

466
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:17,010
We each have clear positions.

467
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:21,370
We're all top members in our positions.

468
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:24,240
I think we're a great team.

469
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,720
Shall we assign parts, then?

470
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,620
The first part should be given to the center, right?

471
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,610
The center should do the first part.

472
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:34,150
I think so.

473
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,080
This is for Koko.

474
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,320
The latter part.

475
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,370
The "How far" this part.

476
00:29:39,370 --> 00:29:41,780
The "Burn more" part.

477
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:45,170
(Two parts are left)

478
00:29:45,170 --> 00:29:48,280
I think it should be either Jungeun or Juwon.

479
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:51,080
The remaining parts are the refrain parts.

480
00:29:53,450 --> 00:29:57,390
The first is an impactful refrain.

481
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:00,990
The second part is high-pitched.

482
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:05,510
I thought I needed to do the first part.

483
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,090
(Juwon is trying the first part)

484
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:22,570
(Jungeun is trying the same part)

485
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:32,900
I do think the second one was better.

486
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:38,160
Try singing the "Latata" part.

487
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,490
(They're trying the high-pitched refrain part)

488
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:49,980
I want Jungeun to do the "the song for you" part.

489
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,310
But Juwon has to do the "Latata" part, then.

490
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:58,160
I'm not sure if I can pull off that part.

491
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,780
But it didn't sound so bad.

492
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,600
I think Juwon should do this part.

493
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,720
(The members want Juwon to do the high-pitched part)

494
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:13,210
I'll do the "Latata" part. You should do the two refrain parts.

495
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:19,590
But I feel like everyone wants you to do this part.

496
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,220
This is a team, but choosing the part you want is...

497
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:25,900
- But you also-
- I don't mind the "Latata" part.

498
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,840
- Really?
- Yes.

499
00:31:29,110 --> 00:31:32,600
I think it's up to you two to decide.

500
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,450
(The two of them will make the decision)

501
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:38,000
(Juwon looks worried)

502
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,380
I'm going crazy.

503
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:45,200
My head hurts.

504
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:49,400
(Juwon is torn between the team vs. individual)

505
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:52,290
I'll do the "Latata" part, then.

506
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:54,840
(Juwon chose the second refrain part)

507
00:31:54,840 --> 00:31:57,130
I don't know why I keep thinking this,

508
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:01,290
but I thought she'd be better at it.

509
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:06,130
I had no confidence since I kept thinking that.

510
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:13,160
(Juwon is practicing the high-pitched part)

511
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:16,610
Why did I say I'd do this part?

512
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:21,650
Too high. Too high.

513
00:32:21,650 --> 00:32:24,320
I should've just done the refrain part.

514
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,300
(2F Practice Room)

515
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,130
(Watching "Into the New World" to assign parts)

516
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,720
I decided for the team, not just for myself.

517
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:40,980
I think it'd suit everyone on my team.

518
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:45,290
I can pull off the pure image.

519
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:48,420
I was very satisfied.

520
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,640
Should we assign parts first?

521
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,550
Yes.

522
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:57,400
The first parts that come to mind are...

523
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,150
I want Fuko to do the "Unknown future" part

524
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,390
And I want Gyuri to do the...

525
00:33:02,390 --> 00:33:05,180
"No need to talk while looking at each other."

526
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:07,710
(Leader Jeemin is recommending parts)

527
00:33:07,710 --> 00:33:11,620
I think it'd suit you well.

528
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,250
It's just my opinion.

529
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:19,410
I think it would've made sense if it were a team battle.

530
00:33:19,410 --> 00:33:22,770
But it's an individual battle.

531
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,750
Yes, it is.

532
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:30,870
I think each person should pick the parts they want.

533
00:33:30,870 --> 00:33:33,560
Since this is the last semi-final before the final,

534
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,690
I want to show off what I'm best at.

535
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,360
I thought I should take as many parts as possible

536
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,000
and do the best I can.

537
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,840
I wanted that part.

538
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:49,840
Do you guys have the parts you want?

539
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,850
(Jeemin is attempting to assign parts again)

540
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,970
(What did you say?)

541
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:59,600
Which part? Which one?

542
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,940
Any parts you want?

543
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:06,630
Everyone is greedy with parts since it's an individual battle.

544
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,790
So, my voice got quiet for no reason.

545
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:12,240
(Her voice is getting quieter and quieter)

546
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,680
Should we start with the intro part?

547
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:21,330
(The intro of "Into the New World" starts with Yuri)

548
00:34:21,330 --> 00:34:23,970
But Jeemin is the center of our team.

549
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:28,230
I think it'd be nice if Jeemin started it.

550
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,590
I wanted the intro part,

551
00:34:30,590 --> 00:34:32,490
but I couldn't attempt to take it.

552
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,730
Because Unni is the center.

553
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:39,150
I think we can each take one before the refrain.

554
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:43,070
I want the first verse.

555
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:44,590
Me, too.

556
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:50,800
But I think the same person should do the intro and first verse.

557
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,710
Really?

558
00:34:52,710 --> 00:34:57,860
(Mai thinks Jeemin should do the intro and first part)

559
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,250
But it gets too long. The intro is about 30 seconds long.

560
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,050
You do the intro, and Saebi does the next part.

561
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:11,220
I think you should do the "Special" part.

562
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,900
Saebi and I kept wanting the same parts.

563
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:19,790
But it's true that Saebi suits this song well.

564
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:21,990
So I let her have it.

565
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,510
(Saebi took the first part)

566
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:26,090
Look how happy she is right now.

567
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,710
No, it's not like that.

568
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,930
And...

569
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:35,360
The chorus part should...

570
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,940
How about Jeemin, since it's the refrain?

571
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,240
Can I have it? Thank you.

572
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,330
Will Jeemin do all the first three verses, then?

573
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,340
I'll do the first part for now.

574
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,620
Should we give the "Countless" part to someone else?

575
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,420
Sounds good.

576
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:57,300
I thought, "I could go home after this."

577
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:02,170
I thought I should do the refrain, at least.

578
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:05,540
I'll definitely take the refrain part if I can.

579
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,640
But don't we all want the refrain part?

580
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,110
Everyone wants to be the center.

581
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,270
Everyone wanted to be the center so much.

582
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,910
It was so hard. I felt so frustrated.

583
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:22,640
Let's leave the third verse empty for now.

584
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,600
Should we choose the two dancers for the dance break?

585
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,650
(The dance break is very impactful)

586
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:34,420
I want to do the dance break.

587
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:36,080
Me, too.

588
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:38,110
Me, too.

589
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:42,770
Can we discuss this ourselves?

590
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,680
(The dance break applicants are leaving)

591
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,050
It's hard to do this when nothing is decided.

592
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:53,610
Since Jeemin is the center of this performance,

593
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,840
I think she should do the dance break part.

594
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:57,630
I had a different idea.

595
00:36:57,630 --> 00:37:01,070
We gave her the intro and outtro since she's the center.

596
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:04,280
But she's doing the refrain, too, in addition to her existing part.

597
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,340
If she does the dance break part, too,

598
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:12,510
we'd be like Jeemin's backup singers and dancers.

599
00:37:12,510 --> 00:37:16,440
I think we should split things up evenly.

600
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,950
What we thought was...

601
00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:22,390
The two should do the dance break and...

602
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:24,730
I'm a bit disappointed that I didn't get it,

603
00:37:24,730 --> 00:37:26,480
but it's okay.

604
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,440
There are two people who want it.

605
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,410
The "This black night" and "This moment" parts.

606
00:37:32,410 --> 00:37:34,490
I want one or the other.

607
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,490
I want the "This moment" part.

608
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:40,330
Gyu Ri and Fuko. In that order.

609
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:44,370
I want the "I love you. This feeling" part.

610
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:48,190
I know how desperate everyone is.

611
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:53,320
As a leader, I tried my best to give them the part they wanted.

612
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,820
Should we choose to start from the intro, then?

613
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,710
Any ideas about the intro?

614
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,230
Koko chose this team and the song.

615
00:38:07,230 --> 00:38:12,260
So, I'd like her ideas to be reflected in the concept and storytelling.

616
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:14,040
I'd prefer to hear more of your opinions.

617
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,000
Because all of us have a lot of opinions.

618
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:22,220
You might end up getting discouraged.

619
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:24,850
So, I'd like you to talk a lot to avoid that.

620
00:38:24,850 --> 00:38:26,290
Okay.

621
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,890
Should we come up with the concept first?

622
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:32,640
I'd like a cowgirl theme.

623
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,420
I'm thinking a bar vibe.

624
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:36,880
A cocktail bar?

625
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,390
How about the six of us sit at a bar in the intro?

626
00:38:40,390 --> 00:38:42,920
That doesn't sound bad.

627
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,150
- Why does purple keep coming to my mind?
- Me, too.

628
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:50,680
The thin, flowy purple fabric keeps coming to mind.

629
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:52,730
How about a swordsman type of thing?

630
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:55,150
- I love it.
- Something like that.

631
00:38:55,150 --> 00:38:58,410
(Purple? Flowy? Swordsman?)

632
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:03,280
The members have a lot of ideas.

633
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,150
But they're all good ideas.

634
00:39:05,150 --> 00:39:07,350
I really love it.

635
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:09,340
(Sharing the 114th idea)

636
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:11,210
(Approving the 114th idea)

637
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:15,940
How about we light it with a lighter?

638
00:39:15,940 --> 00:39:17,850
What do you think, Koko?

639
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:20,260
What image comes to mind?

640
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,940
Center.

641
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,890
I wanted to hear a lot of Koko's opinions.

642
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,560
But she seemed to struggle to speak up.

643
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,880
I hope she isn't like that the entire time.

644
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,160
(Unit "Latata" started the choreography meeting)

645
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,970
This part. What would be good?

646
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,150
To be honest, I felt frustrated.

647
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:48,790
Should I move off to the side?

648
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:50,810
Jiyoon can do the sitting part.

649
00:39:50,810 --> 00:39:54,000
Oh, should we? You're a genius.

650
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,880
How about switching to this?

651
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,000
(Koko is just watching the members coming up with ideas)

652
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,870
That sounds good, too.

653
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:03,480
Ready, go.

654
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:06,020
(Sujung is leading the practice)

655
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,960
Let's do it in a V shape in this part.

656
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,550
Myself and Koko here. Jiyon. Yuju.

657
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:16,900
And here. A V-shape like this.

658
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,690
I'm confident about this mission.

659
00:40:19,690 --> 00:40:22,370
Since we have Kim Sujung.

660
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,270
(A day already went by)

661
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:32,200
Self-evaluation starts now.

662
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:36,190
(Both units come to the main practice room)

663
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,800
(Jeemin looks worried)

664
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,640
(Self-evaluation started with Unit "Latata")

665
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,730
(Koko is starting off "Latata")

666
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,330
(What kind of feedback will they get?)

667
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,290
Koko started the song.

668
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:24,630
I could tell what she was trying to communicate.

669
00:41:24,630 --> 00:41:27,470
I think she's a good center.

670
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:33,140
Koko and the rest of the members complimented each other.

671
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:35,320
Thank you.

672
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:39,820
(Unit "Into the New World" is next)

673
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,350
What a powerful formation.

674
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:47,140
(The powerful intro starts)

675
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:51,480
(Can Unit "Into the New World" get positive feedback?)

676
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,920
(Unlike Unit "Latata")

677
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,260
(Saebi, not the center, is starting the song)

678
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,150
(Jeemin finally became the center in the refrain part)

679
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:39,000
(The center is located all the way in the back)

680
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:57,100
Question.

681
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:59,370
Are you satisfied with the parts you have?

682
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,230
Everyone?

683
00:43:01,230 --> 00:43:03,540
Are you satisfied with the parts you have?

684
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:05,210
Everyone?

685
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,550
Everyone?

686
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,280
I'm satisfied.

687
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,540
How about the rest?

688
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,680
One person doesn't look happy.

689
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,160
One person doesn't look happy.

690
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:25,410
I'm not satisfied.

691
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:30,490
But especially Gyuri...

692
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:33,790
needs to be satisfied with it.

693
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,800
You really do.

694
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,530
Since you had many parts,

695
00:43:40,530 --> 00:43:43,120
I thought you were the center at first.

696
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:45,750
But in the refrain part, Jeemin came out.

697
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:49,140
So, I realized Jeemin was the center.

698
00:43:49,140 --> 00:43:54,550
The fact that I realized it at the refrain means the parts were poorly assigned.

699
00:43:54,550 --> 00:43:56,630
The center didn't shine

700
00:43:56,630 --> 00:44:01,540
and why did Jeemin give up so much?

701
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:07,300
It felt like everyone did what they wanted.

702
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:15,390
It felt like all six of you think you're the center.

703
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,450
I think it'd be good to figure out the essence of the performance.

704
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,290
(After the self-assessment)

705
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:35,210
(Jeemin is approaching Koko)

706
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,130
- You did well.
- Jeemin.

707
00:44:38,130 --> 00:44:39,690
Unni, you should get greedier.

708
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:41,350
Don't yield. I'm serious.

709
00:44:41,350 --> 00:44:43,790
You're the center. You were born to be the center.

710
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,020
You're too nice.

711
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,410
You should do whatever you want to do.

712
00:44:47,410 --> 00:44:50,250
I think you can get greedier.

713
00:44:50,250 --> 00:44:53,710
Everyone freaked out about not having enough parts.

714
00:44:53,710 --> 00:44:55,240
Our team?

715
00:44:56,410 --> 00:44:58,280
Are you satisfied with your part?

716
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,660
- Yes.
- I'm jealous.

717
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,720
- Are you not satisfied?
- No.

718
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,940
Did you not get enough?

719
00:45:04,940 --> 00:45:10,490
No, I don't have that many parts, and it's not impactful, either.

720
00:45:10,490 --> 00:45:13,970
Everyone freaked out about not having enough parts.

721
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:15,750
- Our team?
- Yes.

722
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,950
(Bang Jeemin)

723
00:45:18,950 --> 00:45:20,270
I felt frustrated.

724
00:45:20,270 --> 00:45:23,240
(Jeemin knew the members were unsatisfied with the parts)

725
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:29,250
Since this is an individual battle...

726
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:32,640
and they need to make sure to stand out.

727
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:42,390
So, everyone wants to be the center.

728
00:45:42,390 --> 00:45:46,270
It's too tricky.

729
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:50,710
So frustrating. Gosh.

730
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:54,510
My unni is frustrated.

731
00:45:55,500 --> 00:46:00,520
(The members are hesitant to approach Jeemin, who's crying)

732
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:04,410
(What will the future of Unit "Into the New World" be?)

733
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:10,870
It's finally the semi-final.

734
00:46:10,870 --> 00:46:16,200
I'm so thankful that I came this far.

735
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,620
- There's no time.
- This is the hardest part.

736
00:46:21,250 --> 00:46:23,920
The final hurdle before the debut.

737
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:27,670
It's time to show what I've been working on.

738
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:30,000
What? 16 hours?

739
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,450
To be honest, I'm very nervous and scared, but...

740
00:46:33,450 --> 00:46:36,980
I decided to believe in myself one more time.

741
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:40,930
I can pull it off. I know I will.

742
00:46:40,930 --> 00:46:42,690
(Time is running out)

743
00:46:43,360 --> 00:46:44,900
Unni.

744
00:46:46,430 --> 00:46:50,290
I'll give the perfect performance in the semi-final, too.

745
00:46:50,290 --> 00:46:52,790
I'll try my best.

746
00:46:53,790 --> 00:46:57,080
I want to shine the brightest on stage.

747
00:46:57,080 --> 00:47:02,290
I'll enter the final and debut, too.

748
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:07,090
(Countdown finished)

749
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:16,930
As you saw, the semi-final will be the Self-made Test.

750
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:21,110
With the two centers as leaders, they chose the members,

751
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:26,180
song, and direct the performance on their own.

752
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:31,030
What did they end up creating amid the fierce competition?

753
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:35,310
Let's check out their performances now.

754
00:47:36,110 --> 00:47:39,740
Semi-final's first performance will be by...

755
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,090
Unit "Latata."

756
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:46,780
(Unit "Latata")

757
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:48,340
(Kim Sujung, Nam Yuju, Son Juwon, Yoon Jiyoon, Choi Jungeun, Koko)

758
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,610
The center of this unit is Koko.

759
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:58,340
The unit consists of strong and charismatic performers.

760
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:02,040
What kind of new performance will they show us?

761
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:08,460
The story and performance of Unit "Latata" starts now.

762
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:21,000
The midpoint check starts now.

763
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,180
- Hi.
- Hello.

764
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,600
- Have you been well?
- Yes.

765
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:30,810
It's important to sing and dance well in this mission,

766
00:48:30,810 --> 00:48:35,710
but it's important to keep thinking about how to create the performance.

767
00:48:35,710 --> 00:48:39,080
So I'm very looking forward to this test, too.

768
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:43,410
Could you explain the overall performance concept and story?

769
00:48:43,410 --> 00:48:45,550
Yes.

770
00:48:47,360 --> 00:48:51,470
(Unit "Latata" is presenting something)

771
00:48:51,950 --> 00:48:54,820
(Concept, stage design, choreography, and wardrobe)

772
00:48:54,820 --> 00:48:59,330
(The I-LANDERS prepared a presentation)

773
00:48:59,330 --> 00:49:01,470
(Presentation by Unit "Latata")

774
00:49:01,470 --> 00:49:06,260
Our concept is a purple flower.

775
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:08,460
Dark and...

776
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:10,970
Dark and...

777
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:13,200
Say hello first.

778
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,860
Two, three. Hello.

779
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:21,270
We're Team "Latata."

780
00:49:21,270 --> 00:49:24,870
Our concept is a purple flower.

781
00:49:24,870 --> 00:49:31,090
It protects... Protects...

782
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,480
Protects itself, trying not to open up to anyone.

783
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:42,130
For the background video, we'll use a dark forest at dawn.

784
00:49:42,130 --> 00:49:45,380
Use what?

785
00:49:45,380 --> 00:49:49,580
The LED screen will show a dark forest.

786
00:49:49,580 --> 00:49:52,260
- Dark forest? At dawn?
- Yes.

787
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,030
It will be something like that and...

788
00:49:54,030 --> 00:49:56,810
We wanted to lie down on a flower field.

789
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:00,520
We thought it'd be nice to have a small flower field.

790
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:03,200
Using the color purple and see-through fabric,

791
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:07,430
we'd like to accentuate our idea visually.

792
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:12,680
We think a calm and natural hairstyle would be nice.

793
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,380
Who comes with ideas the most?

794
00:50:14,380 --> 00:50:17,300
Sujung does.

795
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,420
To be honest, seeing the presentation,

796
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:26,870
I can't tell who the leader is between Koko and Sujung.

797
00:50:26,870 --> 00:50:31,900
I can't tell who the leader is between Koko and Sujung.

798
00:50:32,900 --> 00:50:35,630
Sujung helped her with the difficult part.

799
00:50:35,630 --> 00:50:39,220
I understand how you felt. And it was easy for us to understand.

800
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,890
But Koko won the center part by winning 1st place.

801
00:50:42,890 --> 00:50:46,560
So, I thought we could've given her time, too.

802
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:50,580
I do wish Koko had done the entire presentation.

803
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:55,950
Koko, do you think the overall direction

804
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:59,470
is what you wanted?

805
00:50:59,470 --> 00:51:02,820
I'm the leader,

806
00:51:02,820 --> 00:51:07,620
but I don't come up with ideas or speak.

807
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:12,880
So, I did feel guilty toward team members.

808
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:16,550
Koko, you need to sleep less and come up with ideas.

809
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:19,450
Winning 1st place comes with responsibilities.

810
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:22,620
Since you have the power, you need to work harder.

811
00:51:22,620 --> 00:51:26,430
You need to sleep less and feel more stressed than others.

812
00:51:26,430 --> 00:51:29,540
- The other members can't do the work for you.
- Right.

813
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,840
(Unit "Latata" after the midpoint check)

814
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:43,300
But to be honest,

815
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,120
I came up with a lot of ideas because I felt frustrated.

816
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:51,110
Because Koko didn't have any opinions.

817
00:51:51,110 --> 00:51:53,610
So I voiced my opinions a lot...

818
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:56,510
and I find that easier.

819
00:51:56,510 --> 00:51:58,460
I find helping you easier.

820
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:02,110
But the producers think I interfered with you.

821
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,220
I don't feel so good about that.

822
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:06,760
I wish it was more your idea.

823
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,270
Feel free to ask for help if you need it,

824
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:12,480
but I'd like you to take the lead more.

825
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,790
Thank you.

826
00:52:13,790 --> 00:52:15,810
It'd be better if you took the lead.

827
00:52:15,810 --> 00:52:18,530
Thank you, everyone.

828
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:21,960
I'm feeling guilty.

829
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:24,550
- No.
- No!

830
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,330
It's okay, Koko.

831
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:30,220
(Koko breaks down in tears, feeling guilty toward the members)

832
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:32,630
This is your first time as a leader.

833
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:35,850
I can make us stand out more,

834
00:52:35,850 --> 00:52:40,510
but I couldn't come up with ideas. So I relied on you all.

835
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:43,890
You helped me a lot.

836
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:48,510
I don't think I was a good leader.

837
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:52,490
I felt very bad for my team.

838
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:57,510
But we don't want you to take all responsibilities.

839
00:52:57,510 --> 00:53:01,620
Speak up more if you want something.

840
00:53:01,620 --> 00:53:04,150
Say, "I want this. I want that."

841
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:05,320
Thank you.

842
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,270
Don't feel pressured.

843
00:53:07,270 --> 00:53:09,240
You can do it.

844
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:14,850
I'll come up with as many ideas as I can

845
00:53:14,850 --> 00:53:20,450
and I want to talk to my teammates a lot.

846
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:24,130
(Unit "Latata" started practicing again)

847
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,400
Can you do the "I love you" part like this?

848
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,920
(Leader Koko is coming up with more opinions)

849
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:36,490
Juwon,

850
00:53:36,490 --> 00:53:38,680
can you do "I love you" like this?

851
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:48,480
- I did that.
- No.

852
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,110
How?

853
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:54,880
(Koko is leading proactively)

854
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,140
Suddenly, like this.

855
00:53:58,110 --> 00:54:00,860
- That's right.
- Good, good.

856
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:02,950
Right after the midpoint check,

857
00:54:02,950 --> 00:54:05,920
she proved herself to be a proactive leader.

858
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,510
I saw how responsible of a leader she was.

859
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:11,960
So, I felt happy and proud of her.

860
00:54:16,890 --> 00:54:18,670
The end!

861
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,220
So thirsty.

862
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:24,170
So, so thirsty.

863
00:54:24,170 --> 00:54:25,700
So refreshing.

864
00:54:26,990 --> 00:54:30,410
I like the Zero one more.

865
00:54:34,370 --> 00:54:36,330
Great job.

866
00:54:36,330 --> 00:54:38,370
Let's go.

867
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,990
(Juwon left alone in the practice room after rehearsal)

868
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:49,830
(Koko approaches Juwon upon discovering her)

869
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:56,840
Are you practicing?

870
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,370
Was it really tough?

871
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:05,480
Oh, no...

872
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:08,260
I'm okay.

873
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:11,370
You look like you're having a tough time.

874
00:55:12,670 --> 00:55:17,110
(Koko is practicing late into the night with Juwon, who lost her confidence)

875
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,560
Good job, good job! You did really well just now!

876
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:27,730
We're friends,

877
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:31,820
and she's helping me so much as a leader.

878
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:36,950
I'm so grateful, and I hope we can advance together.

879
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:41,380
You did so well just now.

880
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:44,680
Yeah!

881
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:46,400
Son Juwon, you can...

882
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,780
Your facial expression right now is so good.

883
00:55:50,530 --> 00:55:54,650
Son Juwon, you are Son Juwon. You're an amazing woman.

884
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:57,160
An amazing woman? Am I an amazing woman?

885
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:59,410
Yes, you're an amazing woman.

886
00:55:59,410 --> 00:56:01,280
Thank you.

887
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:04,800
Thank you, Koko, my best friend!

888
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,300
(The two cheer each other on as friends, although they are competitors)

889
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,570
We have a lot of low-ranking contestants in our unit.

890
00:56:12,570 --> 00:56:15,810
But these were the five people on I-LAND who I thought was

891
00:56:15,810 --> 00:56:20,290
most talented and wanted to team up with.

892
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:23,380
So, regardless of the ranking,

893
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:29,700
I really thought that I wanted us to be confident.

894
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:36,900
I hope they see shining flowers when they see us.

895
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:46,050
(Very special flowers exist)

896
00:56:46,050 --> 00:56:50,650
(enthralling everybody with only their existence)

897
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,980
(Only 6 flowers in the world)

898
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:17,350
("LATATA" by (G)I-DLE)

899
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:30,290
This "LATATA" test featured the six contestants' charisma and charm.

900
01:00:30,290 --> 01:00:32,480
Let's get the producers'

901
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,160
feedback and hear what they thought.

902
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:41,280
First, Producer Taeyang, what did you think?

903
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:46,310
Everyone's singing and dancing was really stable today.

904
01:00:46,310 --> 01:00:49,140
It was amazing overall.

905
01:00:49,140 --> 01:00:52,920
You created an intoxicating performance,

906
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,690
just like you wanted.

907
01:00:55,690 --> 01:01:01,310
Each of you expressed your flower well.

908
01:01:01,310 --> 01:01:05,530
I was amazed to see the six of you as a single flower.

909
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:12,650
In this performance, I want to compliment I-LANDER Koko in particular.

910
01:01:14,900 --> 01:01:19,700
During the practice, you said it was tough to lead a team.

911
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:24,020
But seeing today's performance, I think you did a good job as a leader.

912
01:01:24,020 --> 01:01:27,650
As a center, you've definitely shown us what you can do.

913
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:29,980
I want to compliment you. Good job.

914
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,910
And Yuju, you had a great facial expression today.

915
01:01:35,910 --> 01:01:39,360
You were great in all performances, but especially today.

916
01:01:39,360 --> 01:01:40,730
I want to compliment you.

917
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,150
Everyone, good work.

918
01:01:43,150 --> 01:01:46,010
Thank you for a wonderful performance.

919
01:01:49,950 --> 01:01:51,230
Yes, thank you.

920
01:01:51,230 --> 01:01:54,260
Next, let's hear from the one who has her own ability

921
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:56,760
to interpretations and emphasize creativity.

922
01:01:56,760 --> 01:02:00,960
Producer Monika, we're very curious about your thoughts.

923
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,240
What are your thoughts?

924
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:09,280
Under the starry night sky,

925
01:02:09,280 --> 01:02:12,480
I went into a mysterious woods while on my trip.

926
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,370
I felt like I had discovered

927
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:19,440
such beautiful six purple flowers that I had never seen before.

928
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:25,310
Isn't this what the Unit "Latata" was trying to achieve?

929
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:29,480
It was fascinating. At such a young age,

930
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:36,060
they were able to create a performance that portrayed the theme that they were after.

931
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:40,940
I think this is their hidden creative talent.

932
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:45,160
I thought, "Are geniuses truly set apart?"

933
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:47,010
I really enjoyed it.

934
01:02:48,490 --> 01:02:54,570
Personally, the part that was very memorable to me

935
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:58,940
was the vocal units. Jiyoon and Jungeun.

936
01:02:58,940 --> 01:03:02,560
Their dances have improved so much.

937
01:03:02,560 --> 01:03:06,160
Through this performance,

938
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:12,060
I think your all-rounder skills have come a long way.

939
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,870
And Unit "Latata," I'm sure you've seen it earlier.

940
01:03:14,870 --> 01:03:17,230
You have quite a story.

941
01:03:17,230 --> 01:03:22,530
And the fact that Sujung was able to communicate things for the sake of a great performance...

942
01:03:22,530 --> 01:03:26,540
I was very touched. Good work.

943
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,600
Thank you.

944
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:35,660
Lastly, Producer VVN, please give us your feedback.

945
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:41,250
I want to praise all of you today.

946
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:47,370
As you mentioned, your costume and the visual production were presented quite well.

947
01:03:47,370 --> 01:03:49,430
Especially, Jiyoon.

948
01:03:49,430 --> 01:03:52,270
On stage, Jiyoon...

949
01:03:52,270 --> 01:03:55,560
is so pretty when she sings.

950
01:03:55,560 --> 01:04:01,350
And the timbre and your physical appearance that you're born with really shined.

951
01:04:01,350 --> 01:04:07,670
I can see that Jiyoon has become versatile by working on different types of performances at I-LAND.

952
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,330
And I think you're ready to be a star.

953
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,650
And Juwon.

954
01:04:16,650 --> 01:04:21,690
I used to think your position was just a dance position.

955
01:04:22,970 --> 01:04:25,810
But actually, from what I've seen thus far...

956
01:04:25,810 --> 01:04:30,820
I think you have an exceptional color to your voice.

957
01:04:30,820 --> 01:04:34,710
I really wanted to tell you that today.

958
01:04:34,710 --> 01:04:36,910
Good work, everyone.

959
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:40,850
Thank you.

960
01:04:40,850 --> 01:04:46,610
So, we've all heard the producers' feedback on Unit "Latata."

961
01:04:46,610 --> 01:04:52,940
I-MATES and Producers get to decide whether an I-LANDER gets to survive or not.

962
01:04:52,940 --> 01:04:57,950
I-MATES, so that your I-LANDER that you root for can make it to the final,

963
01:04:57,950 --> 01:05:02,880
if you have not voted yet, please vote soon.

964
01:05:10,350 --> 01:05:18,760
Now, the 2nd I-MATE SAVE live voting is underway right now.

965
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,910
The time to vote is running out.

966
01:05:22,910 --> 01:05:27,420
To gain the chance to move onto the final, thanks to I-MATES' choices,

967
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:31,470
is a very meaningful gift for the I-LANDERS.

968
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:38,660
In a moment, we'll show you the interim status of the 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote.

969
01:05:39,460 --> 01:05:42,080
(Yoon Jiyoon, debut! / Jungeun, debut!)

970
01:05:47,420 --> 01:05:51,950
Currently, I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN, the 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote

971
01:05:51,950 --> 01:05:56,920
records the highest participation rate globally.

972
01:05:56,920 --> 01:06:01,770
216 countries around the world

973
01:06:01,770 --> 01:06:04,070
have participated in the I-MATE SAVE voting.

974
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:08,720
Thank you so much for your passionate support.

975
01:06:08,720 --> 01:06:13,590
Only three I-LANDERS can survive through the 2nd I-MATE SAVE votes.

976
01:06:13,590 --> 01:06:15,340
For your information,

977
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:21,910
I heard the rankings keep flip-flopping even from the advanced online voting.

978
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:25,370
I-MATES who are still hesitant about who to vote,

979
01:06:25,370 --> 01:06:29,090
you'll have to make your choice soon.

980
01:06:29,090 --> 01:06:34,220
Only your votes can make the dreams of the I-LANDER you're rooting for come true.

981
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,370
I wish that you would please rush to vote.

982
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:45,280
All right, now, we have the second unit, which is standing at the crossroads of destiny.

983
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:50,080
This performance is by the Unit "Into the New World."

984
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:53,360
With Bang Jeemin as the center of this unit,

985
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:57,120
the I-LANDERS, who exude a cheery and refreshing vibe, have gotten together

986
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:59,510
making them an impressive group.

987
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:04,850
What kind of the "New World" did they create?

988
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:10,420
Let us see the story of Unit "Into the New World" and their performance.

989
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:18,710
(2F Practice Room)

990
01:07:19,850 --> 01:07:24,190
(Leader Jeemin is not around?)

991
01:07:24,190 --> 01:07:26,680
The center didn't shine

992
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,160
and why did Jeemin give up so much?

993
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:34,350
All six members performed like they were the center.

994
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:37,580
I think it'd be good to figure out the essence of the performance.

995
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:41,160
(Unit "Into the New World" was criticized for their parts)

996
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:45,500
(The members are hesitant to approach Jeemin, who's crying)

997
01:07:47,830 --> 01:07:51,310
(Jeemin returns after leaving for a bit)

998
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:55,710
(Awkward silence)

999
01:07:56,870 --> 01:07:58,590
Well...

1000
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,170
I understand that not everyone might not be satisfied with their parts.

1001
01:08:06,170 --> 01:08:09,280
Some people only have three lines.

1002
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:13,030
No one is voicing their grievances.

1003
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:17,680
We're working really hard on the overall picture,

1004
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:25,280
but it shows when some of you are unhappy with your parts.

1005
01:08:25,280 --> 01:08:27,830
(Unit "Into the New World" Practice Room - last night)

1006
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,850
During my part, I'm mostly behind the center.

1007
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:34,250
Please change it later, if you can.

1008
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:36,210
You're behind the center during your part?

1009
01:08:36,210 --> 01:08:39,780
I'm behind the center during Gyuri's and Sarang's parts.

1010
01:08:39,780 --> 01:08:43,560
To be honest, I'm always in the back in the choreography.

1011
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:49,740
Also, I barely have a part in the middle.

1012
01:08:50,980 --> 01:08:52,250
I don't know...

1013
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:54,530
(Unit "Into the New World" is behind, reflecting members' opinions)

1014
01:08:54,530 --> 01:08:57,160
Now that it's an individual competition,

1015
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,340
I understand that you're all sensitive.

1016
01:08:59,340 --> 01:09:03,830
But it's really affecting each other negatively.

1017
01:09:03,830 --> 01:09:08,080
I hope we can let go of your individual greed,

1018
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,100
and collaborate together.

1019
01:09:12,030 --> 01:09:13,840
I...

1020
01:09:15,030 --> 01:09:17,600
want to say something.

1021
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,240
I want to say something.

1022
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:26,760
What if we give away some of my parts to those with smaller parts?

1023
01:09:26,760 --> 01:09:29,500
Since we advanced to Part 2,

1024
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:33,090
I haven't received a really good part, and

1025
01:09:33,090 --> 01:09:37,380
I was obsessing over my part.

1026
01:09:50,110 --> 01:09:52,900
(She had no impressive part in Part 2)

1027
01:09:54,370 --> 01:09:57,370
I was thinking that I can only survive

1028
01:09:57,370 --> 01:10:01,710
if I am really seen, but I think I was too greedy.

1029
01:10:01,710 --> 01:10:06,630
I had a chance to reflect on my actions.

1030
01:10:06,630 --> 01:10:08,760
I didn't go up a single ranking,

1031
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:11,890
and I kept descending.

1032
01:10:11,890 --> 01:10:14,060
I don't want to go...

1033
01:10:14,060 --> 01:10:16,290
(Saebi was moved to a new room after getting kicked off the debut group)

1034
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:21,390
Let's all meet again here.

1035
01:10:22,910 --> 01:10:26,650
I'm not usually this concerned about my part.

1036
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:32,700
I usually think that I can shine in any part.

1037
01:10:33,890 --> 01:10:35,960
I think I was just really nervous.

1038
01:10:35,960 --> 01:10:39,720
I wasn't able to care for someone I liked a lot.

1039
01:10:39,720 --> 01:10:42,230
I felt really bad.

1040
01:10:42,230 --> 01:10:48,430
I think Jeemin should do my verse.

1041
01:10:48,430 --> 01:10:49,990
I like that.

1042
01:10:49,990 --> 01:10:52,350
I'll do better.

1043
01:10:52,350 --> 01:10:54,570
I hope all team members can follow after me.

1044
01:10:54,570 --> 01:10:56,010
Yes.

1045
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,510
(Unit "Into the New World" is wrapping up the day)

1046
01:11:05,410 --> 01:11:09,020
I want to say something.

1047
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:14,730
Ever since I advanced to Part 2,

1048
01:11:14,730 --> 01:11:18,430
I became compulsive about my part.

1049
01:11:18,430 --> 01:11:22,340
I wanted to apologize to you.

1050
01:11:22,340 --> 01:11:26,420
No, you don't need to apologize.

1051
01:11:26,420 --> 01:11:31,170
You could've made a choice for yourself,

1052
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:34,260
but instead, you really considered us.

1053
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:39,750
I think I wasn't able to follow you as a leader very well.

1054
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:44,660
- I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

1055
01:11:44,660 --> 01:11:46,720
Thank you for telling me this.

1056
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,320
I'll try...

1057
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,410
I'll wrap up in just five minutes.

1058
01:11:51,410 --> 01:11:52,930
Fighting!

1059
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:55,100
Good night.

1060
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:04,450
(Day of the midpoint check)

1061
01:12:04,450 --> 01:12:08,160
To explain the overall concept,

1062
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:12,440
the original song was about pure and bright girls embarking on a new start.

1063
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:16,190
We wanted to express the hardships and struggles we experience

1064
01:12:16,190 --> 01:12:19,270
and growing through that and becoming more prepared.

1065
01:12:19,270 --> 01:12:23,050
We wanted to reflect our determination in the song.

1066
01:12:23,050 --> 01:12:25,840
During the dance break...

1067
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:27,830
(A highlight of the original "Into the New World")

1068
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:32,590
(Yuri and Hyoyeon's powerful dance break section)

1069
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:35,800
During the dance break, we chose

1070
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,600
Sarang and Mai are the main dancers,

1071
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:43,970
to express charisma and confidence through the performance.

1072
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:47,320
What's one thing you want the audience to feel? A single hashtag.

1073
01:12:47,320 --> 01:12:52,010
To feel our desperate hearts.

1074
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:55,380
If that's what you want to communicate,

1075
01:12:55,380 --> 01:13:00,590
you should think about how you change the music.

1076
01:13:00,590 --> 01:13:05,000
You can't express that by merely changing the dance break.

1077
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:09,270
For example, you could begin in a more lyrical way.

1078
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:11,200
I want you to think about those aspects.

1079
01:13:11,200 --> 01:13:12,410
Yes.

1080
01:13:13,240 --> 01:13:16,640
Listening to Producer Taeyang's feedback,

1081
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,980
I understood what he meant.

1082
01:13:18,980 --> 01:13:21,530
We received a lot of good feedback,

1083
01:13:21,530 --> 01:13:24,670
and I thought we should make a lot of edits.

1084
01:13:24,670 --> 01:13:27,110
(2F Practice Room)

1085
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:28,850
Turning it on.

1086
01:13:28,850 --> 01:13:30,470
Yes.

1087
01:13:31,470 --> 01:13:32,790
It's so sad.

1088
01:13:32,790 --> 01:13:34,600
I'm going to cry.

1089
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:36,750
("Into the New World," rearranged more lyrically, based on producer feedback)

1090
01:13:36,750 --> 01:13:41,030
We made the beginning more lyrical, focusing only on vocals.

1091
01:13:41,030 --> 01:13:46,180
It's cleaner, and I think we can communicate better.

1092
01:13:49,010 --> 01:13:53,320
I was very touched by the lyrics.

1093
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:57,920
The lyrics really match my situation.

1094
01:13:59,640 --> 01:14:04,100
The first verse is about why we first started dreaming.

1095
01:14:04,100 --> 01:14:10,570
I hope they can feel the journey we've been on.

1096
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:15,430
("Into the New World" deep in rehearsal for the new arrangement)

1097
01:14:17,180 --> 01:14:19,500
Should we try the new dance break?

1098
01:14:19,500 --> 01:14:20,870
Shall we?

1099
01:14:21,820 --> 01:14:25,170
(Jeemin, Mai, and Sarang try out the new dance break)

1100
01:14:25,170 --> 01:14:27,150
(Where have we seen this dance before?)

1101
01:14:27,750 --> 01:14:30,490
(Signature choreography of "Final Love Song")

1102
01:14:31,420 --> 01:14:34,180
(Meeting with the producers after the midpoint check)

1103
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:37,460
In terms of the dance break, thinking about Girls' Generation,

1104
01:14:37,460 --> 01:14:42,690
Hyoyeon really did some amazing popping.

1105
01:14:42,690 --> 01:14:48,520
(Hyoyeon's intense popping break dance that changes the vibe of the song)

1106
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:53,070
In my opinion, that was possible because that dancing part existed.

1107
01:14:53,070 --> 01:14:56,350
You don't need such a dramatic and intense twist like that.

1108
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:59,130
Or how about the first song you danced to?

1109
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,530
"Final Love Song"?

1110
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:03,000
I think the choreo for that song would work, too.

1111
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:07,960
When I-MATES saw you guys perform, I wonder what they would remember.

1112
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:12,180
I think it'd be good to incorporate these aspects.

1113
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,220
(New break dance part based on the producers' feedback)

1114
01:15:13,790 --> 01:15:15,300
(Jeemin, Sarang, and Mai do the "Final Love Song")

1115
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,570
(Fuko, Saebi, and Gyuri do the "IWALY" for the dance break)

1116
01:15:19,570 --> 01:15:23,200
Our dance break portrays our growth on I-LAND)

1117
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,110
I think our choreo got more dynamic.

1118
01:15:27,550 --> 01:15:31,920
I'm so proud of ourselves because it feels like we're making our performances ourselves.

1119
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:34,160
I think I'll be happy as I perform.

1120
01:15:36,670 --> 01:15:43,350
Perhaps this semi-final performance could be the last one for one of us.

1121
01:15:43,350 --> 01:15:45,880
We all grew up in different places

1122
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,710
and dreamed of debuting in different places.

1123
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,950
To perform in front of the I-MATES is

1124
01:15:51,950 --> 01:15:56,750
so precious and makes me so happy. I want them to know that.

1125
01:15:56,750 --> 01:16:01,380
I hope my desire to do that is conveyed to the viewers.

1126
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,510
I want to show our real selves.

1127
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:08,120
I don't want to miss this opportunity.

1128
01:16:08,120 --> 01:16:11,480
I really want to hang onto this chance.

1129
01:16:17,320 --> 01:16:20,270
Hello! I'm Bang Jeemin, and I'm 18...

1130
01:16:20,270 --> 01:16:21,560
- Ryu Sarang.
- I'm Mai.

1131
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,660
I'm Fuko.

1132
01:16:23,660 --> 01:16:27,270
I think I let go of everything else except for practicing.

1133
01:16:27,270 --> 01:16:29,330
I let go of my youth...

1134
01:16:29,330 --> 01:16:31,090
You can do this!

1135
01:16:31,790 --> 01:16:34,850
I got upset with myself and was frustrated.

1136
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:39,320
Nothing is firm, so I think I feel more desperate.

1137
01:16:39,320 --> 01:16:44,340
I really contemplated going for another survival program.

1138
01:16:44,340 --> 01:16:47,320
But the opportunity presented itself.

1139
01:16:47,320 --> 01:16:49,790
I don't want to miss out on that opportunity.

1140
01:16:49,790 --> 01:16:53,340
I don't think I've thought about giving up.

1141
01:16:53,340 --> 01:16:55,250
I love to perform so much.

1142
01:16:55,250 --> 01:16:58,690
I think I'll love being an idol all my life.

1143
01:16:59,420 --> 01:17:01,250
I'm so nervous and feel so desperate for it.

1144
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,120
I'll do my best to debut...

1145
01:17:03,120 --> 01:17:05,030
- I want to debut...
- I'll do it.

1146
01:17:05,030 --> 01:17:07,450
- I'll debut.
- I want to make the debut.

1147
01:17:07,450 --> 01:17:09,450
I want it so badly.

1148
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:19,080
("Into the New World" by Girls' Generation)

1149
01:21:24,150 --> 01:21:28,280
That was the test performance of "Into the New World."

1150
01:21:28,280 --> 01:21:31,750
I can feel the strong desire for their debut.

1151
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:35,860
It was quite moving, reminding me of my own trainee days.

1152
01:21:35,860 --> 01:21:39,670
I'd like to hear the producers' feedback.

1153
01:21:39,670 --> 01:21:45,180
Producer 24, what did you think of this performance?

1154
01:21:48,340 --> 01:21:51,120
I know this was a Self-made Test.

1155
01:21:51,120 --> 01:21:57,510
I think your intentions and directions were expressed well.

1156
01:21:57,510 --> 01:22:02,470
When you talked about everyone singing individually,

1157
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:05,680
I was quite concerned.

1158
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:09,090
But you were able to express your story

1159
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:14,270
in the intro video, through music onstage,

1160
01:22:14,270 --> 01:22:17,420
and it was quite moving.

1161
01:22:17,420 --> 01:22:24,620
You don't need a dramatic arrangement or fresh concept to tell a true story.

1162
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:27,920
Your "new world..."

1163
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:33,780
Watching you,

1164
01:22:33,780 --> 01:22:39,190
I was reminded of when I started music.

1165
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:47,500
Jeemin, I think you started us off well.

1166
01:22:47,500 --> 01:22:50,700
I think you helped us get into the performance.

1167
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:58,600
Every member expressed themselves well with their parts. It was very nice.

1168
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:02,720
Good work, everyone. Thank you.

1169
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:06,860
Thank you.

1170
01:23:06,860 --> 01:23:10,270
Next, I'd love to hear from Producer Leejung.

1171
01:23:10,270 --> 01:23:12,710
What did you think?

1172
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:17,920
That was the most honest and true-to-yourself

1173
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:21,760
performance we've seen so far.

1174
01:23:21,760 --> 01:23:24,970
No matter what stage you are in moving forward,

1175
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:32,570
I hope you can be as honest in your song and dance.

1176
01:23:32,570 --> 01:23:37,010
I also liked the dance break with my choreography.

1177
01:23:37,010 --> 01:23:39,520
It was really cute and moving.

1178
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:43,670
I'm very happy and proud that my choreography

1179
01:23:43,670 --> 01:23:48,760
could be a part of building up your creativity.

1180
01:23:48,760 --> 01:23:52,510
One more thing I want to make sure I say.

1181
01:23:52,510 --> 01:23:57,350
When Sarang sang, "I'll protect you with my unchanging love,"

1182
01:23:58,950 --> 01:24:02,960
it was quite moving.

1183
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:11,040
That's how strong Sarang's delivery was.

1184
01:24:11,040 --> 01:24:16,480
I hope you are as unchanging as you sang, Sarang.

1185
01:24:19,020 --> 01:24:24,110
And Saebi, how do you manage to pull us in every time?

1186
01:24:24,110 --> 01:24:28,540
I'm so surprised every time.

1187
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:36,610
You made me curious about your interpretation and perspective.

1188
01:24:36,610 --> 01:24:40,810
That is Saebi's greatest strength.

1189
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,850
Great work, everyone.

1190
01:24:42,850 --> 01:24:46,870
Thank you so much for a great performance.

1191
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:51,520
Thank you for your kind words.

1192
01:24:51,520 --> 01:24:56,020
Lastly, Producer Taeyang. What did you think?

1193
01:24:56,020 --> 01:24:58,660
What I realized again watching this performance

1194
01:24:58,660 --> 01:25:04,890
is that nothing is more moving than one's truth.

1195
01:25:04,890 --> 01:25:07,430
From the intro video to the end,

1196
01:25:07,430 --> 01:25:14,720
you packed your desire for your dream into one song.

1197
01:25:14,720 --> 01:25:17,500
When the arrangement changed in the 1st verse,

1198
01:25:17,500 --> 01:25:24,340
I loved hearing your voices in detail.

1199
01:25:24,340 --> 01:25:30,860
I was not a producer watching, but another I-MATE.

1200
01:25:30,860 --> 01:25:33,570
I found myself rooting for you.

1201
01:25:33,570 --> 01:25:35,840
I loved it.

1202
01:25:35,840 --> 01:25:42,900
Gyuri, I think you improved this time, especially your singing.

1203
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:45,440
You were great at every performance,

1204
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:48,530
but seeing you grow further today,

1205
01:25:48,530 --> 01:25:52,980
I wanted to make sure to compliment you.

1206
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:59,890
And Mai, I felt this even more today.

1207
01:25:59,890 --> 01:26:02,840
I think the nasal sound in your voice has improved.

1208
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,000
I was proud of you.

1209
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:10,390
It's hard to improve that in a short period of time.

1210
01:26:10,390 --> 01:26:16,630
I can tell that you have a disciplined mindset and attitude.

1211
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:22,750
I think that's the most important quality an idol should have.

1212
01:26:22,750 --> 01:26:26,210
I wanted to make sure I compliment you for that.

1213
01:26:26,210 --> 01:26:30,450
And Fuko. Your high belt at the end.

1214
01:26:30,450 --> 01:26:35,720
That part really multiplied how moving the song was.

1215
01:26:35,720 --> 01:26:36,930
You did a great job.

1216
01:26:36,930 --> 01:26:40,900
Great work, everybody. Thank you.

1217
01:26:43,320 --> 01:26:44,720
Thank you.

1218
01:26:44,720 --> 01:26:49,880
That was the producer feedback for "Into the New World."

1219
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:54,280
Unit "Into the New World," great work.

1220
01:27:00,500 --> 01:27:03,450
This is I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

1221
01:27:03,450 --> 01:27:06,350
We've now seen all the semi-final performances.

1222
01:27:06,350 --> 01:27:10,990
It's almost time to end the live vote.

1223
01:27:10,990 --> 01:27:16,590
Tonight, who will survive, and who will be eliminated?

1224
01:27:16,590 --> 01:27:20,230
Your choice matters.

1225
01:27:20,230 --> 01:27:25,940
3 out of the final 10 will be chosen by the I-MATE SAVE vote.

1226
01:27:25,940 --> 01:27:29,890
The remaining 7 will be chosen by the producers.

1227
01:27:29,890 --> 01:27:33,290
You should make up your mind quickly.

1228
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:38,980
Only a minute to go until the vote closes.

1229
01:27:38,980 --> 01:27:42,790
This is your final moment to cast your vote.

1230
01:27:44,060 --> 01:27:47,690
This is I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

1231
01:27:47,690 --> 01:27:52,630
The live 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote is now closed.

1232
01:27:58,230 --> 01:28:00,240
(Choi Jungeun)

1233
01:28:00,240 --> 01:28:02,320
(Kim Sujung)

1234
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:04,310
(Nam Yuju)

1235
01:28:04,310 --> 01:28:06,670
(Yoon Jiyoon)

1236
01:28:06,670 --> 01:28:08,930
(Koko)

1237
01:28:08,930 --> 01:28:11,220
(Son Juwon)

1238
01:28:12,940 --> 01:28:15,110
(Ryu Sarang)

1239
01:28:15,110 --> 01:28:17,300
(Jeong Saebi)

1240
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:19,550
(Kim Gyuri)

1241
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:21,740
(Fuko)

1242
01:28:21,740 --> 01:28:24,170
(Bang Jeemin)

1243
01:28:24,170 --> 01:28:26,380
(Mai)

1244
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:30,150
The live vote is about to close.

1245
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:35,520
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

1246
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:39,660
(Vote closed)

1247
01:28:44,970 --> 01:28:50,700
The live 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote is now closed.

1248
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:55,560
Thank you to the I-MATES around the world who voted

1249
01:28:55,560 --> 01:29:00,960
to help the I-LANDERS' dreams come true.

1250
01:29:00,960 --> 01:29:02,940
All choices have been made.

1251
01:29:02,940 --> 01:29:07,040
All that remains is to announce the survivors.

1252
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:09,710
Based on the results of the 2nd SAVE vote,

1253
01:29:09,710 --> 01:29:14,690
three I-LANDERS will directly advance to the finals.

1254
01:29:14,690 --> 01:29:19,410
I wonder what kind of results the producers are expecting.

1255
01:29:19,410 --> 01:29:24,210
Producer 24, I will ask you quite directly.

1256
01:29:24,210 --> 01:29:27,110
Who do you think the three will be?

1257
01:29:34,170 --> 01:29:39,040
I wouldn't be surprised at any of them getting it.

1258
01:29:39,040 --> 01:29:41,820
It's hard to predict, but...

1259
01:29:41,820 --> 01:29:43,540
still...

1260
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:51,780
I think our thoughts will be similar to the I-MATES'.

1261
01:29:55,860 --> 01:30:00,900
Anyway, the choice of I-MATES is the people's choice.

1262
01:30:00,900 --> 01:30:04,760
Whatever choices they make, they're the right ones.

1263
01:30:06,710 --> 01:30:10,300
Next, Producer Monika.

1264
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,260
There must be I-LANDERS you've been keen on.

1265
01:30:15,260 --> 01:30:19,060
Have your thoughts changed?

1266
01:30:20,090 --> 01:30:22,230
Yes, they have.

1267
01:30:25,990 --> 01:30:29,960
I can give you a hint. Want to guess?

1268
01:30:31,090 --> 01:30:36,030
First, she has long hair.

1269
01:30:38,290 --> 01:30:42,900
And she's a great singer.

1270
01:30:43,930 --> 01:30:47,600
And she can rap.

1271
01:30:49,750 --> 01:30:54,570
That's enough. And she can dance.

1272
01:30:54,570 --> 01:30:58,260
That's the I-LANDER I'm thinking of.

1273
01:30:58,260 --> 01:31:00,120
Isn't this funny?

1274
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:04,790
Good.

1275
01:31:04,790 --> 01:31:11,730
The Final 10 will be performing at the finals next week.

1276
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:16,760
At next week's finals, we will decide the members of the

1277
01:31:16,760 --> 01:31:24,320
2024 global K-Pop group executive produced by Teddy.

1278
01:31:24,320 --> 01:31:28,590
At the end of the long journey of I-LAND and battle against oneself,

1279
01:31:28,590 --> 01:31:32,940
who will be the I-LANDERS making their debuts?

1280
01:31:34,450 --> 01:31:39,990
For those dreams to come true, they must survive today.

1281
01:31:39,990 --> 01:31:47,500
The I-MATES and the producers hold the keys to their fates.

1282
01:31:47,500 --> 01:31:54,350
Who will be the three to survive through the I-MATE vote?

1283
01:31:54,350 --> 01:32:01,120
And who will be the seven to survive through the producers?

1284
01:32:02,080 --> 01:32:06,180
Before we reveal the Final 10,

1285
01:32:06,180 --> 01:32:10,180
as the votes are being counted, I hear that the I-LANDERS

1286
01:32:10,180 --> 01:32:15,510
had a special night ahead of the semi-final show.

1287
01:32:15,510 --> 01:32:17,250
What happened?

1288
01:32:17,250 --> 01:32:20,390
Let's see it right now.

1289
01:32:27,730 --> 01:32:30,160
Please make your way to the living room.

1290
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:31,640
The living room?

1291
01:32:31,640 --> 01:32:34,050
It's good news!

1292
01:32:36,100 --> 01:32:38,760
I don't know if it's good.

1293
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:41,340
What? Now?

1294
01:32:41,340 --> 01:32:43,190
What?

1295
01:32:43,190 --> 01:32:44,770
Something's there.

1296
01:32:44,770 --> 01:32:46,740
What is it?

1297
01:32:47,660 --> 01:32:49,490
(A mystery envelope in the living room)

1298
01:32:49,490 --> 01:32:51,960
NASURI is dancing.

1299
01:32:54,140 --> 01:32:56,130
What is it?

1300
01:32:57,490 --> 01:33:00,000
- Hurry up!
- Read it!

1301
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:03,610
I-LAND 2 pajama party!

1302
01:33:09,840 --> 01:33:11,440
Really?

1303
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:14,240
Pajama party!

1304
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:20,030
One day before the Self-made Test, put on your pajamas

1305
01:33:20,030 --> 01:33:24,530
and make special memories for what may be your last night.

1306
01:33:24,530 --> 01:33:26,900
I'm so happy!

1307
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:28,300
Thank you!

1308
01:33:28,300 --> 01:33:29,930
(Happy tears)

1309
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:36,500
(Animal pajamas for the party)

1310
01:33:36,500 --> 01:33:39,160
The animals are so cute!

1311
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:41,100
Oh, my gosh!

1312
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,920
Look at them!

1313
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:46,420
(Their pajamas are cute too)

1314
01:33:46,420 --> 01:33:48,120
Cute!

1315
01:33:48,120 --> 01:33:49,290
(Temple Stay look?)

1316
01:33:49,290 --> 01:33:51,070
We're not cute.

1317
01:33:51,070 --> 01:33:54,420
You're lying!

1318
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:56,980
It's giving a hospital vibe a little bit.

1319
01:33:56,980 --> 01:33:59,440
(It does look like a health checkup look)

1320
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,870
It's cute.

1321
01:34:01,870 --> 01:34:03,140
They decorated it well.

1322
01:34:03,140 --> 01:34:05,840
- So well.
- I know.

1323
01:34:06,910 --> 01:34:08,360
(Party music on)

1324
01:34:10,110 --> 01:34:14,180
(A familiar song and pose)

1325
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:19,460
("Spicy," by the Main Rap Performance Unit last test)

1326
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:21,850
("Spicy" by CL (Pajama Party Version))

1327
01:34:26,580 --> 01:34:28,770
(The original unit is also happy)

1328
01:34:36,300 --> 01:34:38,110
(Last week)

1329
01:35:00,590 --> 01:35:02,660
He's opening it!

1330
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:06,510
Good job!

1331
01:35:06,510 --> 01:35:10,280
(The next song is "Like Ooh-Ahh" by Twice)

1332
01:35:12,170 --> 01:35:14,440
(There is one person with a bitter smile...)

1333
01:35:18,970 --> 01:35:22,630
(Remembering the dizzying memories...)

1334
01:35:24,450 --> 01:35:26,190
(Jiyoon is still)

1335
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:34,200
(I-LANDER karaoke party in full swing)

1336
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:40,530
(Jeemin is out of battery)

1337
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:42,560
I'm so tired.

1338
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:48,110
(Fidgeting)

1339
01:35:48,110 --> 01:35:50,790
(Sujung has brought a mystery object?)

1340
01:35:52,520 --> 01:35:54,490
(Makes a grotesque sound)

1341
01:35:55,010 --> 01:35:56,560
I'm scared.

1342
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,100
(What is this fearful object?)

1343
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,630
(The object is...)

1344
01:36:00,270 --> 01:36:02,380
(A lie detector!)

1345
01:36:02,380 --> 01:36:04,530
I'm going to scream.

1346
01:36:04,530 --> 01:36:06,710
(Koko is a scary woman)

1347
01:36:06,710 --> 01:36:10,560
(The first one to try the truth or lie game)

1348
01:36:10,560 --> 01:36:13,050
I'm scared.

1349
01:36:13,050 --> 01:36:14,640
(Questioner: Jeong Saebi)

1350
01:36:16,230 --> 01:36:21,280
I still think Jiyoon is tough to talk to.

1351
01:36:21,280 --> 01:36:23,950
(That was strong)

1352
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:30,730
Jiyoon is tough to talk to.

1353
01:36:32,620 --> 01:36:33,750
Honestly?

1354
01:36:33,750 --> 01:36:35,350
It's a lie detector.

1355
01:36:36,380 --> 01:36:38,050
Just think of coming back.

1356
01:36:38,050 --> 01:36:39,360
I don't know.

1357
01:36:39,360 --> 01:36:42,410
(Misunderstanding and conflict between the two from Part 1)

1358
01:36:43,500 --> 01:36:44,660
I'm sorry.

1359
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:48,620
(But they made up during the last test)

1360
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:54,060
(What does Jungeun actually feel?)

1361
01:36:54,060 --> 01:36:57,590
Jungeun, if you don't want to hurt, tell the truth.

1362
01:36:59,660 --> 01:37:02,560
- Tell the truth.
- Is it tough, Jungeun?

1363
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,450
- Is it tough?
- No, it's not tough.

1364
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:09,460
It's not tough.

1365
01:37:09,460 --> 01:37:11,550
(I don't find Jiyoon tough to talk to anymore)

1366
01:37:16,850 --> 01:37:19,210
(What is the truth between the two of them?)

1367
01:37:19,210 --> 01:37:20,130
(Truth!)

1368
01:37:27,210 --> 01:37:29,260
(The person happiest with the result.mp4)

1369
01:37:30,790 --> 01:37:32,100
(Don't relax)

1370
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,130
(Yoon Jiyoon's turn)

1371
01:37:38,160 --> 01:37:40,060
Can I ask?

1372
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:45,160
In Part 1, after "Eyes, Nose, Lips,"

1373
01:37:46,740 --> 01:37:49,780
when you got back to I-LAND, did you really not hear Jungeun?

1374
01:37:49,780 --> 01:37:52,650
Did you really not hear Jungeun?

1375
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:59,080
(After the Part 1 Unit Battle)

1376
01:38:00,930 --> 01:38:04,120
(Jungeun calls over Jiyoon, who is back in I-LAND)

1377
01:38:07,180 --> 01:38:11,540
(Did Jiyoon really not hear her?)

1378
01:38:17,510 --> 01:38:21,310
I really did not hear her.

1379
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,770
You didn't hear her?

1380
01:38:24,770 --> 01:38:30,480
Let's see.

1381
01:38:33,790 --> 01:38:37,540
Did she really not hear me?

1382
01:38:38,620 --> 01:38:41,490
(I really did not hear Jungeun's voice!)

1383
01:38:46,290 --> 01:38:48,670
(Lie)

1384
01:38:57,610 --> 01:39:01,040
(The device may not be accurate)

1385
01:39:01,040 --> 01:39:03,530
(The shocking truth)

1386
01:39:03,530 --> 01:39:05,650
No way!

1387
01:39:05,650 --> 01:39:08,410
You totally heard her.

1388
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:11,790
You heard me and pretended like you didn't?

1389
01:39:11,790 --> 01:39:15,980
No way! That upset me a lot!

1390
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:20,110
(Is this really the truth of that day?)

1391
01:39:20,110 --> 01:39:21,640
Jiyoon...

1392
01:39:22,710 --> 01:39:26,700
I really didn't hear her, I don't think...

1393
01:39:26,700 --> 01:39:29,360
(This is not fair)

1394
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,790
(What's true is our friendship now)

1395
01:39:34,600 --> 01:39:36,310
Oh, no.

1396
01:39:44,120 --> 01:39:46,200
What?

1397
01:39:49,420 --> 01:39:51,440
(To Gyuri)

1398
01:39:51,440 --> 01:39:53,000
(To me?)

1399
01:39:55,550 --> 01:39:57,440
Who is that?

1400
01:40:01,210 --> 01:40:04,080
(What are you doing there?)

1401
01:40:05,550 --> 01:40:07,130
Hi, Gyuri.

1402
01:40:07,970 --> 01:40:09,250
It's Fuko.

1403
01:40:10,090 --> 01:40:13,130
(What is this video that just showed up to I-LANDERS?)

1404
01:40:13,620 --> 01:40:16,520
(The 12 I-LANDERS, the day before the semi-final show)

1405
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:18,900
Hi, Jiyoon.

1406
01:40:18,900 --> 01:40:21,890
(They sent relay video letters to each other)

1407
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,550
(The oldest, Fuko, speaks to Gyuri, the youngest)

1408
01:40:24,550 --> 01:40:28,090
We shared the stage many times.

1409
01:40:28,090 --> 01:40:31,400
We got kicked out of I-LAND together.

1410
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:33,970
If there are challenging moments to come,

1411
01:40:33,970 --> 01:40:37,710
come find me and talk to me.

1412
01:40:37,710 --> 01:40:39,980
Let's do well together.

1413
01:40:39,980 --> 01:40:41,690
I love you.

1414
01:40:41,690 --> 01:40:42,800
Daebak.

1415
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,470
(Warning: may cry)

1416
01:40:44,470 --> 01:40:46,360
I'm so touched.

1417
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:50,480
(The next letter)

1418
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,350
It's Jungeun.

1419
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:55,890
Hi, Jiyoon. It's Jungeun.

1420
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:58,310
Watching this video letter,

1421
01:40:58,310 --> 01:41:03,630
I hope you know how much I like you.

1422
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:08,920
I think we cleared up some stuff in Part 2

1423
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:12,040
and have become friends again. I'm so happy about that.

1424
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,040
Let's not fight again.

1425
01:41:15,040 --> 01:41:16,820
Let's really not fight again.

1426
01:41:16,820 --> 01:41:18,800
(Okay <3)

1427
01:41:18,800 --> 01:41:22,470
I want to be able to tell each other everything.

1428
01:41:22,470 --> 01:41:24,760
I love you.

1429
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:26,700
Bye.

1430
01:41:26,700 --> 01:41:28,290
Cute.

1431
01:41:29,510 --> 01:41:31,150
- What?
- Love and hate.

1432
01:41:31,150 --> 01:41:33,190
What?

1433
01:41:33,190 --> 01:41:35,960
(From rivals to sister vibes)

1434
01:41:35,960 --> 01:41:38,430
Who did Jiyoon write to?

1435
01:41:45,070 --> 01:41:48,290
Oh, no! I can't watch it!

1436
01:41:49,940 --> 01:41:51,410
Do I need to look here?

1437
01:41:51,410 --> 01:41:52,690
(Screaming)

1438
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,670
Please.

1439
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:58,870
(Exorcism skills -99999)

1440
01:41:58,870 --> 01:42:01,260
What do I do?

1441
01:42:06,940 --> 01:42:09,580
Fuko, what do I do?

1442
01:42:09,580 --> 01:42:14,360
(Who is Jiyoon sending the video letter to?)

1443
01:42:14,360 --> 01:42:16,520
Who is it to?

1444
01:42:17,230 --> 01:42:19,810
- Hey, Jeemin.
- Me? What?

1445
01:42:19,810 --> 01:42:21,920
We're the same age.

1446
01:42:21,920 --> 01:42:24,670
We're similar in many ways.

1447
01:42:24,670 --> 01:42:27,890
During difficult moments in I-LAND,

1448
01:42:27,890 --> 01:42:30,700
I think we were able to rely on each other.

1449
01:42:30,700 --> 01:42:34,930
Semi-finals and finals.

1450
01:42:34,930 --> 01:42:38,290
I hope we can both be there.

1451
01:42:38,290 --> 01:42:39,850
Thanks.

1452
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:41,170
(Yoon Jiyoon has left the chat)

1453
01:42:41,170 --> 01:42:43,670
Look at that forced smile.

1454
01:42:46,600 --> 01:42:48,550
I could not have imagined it.

1455
01:42:48,550 --> 01:42:51,220
I could not have imagined Jiyoon sending me a letter.

1456
01:42:51,220 --> 01:42:52,600
(If there's a hole, I want to hide in it)

1457
01:42:52,600 --> 01:42:54,490
She's red.

1458
01:42:59,570 --> 01:43:01,640
Hey, Saebi.

1459
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:06,520
When I was having a hard time adjusting to I-LAND,

1460
01:43:06,520 --> 01:43:11,290
and having a hard time getting along with new people...

1461
01:43:11,290 --> 01:43:13,390
(Part 1, entrance test)

1462
01:43:13,390 --> 01:43:19,420
There are a lot of people who used to train together.

1463
01:43:20,180 --> 01:43:22,730
I had my worries.

1464
01:43:25,930 --> 01:43:28,550
You're so pretty.

1465
01:43:28,550 --> 01:43:31,450
Every time I see you, I notice.

1466
01:43:31,450 --> 01:43:34,790
You're 173cm tall, right?

1467
01:43:34,790 --> 01:43:36,590
I'm the same height.

1468
01:43:36,590 --> 01:43:39,210
The last time I got it measured, I got 172.5cm.

1469
01:43:39,210 --> 01:43:41,420
Me too!

1470
01:43:41,420 --> 01:43:44,200
(Jeemin was empowered by Saebi, young but mature)

1471
01:43:44,200 --> 01:43:46,880
After being roommates with you,

1472
01:43:46,880 --> 01:43:50,910
I want to thank you for caring about me.

1473
01:43:52,900 --> 01:43:56,710
You're a great little sister and trainee friend.

1474
01:43:56,710 --> 01:44:01,060
I'm always thankful that you take care of me in little ways.

1475
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:03,630
Thank you and fighting!

1476
01:44:03,630 --> 01:44:06,950
(Saebi is moved by Jeemin's truthful letter)

1477
01:44:06,950 --> 01:44:09,450
Are you crying? Don't cry.

1478
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:12,280
Saebi's not crying.

1479
01:44:12,280 --> 01:44:14,460
- Are you crying?
- No.

1480
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,020
She said, "I'm not crying."

1481
01:44:20,320 --> 01:44:22,130
(Sujung is the sender of the last video letter)

1482
01:44:24,150 --> 01:44:26,110
Hey, Yuju.

1483
01:44:28,570 --> 01:44:35,120
We've been through a lot from the start until now.

1484
01:44:36,290 --> 01:44:40,520
We should be proud of each other for getting here.

1485
01:44:40,520 --> 01:44:43,860
I don't know what the results will be, but...

1486
01:44:52,040 --> 01:44:53,700
Sad...

1487
01:44:59,820 --> 01:45:01,180
What?

1488
01:45:01,180 --> 01:45:04,490
I hope things go well for you, Yuju.

1489
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:22,610
I know more than anybody how much you want this.

1490
01:45:31,360 --> 01:45:35,800
I really want you to debut here or elsewhere.

1491
01:45:38,830 --> 01:45:41,980
Be strong and work hard.

1492
01:45:41,980 --> 01:45:46,050
Don't forget to smile.

1493
01:45:46,050 --> 01:45:48,840
I want you to be happy.

1494
01:45:50,350 --> 01:45:52,900
Fighting! I love you.

1495
01:46:00,710 --> 01:46:02,590
She's really crying.

1496
01:46:02,590 --> 01:46:04,480
Nam Yuju...

1497
01:46:05,730 --> 01:46:07,960
You're crying!

1498
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:12,570
Yuju!

1499
01:46:17,680 --> 01:46:20,180
We never see Sujung cry.

1500
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:22,310
Why am I crying?

1501
01:46:25,710 --> 01:46:31,380
It's the last day with the twelve of us.

1502
01:46:31,380 --> 01:46:36,070
When two of us are gone, we're really going to feel it.

1503
01:46:36,070 --> 01:46:38,610
I don't want tonight to end.

1504
01:46:38,610 --> 01:46:42,000
I don't want tonight to end, either.

1505
01:46:43,030 --> 01:46:45,680
This is our last night together.

1506
01:46:45,680 --> 01:46:48,470
Should we put blankets down in the grand room and sleep there?

1507
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:50,960
Great idea!

1508
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:54,340
It's really our last night.

1509
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:56,460
(An unfamiliar lights-out first floor of I-LAND)

1510
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:03,680
It's nice.

1511
01:47:03,680 --> 01:47:05,460
(Their practice space)

1512
01:47:05,460 --> 01:47:07,110
(is now a moody bedroom)

1513
01:47:07,110 --> 01:47:10,020
Wow, I love it.

1514
01:47:10,020 --> 01:47:12,790
Hey guys.

1515
01:47:14,090 --> 01:47:16,670
Be careful. I move around a lot in my sleep.

1516
01:47:16,670 --> 01:47:18,630
(Jiyoon is in the center despite moving a lot in her sleep)

1517
01:47:18,630 --> 01:47:21,630
Can you go sleep over there alone?

1518
01:47:22,950 --> 01:47:25,350
We haven't slept together yet.

1519
01:47:25,350 --> 01:47:27,250
I'm so happy.

1520
01:47:28,410 --> 01:47:29,950
You look happy.

1521
01:47:29,950 --> 01:47:34,810
Who were you most jealous of watching the videos?

1522
01:47:36,420 --> 01:47:38,930
- Most jealous?
- Who were you most jealous of, Jeemin?

1523
01:47:38,930 --> 01:47:41,390
Who were you most jealous of, Jeemin?

1524
01:47:42,620 --> 01:47:44,530
I want to know.

1525
01:47:44,530 --> 01:47:45,750
I...

1526
01:47:45,750 --> 01:47:47,120
(Everyone wants to know who Jeemin was jealous of)

1527
01:47:47,120 --> 01:47:49,490
I was jealous of Saebi.

1528
01:47:49,490 --> 01:47:51,370
(Wow, Jeemin is jealous of me)

1529
01:47:51,370 --> 01:47:54,230
Because I made a video for Saebi

1530
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:57,980
but she made one for Koko and even cried.

1531
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:02,530
(Before, during video letters)

1532
01:48:02,530 --> 01:48:04,290
(Saebi appears onscreen)

1533
01:48:04,290 --> 01:48:05,920
(Anticipation)

1534
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:09,020
Koko, hi.

1535
01:48:09,020 --> 01:48:11,770
(1st round jealousy)

1536
01:48:11,770 --> 01:48:15,840
Unni, do you know how much..

1537
01:48:15,840 --> 01:48:17,650
I like you?

1538
01:48:22,080 --> 01:48:25,560
(Is she crying? Because of Koko?)

1539
01:48:26,040 --> 01:48:30,210
I really like you. Let's make sure we debut together.

1540
01:48:30,210 --> 01:48:31,560
(Saebi shares her true feelings for Koko with tears)

1541
01:48:31,560 --> 01:48:33,570
(Saebi shares her true feelings for Koko with tears)

1542
01:48:35,800 --> 01:48:37,700
(Jealous of Koko)

1543
01:48:37,700 --> 01:48:40,750
Saebi is the real player.

1544
01:48:40,750 --> 01:48:43,000
Saebi, pick your 1st choice.

1545
01:48:43,000 --> 01:48:44,720
Who's your 1st choice here?

1546
01:48:44,720 --> 01:48:46,380
Who's your 1st choice?

1547
01:48:47,180 --> 01:48:50,010
Saebi, how could you?

1548
01:48:50,010 --> 01:48:53,040
You've known Jungeun, me, and Juwon for years.

1549
01:48:53,040 --> 01:48:54,460
Same!

1550
01:48:54,460 --> 01:48:57,000
Same with Fuko! We've known you for years.

1551
01:48:57,000 --> 01:48:59,350
She's sick of you guys.

1552
01:49:00,110 --> 01:49:01,660
(Was that it?)

1553
01:49:01,660 --> 01:49:04,000
(Heartbroken)

1554
01:49:04,000 --> 01:49:06,910
I like everyone, but I definitely like one person.

1555
01:49:06,910 --> 01:49:09,950
Who's that person you definitely like?

1556
01:49:09,950 --> 01:49:12,170
I'll take that to the grave.

1557
01:49:12,170 --> 01:49:13,880
(Saebi is playing hard to get with everyone)

1558
01:49:13,880 --> 01:49:15,980
Saebi, bad girl.

1559
01:49:16,780 --> 01:49:19,470
(You know I love you without saying, right?)

1560
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:22,160
I'm the most jealous of the two of them.

1561
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:26,830
Fuko, my best friend, watches your "Iwaly" fan cam a lot

1562
01:49:26,830 --> 01:49:28,320
Me?

1563
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,480
She says, "This girl is so pretty."

1564
01:49:30,480 --> 01:49:32,750
You're her favorite.

1565
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:35,130
- My little sibling is a fan of Saebi.
- Really?

1566
01:49:35,130 --> 01:49:36,870
My sibling likes Saebi.

1567
01:49:36,870 --> 01:49:39,030
When we talk about I-LAND in my class,

1568
01:49:39,030 --> 01:49:44,420
my friend chimes in and says, "But what about Bang Jeemin?"

1569
01:49:44,420 --> 01:49:47,090
"What is she like as a person?"

1570
01:49:47,090 --> 01:49:48,790
My classmates ask so many questions.

1571
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:52,510
"What's so-and-so like? Is so-and-so really like this?"

1572
01:49:52,510 --> 01:49:55,670
Do they ask, "Is Yoon Jiyoon's personality really like that?"

1573
01:49:55,670 --> 01:49:57,290
All the time.

1574
01:49:57,290 --> 01:49:58,850
Yes, yes.

1575
01:49:58,850 --> 01:50:00,340
- Everybody asks that.
- Really?

1576
01:50:00,340 --> 01:50:02,020
My homeroom teacher asked me that, too.

1577
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:03,750
My homeroom teacher watches the show because of me.

1578
01:50:03,750 --> 01:50:07,080
So, everyone just wants to know if I'm weird?

1579
01:50:08,520 --> 01:50:13,970
A girl I trained with said, "I'm really rooting for Jiyoon."

1580
01:50:13,970 --> 01:50:18,430
She told me to tell you that you're her favorite. That she's rooting for you.

1581
01:50:18,430 --> 01:50:22,940
During the first test of Part 2,

1582
01:50:25,260 --> 01:50:29,460
when we saw hundreds of those lights...

1583
01:50:33,550 --> 01:50:36,240
(They want I-LANDERS to debut more than anyone)

1584
01:50:36,240 --> 01:50:38,820
I was so happy in that moment.

1585
01:50:38,820 --> 01:50:40,220
Right, right.

1586
01:50:40,220 --> 01:50:42,240
The happiest.

1587
01:50:43,760 --> 01:50:45,820
It's the semi-finals.

1588
01:50:47,310 --> 01:50:49,810
I wish all of us could just debut.

1589
01:50:51,320 --> 01:50:53,720
It's going to feel weird to say bye.

1590
01:50:53,720 --> 01:50:56,260
(These 12 I-LANDERS have always been together)

1591
01:50:56,260 --> 01:50:58,330
We're the last 12.

1592
01:50:59,040 --> 01:51:01,150
This is the last night.

1593
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:19,400
(Live in Korea)

1594
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,710
Producer VVN.

1595
01:51:26,500 --> 01:51:31,140
That was the I-LANDERS' last night together before the semi-finals.

1596
01:51:31,140 --> 01:51:33,040
What did you think?

1597
01:51:33,040 --> 01:51:38,310
Seeing I-LANDERS be so close to one another,

1598
01:51:38,310 --> 01:51:43,520
I can really start to picture a group.

1599
01:51:43,520 --> 01:51:45,770
It makes me excited.

1600
01:51:46,870 --> 01:51:49,460
But on the other hand,

1601
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:54,590
it is someone's last night, so...

1602
01:51:54,590 --> 01:51:56,940
I'm heartbroken.

1603
01:51:57,930 --> 01:51:59,510
All right.

1604
01:51:59,510 --> 01:52:03,600
I peeked, and Producer Monika

1605
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:07,940
was giving us a maternal smile as she watched.

1606
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:12,020
What is it like to look at the I-LANDERS' daily lives?

1607
01:52:13,270 --> 01:52:16,440
I don't know if this is fit to say for a live broadcast,

1608
01:52:16,440 --> 01:52:21,590
but they're making me want to get married and have a daughter.

1609
01:52:21,590 --> 01:52:24,820
I'm so happy. They're all so lovely.

1610
01:52:26,940 --> 01:52:29,980
Yes, but what should we do?

1611
01:52:29,980 --> 01:52:34,380
All that's left is the cruel announcement of the results.

1612
01:52:35,180 --> 01:52:40,040
Who are the 10 that will advance to the finals?

1613
01:52:41,130 --> 01:52:44,000
Mnet I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

1614
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:48,720
Now, we will announce the survivors still in the running

1615
01:52:48,720 --> 01:52:52,110
to debut in the girl group produced by Teddy.

1616
01:53:00,530 --> 01:53:04,050
Among the 12 I-LANDERS onstage,

1617
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:06,740
3 will survive by I-MATES' choice,

1618
01:53:06,740 --> 01:53:10,620
and 7 will survive by the producers' choice.

1619
01:53:14,910 --> 01:53:17,740
And 2 will be eliminated

1620
01:53:17,740 --> 01:53:20,390
and leave I-LAND permanently.

1621
01:53:21,540 --> 01:53:26,200
We will now announce these fated results.

1622
01:53:28,280 --> 01:53:33,320
First, the combined votes from online and live voting rounds.

1623
01:53:33,320 --> 01:53:37,850
216 countries and regions participated in the vote.

1624
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:41,800
(The 2nd I-MATE SAVE vote: 10,216,761 votes total)

1625
01:53:41,800 --> 01:53:47,420
A total of 10,216,761 votes were recorded.

1626
01:53:47,420 --> 01:53:50,000
To the I-MATES sending their support,

1627
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:53,250
thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

1628
01:53:55,510 --> 01:54:02,410
But only 3 can survive through I-MATES' choice.

1629
01:54:08,680 --> 01:54:14,290
Yes. We just received the final results.

1630
01:54:14,290 --> 01:54:16,600
I'm very nervous.

1631
01:54:17,740 --> 01:54:20,730

1632
01:54:20,730 --> 01:54:23,890

01:54:27,500 --> 01:54:31,230
advancing to the finals through I-MATES' choice.

1635
01:54:37,020 --> 01:54:44,250
The first survivor received the most I-MATE SAVE votes.

1636
01:54:44,250 --> 01:54:48,050
This is the 1st place I-LANDER of the SAVE vote.

1637
01:55:11,460 --> 01:55:15,970

Please say a few words.

01:57:25,800 --> 01:57:28,100
Hello, it's Jeemin.

1657
01:57:28,100 --> 01:57:31,220
(1st place: Bang Jeemin, 3,234,171 points)

1658
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:38,010
I came this far thanks to the I-MATES and their support.

1659
01:57:38,010 --> 01:57:42,210
Thank you for the honor of coming in 1st place again.

1660
01:57:42,210 --> 01:57:46,850
I will work hard to be deserving of that 1st place every second.

1661
01:57:46,850 --> 01:57:52,800
I want to debut and share love and strength with more I-MATES.

1662
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:56,020
Thank you always. I will work harder and make sure I debut.

1663
01:57:56,020 --> 01:57:58,030
Thank you.

1664

proving that she can pull off any position,

1669
01:58:19,740 --> 01:58:22,560

I did not dare imagine that I would go

1743
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:43,010
to the finals with the support of I-MATES.

1744
02:06:43,010 --> 02:06:46,400
I'm not dreaming, right?

1745
02:06:51,280 --> 02:06:57,040
Although you are in front of me, I still can't believe

1746
02:06:57,040 --> 02:07:03,390
there are those who support me and want to hear my voice.

1747
02:07:05,620 --> 02:07:07,460
I...

1748
02:07:11,260 --> 02:07:16,660
I want to give back all the happiness that I've received.

1749
02:07:20,590 --> 02:07:23,170
As I always have,

1750
02:07:23,170 --> 02:07:26,170
I will do my best until the finals

1751
02:07:26,170 --> 02:07:30,680

There are no more I-LANDERS to be saved through the vote.

1762
02:08:33,440 --> 02:08:37,500
Only the producers' choices remain.

1763
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:41,590
Nine contestants await the results.

1764
02:08:41,590 --> 02:08:47,820
Only seven of them will advance to the finals.

1765
02:08:49,020 --> 02:08:53,870
The producers are busy in conversation after the results.

1766
02:09:00,820 --> 02:09:05,830

Hello, it's Kim Gyuri.

1854

It was so hard to get to Part 2.

1855
02:18:29,890 --> 02:18:34,530
I had a lot of anxiety during practice.

1856
02:18:34,530 --> 02:18:37,900

she has shown rapid growth to advance to the finals.

1911
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:12,450
I-LANDER Jung Saebi, please say a few words.

1912
02:25:12,450 --> 02:25:14,790
Hello.

1913
02:25:18,130 --> 02:25:23,870
Thank you for helping me to get to the finals.

1914
02:25:23,870 --> 02:25:27,800
I-MATES who support me...

1915
02:25:27,800 --> 02:25:32,650
I can't explain in words how thankful I am.

1916
02:25:40,640 --> 02:25:43,290
I love you so much.

1917
02:25:48,160 --> 02:25:53,580
I will make you happy forever with my performances.

1918
02:25:54,940 --> 02:25:59,100
I really want to make my debut. Thank you.

1919
02:26:01,740 --> 02:26:04,220
Once again, congratulations.

1920
02:26:04,220 --> 02:26:08,410
Saebi, please make your way to the survivors' stage.

1921
02:26:09,370 --> 02:26:12,870
I-LANDER Jeong Saebi has a lovely, positive mindset

1922
02:26:12,870 --> 02:26:17,230
Jeong Saebi is the sunshine of I-LAND.

1923
02:26:17,230 --> 02:26:21,890
What version of "Lovely Saebi" will she show us at the finals?

1924
02:26:21,890 --> 02:26:23,820
We look forward to it.

1925
02:26:36,700 --> 02:26:41,420
Four I-LANDERS await results.

1926
02:26:42,930 --> 02:26:46,250
Two of them will survive

1927
02:26:46,250 --> 02:26:50,800
and two of them will be eliminated.

1928
02:26:50,800 --> 02:26:56,800
Who is the ninth contestant to advance to the finals?

1929
02:26:56,800 --> 02:27:00,460
Producer Taeyang, please announce your choice.

1930
02:27:02,460 --> 02:27:05,900
The I-LANDER we have chosen

1931
02:27:05,900 --> 02:27:11,810
moved the producers tonight by challenging herself.

1932
02:27:23,480 --> 02:27:27,350
The ninth survivor to advance to the finals is...

1933
02:27:38,780 --> 02:27:41,220
I-LANDER Mai.

1934
02:27:41,220 --> 02:27:44,420
(Producers' Choice: the ninth survivor, Mai)

1935
02:27:44,420 --> 02:27:47,800
Chosen by the producers to advance to the finals,

1936
02:27:47,800 --> 02:27:52,230
the ninth survivor is Mai.

1937
02:27:52,230 --> 02:27:56,110
I-LANDER Mai, please step to the front of the stage.

1938
02:27:59,980 --> 02:28:04,040
Nicknamed "Impact Princess,"

1939
02:28:04,040 --> 02:28:07,230
Mai demonstrates stage presence, even in a small part,

1940
02:28:07,230 --> 02:28:13,310
and has been recognized for her ability to wow us.

1941
02:28:13,310 --> 02:28:17,320
I-LANDER Mai, please say a few words.

1942
02:28:17,320 --> 02:28:20,290
Hello, it's Mai.

1943
02:28:21,420 --> 02:28:29,340
First, thank you to the producers for sending me to the finals.

1944
02:28:29,340 --> 02:28:35,850
I-MATES, thank you for always supporting me.

1945
02:28:35,850 --> 02:28:41,700
I had a really hard time doing the Part 2 missions.

1946
02:28:41,700 --> 02:28:48,560
I was able to get here by thinking of all of you, I-MATES.

1947
02:28:48,560 --> 02:28:54,060
I will not forget how much I want to debut.

1948
02:28:54,060 --> 02:29:00,730
I'll be running toward the finals and beyond.

1949
02:29:00,730 --> 02:29:04,710
Please keep supporting me.

1950
02:29:04,710 --> 02:29:08,920
I-MATES, thank you so much for your support.

1951
02:29:09,770 --> 02:29:19,070
I will do my best at every performance at the finals.

1952
02:29:19,070 --> 02:29:22,840
I will work hard to show you the best version of myself.

1953
02:29:22,840 --> 02:29:25,510
I love you, thank you.

1954
02:29:27,630 --> 02:29:31,260
Mai, once again, congratulations.

1955
02:29:31,260 --> 02:29:33,720
Please make your way to the survivors' stage.

1956
02:29:35,550 --> 02:29:39,710
Mai, to overcome her weaknesses,

1957
02:29:39,710 --> 02:29:44,680
spent more time than anyone else in the practice rooms.

1958
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:50,270
I look forward to seeing her impact again next week.

1959
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:07,480
Only one spot left.

1960
02:30:09,950 --> 02:30:14,110
Remaining contestants, please step to the front of the stage.

1961
02:30:21,830 --> 02:30:25,010
Nam Yuju, Son Juwon, Kim Sujung.

1962
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:29,360
Only one I-LANDER out of the three will survive.

1963
02:30:29,360 --> 02:30:33,090
The other two will be eliminated.

1964
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:41,690
Who will be the last survivor to advance to the finals?

1965
02:31:04,350 --> 02:31:07,000
To be continued.

1966
02:31:15,420 --> 02:31:19,760
This is I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN, happening live.

1967
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:24,900
They are candidates for the new girl group produced by Teddy.

1968
02:31:24,900 --> 02:31:28,870
In the Final 10, nine names have been called out.

1969
02:31:28,870 --> 02:31:33,050
We will reveal the last survivor.

1970
02:31:35,260 --> 02:31:37,760
Right now.

1971
02:31:39,240 --> 02:31:46,100
Who did the producers choose to advance to the finals?

1972
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:51,240
Producer Taeyang, please announce the last survivor.

1973
02:31:52,730 --> 02:31:57,490
Yes, all three of you are so precious to us.

1974
02:31:57,490 --> 02:32:03,280
Even if you are eliminated, it's not because you are inadequate.

1975
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:07,990
As the last survivor, I hope this person can

1976
02:32:07,990 --> 02:32:11,730
do her best at the finals for the eliminated contestants.

1977
02:32:18,060 --> 02:32:22,140
The last survivor to join the finals is...

1978
02:32:35,210 --> 02:32:37,820
I-LANDER Nam Yuju.

1979
02:32:41,060 --> 02:32:46,120
(Producers' Choice: the last survivor, Nam Yuju)

1980
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:51,270
Nam Yuju's special skills are her powerful performance and rap.

1981
02:32:51,270 --> 02:32:55,080
She has grown while executing many different positions.

1982
02:32:56,010 --> 02:33:00,450
I-LANDER Nam Yuju, please say a few words.

1983
02:33:00,450 --> 02:33:02,990
Hello, it's Nam Yuju.

1984
02:33:04,940 --> 02:33:10,350
I'm so happy I will be performing at the finals.

1985
02:33:10,350 --> 02:33:13,990
It's an honor. I'm so happy. Thank you so much.

1986
02:33:13,990 --> 02:33:19,110
Like I have up until now, I will do my best until the end.

1987
02:33:19,110 --> 02:33:22,580
I will put on a great show and finish without regrets.

1988
02:33:22,580 --> 02:33:26,520
Imagining people around the world supporting me...

1989
02:33:26,520 --> 02:33:30,980
Please know how happy and warm that makes me feel.

1990
02:33:30,980 --> 02:33:33,750
I'm looking forward to next week.

1991
02:33:33,750 --> 02:33:36,430
Thank you so much.

1992
02:33:38,220 --> 02:33:40,850
Once again, congratulations.

1993
02:33:40,850 --> 02:33:44,970
Yuju, please make your way to the survivors' stage.

1994
02:33:47,650 --> 02:33:52,450
I-LANDER Nam Yuju, the last survivor to join the finals,

1995
02:33:52,450 --> 02:33:58,860
earned the fortune of being the producers' final choice.

1996
02:33:58,860 --> 02:34:04,640
I hope she will show her unique strengths at the finals.

1997
02:34:04,640 --> 02:34:06,400
Congratulations.

1998
02:34:13,690 --> 02:34:16,130
While they may not have made it to the finals,

1999
02:34:16,130 --> 02:34:20,170
they showed their limitless potential and charms in I-LAND.

2000
02:34:20,170 --> 02:34:24,860
Contestants Kim Sujung and Son Juwon, great work.

2001
02:34:24,860 --> 02:34:30,350
Please say your goodbyes to the I-MATES.

2002
02:34:32,520 --> 02:34:35,240
Hello, it's Son Juwon.

2003
02:34:38,880 --> 02:34:40,190
Thank you.

2004
02:34:40,190 --> 02:34:46,880
First, I'm glad that I got to introduce Son Juwon through I-LAND.

2005
02:34:46,880 --> 02:34:49,400
And...

2006
02:34:49,400 --> 02:34:52,280
while making many memories,

2007
02:34:52,280 --> 02:34:53,960
and...

2008
02:34:54,960 --> 02:34:58,040
going through some tough moments,

2009
02:34:58,040 --> 02:35:04,010
I'm still glad we were able to make good memories.

2010
02:35:06,040 --> 02:35:08,980
To everyone who worked hard for me,

2011
02:35:08,980 --> 02:35:14,660
PDs, directors, writers, producers...

2012
02:35:16,090 --> 02:35:20,540
talent development, management, teachers...

2013
02:35:20,540 --> 02:35:23,530
dance, voice teachers...

2014
02:35:23,530 --> 02:35:27,500
and my 23 friends.

2015
02:35:31,550 --> 02:35:35,050
And my family, mom, dad,

2016
02:35:35,050 --> 02:35:37,480
relatives, friends...

2017
02:35:38,890 --> 02:35:45,580
Princesses, I'm going to miss you all so much.

2018
02:35:46,530 --> 02:35:55,390
Lastly, I-MATES, who showed me support and love, thank you.

2019
02:35:55,390 --> 02:36:02,730
Even just performing in Part 2 was so joyful for me.

2020
02:36:02,730 --> 02:36:06,690
This is not the end of Son Juwon.

2021
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:10,120
I would be grateful for your continued support.

2022
02:36:10,120 --> 02:36:14,850
I-MATES, thank you and I love you.

2023
02:36:20,180 --> 02:36:23,420
Hello, it's Kim Sujung.

2024
02:36:24,820 --> 02:36:32,930
First, through this program, I-LAND, in life...

2025
02:36:33,990 --> 02:36:40,290
I challenged myself in a way I have not before in my life.

2026
02:36:40,290 --> 02:36:45,240
I got to work with great producers, great songs,

2027
02:36:45,240 --> 02:36:50,040
and great people for the past six months.

2028
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:53,590
I think I grew a lot.

2029
02:36:55,870 --> 02:37:00,680
This was challenging, but I made it this far

2030
02:37:00,680 --> 02:37:04,800
because of my 23 friends.

2031
02:37:06,570 --> 02:37:11,910
Jeemin, I like you so much, and I'm so grateful for you.

2032
02:37:11,910 --> 02:37:13,780
Jungeun...

2033
02:37:17,410 --> 02:37:21,860
Jungeun, you're so young but so mature.

2034
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:23,690
Thank you.

2035
02:37:23,690 --> 02:37:26,280
Jiyoon, I'm grateful...

2036
02:37:27,070 --> 02:37:29,700
we could comfort...

2037
02:37:29,700 --> 02:37:33,190
each other during hard times.

2038
02:37:33,190 --> 02:37:35,570
And Fuko...

2039
02:37:36,440 --> 02:37:40,950
I'll remember you as a great Unni.

2040
02:37:40,950 --> 02:37:42,710
Thank you so much.

2041
02:37:42,710 --> 02:37:44,630
Koko...

2042
02:37:47,560 --> 02:37:50,090
I'm sorry I'm leaving.

2043
02:37:51,560 --> 02:37:53,850
Please make your debut.

2044
02:37:53,850 --> 02:37:58,840
Please keep working hard as one of the last remaining ones.

2045
02:37:58,840 --> 02:38:06,800
Our baby, Gyuri, take care of your health. Don't struggle too much.

2046
02:38:07,800 --> 02:38:13,730
Sarang, you're the prettiest here. Trust that.

2047
02:38:13,730 --> 02:38:19,550
Saebi, don't cry too much. Be strong.

2048
02:38:19,550 --> 02:38:21,990
Mai, you're doing so well.

2049
02:38:21,990 --> 02:38:25,160
Keep doing what you do...

2050
02:38:25,160 --> 02:38:26,850
and don't lose faith.

2051
02:38:26,850 --> 02:38:29,180
Yuju, be strong.

2052
02:38:29,180 --> 02:38:33,300
You're stronger than you think. I'm going to root for you.

2053
02:38:33,300 --> 02:38:35,600
I love you all so much.

2054
02:38:35,600 --> 02:38:37,940
And...

2055
02:38:37,940 --> 02:38:41,630
Mom and Dad, who have always supported me, I love you so much.

2056
02:38:41,630 --> 02:38:46,150
I made it this far because of my loving friends.

2057
02:38:46,150 --> 02:38:50,150
And I am someone with limitless potential.

2058
02:38:50,150 --> 02:38:52,300
This is just my beginning.

2059
02:38:52,300 --> 02:38:56,970
Just because I won't debut here doesn't mean it's over.

2060
02:38:56,970 --> 02:38:59,720
I think this is only my beginning.

2061
02:38:59,720 --> 02:39:03,210
I will not despair. I will keep going toward a new beginning.

2062
02:39:03,210 --> 02:39:08,910
I still can't believe there are people who love and support me.

2063
02:39:08,910 --> 02:39:13,880
I'm so happy I got to see you all today. Thank you.

2064
02:39:20,690 --> 02:39:23,070
Producer Taeyang.

2065
02:39:23,070 --> 02:39:28,050
Please say a few words to the eliminated I-LANDERS.

2066
02:39:29,020 --> 02:39:32,970
Sujung. Juwon. Good work.

2067
02:39:32,970 --> 02:39:36,920
It must not have been easy to get here.

2068
02:39:36,920 --> 02:39:40,760
Thank you for staying strong.

2069
02:39:40,760 --> 02:39:44,670
I hope you don't think this is the end.

2070
02:39:44,670 --> 02:39:53,050
I hope this experience gets you closer to your dreams.

2071
02:39:53,050 --> 02:39:57,650
Let's meet again on a bigger stage. Fighting!

2072
02:40:04,970 --> 02:40:08,980
This was a live show of I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

2073
02:40:08,980 --> 02:40:13,760
These are the candidates for the girl group produced by Teddy.

2074
02:40:13,760 --> 02:40:17,400
Through global I-MATES' and the producers' choice,

2075
02:40:17,400 --> 02:40:23,280
we've decided on the Final 10, which will take the stage next week.

2076
02:40:24,230 --> 02:40:28,090
Next week will determine the final group to debut.

2077
02:40:28,090 --> 02:40:32,350
The finals will also happen live.

2078
02:40:33,350 --> 02:40:38,400
Immediately after this episode airs, the final SAVE vote

2079
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:42,430
