Koko is so good that you can only see her in a unit she's in.

353
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,830
She's so good.

354
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,050
I've been dancing since I was 3 years old.

355
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:46,320
I've dreamed of becoming a K-Pop idol since I was in middle school.

356
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,450
(I-MATE's attention pouring in immediately after the performance)

357
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,980
(The tall one in the center is amazing / Koko is the best)

358
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,370
As for dance, I'm in first place.

359
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:58,210
No. 1 rapper, Yui. Daebak!

360
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,780
♫ Ignite from the roots ♫

361
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,730
♫ We're roots, deep down to the roots of that root. ♫

362
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,790
♫ Ignite from the roots and burn, starting with us. ♫

363
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,100
(Tearing it up)

364
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:10,640
♫ I'm standing tall now so I can enjoy my ambition. ♫

365
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,860
♫ I give my future as I see it, and I see my best. ♫

366
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,470
It's so cool.

367
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,660
I didn't know Yui's Korean pronunciation was that good.

368
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,170
She's better than me.

369
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:22,750
5-year friends with Koko.

370
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,770
You've been friends for 5 years? Really?

371
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,480
At a dance studio.

372
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:30,700
We met again at the same company.

373
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:33,000
- And you met here again?
- Yes.

374
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,780
It's destiny. It's destiny.

375

(Contestant Nam Yuju's profile feed)

376
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,810
- 3rd time?
- This is your 3rd survival competition?

377
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,430
I did it once on Mnet in 2020.

378
00:18:42,430 --> 00:18:45,140
I did it again in 2022 somewhere else.

379
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,440
This is my third time.

380
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,290
Last chance. That sounds really cool.

381
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:53,690
As time went by, my desperation grew...

382
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,140
I thought this time might really be the last time.

383
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,620
I hope I can debut soon.

384
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,680
Hi.

385
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,600
Hi.

386
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:14,110
Saebi was so pretty.

387
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:16,000
She stood out the most.

388
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
She's so pretty.

389
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,890
There was a completely idol-like vibe and aura.

390
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,030
She just felt like a celebrity.

391
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:30,430
I was enchanted by her.

392
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:33,630
(Jeong Saebi, 16 years old)

393
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:35,900
Her legs are so long.

394
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,820
So pretty.

395
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,710
You guys are prettier.

396
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,640
(Caught everyone's attention)

397
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,290
I'm nervous.

398
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:50,610
(Oh Yuna, 15 years old / Lingling, 18 years old)
She totally looks like a high-teen girl.

Her legs are 107cm long?

402
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,750
So pretty.

403
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,400
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...)

404
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,680
What's the ratio?

405
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,030
1 to 8. 1 to 8.

406
00:20:06,030 --> 00:20:07,410
(Contestant Jeong Saebi has a 1:8 head-to-body ratio)

407
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:10,350
I'm full of cuteness and loveliness.

408
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:12,400
I'm 16-year-old Jeong Saebi.

409
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,070
I was a ballet model,

410
00:20:14,070 --> 00:20:15,940
a Chinese textbook model,

411
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,020
and an English academy model.

412
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:19,630
So pretty!

413
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:22,150
The longest training period?

414
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:24,550
Right, I trained the longest here.

415
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:25,760
How many years has it been?

416
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,930
It's my 5th year.

417
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,250
5th year?

418
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:29,480
(Oh, my God)

419
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,430
She's a senior!

420
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:33,700
- Advanced to the finals.
- The main dancer.

at 'S' Arts High School.

423

I participated in "Street Dance Girls Fighter 2"

424
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:42,900
and made it to the finals.

425
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,900
I like hip-hop,

426
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:47,810
but can also do waacking, locking, house, choreography,

427
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:50,470
basically, all the genres you might know.

428
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,840
Wouldn't I be the No.1 dancer among contestants?

429
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,910
(No.1 dancer?)

430
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,440
That's cool.

Here they come.

442
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,790
It's a real Avengers unit here too.

443
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:28,100
(The last unit that is in the higher ranks, including first place)

444
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,320

445
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:33,300

Wow!

She's like a model.

458

No.1 visual chosen by contestants.

459
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,510
Her facial features are so defined.

460
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:13,330
She looks like a statue.

461
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,700
She's tall and has a small face.

462
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,550
Kind of like a deer?

463
00:22:17,550 --> 00:22:20,180

She dances so powerfully and neatly.

471
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:47,560
She sings very well, so feels like an all-rounder.

I participated in a survival program called "R * Next?".

478
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,430
I went to the finals,

479
00:23:11,430 --> 00:23:14,340
but I was not selected by an agency

480
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:17,190
and unable to debut.

during this program...

485
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,930
- You did well!
- You did well.

486
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:39,240
Since it's my second survival, I feel a lot of emotions.

487
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,520
I'm both worried and excited.

488

My dream of becoming an idol

489

is so desperate that I want to try again.

490

491
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:58,140

529
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:55,440
(That's right, I'm a fox!)

530
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,250
(My specialty is chatting)

531
00:25:57,250 --> 00:25:58,720
(My hobby is cheering)

532
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,900
(NaSURI wants to become a perfect fox)

533
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:06,150
(And makes a special contract with an unknown entity...)

534
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,300
I don't know how long I've waited for this moment for us to meet.

535
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:11,940
Me too.

536
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,480
I'm looking forward to the adventure ahead! Have fun!

537
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,340
Fighting.

538
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:22,210
- Are you leaving?
- No, don't go.

539
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:25,440
- It's gone.
- It's gone.

540
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Are you leaving without saying goodbye?

541
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:30,320
Please say goodbye.

542
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,830
NaSURI...

543
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:35,680
- NaSURI...
- What, what?

544
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,320
It's scary.

545
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:43,880
Welcome, all 24 contestants.

546
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:48,150
This is a place that awakens the unpredictable diversity,

547
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:52,460
the colorful charm, and the infinite possibilities hidden inside you,

548
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,500
I-LAND.

549
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:56,700
I got goosebumps!

550
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,180
We're finally here.

551
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:03,130
I-LAND aims to create the most iconic girl group in the world,

552
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:05,500
providing everything you need

553
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,270
on your journey to debut.

554
00:27:08,270 --> 00:27:09,450
Thank you.

555
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:11,010
However!

556
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:16,600
Only 12 people can stay in this dreamy I-LAND.

557
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:20,680
Shortly, the entrance test will begin.

558
00:27:28,310 --> 00:27:31,140
(Entrance test countdown begins)

559
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:37,170
As the one-hour countdown began,

560
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:39,730
suddenly, my heart started pounding.

561
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:42,380
During "I-LAND" season 1, I watched the countdown,

562
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,980
and thought, "Wow, that's how you countdown."

563
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:50,630
I feel more nervous now that I'm experiencing it myself.

564
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:53,290
We will now begin the entrance test.

565
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:54,660
That gave me the chills.

566
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,000
Oh, my God. So pretty.

567
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,190
Her expression is amazing.

568
00:27:57,190 --> 00:27:58,350
She nailed it.

569
00:27:58,350 --> 00:28:00,210
She's charismatic.

570
00:28:01,190 --> 00:28:05,030
Don't forget. The number limit for I-LAND is 12.

571
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:06,960
- It was a perfect performance.
- I-LAND in.

572
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,740
- You were quite inadequate.
- I-LAND out.

573
00:28:08,740 --> 00:28:10,780
I want to remain in I-LAND.

574
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,910
The last unit.

575
00:28:12,910 --> 00:28:14,040
Finally, the time has come.

576
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,500
'Drama' Team is insane.

577
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,400
(Only 12 can enter I-LAND. What will be the result of the entrance test?)

578
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:29,040
(A space where you can see everywhere in I-LAND)

579
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,460
(The place with producers' identities)

580
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you.

581
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:35,480
Hello!

582
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,310
(Performance Director Leejung / Performance Director Monika)

583
00:28:37,310 --> 00:28:41,430
(24 / VVN)
Participating in a survival program makes me nervous but also very excited.

584
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,880
You debuted with that kind of program.

585
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:46,460
Right. I don't think the survival program was easy.

586
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:48,280
I think he's the most suitable person, isn't he?

587
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,240
Here today?

588
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,150
In a way, I think this moment is the most important moment that

589
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:56,600
you'll experience before you debut as a singer.

590
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,840
Desperation to make it happen. I wish I could see things like this.

591
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,220
Because it's a competition, in the end.

592
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,650
Rather than the contestants being good at everything,

593
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:10,430
I think it's important that each of them has a strong point.

594
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:12,690
As a dancer,

595
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:17,730
I think the most important thing is how to lead the first 3 seconds.

596
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:20,700
Above all, if they want to become idols,

597
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,840
extraordinary energy, honesty, and sincerity are

598
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,540
all required at the same time.

599
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:30,340
You're living the most exemplary life.

600
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,570
I'm sure they've prepared a lot for today.

601
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,720
I hope they show it well.

602
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,220
(Countdown ends)

603
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,790
Oh, my.

604
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,060
Oh, no.

605
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:55,680
(Where did the contestants arrive in META BALL?)

606
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:00,270
It's jelly.

607
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:10,100
Seeing the stage made me realize I was in I-LAND

608
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,170
and that it is starting now.

609
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:16,640
I'm so nervous.

610
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:18,880
What, what, what, what?

611
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,820
It's starting!

612
00:30:22,850 --> 00:30:27,010
(I-STAGE where the entrance test will take place)

613
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:36,390
Mnet "I-LAND 2 N/a."

614
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:40,210
Hello, 24 contestants.

615
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:43,600
I'm going to go on a new journey in I-LAND with you.

616
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,720
I'm your storyteller, Song Kang.

617
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,400
I thought it was a dream.

618
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:55,870
Did they turn on the wrong ad? It was good enough to think this way.

619
00:30:55,870 --> 00:30:58,320
He's so cool.

620
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:04,300
Just a while ago, you might have been able to feel the new atmosphere of I-LAND.

621
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:09,220
Now, not everyone can go there.

622
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,850
There's only one way to get to I-LAND.

623
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,960
You must pass the entrance test starting now.

624
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,670
Please.

625
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,230
Gosh, I'm suddenly nervous again.

626
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:27,900
The entrance test is 100% decided by the producers.

627
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:31,610
With the unit performances that you've prepared,

628
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:35,450
each person will receive an individual evaluation, not a team evaluation.

629
00:31:35,450 --> 00:31:36,570
It's changed.

630
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:40,010
You have the power to decide on 12 people.

631
00:31:40,010 --> 00:31:44,280
The entrance test is a self-evaluation test.

632
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:47,140
- It's changed?
- Then it could be completely different.

633
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,370
I actually thought it was better this way.

634
00:31:50,370 --> 00:31:52,360
They can evaluate us professionally.

635
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:55,470
Because it's 100% producers' evaluation,

636
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:59,270
I want to be recognized more and do better.

637
00:31:59,270 --> 00:32:04,080
Today's entrance test is to impress the 5 producers.

638
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,000
Producers of "I-LAND 2 N/a." Let me introduce them right away.

639
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,910
(5 producers will watch the performance in real-time)

640
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:17,220
This is legendary.

641
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:20,870
Each producer has a ticket to go to the I-LAND

642
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,760
which is I.

643
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:27,580
You must be chosen by at least 3 out of 5 people, i.e., a majority vote

644
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:30,130
to enter I-LAND.

645
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:33,510
If you receive 3 or more I, I-LAND in.

646
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:35,290
I-LAND in.

647
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:38,790
If you receive no more than two I, I-LAND out.

648
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:40,520
I-LAND out.

649
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,830
You'll go to the GROUND.

650
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:49,230
I want to go to I-LAND.

651
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:51,100
Please.

652
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:55,670
I hope you have a great time on stage today.

653
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:04,100
Now, we're going to take the entrance test that will determine your fate.

654
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,690
We can do it.

655
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:10,640
Make a strong first impression tonight.

656
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,290
Don't forget, I-LAND can take only 12 people.

657
00:33:15,290 --> 00:33:17,960
Mnet "I-LAND 2 N/a."

658
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,080
The entrance test starts now.

659
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,850
(The entrance test starts)

660
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,070
Look at that number 12.

661
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,110
I guess that's the limit.

662
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:34,950
I'm scared.

663
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:38,930
No. Before I came here, I told myself not to be scared.

664
00:33:38,930 --> 00:33:40,450
We were ready for it.

665
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:41,570
Don't be scared.

666
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:43,720
This is real.

667
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,220
I'm not dreaming.

668
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,880
We can do it.

669
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,320
The first unit.

670
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,350
Is it us?

671
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:53,630
Move to the stage when your unit is called.

672
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:55,720
Who's going first?

673
00:33:56,830 --> 00:33:59,290
Four people?

674
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:04,330
(Kim Minsol, Ryu Sarang, Um Jiwon, Son Juwon)
It's us.

675
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,860
- It's us.
- My gosh.

676
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:09,650
Kim Minsol, Um Jiwon,

677
00:34:09,650 --> 00:34:13,190
Ryu Sarang, Son Juwon.

678
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:14,590
To the stage.

679
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,880
Let's go.

680
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:17,380
Good luck.

681
00:34:17,380 --> 00:34:19,420
Going first matters.

682
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,800
Right. The start.

683
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,090
When the first one up is good, it sticks out in your memory.

684
00:34:24,090 --> 00:34:25,120
True.

685
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:28,230
This unit consists of pretty good members.

686
00:34:28,230 --> 00:34:30,230
They placed pretty high among the 24.

687
00:34:30,230 --> 00:34:31,230
Exactly.

688
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,360
Ryu Sarang placed 3rd.

689
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,140
I wonder how she does.

690
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,410
And the one who's mainly a dancer became the leader.

691
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:42,180
I wonder what it's going to be like.

692
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,830
Introduce yourselves.

693
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:47,560
Did they prepare something? Okay.

694
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,290
Is that true?

695
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,380
Yes.

696
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:55,120
Dokey dokey. Yo.

697
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:57,100
- Do.
- Key.

698
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:58,470
We're Team Dokey Dokey.

699
00:34:58,470 --> 00:34:59,940
Oh, Dokey Dokey.

700
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:03,260
I thought they said dokki, as in an axe to chop everything.

701
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,670
Chop it.

702
00:35:06,670 --> 00:35:08,680
So cute.

703
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:12,330
We will now begin the first entrance test.

704
00:35:12,330 --> 00:35:14,130
Standby.

705
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:19,750
We prepared 'Unforgiven' by Le Sserafim.

706
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:23,060
(The first unit is performing Le Sserafim)

707
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,950
We're confident.

708
00:35:24,950 --> 00:35:26,670
If we do as we did in practice,

709
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:30,350
we'll all get to spend a night in I-LAND together.

710
00:35:30,350 --> 00:35:34,990
I hope they say we make a good team.

711
00:35:34,990 --> 00:35:36,250
I feel confident.

712
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:38,830
I can't wait.

713
00:35:38,830 --> 00:35:40,760
Cool.

714
00:35:43,030 --> 00:35:44,130
(Surprised)

715
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:47,760
They must be so nervous.

716
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:01,120
(Even the producers are surprised to see the stage)

717
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,320
This is crazy.

718
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,920
I want to dance here too.

719
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:10,520
So cool.

720
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,420
('Unforgiven,' original song by Le Sserafim)

721
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,540
They're amazing.

722
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,440
Alright.

723
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,290
All four of them have a good expression.

724
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,260
They're great.

725
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,010
So cool.

726
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:44,470
That was crazy. They were amazing.

727
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,590
Good job.

728
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,820
- That was so impressive.
- I know. They were amazing.

729
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:50,300
They're already so charismatic.

730
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,240
The end of the test.

731
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,850
These four have a good balance.

732
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:57,340
It was amazing from the start. We're in trouble now.

733
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,830
It was a high-quality performance.

734
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,550
I know. From the start.

735
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:03,930
Producers will give feedback on the performance.

736
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,270
What?

737
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:06,800
We get feedback?

738
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,650
Right away? Here?

739
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:11,620
(The producers appear on stage again)

740
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:12,930
(Nervous)

741
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:15,880
(Producer Taeyang)

742
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:21,930
While I was watching, I focused on how well

743
00:38:21,930 --> 00:38:24,400
you'd express the song.

744
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,670
You seemed to have good teamwork.

745
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:33,290
I liked how you enjoyed

746
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:37,220
singing and dancing on stage.

747
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,600
- Ryu Sarang.
- Yes.

748
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,930
There was a reason you started the song.

749
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:46,970
(Ryu Sarang started the 'Unforgiven' performance)

750
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:54,670
It seems you studied how to impress people with your charm in a short time.

751
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:55,750
I'm jealous.

752
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,480
And Um Jiwon.

753
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:02,340
I got the feeling you still have a lot to learn.

754
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:07,970
You looked awkward.

755
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:09,270
I know it was your first performance,

756
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:13,340
but who would take that into consideration?

757
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,470
She has a point.

758
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,970
We will now announce the result of the first entrance test.

759
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:21,430
I can't watch it. Oh, my gosh.

760
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,820
We'll be divided into I-LAND and the GROUND.

761
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:27,270
Who will make it to I-LAND?

762
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:30,040
Son Juwon.

763
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,660
(VVN / 24 / Taeyang / Monika / Leejung)

764
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:35,380
(What's the producers' evaluation of Son Juwon?)

765
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:37,390
Are the cards flipping?

766
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,650
Will they turn to show an I?

767
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:46,240
Leading a balanced performance is a leader's virtue,

768
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,410
but the fact that she didn't stand out is also a problem.

769
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:52,650
What if I don't get any I's?

770
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:04,500
(Son Juwon will enter I-LAND if she gets one more I)

771
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,690
(Taeyang)

772
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,130
- Huh?
- What would it be?

773
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:16,360
(With 3-I, she's guaranteed to enter I-LAND)

774
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,210
(With 4-I, SON JUWON enters I-LAND)

775
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,760
I-LAND in.

776
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,330
Thank you.

777
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,750
I gave her an I.

778
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,490
I thought about whether she had the potential or if that was all she could

779
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:38,140
I'll consider she has potential.

780
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:42,500
I gave her an I that she'd be able to absorb more.

781
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,250
Congratulations.

782
00:40:45,150 --> 00:40:46,470
Oh. 1.

783
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,080
The number went up.

784
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,540
That's one less spot for us.

785
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:53,260
(11 spots left in I-LAND)

786
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:55,760
Kim Minsol.

787
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:03,440
(With 4-I, Kim Minsol enters I-LAND)

788
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:05,130
I-LAND in.

789
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,830
My gosh.

790
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:11,770
You did well.

791
00:41:11,770 --> 00:41:17,810
I think it was Minsol who danced the most stably.

792
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:19,900
Congratulations.

793
00:41:19,900 --> 00:41:22,440
Um Jinwon.

794
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:28,490
We're all going to I-LAND.

795
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:30,820
(Producers VVN &amp; 24 chose an I)

796
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,920
Is she...

797
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,800
(Only one more I to enter I-LAND)

798
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:36,370
It's up to Leejung.

799
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:38,050
Please.

800
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,610
(Um Jiwon's destiny is up to Director Leejung)

801
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,640
(With 2-I, Um Jiwon is out of I-LAND)

802
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,930
I-LAND out.

803
00:41:56,830 --> 00:41:59,060
Thank you.

804
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,450
Jiwon is out.

805
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:07,110
If she's out, what about me?

806
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:09,490
The fact that she's out...

807
00:42:09,490 --> 00:42:10,990
Ryu Sarang.

808
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:12,440
(So far, 2 entered I-LAND, and 1 is out)

809
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:15,580
(Only Ryu Sarang's result remains)

810
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,440
(What will become of her?)

811
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,480
ALL I?

812
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:27,170
(With 4-I, she's guaranteed to enter I-LAND)

813
00:42:27,170 --> 00:42:28,780
ALL I?

814
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,720
(Will she be the first to receive ALL I?)

815
00:42:31,490 --> 00:42:32,560
Drum roll...

816
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:35,170
Why am I at the end?

817
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,890
I feel so bad.

818
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,820
(With ALL I, Ryu Sarang enters I-LAND)

819
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,110
I-LAND in.

820
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:45,520
She must be so happy.

821
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,880
The screen is different for ALL I.

822
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,650
Thank you.

823
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:51,910
Thank you.

824
00:42:51,910 --> 00:42:53,460
Good job.

825
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,280
She stood out the most on stage.

826
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,580
It didn't look like her first performance.

827
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,740
(In / In / Out / In)

828
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:05,940
(Um Jiwon is the only one out in the first unit)

829
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:08,670
We'll wait for you in I-LAND. Hurry up.

830
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:15,380
The number went up.

831
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:17,380
It's one-fourth full already.

832
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:21,040
I wish everyone makes it yet doesn't make it at the same time.

833
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,540
My spot.

834
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:24,840
My spot.

835
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:29,640
Put on a sticker according to your result on your left chest

836
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:32,420
and go back to your seats.

837
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:40,930
If she's angry and improves, it becomes a drama.

838
00:43:40,930 --> 00:43:44,830
If she's discouraged, it makes her who she is.

839
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:48,420
To the contestants, this world means everything.

840
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:56,020
It feels like the end of the world if they don't survive here.

841
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:58,690
The second unit.

842
00:43:58,690 --> 00:44:00,270
Who is it?

843
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:01,950
(Kim Gyuri, Fuko, Park Yeeun, Kim Chaeeun, Kang Jiwon)

844
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,550
Kim Chaeeun. Fuko. Kang Jiwon.

845
00:44:05,550 --> 00:44:08,210
Kim Gyuri. Park Yeeun.

846
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,020
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

847
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:14,390
That's cute. All the same calves.

848
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:17,670
The same calves.

849
00:44:17,670 --> 00:44:20,910
"The same calves."

850
00:44:20,910 --> 00:44:23,830
Sha-la-la-la-la.

851
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:25,250
What? What?

852
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,260
Sha-la-la-la-la.

853
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,310
- What? What?
- Pretty.

854
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,470
They're so pretty.

855
00:44:31,470 --> 00:44:34,030
I was surprised to see them at first. So pretty.

856
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,130
So pretty.

857
00:44:36,130 --> 00:44:37,610
This unit.

858
00:44:37,610 --> 00:44:39,490
My goodness. The bottom place is in this unit.

859
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:41,440
It's Kim Chaeeun.

860
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,230
If she's the first Korean scholarship student at British R Ballet School,

861
00:44:45,230 --> 00:44:46,880
The competition rate is 4,000:1.

862
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,090
If she's the first Korean scholarship student at British R ballet school,

863
00:44:50,090 --> 00:44:52,280
what's she doing here?

864
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:53,320
I know.

865
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:57,750
Most of them ranked low in the 24-person self-evaluation ranking.

866
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,230
- Right.
- But the 2nd place is here.

867
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:03,140
Yes, only one was trained for a long time.

868
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,450
I guess that's why she's the leader.

869
00:45:05,450 --> 00:45:07,270
She was like a mom.

870
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:11,630
There were many applicants with a short training period.

871
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,330
She taught them the choreography.

872
00:45:13,330 --> 00:45:16,970
She was our center and guided us well.

873
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:19,830
We'll be able to rely on her and perform with confidence.

874
00:45:19,830 --> 00:45:23,690
Everyone else is in GROUND.

875
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:28,180
I think I will be able to lead them.

876
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,800
Don't forget to smile!

877
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:31,420
No wonder she's the leader.

878
00:45:32,310 --> 00:45:35,160
- Smile!
- I'm looking forward to watching Fuko.

879
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,910
So pretty.

880
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:41,120
Wow!

881
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,300
They look like angels.

882
00:45:46,590 --> 00:45:48,630
Wow!

883
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:50,920
Daebak.

884
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:53,650
They're so pretty.

885
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,980
("After LIKE," an original song by IVE)

886
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,960
They're pretty.

887
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:05,960
I'm into it.

888
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,850
Cute.

889
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:32,430
My gosh...

890
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,760
They're basically celebrities.

891
00:47:03,050 --> 00:47:04,880
Pretty.

892
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,230
So pretty.

893
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,530
- Cute.
- Gyuri's good.

894
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:26,960
Fuko, you're amazing!

895
00:47:45,610 --> 00:47:47,950
They're so pretty.

896
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,380
So pretty. They were so good.

897
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,880
Oh, they're so pretty.

898
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:52,970
So cute!

899
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,360
Fuko is so pretty. Like seriously.

900
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,640
She's basically an idol.

901
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,820
The test is now complete.

902
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,890
I have to say their visuals are top-notch.

903
00:48:01,890 --> 00:48:04,120
They're really pretty.

904
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:06,180
So pretty.

905
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:07,610
I'm so nervous.

906
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:09,830
I'm not sure if I did well.

907
00:48:09,830 --> 00:48:11,880
It's okay.

908
00:48:11,880 --> 00:48:13,580
You did a good job.

909
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,130
Chaeeun, I can tell you majored in ballet.

910
00:48:20,130 --> 00:48:22,760
Your lines are clean.

911
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:25,420
But this isn't a children's rhyme.

912
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:28,660
You should focus on improving your singing.

913
00:48:28,660 --> 00:48:30,280
Got it.

914
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:34,980
As for Jiwon, to be honest, I didn't really notice you.

915
00:48:37,780 --> 00:48:39,600
I-LAND out.

916
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,160
(Kim Chaeeun and Kang Jiwon are out of I-LAND)

917
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,020
Contestant Kim Gyuri.

918
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:52,030
To be honest, I thought I didn't do as well as I practiced,

919
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:54,900
so I wasn't expecting much.

920
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,530
(Will she be the second person to receive ALL I?)

921
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:15,150
(Confusion)

922
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:16,980
I-LAND in.

923
00:49:16,980 --> 00:49:18,950
- So cute.
- She's so confused.

924
00:49:18,950 --> 00:49:19,960
So cute.

925
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:22,450
- Gyuri, congratulations!
- Good job!

926
00:49:22,450 --> 00:49:25,160
(Confusion)

927
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,000
I didn't think I would make it.

928
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,840
Good job.

929
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:33,560
She's in disbelief.

930
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,040
We could see the confidence on her face.

931
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:38,060
It pulls you in.

932
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:40,400
This is how you work the stage.

933
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,640
(What's the feedback on our leader, Fuko?)

934
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,660
Our leader, Fuko.

935
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:45,930
Your facial expressions were great.

936
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:47,830
Overall, you were very consistent.

937
00:49:47,830 --> 00:49:52,770
Your group didn't have much time to train, but you pulled through.

938
00:49:52,770 --> 00:49:56,010
It means it was thanks to your leadership.

939
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:01,100
You must've worked so hard. Good job.

940
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,420
- Thank you.
- It must have been tough.

941
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:10,250
They recognized the work I did behind the scenes.

942
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,440
That made me feel so much better.

943
00:50:14,290 --> 00:50:16,130
Contestant Fuko.

944
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,840
Fuko will make it, for sure.

945
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,460
I'm sure she'll get ALL I.

946
00:50:31,340 --> 00:50:32,810
(With ALL I, Fuko enters I-LAND)

947
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:34,100
I knew you would get it.

948
00:50:34,100 --> 00:50:36,130
I-LAND in.

949
00:50:36,130 --> 00:50:38,300
Fuko!

950
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,680
(The members congratulate their leader)

951
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,170
Thank you.

952
00:50:41,170 --> 00:50:44,010
Two people in the same unit received ALL I.

953
00:50:44,990 --> 00:50:46,230
(7 spots left in I-LAND)

954
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:47,830
The number went up again.

955
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:49,070
(What is the feedback on the last member, Park Yeeun?)

956
00:50:49,070 --> 00:50:51,270
Yeeun, you are...

957
00:50:52,550 --> 00:50:54,290
So pretty.

958
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:56,070
Thank you.

959
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,310
You're so pretty, but...

960
00:50:57,310 --> 00:51:01,320
For an idol, their appearance is also a talent and an advantage.

961
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,310
You should make more use of it.

962
00:51:04,310 --> 00:51:09,690
On top of that, dancing and singing are must-have skills.

963
00:51:10,690 --> 00:51:12,870
Contestant Park Yeeun.

964
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:15,840
(What did the producers think of Park Yeeun?)

965
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:18,730
You got this. Let's go.

966
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:25,860
Life is not easy, I guess.

967
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:30,110
Contestant Park Yeeun.

968
00:51:32,540 --> 00:51:34,270
I-LAND out.

969
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,110
I-LAND out.

970
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:39,130
I was mad at myself.

971
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:43,060
There must be a reason why I got the results I did.

972
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:46,310
I was angry that I didn't know what it was before.

973
00:51:46,310 --> 00:51:50,980
She was cast because she went viral on the internet.

974
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:53,620
She's an example of how, even if you have other charms,

975
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:58,310
you need a technique to be onstage.

976
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,170
Entrance test, unit 3.

977
00:52:01,170 --> 00:52:02,690
Who's it going to be?

978
00:52:02,690 --> 00:52:03,990
(The next unit has 4 members)

979
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,400
Four? Isn't that us?

980
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:10,060
(Lingling / Jeong Saebi / Oh Yuna / Kim Sujung)

981
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:12,450
Fighting!

982
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:14,920
I'm so excited.

983
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:20,270
I've always thought Sujung looks so cool dancing.

984
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,070
She was the leader of the team "Mannequin" on "Street Dance Girls Fighter Season 2."

985
00:52:24,070 --> 00:52:26,370
After participating in "Street Dance Girls Fighter 2,"

986
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,970
and watching myself on TV,

987
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:30,790
I love dancing, but...

988
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:36,550
I thought being an idol could get me more attention.

989
00:52:36,550 --> 00:52:38,360
Jeong Saebi is so tall.

990
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:40,200
Her legs are amazing.

991
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,890
If it's long, it's Jeong Saebi.

992
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:43,670
If it's Jeong Saebi, it's pretty.

993
00:52:43,670 --> 00:52:45,840
If it's pretty, it's Kim Chaeeun.

994
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:47,520
What?

995
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,080
Standby.

996
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:52,560
So cool. Oh Yuna!

997
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:58,330
Oh Yuna made headlines with her cover dance of "Queencard."

998
00:52:58,330 --> 00:53:01,390
(Her cover dance in Mungyeong went viral online)

999
00:53:01,390 --> 00:53:03,340
5 million views.

1000
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:05,620
That's a lot.

1001
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:09,010
She's been training for 3 years and 8 months.

1002
00:53:09,010 --> 00:53:10,650
That's a long time.

1003
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:12,800
Her starting pose is already flawless.

1004
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,390
You can feel her aura in the pose.

1005
00:53:15,390 --> 00:53:17,440
It says we're different.

1006
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:20,200
I really like how they're all looking somewhere.

1007
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:22,120
I'm so excited.

1008
00:53:26,390 --> 00:53:28,500
What is that?

1009
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,370
Wow, look.

1010
00:53:32,370 --> 00:53:34,890
What's going on?

1011
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:38,570
("Sweet Venom," originally sung by ENHYPEN)

1012
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:46,190
Hey!

1013
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,500
They're crazy!

1014
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,790
They can sing, too.

1015
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:51,900
They can dance!

1016
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,240
Wow, they're crazy.

1017
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,280
They can really dance.

1018
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,780
It's a high-quality performance.

1019
00:55:06,330 --> 00:55:08,200
They're so good.

1020
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:37,270
So cool.

1021
00:55:37,270 --> 00:55:38,610
I'm going to fall in love with them.

1022
00:55:38,610 --> 00:55:41,140
- So cool.
- They're all so hot.

1023
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:42,880
Their facial expressions are so...

1024
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:44,860
Their facial expressions are so...

1025
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,620
savage!

1026
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,210
I got goosebumps.

1027
00:55:50,210 --> 00:55:51,790
Their expressions are amazing.

1028
00:55:51,790 --> 00:55:53,720
I got goosebumps, really.

1029
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,300
I'm going to fall in love with Saebi.

1030
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,160
They're such good dancers.

1031
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,890
All four of them went out there to slay.

1032
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:03,170
Good job!

1033
00:56:05,190 --> 00:56:07,710
The most nerve-wracking moment.

1034
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:12,470
I didn't think this was a song for female idols.

1035
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:16,100
You were a group of very charming, very bad girls.

1036
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:17,820
Bad girls.

1037
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:20,770
Where did you learn how to make such savage faces?

1038
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:22,760
Thank you.

1039
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:24,410
Your venom was so sweet.

1040
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,100
Kim Sujung from "Street Girls Fighter 2." I've been looking forward to seeing you.

1041
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:29,210
Nice to meet you.

1042
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,030
Nice to meet you.

1043
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,190
First of all, the dance was flawless.

1044
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,830
During the dance break, you came up to the front

1045
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:38,600
and tore up the whole stage by yourself.

1046
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:40,080
Thank you.

1047
00:56:41,870 --> 00:56:44,680
(Kim Sujung commanded the stage during the dance break)

1048
00:56:46,790 --> 00:56:48,750
She's such a good dancer.

1049
00:56:48,750 --> 00:56:50,510
She's a dancing machine, indeed.

1050
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:51,500
Seriously.

1051
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:53,350
I want to be like that, too.

1052
00:56:53,350 --> 00:56:57,580
Let me give you some harsh advice.

1053
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:03,220
I think it would be good for you to practice a move or two that makes you look taller onstage.

1054
00:57:03,220 --> 00:57:05,500
You need to make your neck look longer.

1055
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,510
Then you'll look taller.

1056
00:57:07,510 --> 00:57:11,330
I think your stage presence will be bigger, too.

1057
00:57:11,330 --> 00:57:13,160
You can do that, right?

1058
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,740
Normally, I would never get to meet these people,

1059
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:20,330
let alone work with them as producers.

1060
00:57:20,330 --> 00:57:23,740
I think this was a really valuable opportunity.

1061
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:26,470
Jeong Saebi, you have a lot of good stuff as well.

1062
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,890
You're good at making use of them.

1063
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:35,310
As the song went on, I could see that you trust yourself.

1064
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,640
Thank you.

1065
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:41,710
Everything Monika says is so good.

1066
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:43,900
First, great work.

1067
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:50,030
I don't have much to say about Yuna's singing.

1068
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:54,370
Because it's not good.

1069
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,410
"I am going to be reborn."

1070
00:57:56,410 --> 00:58:00,680
Tell yourself, "I am going to be reborn."

1071
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:02,780
And keep working hard.

1072
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:04,120
Got it.

1073
00:58:04,120 --> 00:58:07,690
That must not have been easy to pull off. Good job, everyone.

1074
00:58:07,690 --> 00:58:10,130
Thank you.

1075
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:12,850
How many do you think will make it?

1076
00:58:12,850 --> 00:58:14,240
Good job.

1077
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,720
I think several.

1078
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:19,470
Sujung will make it, for sure.

1079
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:22,470
Maybe all of them?

1080
00:58:22,470 --> 00:58:23,600
No!

1081
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:26,200
That would be nice for them, but no.

1082
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,110
- If they did, it's 9 people.
- I know.

1083
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:35,040
Here are the results of the 3rd unit's entrance test.

1084
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:37,280
I'm nervous.

1085
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:38,680
Why am I nervous?

1086
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:41,270
Contestant Kim Sujung.

1087
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:45,080
Will Sujung make it?

1088
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:47,030
She got good feedback.

1089
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:52,290
I can feel the desperation on her face.

1090
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:55,310
(Producer VVN is I)

1091
00:58:55,310 --> 00:58:57,410
Let's go.

1092
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:59,210
(Producer 24 is I)

1093
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,810
She's in.

1094
00:59:01,810 --> 00:59:04,360
(Producer Taeyang is I, she is I-LAND in)

1095
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:05,930
ALL I?

1096
00:59:05,930 --> 00:59:08,140
(Kim Sujung I-LAND in by ALL I)

1097
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:09,960
(With ALL I, Kim Sujung is I-LAND in)

1098
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:12,690
I-LAND in.

1099
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:14,890
Cute. Is she surprised?

1100
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:20,720
I thought she was a machine at singing, too.

1101
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:24,070
She has a lot of talent.

1102
00:59:24,070 --> 00:59:27,960
I hope I shine like that someday.

1103
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,080
(6 spots remaining in I-LAND)

1104
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,720
Only half left.

1105
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:33,050
Contestant Lingling.

1106
00:59:35,270 --> 00:59:37,700
Her expression is so heartbreaking.

1107
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:42,420
I did as much as I could, but I'm not sure.

1108
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:51,430
I-LAND out.

1109
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:55,100
There is someone I am very disappointed in. It's Lingling.

1110
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:58,390
You can't just be good at dancing or singing.

1111
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:03,190
You need to focus on giving a full performance.

1112
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:06,510
This is hard.

1113
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,870
Contestant Oh Yuna.

1114
01:00:10,300 --> 01:00:11,870
She's holding hands with unni.

1115
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:14,010
Even though she's taller than unni.

1116
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:17,350
(What did the producers think of Oh Yuna?)

1117
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:23,610
Tell yourself, "I'm going to be reborn."

1118
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:34,450
I-LAND out.

1119
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,530
I-LAND out.

1120
01:00:38,530 --> 01:00:40,350
(Oh Yuna is out of I-LAND)

1121
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:43,170
It hurts when things like this happen.

1122
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:45,120
She became famous on social media.

1123
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,900
She did that stuff because she liked doing it.

1124
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:51,310
But here, you can't just like it. You need to be good at it.

1125
01:00:51,310 --> 01:00:52,370
That's right.

1126
01:00:52,370 --> 01:00:53,770
Contestant Jeong Saebi.

1127
01:00:53,770 --> 01:00:55,760
(Lastly, the results for Jeong Saebi)

1128
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:57,130
She's 100% ALL I.

1129
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:58,710
Really?

1130
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:10,810
(One more vote needed for I-LAND in)

1131
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:12,830
It's close.

1132
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:18,990
(Jeong Saebi is in I-LAND with 4-I)

1133
01:01:18,990 --> 01:01:21,550
I-LAND in.

1134
01:01:21,550 --> 01:01:23,940
To me, she was the most consistent.

1135
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,370
If she keeps working hard, something will come out of it.

1136
01:01:26,370 --> 01:01:28,300
She's great physically.

1137
01:01:28,300 --> 01:01:30,970
I like the energy of her eyes.

1138
01:01:30,970 --> 01:01:35,170
She gives off a cocky vibe onstage, in a good way.

1139
01:01:35,170 --> 01:01:38,000
She has bad girl energy.

1140
01:01:38,000 --> 01:01:39,610
It changed!

1141
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,500
There are five spots left.

1142
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,830
Oh no, I'm worried.

1143
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:49,260
Seeing the numbers go up,

1144
01:01:49,260 --> 01:01:50,750
I became more and more anxious.

1145
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:57,270
As the number of spots went down, I became more impatient.

1146
01:01:57,270 --> 01:01:59,280
(So far, 7 in I-LAND and 6 in Ground)

1147
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,070
(So far, 7 in I-LAND and 6 in GROUND)

1148
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:04,100
They might go over.

1149
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:05,760
I think they will.

1150
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:07,560
The ones left are all good.

1151
01:02:07,560 --> 01:02:09,950
Everyone left is good enough to get into I-LAND.

1152
01:02:09,950 --> 01:02:12,190
There are still a lot of people left.

1153
01:02:12,190 --> 01:02:13,530
They'll go over the number.

1154
01:02:13,530 --> 01:02:15,550
Oh, there are people here, too.

1155
01:02:15,550 --> 01:02:17,440
A little here.

1156
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,840
It's starting, everyone.

1157
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,720
So much tension.

1158
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:24,200
(The results of the 4th unit's self-evaluation)

1159
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:26,090
Please, come out.

1160
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:28,090
Please.

1161
01:02:28,090 --> 01:02:30,070
Please.

1162
01:02:30,070 --> 01:02:33,700
(What are the results of the 4th unit's self-evaluations?)

1163
01:02:34,060 --> 01:02:35,840
(Self-evaluation by the 24)

1164
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:39,110
(Contestants surprised by the low rankings)

1165
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,550
(The lowest average rankings of any unit)

1166
01:02:43,550 --> 01:02:45,750
I need to work harder.

1167
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:48,460
Everyone has trained for very short amounts of time.

1168
01:02:48,460 --> 01:02:50,180
No one has trained for more than a year.

1169
01:02:50,180 --> 01:02:52,240
So the rankings

1170
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:55,040
are all on the lower end.

1171
01:02:55,040 --> 01:02:59,330
We prepared a performance of "Cake" by ITZY.

1172
01:02:59,330 --> 01:03:03,910
I hope we can show off our bright and cute energy.

1173
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:05,960
Even the way they walk is cute.

1174
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:07,390
They look like chicks.

1175
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,530
Babies, babies.

1176
01:03:09,530 --> 01:03:10,620
Schoolgirl uniforms.

1177
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:11,970
I'm Grapefruit Yuiko.

1178
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:13,310
I'm Peach Eunchae.

1179
01:03:13,310 --> 01:03:15,220
- I'm Strawberry Soul.
- I'm Cherry Nana.

1180
01:03:15,220 --> 01:03:18,450
We are the fruit cake unit.

1181
01:03:18,450 --> 01:03:20,510
So cute.

1182
01:03:20,510 --> 01:03:22,290
Fruit cake.

1183
01:03:22,290 --> 01:03:25,070
So cute.

1184
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,810
If we were judging by cuteness, there would be no competition.

1185
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:30,670
They'll be the hardest to judge.

1186
01:03:30,670 --> 01:03:33,610
We will now begin the entrance test performance.

1187
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:35,230
Standby.

1188
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:36,900
Fighting!

1189
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:40,150
They whispered "fighting" to each other.

1190
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,840
It's like looking at babies.

1191
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,810
Oh, my God!

1192
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:49,810
Wow!

1193
01:03:49,810 --> 01:03:51,750
There's a cake above them.

1194
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:54,060
So cute!

1195
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:58,500
("Cake," originally sung by ITZY)

1196
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:11,880
They're good.

1197
01:04:15,330 --> 01:04:17,000
So cute.

1198
01:04:30,510 --> 01:04:33,640
It's juicy right from the start!

1199
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,690
Oh, my God.

1200
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,170
So fresh.

1201
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:33,670
I want to take a bite!

1202
01:05:35,510 --> 01:05:37,650
Toward the end, it was weak.

1203
01:05:37,650 --> 01:05:41,600
I loved the energy when they first appeared.

1204
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:44,650
But it didn't go beyond cuteness.

1205
01:05:44,650 --> 01:05:47,160
End of test.

1206
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,780
I was nervous 80% of the time.

1207
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,240
There were so many off-pitch notes.

1208
01:05:53,240 --> 01:05:54,690
Who's going to get in?

1209
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,630
One person?

1210
01:05:56,630 --> 01:05:58,280
Maybe Soul?

1211
01:05:58,280 --> 01:05:59,590
I don't know.

1212
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,080
Yeah, I can't predict it.

1213
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:02,380
The most important thing is singing.

1214
01:06:02,380 --> 01:06:05,800
Because all three of them are singers.

1215
01:06:05,800 --> 01:06:07,940
This is strangely difficult.

1216
01:06:07,940 --> 01:06:10,460
This is too hard.

1217
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,900
I'm really nervous again.

1218
01:06:12,900 --> 01:06:16,550

Don't cry.

1223
01:06:33,350 --> 01:06:34,480
She's crying.

1224
01:06:34,480 --> 01:06:37,700
I thought it would be nice if at least one of us got in.

1225

1231
01:07:04,850 --> 01:07:06,720
I'm so nervous.

1232
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,990
I think this unit did a good job.

1233
01:07:08,990 --> 01:07:10,310
I don't know about their vocals.

1234
01:07:10,310 --> 01:07:12,040
But they were really good dancers.

1235
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,530
I agree.

1236
01:07:13,530 --> 01:07:16,170
The first three seconds were fantastic.

1237
01:07:17,570 --> 01:07:22,510
I loved how they were playful and expressive at the start.

1238
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:24,630
Wow, I'm in big trouble. Look at the number.

1239

1240
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:29,730
Then Soul will get in, too.

1241

I hope we all get it.

01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,960
Please, please, please.

1244
01:07:37,960 --> 01:07:39,850
Let's go together.

1245
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:43,280
(Currently 2 votes with Producers Taeyang and Monika)

1246
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:45,070
What is up with this "Cake" unit?

1247
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,880
Please, please.

1248
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:50,610
(With 3 votes, Choi Soul I-LAND in)

1249
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:52,840
I-LAND in.

1250
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,830
Two spots left!

1251
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:56,300
Are they all in?

1252
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:58,490
Oh, no.

1253
01:07:58,490 --> 01:08:02,650
(The contestants are feeling mixed about the 4th unit's results)

1254
01:08:02,980 --> 01:08:05,180
Are they all in?

1255
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:08,510
Contestant Nana.

1256
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,850
Nana, why are you crying?

1257
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,370
(Nana is I-LAND out)

1258
01:08:17,370 --> 01:08:19,670
I-Land out.

1259
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:23,400
If you want to be a singer,

1260
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:27,050
you're going to need to work a lot harder.

1261
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:31,140
I actually didn't vote for any of them.

1262
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:34,130
Their entrance was very impactful.

1263
01:08:34,130 --> 01:08:35,580
They had a strong start.

1264
01:08:35,580 --> 01:08:39,320
But I can't help but notice the singing.

1265
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,280
At some point, they let go of the singing.

1266
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:44,520
Like they gave up?

1267
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:49,050
(Their vocals were disappointing towards the end)

1268
01:08:49,050 --> 01:08:52,150
It was hard for me to give an I.

1269
01:08:52,150 --> 01:08:55,600
If you consider the first half as their potential,

1270
01:08:55,600 --> 01:08:57,460
I think the unit has a lot of potential.

1271
01:08:57,460 --> 01:08:59,310
Good job.

1272
01:08:59,310 --> 01:09:01,680
I'm so happy.

1273
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:03,350
There aren't many spots left.

1274
01:09:03,350 --> 01:09:04,940
It's going to be a bloodbath.

1275
01:09:04,940 --> 01:09:06,980
GROUND is peaceful.

1276
01:09:06,980 --> 01:09:08,130
Save me.

1277
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:10,770
I'll remember that I didn't get a single vote for the rest of my life.

1278
01:09:10,770 --> 01:09:12,540
I'm not a cool girl.

1279
01:09:12,540 --> 01:09:15,210
(The 5th unit's entrance test)

1280
01:09:15,210 --> 01:09:16,520
The number of people is crucial.

1281
01:09:16,520 --> 01:09:19,220
Three or four.

1282
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:22,230
It's us.

1283
01:09:22,230 --> 01:09:24,240
Oh, here we go.

1284
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,760
Oh, so cool.

1285
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,450
They're so cool.

1286
01:09:27,450 --> 01:09:30,530
This is the third survival for Nam Yuju.

1287
01:09:30,530 --> 01:09:33,830
I think she's already proven how much she wants it.

1288
01:09:33,830 --> 01:09:36,630
She's 16, and this is her third survival.

1289
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,640
Most of her life has been about survival.

1290
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:41,460
Her whole life has been about competing.

1291
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:43,560
She hasn't had an easy life.

1292
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,750
Koko is 173.5cm tall.

1293
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:47,920
So tall.

1294
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,710
Being tall might make it harder to dance.

1295
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:54,340
But the contestants picked her as the best dancer.

1296
01:09:54,340 --> 01:09:56,410
It shows she has control over her body.

1297
01:09:56,410 --> 01:09:59,160
- Her ranking isn't bad.
- No. 5.

1298
01:09:59,160 --> 01:10:02,540
I'm so curious about her great dance experience.

1299
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:07,340
The contestants picked Yui as the best rapper.

1300
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:09,250
That means she raps the best.

1301
01:10:09,250 --> 01:10:13,650
All three of them are good rappers.

1302
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:16,450
That's why they chose "Baggy Jeans" by NCT U.

1303
01:10:16,450 --> 01:10:21,170
("Baggy Jeans" by NCT U, known for its groovy rapping)

1304
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:24,030
This dance needs to look cool. But you know.

1305
01:10:24,030 --> 01:10:27,000
Doing well and looking cool are two different things.

1306
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:33,000
Not only does this choreography require practice, but you need to study the moves.

1307
01:10:33,010 --> 01:10:34,830
You need to look strong while being relaxed.

1308
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:36,580
Not try to be cool, but look cool.

1309
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,090
Your existence itself needs to be cool.

1310
01:10:38,090 --> 01:10:39,670
Effortless.

1311
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:44,110
I'm curious whether they'll deliver that coolness.

1312
01:10:44,110 --> 01:10:47,050
They already look so cool.

1313
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:49,450
I'm so nervous.

1314
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:51,420
I think they'll all get in.

1315
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:53,120
They're all so good.

1316
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,150
Two, three...

1317
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:59,280
♫ Can't take your eyes off, yeah you need a break ♫

1318
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:00,540
I like it already.

1319
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:02,660
Hello, usually I'm...

1320
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:06,940
♫ Baggy, baggy, baggy, baggy, baby, baby boo ♫

1321
01:11:06,940 --> 01:11:07,930
So cute!

1322
01:11:07,930 --> 01:11:12,790
But onstage, I'm gorgeous, and I glow. I'm Yui.

1323
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:14,040
So cute.

1324
01:11:14,040 --> 01:11:15,280
Can't wait.

1325
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:18,620
Hello. Usually, I'm a smiley bunny.

1326
01:11:18,700 --> 01:11:23,370
But onstage, I'm cool and charming.

1327
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:26,500
I'm charming Koko.

1328
01:11:27,630 --> 01:11:29,240
They all have enticing eyes.

1329
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,600
They all look like they're of their generation.

1330
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:36,620
I'll enchant you all with my exemplary enigma.

1331
01:11:36,620 --> 01:11:38,550
My name is Nam Yuju with unexpected charm.

1332
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:39,540
So attractive.

1333
01:11:39,540 --> 01:11:41,490
- I'm the most excited about this unit.
- Me too.

1334
01:11:41,490 --> 01:11:44,200
I saw them practice, and they were so good.

1335
01:11:44,210 --> 01:11:45,990
They're all so talented and all so charming.

1336
01:11:45,990 --> 01:11:48,560
and all so charming.

1337
01:11:48,560 --> 01:11:52,710
- I'm curious.
- Let the entrance test begin.

1338
01:11:52,710 --> 01:11:58,860
We want our rap and singing to come across as hip.

1339
01:11:58,860 --> 01:12:00,480
They're going to transform.

1340
01:12:00,480 --> 01:12:02,200
Standby.

1341
01:12:02,200 --> 01:12:03,600
Can't wait.

1342
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,570
They'll be great.

1343
01:12:05,570 --> 01:12:07,270
Let's go!

1344
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:10,320
- Let's go!
- What?

1345
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:11,650
What?

1346
01:12:11,650 --> 01:12:13,420
From the start.

1347
01:12:13,420 --> 01:12:15,550
They're slaying.

1348
01:12:19,080 --> 01:12:20,300
What?

1349
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:22,460
Wow, awesome.

1350
01:12:22,460 --> 01:12:23,520
Cool.

1351
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:24,600
I'm so excited right now.

1352
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,520
Wow, so cool.

1353
01:12:28,200 --> 01:12:30,790
("Baggy Jeans," originally sung by NCT U)

1354
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,800
They're nuts.

1355
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,840
So cool!

1356
01:13:48,580 --> 01:13:50,850
She's not singing.

1357
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,900
Koko is nuts. She's so good!

1358
01:14:07,900 --> 01:14:09,740
Awesome!

1359
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:29,790
This is hard choreography.

1360
01:14:45,300 --> 01:14:46,890
What was that?

1361
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,290
They were great through the end.

1362
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:57,530
So cool.

1363
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,970
I got chills.

1364
01:14:58,970 --> 01:15:01,730
My gosh. I want to marry them.

1365
01:15:01,730 --> 01:15:04,570
Koko is amazing.

1366
01:15:04,570 --> 01:15:06,000
I think they'll all get in.

1367
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,650
So good.

1368
01:15:07,650 --> 01:15:09,170
- There are only two spots left.
- I know.

1369
01:15:09,170 --> 01:15:11,150
If they're all in, they're past the limit.

1370
01:15:11,150 --> 01:15:13,040
But there's one more team left.

1371
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,190
But that team is good, too.

1372
01:15:15,190 --> 01:15:18,630
I think all three will get in.

1373
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:21,690
Koko, as for you...

1374
01:15:21,690 --> 01:15:27,610
When you speak, I can tell you're not a fluent Korean speaker.

1375
01:15:27,610 --> 01:15:31,830
But when you sing and rap, I can't tell.

1376
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:32,820
I agree.

1377
01:15:32,820 --> 01:15:36,030
(Contestant Koko performs rap in perfect Korean)

1378
01:15:36,030 --> 01:15:40,610
I could tell how hard you worked on it.

1379
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,020
Thank you.

1380
01:15:42,020 --> 01:15:45,080
Yui, you too. When you rapped in Korean,

1381
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:49,560
I didn't hear any flaws. You did a great job.

1382
01:15:49,560 --> 01:15:52,710
But maybe you exerted too much energy in the beginning.

1383
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:55,170
Toward the end, you were out of breath.

1384
01:15:55,170 --> 01:15:57,980
It looked like you were tired.

1385
01:15:57,980 --> 01:16:03,300
(Contestant Yui couldn't quite carry her energy through the end)

1386
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,330
I think you have some room to improve there.

1387
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:13,050
To be honest, the performance itself wasn't all that great.

1388
01:16:13,050 --> 01:16:17,510
(Unexpected harsh criticism from Producer 24)

1389
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:21,990
I felt like the song was misinterpreted.

1390
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:25,320
It should look like your bodies are so used to the movement that

1391
01:16:25,320 --> 01:16:27,880
you look cool while even half-assing it.

1392
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,580
But I didn't feel that here.

1393
01:16:30,580 --> 01:16:32,570
That's harsh.

1394
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:34,410
Yuju.

1395
01:16:34,410 --> 01:16:38,020
When you have a part, you need to commit to it more.

1396
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:40,460
(Contestant Nam Yuju didn't sing for some parts of the song)

1397
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,130
She's not singing.

1398
01:16:42,130 --> 01:16:43,410
Yes.

1399
01:16:43,410 --> 01:16:45,630
What a twist.

1400
01:16:45,630 --> 01:16:47,580
Their criteria is completely different.

1401
01:16:47,580 --> 01:16:50,230
They look from a different perspective.

1402
01:16:50,230 --> 01:16:53,260
I thought they did amazing.

1403
01:16:54,370 --> 01:16:56,410
Good job.

1404
01:16:56,410 --> 01:16:58,230
This is so disappointing.

1405
01:16:58,230 --> 01:17:00,250
The title is "Baggy Jeans."

1406
01:17:00,250 --> 01:17:02,730
You need to be cocky.

1407
01:17:02,730 --> 01:17:04,530
They weren't cocky at all.

1408
01:17:04,530 --> 01:17:09,000
I felt their enthusiasm as if they wanted to do something.

1409
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:12,250
But they didn't really own it.

1410
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:16,760
It can be a disadvantage to have such high expectations of you.

1411
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:18,170
Right.

1412
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:23,290
The feedback wasn't as good as I thought.

1413
01:17:23,290 --> 01:17:25,640
I wonder what will happen.

1414
01:17:25,640 --> 01:17:27,860
Contestant Yui.

1415
01:17:32,480 --> 01:17:34,500
I can't tell what's going to happen.

1416
01:17:35,520 --> 01:17:36,920
She's in.

1417
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,700
She did well.

1418
01:17:40,040 --> 01:17:41,250
What?

1419
01:17:41,250 --> 01:17:45,440
(She needs one more vote to get in)

1420
01:17:45,440 --> 01:17:49,070
I was scared and nervous.

1421
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:57,390
I-LAND in.

1422
01:17:57,390 --> 01:17:58,660
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1423
01:17:58,660 --> 01:18:01,090
Their standards are high.

1424
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:03,330
That's a twist on a twist.

1425
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:06,520
- You really can't tell what will happen.
- Right.

1426
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:09,460
There's one spot left.

1427
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:10,980
My I-LAND.

1428
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:12,920
Contestant Koko.

1429
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:14,920
(Nervous)

1430
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:19,210
ALL I.

1431
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:24,530
(With three votes, I-LAND in)

1432
01:18:25,850 --> 01:18:28,860
(But no vote from the performance directors)

1433
01:18:29,430 --> 01:18:31,770
I-LAND in.

1434
01:18:33,470 --> 01:18:35,400
Everyone barely got in.

1435
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:37,490
That's unexpected.

1436
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:41,680
The two of us didn't vote for her.

1437
01:18:41,680 --> 01:18:43,520
I think we had high expectations as dancers.

1438
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,790
Maybe.

1439
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:48,580
As Taeyang said earlier, her pronunciation is different when she raps.

1440
01:18:48,580 --> 01:18:51,300
- That's really hard.
- Right.

1441
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,610
It's full.

1442
01:18:54,610 --> 01:18:55,850
It's 12 people.

1443
01:18:55,850 --> 01:18:57,150
I'm scared now.

1444
01:18:57,150 --> 01:18:58,460
What now?

1445
01:18:58,460 --> 01:19:00,840
Contestant Nam Yuju.

1446
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:03,850
Oh, no.

1447
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:05,040
Must be nerve-wracking.

1448
01:19:05,040 --> 01:19:06,970
But she couldn't sing.

1449
01:19:06,970 --> 01:19:09,160
Not at all.

1450
01:19:09,160 --> 01:19:12,950
I don't doubt my skills at all.

1451
01:19:21,130 --> 01:19:22,270
She's in.

1452
01:19:22,270 --> 01:19:24,180
She's going.

1453
01:19:28,890 --> 01:19:31,440
I think Leejung would have voted for her.

1454
01:19:32,510 --> 01:19:34,980
(What are the results for contestant Nam Yuju?)

1455
01:19:45,090 --> 01:19:47,170
(Nam Yuju with a GROUND sticker)

1456
01:19:47,170 --> 01:19:51,120
I feel like my four years of training were nothing.

1457
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:55,290
It made me think, "What have I done until now?"

1458
01:19:55,290 --> 01:19:59,030
I feel like I'm not getting recognized.

1459
01:19:59,030 --> 01:20:01,030
I'm upset at myself,

1460
01:20:01,030 --> 01:20:04,490
and it really hurt my pride.

1461
01:20:04,490 --> 01:20:06,620
Unbelievable.

1462
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:09,540
The bar just got so high.

1463
01:20:09,540 --> 01:20:12,050
I think luck is important, too.

1464
01:20:12,050 --> 01:20:16,540
I don't know why three people from that unit got in.

1465
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:21,410
Producers might see it differently.

1466
01:20:21,410 --> 01:20:24,270
Yuju is someone who's pretty good at everything

1467
01:20:24,270 --> 01:20:27,230
but she doesn't have a special weapon.

1468
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:31,330
I wish she could really break through with something.

1469
01:20:31,330 --> 01:20:33,210
That's where she fell short.

1470
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:38,140
Compared to the previous unit, all three of them did a good job.

1471
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,550
They picked a hard song, too.

1472
01:20:39,550 --> 01:20:45,970
But I sent her to GROUND in hopes that she would execute hard songs like this.

1473
01:20:47,690 --> 01:20:49,170
(I-LAND is now full)

1474
01:20:49,170 --> 01:20:51,420
Suddenly, I can't predict a thing.

1475
01:20:51,420 --> 01:20:54,050
There's one last unit left.

1476
01:20:54,050 --> 01:20:55,940
We got this.

1477
01:20:55,940 --> 01:20:56,940
Avengers.

1478
01:20:56,940 --> 01:20:59,940
The last unit is the Avengers.

1479
01:20:59,940 --> 01:21:03,600
(The entrance test of the last unit.)

1480
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:05,680
Wow!

1481
01:21:05,680 --> 01:21:07,460
What a starry lineup.

1482
01:21:07,460 --> 01:21:10,840
Everyone in this unit feels mature,

1483
01:21:10,840 --> 01:21:12,490
and quite sexy.

1484
01:21:12,490 --> 01:21:14,560
Contestant Mai.

1485
01:21:14,560 --> 01:21:19,260
She has a face that's very trendy right now.

1486
01:21:19,260 --> 01:21:20,500
She stands out.

1487
01:21:20,500 --> 01:21:22,760
She looks like a pretty robot.

1488
01:21:22,760 --> 01:21:25,430
- You know what's amazing?
- What?

1489
01:21:25,430 --> 01:21:29,160
Choi Jungeun ranked first among 24 participants.

1490
01:21:29,160 --> 01:21:31,570
She ranked first the most on monthly evaluations.

1491
01:21:31,570 --> 01:21:34,230
It means it wasn't luck.

1492
01:21:34,230 --> 01:21:36,140
She has talent.

1493
01:21:36,140 --> 01:21:37,650
(Another talent in the 6th unit)

1494
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:41,980
(Yoon Jiyoon, who has a unique voice)

1495
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:47,180
I think I have a very unique voice that the other contestants don't have.

1496
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:51,710
I'll do my best to express myself.

1497
01:21:51,710 --> 01:21:55,300
Their average self-evaluation rank is the highest as well.

1498
01:21:55,300 --> 01:21:56,720
Right.

1499
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:58,240
They're top 10.

1500
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:00,300
This unit is made of aces.

1501
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:01,520
What are they performing?

1502
01:22:01,520 --> 01:22:03,730
"Drama" by aespa.

1503
01:22:06,900 --> 01:22:08,580
This song has high notes,

1504
01:22:08,580 --> 01:22:10,830
but requires other fancy techniques as well.

1505
01:22:10,830 --> 01:22:12,180
If they can do it,

1506
01:22:12,180 --> 01:22:16,570
it'll be a chance for them to show off their capacity for singing.

1507
01:22:16,570 --> 01:22:18,060
The dance isn't easy, either.

1508
01:22:18,060 --> 01:22:21,990
It's impactful not because it's loose but because it's powerful.

1509
01:22:21,990 --> 01:22:24,280
If they do well, it'll be a hit.

1510
01:22:24,280 --> 01:22:26,510
If not, it'll be a real mess.

1511
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:28,270
I can't wait to see it.

1512
01:22:28,270 --> 01:22:30,250
I'm really excited to see it.

1513
01:22:30,250 --> 01:22:31,940
So pretty.

1514
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,650
Their silhouettes are gorgeous.

1515
01:22:33,650 --> 01:22:35,810
Not fair.

1516
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,540
Wow, the vibes.

1517
01:22:37,540 --> 01:22:39,670
They're all so talented.

1518
01:22:39,670 --> 01:22:42,710
They'll be the unit where everyone goes to I-LAND.

1519
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:45,270
Unit "Drama" is called the Avengers.

1520
01:22:45,270 --> 01:22:48,720
They have Jungeun, who ranked first in the self-evaluations.

1521
01:22:48,720 --> 01:22:52,380
They have Jeemin, who was on "R U NEXT?"

1522
01:22:52,380 --> 01:22:58,430
I'm excited to see what kind of show they've prepared.

1523
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:00,440
She has such an attractive face.

1524
01:23:00,440 --> 01:23:01,720
They look like a group.

1525
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:03,800
Don't they already look like a real group?

1526
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:06,060
Standby.

1527
01:23:06,060 --> 01:23:07,330
Fighting!

1528
01:23:07,330 --> 01:23:08,600
I can't wait.

1529
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,500
I'm so excited right now.

1530
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:14,940
The fact that they have the number one makes me excited.

1531
01:23:14,940 --> 01:23:16,850
Awesome.

1532
01:23:16,850 --> 01:23:18,050
I'm so excited!

1533
01:23:18,050 --> 01:23:20,090
So pretty.

1534
01:23:20,090 --> 01:23:22,550
She's like a princess.

1535
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:25,610
Her skin is luminous, and she's so tall.

1536
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:33,660
- What?
- Daebak.

1537
01:23:33,660 --> 01:23:35,080
So cool.

1538
01:23:35,080 --> 01:23:36,490
So cool.

1539
01:23:36,490 --> 01:23:38,880
("Drama," originally sung by aespa)

1540
01:24:24,950 --> 01:24:26,950
They're so good!

1541
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,750
Wow.

1542
01:24:48,150 --> 01:24:49,900
So good.

1543
01:25:48,030 --> 01:25:50,630
Yoon Jiyoon, you're crazy!

1544
01:26:18,870 --> 01:26:19,860
So pretty.

1545
01:26:19,860 --> 01:26:21,970
So good.

1546
01:26:21,970 --> 01:26:24,930
They're basically idols that just debuted.

1547
01:26:27,210 --> 01:26:28,540
They tore it up.

1548
01:26:28,540 --> 01:26:30,560
Jungeun is such a good singer.

1549
01:26:30,560 --> 01:26:32,630
They're all-rounders.

1550
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:34,020
Look at Mai.

1551
01:26:34,020 --> 01:26:37,830
I wish I could have her face for a day.

1552
01:26:37,830 --> 01:26:38,980
Seriously.

1553
01:26:38,980 --> 01:26:39,980
I think all four of them...

1554
01:26:39,980 --> 01:26:41,400
The test is complete.

1555
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,520
are going to get ALL I.

1556
01:26:44,650 --> 01:26:47,990
But what happens if they all get it? That's 16 people.

1557
01:26:49,010 --> 01:26:51,550
Good job.

1558
01:26:51,550 --> 01:26:52,940
Oh, my.

1559
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:55,030
It's nerve-wracking here.

1560
01:26:55,030 --> 01:26:56,970
I'm so curious about the feedback.

1561
01:26:56,970 --> 01:27:02,140
This unit has contestants with high rankings from self-evaluations.

1562
01:27:02,140 --> 01:27:04,920
Choi Jungeun, you came in first.

1563
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,330
That's actually poison for you all.

1564
01:27:08,330 --> 01:27:11,520
We have high standards for you.

1565
01:27:11,520 --> 01:27:16,130
I think the fact that you were ranked first...

1566
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:18,620
Since the bar is so high,

1567
01:27:18,620 --> 01:27:22,470
I'm nervous about what kind of feedback I'm going to get.

1568
01:27:22,470 --> 01:27:24,810
was proven by the performance.

1569
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,900
Thank you.

1570
01:27:25,900 --> 01:27:29,410
As the main vocalist, you were the center of the music.

1571
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:33,540
You easily disproved the concern that if you sing well, you can't dance well.

1572
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:36,000
Your sense of balance in your movement is great.

1573
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:37,370
Thank you.

1574
01:27:37,370 --> 01:27:38,840
And Mai.

1575
01:27:38,840 --> 01:27:42,380
I had some assumptions about you because of your appearance.

1576
01:27:42,380 --> 01:27:45,900
I thought you would play it coy, but...

1577
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:48,840
you started off with such tough energy.

1578
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:53,050
(Mai showed off her unexpected charms at the start of the song)

1579
01:27:54,860 --> 01:27:56,280
I was enchanted.

1580
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,850
Thank you.

1581
01:27:57,850 --> 01:27:59,930
It was fantastic.

1582
01:27:59,930 --> 01:28:03,140
Contestant Bang Jeemin.

1583
01:28:03,140 --> 01:28:04,740
This is what I would say to you.

1584
01:28:04,740 --> 01:28:06,600
You are ready.

1585
01:28:06,600 --> 01:28:09,460
You ranked high in your previous survival programs

1586
01:28:09,460 --> 01:28:11,740
but you didn't have much luck.

1587
01:28:11,740 --> 01:28:13,700
But that was all you lacked.

1588
01:28:13,700 --> 01:28:17,680
Here, I can tell how much work you've put in.

1589
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,140
Thank you.

1590
01:28:19,140 --> 01:28:21,260
The overall performance was really great

1591
01:28:21,260 --> 01:28:24,970
and it felt very complete.

1592
01:28:24,970 --> 01:28:29,360
Yoon Jiyoon, you have such a unique voice.

1593
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:33,800
But I felt like you weren't fully owning it.

1594
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:36,960
(Taeyang felt that Yoon Jiyoon did not own her performance)

1595
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:38,980
You can trust yourself more.

1596
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:47,100
Think about how you can truly deliver your unique voice.

1597
01:28:48,210 --> 01:28:49,500
What's going to happen?

1598
01:28:49,500 --> 01:28:51,660
Maybe all four will get ALL I.

1599
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,250
I think so, too.

1600
01:28:53,250 --> 01:28:55,360
(How will the producers judge the sixth unit?)

1601
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:57,320
Please reveal it now.

1602
01:28:57,320 --> 01:29:00,260
(Contestant Bang Jeemin)

1603
01:29:00,260 --> 01:29:01,760
(Nervous)

1604
01:29:03,620 --> 01:29:05,240
I think she'll get all five votes.

1605
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:07,250
ALL I.

1606
01:29:09,350 --> 01:29:11,100
(Bang Jeemin got excellent feedback from the producers)

1607
01:29:11,100 --> 01:29:16,050
Here, I can tell how much work you've put in.

1608
01:29:17,950 --> 01:29:20,990
(With three votes, I-LAND in)

1609
01:29:22,850 --> 01:29:24,170
(Can she get ALL I?)

1610
01:29:24,170 --> 01:29:26,500
ALL I.

1611
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:30,120
(Bang Jeemin in with ALL I)

1612
01:29:30,120 --> 01:29:31,960
I-LAND in.

1613
01:29:31,960 --> 01:29:34,070
Thank you.

1614
01:29:36,050 --> 01:29:38,130
The stars poured out.

1615
01:29:38,130 --> 01:29:41,800
I felt like those stars were welcoming me to I-LAND.

1616
01:29:41,800 --> 01:29:47,770
I was worried, but I felt proud and happy.

1617
01:29:47,770 --> 01:29:49,780
(5 Weeks Later)

1618
01:29:51,230 --> 01:29:55,330
Things that Bang Jeemin has shown so far...

1619
01:29:55,330 --> 01:29:58,800
She's really good but...

1620
01:29:58,800 --> 01:30:01,880
You fell short.

1621
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:03,910
Good job.

1622
01:30:09,360 --> 01:30:11,760
How will they pick a dropout?

1623
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:12,940
(1 over I-LAND capacity)

1624
01:30:12,940 --> 01:30:14,080
It's red.

1625
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:16,780
It suddenly turned into a horror show.

1626
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:21,800
- I hate this.
- Is someone being dropped?

1627
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:24,640
There's more tension with the excess.

1628
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:26,610
It turned red.

1629
01:30:26,610 --> 01:30:28,840
Contestant Mai.

1630
01:30:31,570 --> 01:30:33,020
I think it's ALL I.

1631
01:30:33,020 --> 01:30:35,520
ALL I.

1632
01:30:37,230 --> 01:30:39,400
(Taeyang / Monika / LeeJung)

1633
01:30:41,580 --> 01:30:43,280
I think she'll get in, at least.

1634
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:45,220
Not ALL I?

1635
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:51,870
I-LAND in.

1636
01:30:51,870 --> 01:30:53,970
Thank you.
(Mai I-LAND in)

1637
01:30:56,500 --> 01:30:57,960
(2 over I-LAND capacity)

1638
01:30:59,000 --> 01:31:02,210
Oh, no, I don't want to remove this sticker.

1639
01:31:02,210 --> 01:31:03,400
It's not easy.

1640
01:31:03,400 --> 01:31:05,690
I can't remove my I.

1641
01:31:05,690 --> 01:31:07,490
I will never be removed.

1642
01:31:07,490 --> 01:31:09,930
Contestant Yoon Jiyoon.

1643
01:31:11,770 --> 01:31:13,510
ALL I.

1644
01:31:13,510 --> 01:31:16,840
I'm confident I can get into I-LAND.

1645
01:31:17,940 --> 01:31:20,490
I knew it.

1646
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:24,440
(Yoon Jiyoon in with 4-I)

1647
01:31:24,440 --> 01:31:26,200
I-LAND in.

1648
01:31:26,200 --> 01:31:27,790
Really,

1649
01:31:27,790 --> 01:31:29,960
I knew they'll all get in.

1650
01:31:29,960 --> 01:31:32,390
I think the members of this unit

1651
01:31:32,390 --> 01:31:34,600
were set to get ALL I.

1652
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:36,700
Their goal is different.

1653
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:39,130
It's not to enter I-LAND

1654
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:41,280
but to get ALL I.

1655
01:31:41,280 --> 01:31:42,450
They can only live with that.

1656
01:31:42,450 --> 01:31:44,220
Since they're ace unit.

1657
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:46,360
I think they'll all go to I-LAND.

1658
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:48,450
I think Jungeun will get ALL I.

1659
01:31:48,450 --> 01:31:50,890
Contestant Choi Jungeun.

1660
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:54,220
I'm sure Jungeun will get ALL I.

1661
01:31:54,220 --> 01:31:56,090
Of course.

1662
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:01,790
(Choi Jungeun in with ALL I)

1663
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:04,260
I-LAND in.

1664
01:32:05,310 --> 01:32:06,920
It's an ace unit, indeed.

1665
01:32:06,920 --> 01:32:08,660
They totally killed it.

1666
01:32:08,660 --> 01:32:11,440
Choi Jungeun especially.

1667
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:14,420
She said, 'Oh, my God,' and it was over.

1668
01:32:15,570 --> 01:32:19,370
The most suiting contestant for the first 3 seconds.

1669
01:32:19,370 --> 01:32:21,830
Whoa, they're all in.

1670
01:32:21,830 --> 01:32:24,010
We all got in.

1671
01:32:24,010 --> 01:32:26,480
We all did.

1672
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:30,210
All 4 of them went to I-LAND.

1673
01:32:30,210 --> 01:32:31,620
(3 over I-LAND capacity)

1674
01:32:32,610 --> 01:32:34,430
(4 over I-LAND capacity)

1675
01:32:34,430 --> 01:32:35,920
- 4 over?
- So many.

1676
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:36,970
So sad.

1677
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:40,090
Help me, NaSURI.

1678
01:32:40,090 --> 01:32:42,360
Protect me.

1679
01:32:42,360 --> 01:32:43,700
Good job.

1680
01:32:43,710 --> 01:32:45,670
(Everyone in the last unit gets in)

1681
01:32:45,670 --> 01:32:46,910
We did it.

1682
01:32:46,910 --> 01:32:50,090
Don't you think a big change is coming?

1683
01:32:50,090 --> 01:32:51,920
In terms of adjusting the 12.

1684
01:32:51,920 --> 01:32:55,210
The ones that got in first are frightened.

1685
01:32:55,210 --> 01:32:59,300
They might go to GROUND suddenly.

1686
01:32:59,300 --> 01:33:00,940
As the result of the entrance test,

1687
01:33:00,940 --> 01:33:05,550
the number of people who can go to I-LAND is 16.

1688
01:33:05,550 --> 01:33:07,420
Oh, my God.

1689
01:33:10,530 --> 01:33:12,480
The entrance test is completed.

1690
01:33:12,480 --> 01:33:15,720
(I-LAND can take 12 people, and the entrance test ended with 4 extra people)

1691
01:33:15,720 --> 01:33:20,210
Those who made it to I-LAND can now board META BALL.

1692
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:22,940
(META BALL booting back up to go to I-LAND)

1693
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:28,540
Now?

1694
01:33:28,540 --> 01:33:30,730
(16 people who passed the entrance test cannot easily get up from their seats)

1695
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:35,920
You're coming, right?

1696
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:37,770
I'll be waiting for you.

1697
01:33:37,770 --> 01:33:39,740
You did a great job.

1698
01:33:39,740 --> 01:33:41,800
Bye, Eunchae.

1699
01:33:41,800 --> 01:33:44,400
You have to come to I-LAND next time, okay?

1700
01:33:44,400 --> 01:33:45,560
Okay.

1701
01:33:45,560 --> 01:33:47,200
Take care.

1702
01:33:47,200 --> 01:33:50,130
(Those who passed get going)

1703
01:33:51,560 --> 01:33:53,710
I will definitely follow you.

1704
01:33:53,710 --> 01:33:57,580
(16 who passed the entrance test completed boarding META BALL)

1705
01:33:59,670 --> 01:34:02,240
(GROUNDER Nam Yuju can't hold back her tears anymore)

1706
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:03,960
It's okay.

1707
01:34:05,420 --> 01:34:09,380
(META BALL with quiet air)

1708
01:34:10,550 --> 01:34:12,540
What is this?

1709
01:34:14,230 --> 01:34:15,850
(Surprised by something)

1710
01:34:16,830 --> 01:34:18,320
(I-LAND's lobby is a bit different from the entrance)

1711
01:34:18,840 --> 01:34:19,840
(Only 12 chairs prepared for I-LANDERs)

1712
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,000
There are only 12 chairs.

1713
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,740
Only 12 people can survive.

1714
01:34:23,740 --> 01:34:26,630
We're going to do something.

1715
01:34:26,630 --> 01:34:30,640
(Entering the lobby nervously)

1716
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:32,840
What are those name tags?

1717
01:34:33,910 --> 01:34:35,470
(Name tags that only I-LANDERs can have)

1718
01:34:35,470 --> 01:34:38,760
It's gone up here, too. It's reset again.

1719
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:40,140
(Meanwhile, the remaining GROUNDERS)

1720
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:41,310
Let's do our best.

1721
01:34:41,310 --> 01:34:44,350
Let's work hard and go up to I-LAND together.

1722
01:34:44,350 --> 01:34:46,650
I don't know what the next test is, but let's do our best.

1723
01:34:46,650 --> 01:34:50,360
Get on META BALL and go to GROUND.

1724
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:51,780
Everyone, let's go.

1725
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:53,600
Let's go.

1726
01:34:53,600 --> 01:34:55,590
Let's go.

1727
01:34:55,590 --> 01:34:57,110
Let's go, Nana.

1728
01:34:57,110 --> 01:34:58,820
Chaeeun, aren't you cold?

1729
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:00,220
I'm hot.

1730
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:02,560
You're mad.

1731
01:35:03,500 --> 01:35:04,740
(The way to GROUND opens)

1732
01:35:04,740 --> 01:35:07,090
It's turning.

1733
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:11,600
It was dark.

1734
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:15,690
It was monochromatic, and there was nothing there.

1735
01:35:15,690 --> 01:35:18,240
- GROUND is cold.
- It's chilly here.

1736
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,120
I feel chilly too.

1737
01:35:20,950 --> 01:35:22,600
It's okay.

1738
01:35:24,270 --> 01:35:26,160
Okay!

1739
01:35:26,160 --> 01:35:28,840
(Heavy steps toward the GROUND)

1740
01:35:30,430 --> 01:35:34,220
The road to the GROUND was very empty.

1741
01:35:34,220 --> 01:35:37,630
I can see the difference more clearly because it's right next to I-LAND.

1742
01:35:37,630 --> 01:35:40,690
I think it made me feel smaller.

1743
01:35:40,690 --> 01:35:43,750
I felt empty.

1744
01:35:43,750 --> 01:35:46,630
There are three rules in I-LAND.

1745
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:47,750
What is it?

1746
01:35:47,750 --> 01:35:50,320
First, a common destiny.

1747
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,540
We share the same fate as a team, not as an individual.

1748
01:35:54,540 --> 01:35:56,570
With the team score...

1749
01:35:56,570 --> 01:35:58,760
Oh, I guess it's based on the team score.

1750
01:35:58,760 --> 01:36:04,120
Second, I-LANDERS decide everything on their own.

1751
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:06,530
What does that mean?

1752
01:36:06,530 --> 01:36:09,090
Are you saying that we decide who to let out of here?

1753
01:36:09,090 --> 01:36:11,020
That's what it is.

1754
01:36:11,020 --> 01:36:14,440
Something will happen on its own again.

1755
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:15,610
It was scary.

1756
01:36:15,610 --> 01:36:20,100
Third, I-LAND can have only 12 people.

1757
01:36:20,100 --> 01:36:24,770
There are 16 people here right now.

1758
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:30,460
From now on, to meet the I-LAND capacity, you'll start voting.

1759
01:36:30,460 --> 01:36:31,960
(Vote for survivors)

1760
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:33,830
I knew this would happen.

1761
01:36:33,830 --> 01:36:36,560
Okay, welcome to survival.

1762
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:40,600
The survivor vote is solely up to you.

1763
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:41,740
Our choice.

1764
01:36:41,740 --> 01:36:45,660
In the process of completing the ideal team you want,

1765
01:36:45,660 --> 01:36:48,900
you are given the privilege to

1766
01:36:48,900 --> 01:36:53,210
choose the member you want to be with.

1767
01:36:53,210 --> 01:36:56,080
(Survivor Vote: where they have to choose who they want to be with in I-LAND)

1768
01:36:56,790 --> 01:36:58,900
We're choosing who we want to work with, right?

1769
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:04,130
In Season 1, it was about choosing who to kick off.

1770
01:37:04,130 --> 01:37:09,310
Decide 4 dropouts by your own vote.

1771
01:37:09,310 --> 01:37:11,900
(In Season 1 of I-LAND, dropouts were decided through self-voting)

1772
01:37:11,900 --> 01:37:15,760
In Season 2, we get to choose who we want to

1773
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:17,340
be with, which was great.

1774
01:37:17,340 --> 01:37:22,390
Voting rights are given differently depending on the results of the entrance test.

1775
01:37:22,390 --> 01:37:23,550
I don't like that.

1776
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:26,740
Those who received 3-I will receive 3 votes.

1777
01:37:26,740 --> 01:37:29,700
Those who received 4-I will receive 4 votes.

1778
01:37:29,700 --> 01:37:32,930
Those who received 5-I will receive 5 votes.

1779
01:37:32,930 --> 01:37:34,950
Duplicate voting is not allowed.

1780
01:37:34,950 --> 01:37:37,850
You can also vote for yourself.

1781
01:37:37,850 --> 01:37:41,950
I have 3 votes, so I think I have to choose carefully.

1782
01:37:41,950 --> 01:37:47,110
I have a lot of voting rights, so it was nice that I didn't have to worry too much.

1783
01:37:52,550 --> 01:37:53,570
What?

1784
01:37:53,570 --> 01:37:58,020
However, the I-LANDER who placed first in the entrance test

1785
01:37:58,020 --> 01:38:01,560
will be granted a dropout exemption as a benefit.

1786
01:38:01,560 --> 01:38:03,040
It's a great privilege, isn't it?

1787
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:04,310
I'm jealous.

1788
01:38:04,310 --> 01:38:05,930
Let me announce the candidates.

1789
01:38:05,930 --> 01:38:08,800
After selecting applicants who received ALL I...

1790
01:38:08,800 --> 01:38:10,580
- Ryu Sarang.
- I think she had no competitors.

1791
01:38:10,580 --> 01:38:13,920
She was in the first unit, but I couldn't forget her until the end.

1792
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,790
I support Fuko.

1793
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:19,700
I think she has the best feeling, facial expressions, and delivery

1794
01:38:19,700 --> 01:38:22,200
for the image that comes to mind when you think of a girl group.

1795
01:38:22,200 --> 01:38:25,960
Choi Jungeun left the biggest impact of the first

1796
01:38:25,960 --> 01:38:28,970
three seconds that has been emphasized.

1797
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:33,350
The person who came in first in the entrance test to receive a dropout exemption.

1798
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:37,450
Choi Jungeun.

1799
01:38:37,450 --> 01:38:39,210
Choi Jungeun.

1800
01:38:39,210 --> 01:38:41,470
(Choi Jungeun became the first I-LANDER by winning first place in the entrance test)

1801
01:38:41,470 --> 01:38:44,320
Because she has so many things in finished form,

1802
01:38:44,320 --> 01:38:47,330
I believe that her possibilities are endless.

1803
01:38:47,330 --> 01:38:52,240
I think she created a lot of killer highlight moments.

1804
01:38:52,240 --> 01:38:56,110
It is fair that the one who showcases the most breadth gets first place.

1805
01:38:56,110 --> 01:38:58,450
Thank you.

1806
01:38:58,450 --> 01:39:02,490
Lately, my confidence kept getting low,

1807
01:39:02,490 --> 01:39:05,820
and I felt like I couldn't trust my skills.

1808
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:08,840
I felt I was actually doing well.

1809
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,330
So, I'm going to try to be more confident.

1810
01:39:12,330 --> 01:39:18,820
I-LANDER Choi Jungeun, put your name tag on the chair you want.

1811
01:39:18,820 --> 01:39:20,090
Really? Now?

1812
01:39:20,090 --> 01:39:22,080
Right now!

1813
01:39:22,080 --> 01:39:24,450
The first I-LANDER.

1814
01:39:27,450 --> 01:39:29,470
I'll put it on here.

1815
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:30,920
Come here.

1816
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,290
Congratulations, confirmed I-LANDER.

1817
01:39:34,290 --> 01:39:35,590
(First I-LANDER Choi Jungeun)

1818
01:39:36,140 --> 01:39:39,400
(Choi Jungeun, the first to be named on I-LAND insignia)

1819
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,840
It has been reduced to eleven seats.

1820
01:39:41,840 --> 01:39:45,980
Voting will take place in 30 minutes.

1821
01:39:50,050 --> 01:39:52,320
Everyone, move to the second floor.

1822
01:39:52,320 --> 01:39:53,600
Second floor?

1823
01:39:53,600 --> 01:39:55,750
- Let's check it out.
- I love it.

1824
01:39:55,750 --> 01:39:58,650
I'm so curious. Thank you.

1825
01:39:58,650 --> 01:40:01,510
It's NaSURI!

1826
01:40:01,510 --> 01:40:02,750
NaSURI welcomed us.

1827
01:40:02,750 --> 01:40:04,210
NaSURI has feet?

1828
01:40:04,210 --> 01:40:07,640
I heard NaSURI has hands, too.

1829
01:40:07,640 --> 01:40:09,600
It's so pretty.

1830
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:13,000
(A lovely and bright residential space)

1831
01:40:13,460 --> 01:40:16,560
(I-LAND with everything ready for optimal training)

1832
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:20,740
Wow, what's that?

1833
01:40:20,740 --> 01:40:22,080
(Where did they visit first?)

1834
01:40:22,740 --> 01:40:25,920
(The item room with bright training uniforms)

1835
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:31,170
(and various clothing items for I-LANDERS)

1836
01:40:31,170 --> 01:40:33,400
Wow, this is so pretty.

1837
01:40:33,400 --> 01:40:36,060
It's totally mine. Oh, no.

1838
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,450
(This is mine)

1839
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:43,730
(This place makes I-LANDERS' hearts flutter)

1840
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:45,530
(Of course, a pantry for hydration and)

1841
01:40:45,870 --> 01:40:48,230
(replenishing energy during practice at any time)

1842
01:40:48,230 --> 01:40:49,240
(Pantry)

1843
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:51,430
- It's chicken breast.
- I want to live here.

1844
01:40:51,430 --> 01:40:53,030
There's a dried laver.

1845
01:40:53,030 --> 01:40:55,300
Can I eat it now?

1846
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:58,260
We're not I-LANDERS, yet.

1847
01:40:58,260 --> 01:40:59,580
Everyone, this place is amazing!

1848
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:01,190
The bed is awesome!

1849
01:41:01,190 --> 01:41:02,880
(Happy)

1850
01:41:02,880 --> 01:41:04,800
Come here.

1851
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,720
It's crazy.

1852
01:41:08,760 --> 01:41:10,370
Oh, my gosh!

1853
01:41:10,370 --> 01:41:15,330
(Space responsible for comfortable rest and healthy sleep)

1854
01:41:16,560 --> 01:41:22,570
(I-LAND bedroom with a dressing table full of beauty items)

1855
01:41:22,570 --> 01:41:25,660
(Candy Room / Cotton Candy Room / Ice Cream Room)

1856
01:41:25,660 --> 01:41:27,490
(Candy Room)

1857
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,370
(Am I allowed to be this happy?)

1858
01:41:31,110 --> 01:41:33,010
It has all the cosmetics.

1859
01:41:33,010 --> 01:41:35,260
(I didn't know what you'd like, so I prepared everything!)

1860
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,120
What's this!

1861
01:41:41,060 --> 01:41:42,850
It's so nice.

1862
01:41:42,850 --> 01:41:44,700
I really want to live here.

1863
01:41:44,700 --> 01:41:46,930
- It's a luxury.
- Can't we all live together here?

1864
01:41:46,930 --> 01:41:50,260
I really want to sleep here.

1865
01:41:50,260 --> 01:41:52,190
Yeah, this is it. This is it.

1866
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:55,100
(Stretching room in charge of physical fitness)

1867
01:41:57,230 --> 01:41:58,910
Oh, it's fun! It's fun!

1868
01:41:58,910 --> 01:42:02,100
(Photo booth to record memories from I-LAND)

1869
01:42:02,100 --> 01:42:04,380
(Smile)

1870
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:07,270
(#First_time_in_I-LAND / #Must_survive_in_I-LAND! / #May_this_happiness_last_forever)

1871
01:42:07,990 --> 01:42:11,030
I was surprised because it was so fancy.

1872
01:42:11,030 --> 01:42:12,410
I kind of regretted seeing it.

1873
01:42:12,410 --> 01:42:15,130
If I fall to the GROUND,

1874
01:42:15,130 --> 01:42:17,020
I would be so sad.

1875
01:42:17,020 --> 01:42:18,420
(GROUND)

1876
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,310
Oh, what is it?

1877
01:42:22,310 --> 01:42:24,550
(GROUND, the dropouts' space where GROUNDERS will live in the future)

1878
01:42:25,200 --> 01:42:29,690
(Space for dropouts who must constantly prove themselves to get to I-LAND)

1879
01:42:29,690 --> 01:42:32,630
It's dark. A practice room with only mirrors.

1880
01:42:32,630 --> 01:42:37,550
I was just upset because it was really just a practice space.

1881
01:42:37,550 --> 01:42:39,750
Guys, I don't think it's really that bad.

1882
01:42:39,750 --> 01:42:41,070
But I think I-LAND would be better.

1883
01:42:41,070 --> 01:42:44,970
- It's not bad.
- So, I'm going to I-LAND.

1884
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:46,960
(Checking it out)

1885
01:42:46,960 --> 01:42:50,830
First of all, I was most shocked by the color.

1886
01:42:50,830 --> 01:42:53,340
It was my worst personal color.

1887
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:57,260
I thought I had to get out as soon as possible.

1888
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:04,460
This is the GROUND.

1889
01:43:04,460 --> 01:43:08,890
GROUND is a place where those released from I-LAND gather.

1890
01:43:08,890 --> 01:43:12,090
As long as you're here, there is no chance for a debut.

1891
01:43:12,090 --> 01:43:14,580
That's too harsh.

1892
01:43:14,580 --> 01:43:17,060
I'm going to I-LAND.

1893
01:43:17,060 --> 01:43:22,600
Only when a dropout occurs in I-LAND, you'll be given a chance to go to I-LAND.

1894
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:24,230
We'll take a spot for ourselves.

1895
01:43:24,230 --> 01:43:25,760
I really liked it.

1896
01:43:25,760 --> 01:43:29,060
I'm going to step on them and go up one by one.

1897
01:43:29,060 --> 01:43:30,090
(I-LAND)

1898
01:43:30,090 --> 01:43:32,120
12 people.

1899
01:43:32,120 --> 01:43:34,310
(I-LAND can take only 12 people)

1900
01:43:34,900 --> 01:43:36,320
(A tense atmosphere ahead)

1901
01:43:36,320 --> 01:43:38,700
(of the preliminary I-LANDER vote)

1902
01:43:39,350 --> 01:43:41,330
Who should I vote for?

1903
01:43:41,330 --> 01:43:43,850
I think it was a bit scary.

1904
01:43:43,850 --> 01:43:47,220
Everyone had a lot of thoughts.

1905
01:43:47,220 --> 01:43:49,250
The atmosphere was fierce.

1906
01:43:49,250 --> 01:43:51,130
It's scary.

1907
01:43:52,270 --> 01:43:54,560
I'm good at washing dishes.

1908
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:56,200
I'm good at organizing a room.

1909
01:43:56,200 --> 01:43:57,280
I'm really good at cleaning.

1910
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,730
I'm good at everything you ask me to do.

1911
01:43:58,730 --> 01:44:01,600
I'm really good at cooking.

1912
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:04,060
(Time to appeal for survival voting)

1913
01:44:04,320 --> 01:44:07,420
(Bang Jeemin is full of worries amidst this cheerful atmosphere)

1914
01:44:07,420 --> 01:44:12,610
There were a lot of us who trained together for a long time.

1915
01:44:12,610 --> 01:44:17,630
If I choose those I want to be with, can I become an I-LANDER here?

1916
01:44:17,630 --> 01:44:20,250
I was worried.

1917
01:44:21,630 --> 01:44:24,380
Because I feel the most comfortable with her,

1918
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:26,050
and we're close friends.

1919
01:44:26,050 --> 01:44:27,260
Fuko.

1920
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:29,290
- Fuko.
- Fuko.

1921
01:44:29,290 --> 01:44:30,440
Fuko.

1922
01:44:30,440 --> 01:44:32,820
I like her.

1923
01:44:32,820 --> 01:44:36,510
I feel so comfortable when I'm with Fuko.

1924
01:44:36,510 --> 01:44:40,400
I want to be with her because she's someone I want to lean on.

1925
01:44:40,400 --> 01:44:42,710
Because we don't know the next mission.

1926
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:45,100
Isn't it I-LANDERS versus GROUNDERS?

1927
01:44:45,100 --> 01:44:48,980
We must choose members who can win unconditionally.

1928
01:44:48,980 --> 01:44:50,990
That's right.

1929
01:44:52,500 --> 01:44:55,470
I really want to do it with Minsol...

1930
01:44:56,810 --> 01:44:59,310
who was in the same unit.

1931
01:44:59,310 --> 01:45:03,160
Since team balance is important,

1932
01:45:03,160 --> 01:45:05,280
it's a bit of a concern.

1933
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:07,940
Voting is no joke.

1934
01:45:07,940 --> 01:45:09,300
Really.

1935
01:45:09,300 --> 01:45:12,070
It's dangerous if the same unit doesn't pick me.

1936
01:45:12,070 --> 01:45:13,960
Yes, right.

1937
01:45:16,020 --> 01:45:18,220
One minute before voting.

1938
01:45:18,220 --> 01:45:19,550
I don't think I can be an I-LANDER.

1939
01:45:19,550 --> 01:45:21,130
There's no such thing.

1940
01:45:21,130 --> 01:45:23,460
Just believe that it will work.

1941
01:45:23,460 --> 01:45:25,070
I can't choose.

1942
01:45:25,070 --> 01:45:27,470
I don't know what to do.

1943
01:45:33,370 --> 01:45:34,550
(Countdown ends)

1944
01:45:34,550 --> 01:45:36,710
Countdown ends.

1945
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:39,710
Voting starts now.

1946
01:45:39,710 --> 01:45:41,490
(Survivor voting begins)

1947
01:45:41,490 --> 01:45:44,710
Kim Minsol, please go to the room of choice.

1948
01:45:44,710 --> 01:45:46,610
Am I the first one?

1949
01:45:47,850 --> 01:45:49,510
Have a safe trip.

1950
01:45:49,510 --> 01:45:51,650
Everyone, remember me. I'm Kim Minsol.

1951
01:45:51,650 --> 01:45:54,190
Watch your step.

1952
01:45:56,180 --> 01:45:59,460
I think the result will be very different from expectation.

1953
01:45:59,460 --> 01:46:01,450
Oh, my.

1954
01:46:02,400 --> 01:46:05,500
My 24-person self-evaluation ranking was 12th.

1955
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,710
If I take one step down, I'll fall to the GROUND.

1956
01:46:08,710 --> 01:46:11,710
I was very nervous.

1957
01:46:11,710 --> 01:46:14,410
(Room of choice, a space where I-LANDERS choose their own destiny)

1958
01:46:14,410 --> 01:46:15,720
(Results from the entrance evaluation by producers)

1959
01:46:18,290 --> 01:46:24,510
There were 5 people with 3-I.

1960
01:46:24,510 --> 01:46:27,890
Depending on who you vote for,

1961
01:46:27,890 --> 01:46:30,110
our fate will also change.

1962
01:46:30,110 --> 01:46:33,460
I felt a sense of responsibility.

1963
01:46:33,460 --> 01:46:35,610
What should I do?

1964
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:39,150
I really don't know.

1965
01:46:39,150 --> 01:46:43,760
(Who will survive in I-LAND?)

1966
01:46:46,580 --> 01:46:49,210
(Voting is complete / To be continued shortly)

1967
01:46:49,210 --> 01:46:55,130
Finally, the voting to select 12 people for I-LAND has been completed.

1968
01:46:55,130 --> 01:46:58,620
It was solely your choice.

1969
01:46:58,620 --> 01:47:02,240
Those who are selected get to enjoy I-LAND.

1970
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:07,870
And unfortunately, those who are not selected must leave for the GROUND.

1971
01:47:07,870 --> 01:47:12,500
Who will remain safely on I-LAND?

1972
01:47:13,520 --> 01:47:18,840
Your choices decided 12 I-LANDERS.

1973
01:47:19,890 --> 01:47:21,460
Oh, my gosh.

1974
01:47:21,460 --> 01:47:24,190
I really want to stay here.

1975
01:47:24,190 --> 01:47:27,700
- Here are 11 people who survived after voting.
- Please.

1976
01:47:27,700 --> 01:47:29,740
The second I-LANDER

1977
01:47:29,740 --> 01:47:31,450
received 9 votes.

1978
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,400
That's a lot.

1979
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:36,880
(Who's the second I-LANDER?)

1980
01:47:36,880 --> 01:47:38,420
(Desperate)

1981
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:43,130
(Bang Jeemin)

1982
01:47:43,130 --> 01:47:45,340
(The second I-LANDER is Bang Jeemin)

1983
01:47:47,380 --> 01:47:49,810
Thank you.

1984
01:47:49,810 --> 01:47:52,450
I voted for her because

1985
01:47:52,450 --> 01:47:56,240
she'd pull off any missions.

1986
01:47:56,240 --> 01:48:01,170
I couldn't believe it. There are many candidates who believe in me.

1987
01:48:01,170 --> 01:48:03,920
I decided to try harder.

1988
01:48:03,920 --> 01:48:05,810
The third I-LANDER

1989
01:48:05,810 --> 01:48:08,130
received 7 votes.

1990
01:48:09,230 --> 01:48:10,880
Fuko.

1991
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,660
(The third I-LANDER is Fuko)

1992
01:48:12,660 --> 01:48:13,660
I'm relieved.

1993
01:48:13,660 --> 01:48:15,880
The next I-LANDER

1994
01:48:17,380 --> 01:48:18,470
received 6 votes. Mai.

1995
01:48:18,470 --> 01:48:19,880
Mai.

1996
01:48:19,880 --> 01:48:22,420
- Ryu Sarang.
- Thank you!

1997
01:48:22,420 --> 01:48:24,220
Jeong Saebi.

1998
01:48:24,220 --> 01:48:26,060
Thank you.

1999
01:48:27,330 --> 01:48:28,670
(Ryu Sarang)

2000
01:48:28,670 --> 01:48:30,430
(Jeong Saebi)

2001
01:48:31,020 --> 01:48:34,690
The seventh I-LANDER received 5 votes.

2002
01:48:34,690 --> 01:48:36,130
I voted for her because she's a good dancer,

2003
01:48:36,130 --> 01:48:38,150
and she's also a good vocalist,

2004
01:48:38,150 --> 01:48:39,540
second to none.

2005
01:48:39,540 --> 01:48:40,850
(Kim Sunjung, 5-I / Son Juwon, 4-I / Kim Gyuri, 5-I / Yoon Jiyoon, 4-I)

2006
01:48:40,850 --> 01:48:42,240
(Kim Sunjung, 5-I / Son Juwon, 4-I / Kim Gyuri, 5-I / Yoon Jiyoon, 4-I)

2007
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:43,760
(Kim Sunjung, 5-I / Son Juwon, 4-I / Kim Gyuri, 5-I / Yoon Jiyoon, 4-I)

2008
01:48:44,550 --> 01:48:45,990
Yui.

2009
01:48:45,990 --> 01:48:48,140
(The seventh I-LANDER is Yui)

2010
01:48:48,140 --> 01:48:50,410
Thank you.

2011
01:48:50,410 --> 01:48:52,900
I actually gave up on becoming an I-LANDER.

2012
01:48:52,900 --> 01:48:55,540
Because I only received 3-I,

2013
01:48:55,540 --> 01:48:58,690
I thought no one would vote for me.

2014
01:48:58,690 --> 01:49:02,270
Then, I was surprised by the number of votes I received.

2015
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:05,500
The 8th I-LANDER. Koko.

2016
01:49:05,500 --> 01:49:11,290
And I was happy to enter I-LAND with Koko.

2017
01:49:11,290 --> 01:49:14,500
(The 8th I-LANDER is Koko)

2018
01:49:14,500 --> 01:49:17,160
Koko.

2019
01:49:17,820 --> 01:49:20,840
Only 4 spots left.

2020
01:49:20,840 --> 01:49:22,750
What if I end up in GROUND?

2021
01:49:22,750 --> 01:49:24,470
No, there are still many left.

2022
01:49:24,470 --> 01:49:27,670
The 9th and 10th I-LANDERS

2023
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:29,450
received 4 votes.

2024
01:49:29,450 --> 01:49:30,790
Kim Minsol.

2025
01:49:30,790 --> 01:49:31,890
Juwon?

2026
01:49:31,890 --> 01:49:33,870
(Son Juwon, 4-I)

2027
01:49:33,870 --> 01:49:36,570
(Kim Sujung, 5-I)

2028
01:49:36,570 --> 01:49:38,330
(Yoon Jiyoon, 4-I)

2029
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,250
Kim Sujung.

2030
01:49:41,250 --> 01:49:42,880
Yoon Jiyoon.

2031
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:44,670
(The 9th I-LANDER is Kim Sujung)

2032
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:46,510
(The 10th I-LANDER is Yoon Jiyoon)

2033
01:49:46,870 --> 01:49:47,950
Thank you.

2034
01:49:47,950 --> 01:49:52,040
I knew she'd put on a high-quality performance.

2035
01:49:52,040 --> 01:49:58,070
I voted for her because she's a good vocalist.

2036
01:49:58,070 --> 01:50:01,320
(Only 2 spots left in I-LAND)

2037
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,620
I feel so anxious.

2038
01:50:04,620 --> 01:50:06,940
The 11th I-LANDER

2039
01:50:07,770 --> 01:50:09,790
received 3 votes.

2040
01:50:10,790 --> 01:50:12,110
Kim Gyuri.

2041
01:50:12,110 --> 01:50:13,220
(Puzzled)

2042
01:50:14,040 --> 01:50:16,230
Thank you.

2043
01:50:17,170 --> 01:50:20,400
I'd pretty much given up.

2044
01:50:20,400 --> 01:50:22,680
I'm not happy with it,

2045
01:50:22,680 --> 01:50:27,350
but I'm still grateful to be here.

2046
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:32,150
Because my name wasn't called to the end,

2047
01:50:32,150 --> 01:50:34,660
I was so anxious.

2048
01:50:34,660 --> 01:50:37,680
Do I have to leave for the GROUND?

2049
01:50:37,680 --> 01:50:39,990
The last I-LANDER

2050
01:50:39,990 --> 01:50:42,220
received 3 votes.

2051
01:50:43,320 --> 01:50:46,410
For people I want to stay with,

2052
01:50:46,410 --> 01:50:48,850
I chose Sarang, Juwon, and me

2053
01:50:48,850 --> 01:50:53,380
since we were in the same unit.

2054
01:50:55,140 --> 01:51:01,420
(Son Juwon received 4-I. Who are the 4 people she votes for?)

2055
01:51:02,790 --> 01:51:05,040
Isn't it I-LANDERS versus GROUNDERS?

2056
01:51:05,040 --> 01:51:09,400
So we need to pick members who can pass all the tests.

2057
01:51:09,400 --> 01:51:13,510
Since the team balance matters,

2058
01:51:13,510 --> 01:51:17,120
I voted for skilled members.

2059
01:51:17,120 --> 01:51:21,760
(Son Juwon considered team balance, unlike Kim Minsol)

2060
01:51:23,520 --> 01:51:25,560
The last I-LANDER

2061
01:51:25,560 --> 01:51:27,710
received 3 votes.

2062
01:51:31,310 --> 01:51:33,470
(GROUND)

2063
01:51:35,320 --> 01:51:38,820
The dropouts will go to the GROUND.

2064
01:51:38,820 --> 01:51:40,220
I can never guess.

2065
01:51:40,220 --> 01:51:43,870
4 people are a lot. My goodness.

2066
01:51:43,870 --> 01:51:47,020
(Who are 4 GROUNDERS released from I-LAND? / To be continued)

2067
01:51:47,390 --> 01:51:48,990
(I-LAND)

2068
01:51:48,990 --> 01:51:50,930
The last I-LANDER

2069
01:51:50,930 --> 01:51:53,130
received 3 votes.

2070
01:51:55,050 --> 01:52:00,840
(Only one spot remains. Who will be the last one to remain in I-LAND?)

2071
01:52:11,090 --> 01:52:12,830
Son Juwon.

2072
01:52:12,830 --> 01:52:16,800
(The 12th I-LANDER is Son Juwon)

2073
01:52:19,810 --> 01:52:22,800
That's all 12 people.

2074
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:25,540
I have no idea who voted for me.

2075
01:52:25,540 --> 01:52:26,620
I'm really curious.

2076
01:52:26,620 --> 01:52:32,670
I'm really grateful for two people who voted for me.

2077
01:52:33,840 --> 01:52:39,250
Those whose names aren't called out are released to the GROUND.

2078
01:52:39,250 --> 01:52:40,970
(I-LAND dropouts: Kim Minsol, Kim Eunchae, Yuiko, Choi Soul)

2079
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:47,680
(I-LAND dropouts: Kim Minsol, Kim Eunchae, Yuiko, Choi Soul)

2080
01:52:48,550 --> 01:52:50,010
Do we leave now?

2081
01:52:51,810 --> 01:52:55,840
(Their first time to say goodbye)

2082
01:52:58,270 --> 01:52:59,310
Come back next week.

2083
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:01,440
I don't think I can.

2084
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,510
You can always come back.

2085
01:53:03,510 --> 01:53:05,890
The youngest is the strongest.

2086
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:08,640
Yuiko.

2087
01:53:09,940 --> 01:53:12,300
The dropouts must move to the GROUND.

2088
01:53:12,300 --> 01:53:14,170
Let's go.

2089
01:53:19,470 --> 01:53:24,220
(The 4 dropouts leave I-LAND with a promise to be back)

2090
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:26,910
(GROUND)

2091
01:53:26,910 --> 01:53:28,690
(GROUNDERS are surprised to see unexpected dropouts)

2092
01:53:29,510 --> 01:53:32,890
(GROUNDERS are surprised to see unexpected dropouts)

2093
01:53:34,240 --> 01:53:37,030
What are you doing here, Minsol?

2094
01:53:37,030 --> 01:53:39,460
We'll all make it together.

2095
01:53:39,460 --> 01:53:41,610
We're all spiteful.

2096
01:53:41,610 --> 01:53:44,370
I'm really angry.

2097
01:53:44,370 --> 01:53:48,410
I can't wait to go to I-LAND.

2098
01:53:48,410 --> 01:53:52,630
Those in I-LAND better be nervous.

2099
01:53:52,630 --> 01:53:57,240
In 2024, the unprecedented iconic collaboration girl group will be created.

2100
01:53:57,240 --> 01:53:59,300
I-LAND 2 N/a.

2101
01:53:59,300 --> 01:54:02,920
Dear I-MATES, have you found your I?

2102
01:54:02,920 --> 01:54:08,200
Starting at midnight, you can start supporting your I.

2103
01:54:08,200 --> 01:54:12,620
You can participate in the I-LAND 2 N/a official voting app.

2104
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:15,900
Here is the first test.

2105
01:54:15,900 --> 01:54:17,820
Produced by Teddy.

2106
01:54:17,820 --> 01:54:19,410
The choreography is crazy.

2107
01:54:19,410 --> 01:54:23,500
Only one person will distribute the parts for the signal song.

2108
01:54:23,500 --> 01:54:25,180
It was a lot of pressure.

2109
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,890
Everything is up to you, Jungeun.

2110
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:28,530
I'm in the room.

2111
01:54:28,530 --> 01:54:30,000
(Everyone appeals to her to get the part they want)

2112
01:54:30,000 --> 01:54:31,460
I want to be in the center.

2113
01:54:31,460 --> 01:54:33,360
I can sing this song.

2114
01:54:33,360 --> 01:54:35,240
I thought about it a lot.

2115
01:54:35,240 --> 01:54:36,510
(1. Center - Choi Jungeun)

2116
01:54:37,380 --> 01:54:38,550
(Signal Song - Produced by THEBLACKLABEL)

2117
01:54:38,550 --> 01:54:40,150
I feel confident.

2118
01:54:40,150 --> 01:54:44,230
However, without a dropout, you get no chance to perform.

2119
01:54:44,230 --> 01:54:47,050
I might not get a chance to be on stage at all.

2120
01:54:47,050 --> 01:54:49,280
The interim check begins.

2121
01:54:49,280 --> 01:54:51,600
The parts aren't distributed right.

2122
01:54:51,600 --> 01:54:54,290
You should think about it objectively.

2123
01:54:54,290 --> 01:54:57,840
I regret how I distributed the parts.

2124
01:54:57,840 --> 01:55:01,510
It's a team mission. As a leader,

2125
01:55:01,510 --> 01:55:04,290
I will make sure no one gets dropped out.

2126
01:55:04,290 --> 01:55:05,860
(What's the result of the first test?)

2127
01:55:06,610 --> 01:55:08,480
From I-LAND,

2128
01:55:09,340 --> 01:55:11,350
a dropout...

2129
01:55:13,100 --> 01:55:17,060
(NaSURI Cam)

2130
01:55:17,600 --> 01:55:19,920
(Welcome to I-LAND)

2131
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:22,070
Can I touch this?
(Looking around I-LAND for the first time)

2132
01:55:22,070 --> 01:55:23,690
(Fun)

2133
01:55:24,640 --> 01:55:26,510
So soft!

2134
01:55:26,510 --> 01:55:28,170
Like a puppy.

2135
01:55:28,170 --> 01:55:29,900
Cute.

2136
01:55:29,900 --> 01:55:31,510
(Want to keep touching the furry wall)

2137
01:55:31,510 --> 01:55:32,510
Soft!

2138
01:55:32,510 --> 01:55:34,930
(Taking a seat after feeling the addictive texture)

2139
01:55:34,930 --> 01:55:36,760
They're coming!

2140
01:55:38,090 --> 01:55:40,900
(Holding their breaths waiting)

2141
01:55:41,370 --> 01:55:43,610
They're going in now.

2142
01:55:44,770 --> 01:55:46,780
When they enter...

2143
01:55:46,780 --> 01:55:48,970
(Sharing welcome pose ideas)

2144
01:55:50,810 --> 01:55:54,210
Cross your arms while waiting.

2145
01:55:54,210 --> 01:55:56,830
Pretend like you saw our ranking, right?

2146
01:55:56,830 --> 01:55:59,150
We're all I-LANDERS.

2147
01:55:59,150 --> 01:56:00,740
(Get confident)

2148
01:56:00,740 --> 01:56:03,380
With an arrogant smile.

2149
01:56:03,380 --> 01:56:05,310
(The most arrogant smile of her 14-year-old life)

2150
01:56:05,600 --> 01:56:07,910
(Ready with their welcome pose)

2151
01:56:08,240 --> 01:56:10,210
Her face.

2152
01:56:10,640 --> 01:56:12,020
(Ctrl C)

2153
01:56:12,020 --> 01:56:13,670
(Face and pose, perfect teamwork)

2154
01:56:14,170 --> 01:56:16,120
(So moved)

2155
01:56:16,530 --> 01:56:18,410
(Welcome event is a success)

2156
01:56:19,090 --> 01:56:21,860
My goodness! Isn't that the ranking?

2157
01:56:21,860 --> 01:56:23,660
I want to touch it.

2158
01:56:23,660 --> 01:56:26,190
The fluffy thing.

2159
01:56:26,190 --> 01:56:28,460
Touch it, I touched it earlier.

2160
01:56:28,460 --> 01:56:30,230
Can I touch it?

2161
01:56:30,230 --> 01:56:31,490
Me too!

2162
01:56:31,490 --> 01:56:33,610
I'm going this way.

2163
01:56:33,610 --> 01:56:36,170
It's hard.

2164
01:56:36,170 --> 01:56:38,560
(Still fun)

2165
01:56:38,560 --> 01:56:39,470
(The fluffy texture invites touch)

2166
01:56:39,470 --> 01:56:40,560
It feels nice.

2167
01:56:40,560 --> 01:56:42,070
It's like a puppy.

2168
01:56:42,070 --> 01:56:43,780
So neat. Whoa!

2169
01:56:43,780 --> 01:56:44,820
(Time for the 3rd unit to appear)

2170
01:56:44,820 --> 01:56:46,110
(They're coming.)

2171
01:56:46,110 --> 01:56:48,270
Get ready.

2172
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:50,070
Cross your legs.

2173
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:52,340
(Everyone strikes a pose)

2174
01:56:52,680 --> 01:56:54,610
(New option added)

2175
01:56:54,610 --> 01:56:56,930
Everyone, lean back like this.

2176
01:56:56,930 --> 01:56:58,740
You get it, right?

2177
01:56:58,740 --> 01:57:01,090
Then smile like this.

2178
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:03,410
(Students interpret it their own way)

2179
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:06,920
(Teacher's pet adds her own flair)

2180
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:08,820
So cute.

2181
01:57:10,930 --> 01:57:12,710
Should we say, "Welcome"?

2182
01:57:12,710 --> 01:57:14,230
(So happy)

2183
01:57:14,930 --> 01:57:17,120
(Going to give them a bright hello)

2184
01:57:17,490 --> 01:57:19,320
(The ones who are waiting are somehow the most nervous)

2185
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:21,540
(When are they coming?)

2186
01:57:22,000 --> 01:57:23,430
(Let's clap for them too)

2187
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:25,010
(The META BALL arrives with the third unit)

2188
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:26,420
(Applause as planned)

2189
01:57:26,420 --> 01:57:28,120
Welcome!

2190
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:29,780
(Welcome!)

2191
01:57:30,080 --> 01:57:31,980
(Welcome to I-LAND)

2192
01:57:32,700 --> 01:57:34,470
Is this another welcome?

2193
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:36,570
Welcome to I-LAND!

2194
01:57:37,650 --> 01:57:39,890
(The welcome that has taken over her entire body)

2195
01:57:41,730 --> 01:57:43,200
What are you doing?

2196
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:44,860
What are you doing?

2197
01:57:44,860 --> 01:57:46,610
- I'm congratulating them.
- She's a cheerleader.

2198
01:57:46,610 --> 01:57:47,840
A cheerleader.

2199
01:57:47,840 --> 01:57:49,790
Oh, that's good.

2200
01:57:49,790 --> 01:57:52,550
(Chaeeun gets curious about the number of cameras)

2201
01:57:54,840 --> 01:57:59,420
(Eyes busy looking for cameras)

2202
01:57:59,820 --> 01:58:05,540
(Everywhere she looks, there are cameras)

2203
01:58:05,540 --> 01:58:07,370
There are 20 cameras.

2204
01:58:07,370 --> 01:58:10,010
Twenty? Really?

2205
01:58:10,010 --> 01:58:11,840
(Jiwon joins her in counting the cameras)

2206
01:58:12,200 --> 01:58:14,030
(Looking for hidden cameras)

2207
01:58:14,030 --> 01:58:15,310
They're up there, too.

2208
01:58:15,310 --> 01:58:17,240
(I can move too)

2209
01:58:17,800 --> 01:58:21,270
There are 20 cameras.

2210
01:58:21,270 --> 01:58:22,930
- Did you count?
- Yes.

2211
01:58:22,930 --> 01:58:24,400
That's amazing.

2212
01:58:24,400 --> 01:58:27,000
Over there, over there, everywhere.

2213
01:58:27,000 --> 01:58:29,170
That's so strange.

2214
01:58:32,040 --> 01:58:34,580
(I-STAGE has a lot of cool things)

2215
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:38,410
I feel like I'm in space.

2216
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:41,450
Or an amusement park.

2217
01:58:41,450 --> 01:58:42,730
(What caught Joowon's eyes?)

2218
01:58:42,730 --> 01:58:43,930
What is that?

2219
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:46,240
(A lamp on top of a table)

2220
01:58:46,670 --> 01:58:48,090
I want to look in a mirror.

2221
01:58:48,090 --> 01:58:52,150
(Checking themselves out)

2222
01:58:52,480 --> 01:58:54,840
(Thanks to Joowon, it's now a popular tourist attraction)

2223
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:57,210
(Minsol, Jiwon)

2224
01:58:57,710 --> 01:58:59,650
(Soojung, Juwon, Chaeeun)

2225
01:58:59,650 --> 01:59:00,660
Hello.

2226
01:59:02,930 --> 01:59:04,670
We're like goldfish.

2227
01:59:04,670 --> 01:59:07,650
- Please let me get into I-LAND next time.
- Me too.

2228
01:59:07,650 --> 01:59:10,470
(A brief break)

2229
01:59:10,940 --> 01:59:13,570
(Camera is on Team Cake)

2230
01:59:14,280 --> 01:59:15,950
It's moving.

2231
01:59:19,220 --> 01:59:22,880
(Team Drama wants screen time too)

2232
01:59:23,450 --> 01:59:26,240
(Everyone dancing for the camera)

2233
01:59:26,820 --> 01:59:29,240
(Come over here!)

2234
01:59:29,960 --> 01:59:32,440
It's moving away.

2235
01:59:34,110 --> 01:59:37,300
♫ I bring the drama ♫

2236
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:40,900
♫ With my girls in the back, drama ♫

2237
01:59:43,230 --> 01:59:45,750
(Come here!)

2238
01:59:45,750 --> 01:59:49,380
(Camera moving slowly, won over by their song)

2239
01:59:50,270 --> 01:59:51,880
(Come here!)

2240
01:59:52,620 --> 01:59:53,650
Unni!

2241
01:59:53,650 --> 01:59:56,000
Don't play hard to get!

2242
01:59:56,790 --> 01:59:58,970
It's playing hard to get.

2243
01:59:58,970 --> 02:00:02,090
(They will not give up)

2244
02:00:02,360 --> 02:00:03,540
It's back!

2245
02:00:03,540 --> 02:00:05,190
(Finally got the camera)

2246
02:00:05,190 --> 02:00:06,730
Good to see you.

2247
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,480
Let's do something cute.

2248
02:00:09,480 --> 02:00:11,620
(Celebrating getting the camera's attention)

2249
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:12,610
(So nervous)

2250
02:00:13,250 --> 02:00:14,390
(Hello)

2251
02:00:15,830 --> 02:00:17,660
(Another unit loves the camera)

2252
02:00:17,660 --> 02:00:20,400
(Have you eaten?)

2253
02:00:21,580 --> 02:00:23,140
Have you eaten?

2254
02:00:23,140 --> 02:00:24,730
It says, "I had some batteries."

2255
02:00:24,730 --> 02:00:26,710
(We're friends now, right?)

2256
02:00:29,840 --> 02:00:32,170
