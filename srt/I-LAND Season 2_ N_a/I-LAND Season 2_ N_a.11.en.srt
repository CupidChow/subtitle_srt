We really racked our brains about the decision-making method.

245
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:25,880
As the producers, we made the decision to prioritize I-MATES' votes

246

353
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:13,860
is a new song produced by Producer Teddy, who will oversee the music of the debut group.

354
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,280
Can't wait.

355
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:19,800
Seeing Producer Teddy's name in the mission,

356
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,450
it finally felt real that we'll be produced by Producer Teddy.

357
00:25:24,450 --> 00:25:30,050
Wow, I was so honored that I was a part of something with Producer Teddy.

358
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:37,670
In this test, two units of five members each will perform a new song.

359
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,330
I bet it'll be two different vibes.

360
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,140
What vibe?

361
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,550
First new song produced by Teddy.

362
00:25:45,550 --> 00:25:47,550
Calm down.

363
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:50,350
("Drip")

364
00:25:50,350 --> 00:25:52,500
Love it already, just by the title.

365
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,820
I can't wait.

366
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:56,350
I absolutely cannot wait.

367
00:25:56,350 --> 00:25:58,400
(Revealing the first test song, "Drip")

368
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,310
Love it.

369
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:09,820
(First test song "Drip" with rhythmical melody)

370
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,250
It looked so cool.

371
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:14,230
It was a really amazing song.

372
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,640
(Performance as powerful as the melody line of the song)

373
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,910
Wow, it's really hard.

374
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:19,890
So hard.

375
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:22,940
What do we do? Are there five people who can handle this?

376
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:25,960
Right? Which five?

377
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:27,690
How do we do this...

378
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:32,380
You need to be an amazing dancer to handle this.

379
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,760
It's so hard.

380
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:35,800
So hard.

381
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,580
The song is hard, and the dance is hard...

382
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:40,400
The second new song produced by Teddy.

383
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,260
Can't wait for the next song. Can't wait.

384
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,500
("Fake It")

385
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,760
"Fake it"?

386
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:48,560
So curious.

387
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,800
("Fake It," a dreamy second test song)

388
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,260
I like it.

389
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,970
Wow, I love it.

390
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:03,870
I bet I can hit above average if I do it well.

391
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,550
Love it.

392
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:11,530
(Chorus performance utilizing mic stands)

393
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,430
I love the handheld mics.

394
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,190
I loved both the song and the choreography.

395
00:27:18,190 --> 00:27:21,030
I fell in love at first sight.

396
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:26,740
("Fake It" rap part that brought the vibe of the song to life even more)

397
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,600
So cool.

398
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,510
I love it.

399
00:27:34,510 --> 00:27:36,180
Which do I do?

400
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:38,880
- The first song for you.
- I do want to do the first song more.

401
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,180
I can definitely do "Fake It" better.

402
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:45,850
"Drip" was so my style that I wanted to do it.

403
00:27:45,850 --> 00:27:47,850
How do we choose?

404
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,350
It's important.

405
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:54,500
I will share with you how we will choose the units and the parts for the final new song test.

406
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,510
I'm scared.

407
00:27:56,510 --> 00:28:00,790
The units and the parts for the two new songs produced by Teddy...

408
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:02,880
I have no idea.

409
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:09,200
have 100% been chosen by Producer Teddy.

410
00:28:12,970 --> 00:28:14,640
Daebak!

411
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:19,510
I was curious and worried about which song and part he chose for me.

412
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:22,280
Gosh, so curious. - I'm scared.

413
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:24,640
I want to find out. I can't wait.

414
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,010
I can do better with "Fake it."

415
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:31,440
I wanted to be the center, the most visible part, or the main vocal.

416
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,560
Revealing now.

417
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,790
First, center.

418
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,730
I bet it's Bang Jeemin.

419
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:45,530
I feel like the vibes of the song and the choreography are a perfect fit for Bang Jeemin.

420
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:47,670
I wonder who the center for "Fake It" is.

421
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:49,710
I bet it'll be Fuko.

422
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:53,220
It might be Fuko. She's a good fit with "Fake It."

423
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:55,410
I also wanted to be the center for "Fake It."

424
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:59,740
The choreography with the arm stretched out was so sentimental and beautiful.

425
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,550
I thought I could do a good job.

426
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:04,360
Center.

427
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,680
(Who will be the center for the "Produced by Teddy" test?)

428
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,970
("Drip" - Bang Jeemin / "Fake It" - Jeong Saebi)

429
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:15,630
("Drip" Center - Bang Jeemin / "Fake It" Center - Jeong Saebi)

430
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,600
I was disappointed.

431
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,080
Is this real?

432
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:24,550
We went up against each other center to center before.

433
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:27,510
(Bang Jeemin and Jeong Saebi competed as centers during "Whistle" and "Panorama")

434
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:29,380
We meet again as centers.

435
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:33,770
I want to beat Saebi's center.

436
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:36,720
Secondly, the main vocal.

437
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,580
I wasn't named as the center.

438
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,480
At least, I wanted to be the main vocal for "Fake It."

439
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,160
Will I be named the main vocal?

440
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,290
I'm sure you'll be "Fake It"'s main vocal.

441
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,860
I can do "Fake It" well.

442
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:52,280
Emotional expression is important in that song.

443
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:57,210
Since I'm good at expressing emotions, I want to do "Fake It."

444
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:01,610
I bet Jungeun could also be the main vocal for "Fake It."

445
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:05,560
No, no. Jungeun's definitely "Drip."

446
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:11,570
I thought "Drip" showed off a hip vibe and was a good fit for me.

447
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:13,580
So, I wanted to try it.

448
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:16,180
Please... Please!

449
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,470
("Drip" - Yoon Jiyoon / "Fake It" - Choi Jungeun)

450
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,330
(Yoon Jiyoon and Choi Jungeun are the main vocals)

451
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,380
I was so disappointed.

452
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,620
("Drip" main vocal - Yoon Jiyoon)

453
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:28,340
("Fake It" main vocal - Choi Jungeun)

454
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,780
(Jiyoon assigned to a song that's not her preferred song, "Fake It")

455
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:34,490
How am I supposed to do "Drip"?

456
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:36,530
So hard. Hard.

457
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,630
Are there five people who can handle this?

458
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,420
So hard.

459
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:43,350
It requires really amazing dancing. It's hard.

460
00:30:43,350 --> 00:30:47,340
("Drip" choreography is advanced due to many fast moves)

461
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:51,420
Let's work hard on the dance. And the singing.

462
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,930
Thirdly, the main rap position.

463
00:30:53,930 --> 00:30:54,990
Ko?

464
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:58,030
I feel like the "Fake It" rap is perfect for Yuju.

465
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,300
Right.

466
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:02,270
The main rapper for that one, Yuju.

467
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:05,220
The main rapper for this, Koko.

468
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,070
(The main rapper was revealed)

469
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,710
(Why are the I-LANDERS shocked?)

470
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,030
("Drip" - Koko / "Fake It" - Ryu Sarang)

471
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,910
Sarang?

472
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,250
("Fake It" main rapper - Ryu Sarang)

473
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:22,690
I was caught off-guard.

474
00:31:22,690 --> 00:31:24,510
("Drip" main rapper - Koko)

475
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:27,790
I've never been a main rapper.

476
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:33,020
(Ryu Sarang has never rapped on the I-LAND stage)

477
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,860
Since I've never done this part, I'm nervous and worried.

478
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,860
(Next, the fourth part is revealed)

479
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:45,230
("Fake It" - 4th, Fuko / "Drip" - 4th, Nam Yuju)

480
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:46,650
Fuko, you'll rap?

481
00:31:46,650 --> 00:31:49,490
It's English rap, not even Korean.

482
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,440
(Fuko's rap part in "Fake It" is almost entirely English)

483
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,020
I lack in pronunciation...

484
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:56,880
I don't know if I'll be able to do well.

485
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,010
Lastly, the fifth.

486
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:02,510
I bet Mai will be assigned to "Drip."

487
00:32:02,510 --> 00:32:04,080
I bet Gyuri will do "Fake It."

488
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,670
I also thought I was better suited for "Fake It."

489
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:10,980
("Drip" - Kim Gyuri / "Fake It" - Mai)

490
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:13,940
Huh?

491
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:18,360
- Wow.
- He wants us to try something we've never done.

492
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,620
- That must be it.
- Since Gyuri's always done innocent things.

493
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:27,740
(Kim Gyuri performed innocent songs in the last test)

494
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:29,990
What a twist.

495
00:32:29,990 --> 00:32:33,130
Since this is the final, Producer Teddy

496
00:32:33,130 --> 00:32:37,920
must be gauging if we can handle something totally different.

497
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,380
This is really tough.

498
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,890
I must showcase a new side of myself, no matter what.

499
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,440
(1F Large Practice Room - "Fake It" Unit)

500
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,530
Who should be the leader?

501
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,400
Raise your hand if you want to do it.

502
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,490
I want to do it.

503
00:32:57,490 --> 00:33:00,130
I might want to, too.

504
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,040
"I might?"

(She's been a leader four times on I-LAND)

511
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,080
Jungeun will be the leader.

512

(Time is gold on I-LAND! She guarantees practicality and effectiveness!)

Close your eyes.

Thank you.

Congratulations.

I've never been a leader in Part 2. I'm satisfied.

524

We don't have a lot of time, and we need to move fast.

525

00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:26,900
I've never done choreography using a mic.

528
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:33,980
Using mic stands is the characteristic choreography for this song.

529
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:35,870
It's so, so cool.

530
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:38,470
I thought it was amazing.

531
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:41,540
I'm curious. How do I spin?

532
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,770
Should we start with this?

533
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,410
So cool.

534
00:34:51,410 --> 00:34:54,180
(We look so cool in the mirror)

535
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,800
(Slips)

536
00:35:01,630 --> 00:35:03,300
Is this how you do it?

537
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,870
(Everyone flailing with the unfamiliar standing mic choreography)

538
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:08,280
It's a little...

539
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:14,420
(Harmony of standing mics is important to the "Fake It" choreography)

540
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,870
- It's not going the way I want.
- It's hard.

541
00:35:17,870 --> 00:35:21,110
- It goes like this.
- This is hard.

542
00:35:21,110 --> 00:35:23,350
We need to practice a lot.

543
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:26,000
(The choreography looks sloppy despite the repeated practice)

544
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,940
I'm so confused.

545
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:33,420
We're in trouble.

546
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,850
What do we do?

547
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:40,760
The standing mic looks fancy but it's really hard.

548
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:43,660
Not only am I worried about the standing mic,

549
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,830
but I also have a pair choreography with Jungeun.

550
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:51,950
(Saebi / Jungeun)

551
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:56,810
We're going to practice like we're in a mirror.

552
00:35:56,810 --> 00:35:58,810
Start.

553
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:01,580
(I am mirror)

554
00:36:01,580 --> 00:36:03,180
(Shattering)

555
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:07,510
Saebi, you look weird.

556
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,310
Saebi, you're weird. Look.

557
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:11,870
(Stretch)

558
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:14,060
Why are you going up?

559
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:16,890
Just raise your hand.

560
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:20,320
(Third mirror choreography attempt)

561
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:24,360
It's weird! (Creaky)

562
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:26,500
So funny. (Thinking hard)

563
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,860
(Thinking hard)

564
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,680
Right, right. It's working.

565
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,600
Something's off.

566
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:38,280
Right, right. It's working. (Creaky)

567
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:40,520
Something's off.

568
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,120
Weird.

569
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,270
What's weird?

570
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,750
I want to know.

571
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:49,940
(Mai used to dance big time back in the day)

572
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,690
(Lower one shoulder, point downward with the arm, 30cm of distance, 90 degree leg angle) (Solved the problem)

573
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:55,000
- Like this.
- Like this.

574
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,520
Jungeun's leg needs to bend this way.

575
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,810
Like this?

576
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:01,550
Yes, yes.

577
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,320
Starting now.

578
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,070
What am I doing?

579
00:37:06,070 --> 00:37:07,500
Saebi, I understand.

580
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,440
Saebi, I understand what's going on.

581
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,920
(Saebi's two legs, Saebi's two arms)

582
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,180
(Left, right, baby giraffe, mirror choreography)

583
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,650
(I'm detective Mai. I shall rescue Saebi)

584
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:18,140
Saebi, I understand what's going on.

585
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,810
Saebi, you're using the wrong shoulder.

586
00:37:19,810 --> 00:37:24,430
- Your hand needs to be like this, but you're using this one.
- That's right.

587
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:28,480
(Right shoulder behind / Right shoulder in front)

588
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,270
Like this? (Eureka!)

589
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:33,830
(Good reasoning)

590
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:36,990
(What will happen this time?)

591
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,300
Where's your hand? (Detective Mai at work)

592
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,780
Great job!

593
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,530
(Happy dance)

594
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:46,900
That was the opposite direction.

595
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:52,260
It's working out a little bit at a time. - Hurry up and fix what's not working.

596
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:56,580
(2F Practice Room - "Drip" Unit)

597
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,330
Why are they doing this to us?

598
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,000
I'm sad.

599
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,060
We can do it.

600
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,880
("Drip" feels like a funeral - what happened?)

601
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:12,910
("Drip" Unit - six hours ago)

602
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:15,530
Should we try the choreography?

603
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,640
(Rehearsal starts under Jeemin's leadership)

604
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,320
(Watching the choreography video)

605
00:38:23,370 --> 00:38:27,380
I love the song, but it is really tough.

606
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,180
It needs to look cool.

607
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,880
Will we be able to do it?

608
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,160
I'm very worried.

609
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:39,310
Gosh, the song's much harder than I thought.

610
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:41,200
The final is no joke.

611
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:42,900
Right?

612
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:48,160
("Drip" Unit diving into learning choreography)

613
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,650
(Tough to follow)

614
00:38:54,810 --> 00:38:56,800
Is this sped up twice as fast?

615
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,620
It's not easy.

616
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,990
We're supposed to sing while dancing, right?

617
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:03,530
(One "no" vote)

618
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,280
(Leaning the choreography slowly this time)

619
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:10,820
(Falls down)

620
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:13,200
Jiyoon, you can do it.

621
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,560
(Choreography is super tough)

622
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,000
I'm ruined this time.

623
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:20,560
- Opposite?
- Like this...

624
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:24,480
(Vocalist Jiyoon is slow at taking in choreography)

625
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,200
(During Self-made Test)

626
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,760
(But throughout the tests)

627
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:38,210
(Yoon Jiyoon improved her dance skills)

628
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:43,600
I'm always slow at learning choreography, so I was worried.

629
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:48,850
This is the hardest song since I entered I-LAND.

630
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:54,870
So fun! Like a game.

631
00:39:54,870 --> 00:39:56,740
(Koko, you're always amazing)

632
00:39:58,260 --> 00:40:03,760
(Staring straight)

633
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,610
Koko, you memorize so fast.

634
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:08,400
(I'm a choreograph copier)

635
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:11,810
(Making progress on "Drip" choreography, thanks to the dance master Koko)

636
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,400
(Only one failing)

637
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:15,850
(Jeemin discovers Jiyoon is getting the choreography wrong by herself)

638
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:18,420
Should we slow it down? One more time.

639
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:20,580
The choreography is tough, to begin with,

640
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,480
and my teammates were progressing quickly.

641
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:28,950
I need to go along with them, but I wasn't able to, and felt frustrated.

642
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,150
Again, again.

643
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:32,620
Let's memorize.

644
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,950
Fighting. Jiyoon.

645
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,430
(Yoon Jiyoon is broken)

646
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,940
(Koko's laughter = Broken Jiyoon)

647
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:49,240
(Yoon Jiyoon's majorly broken)

648
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:56,240
(Infinite repeat, infinitely broken)

649
00:40:56,990 --> 00:41:00,020
(Broken, Arabian Night style)

650
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,990
(Shocked by the surprising movement)

651
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,810
(Brief rest after practicing a while)

652
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,730
I'm exhausted.

653
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:13,170
Not bad.

654
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:18,150
Are you serious, Koko?

655
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:22,630
How could they do this to us?

656
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:26,350
We can do it.

657
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:29,150
We can do it!

658
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,120
(The sun sets as they cheer each other up)

659
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:34,320
("Fake It" Unit dives into vocal rehearsal)

660
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,810
I love this rap.

661
00:41:42,810 --> 00:41:44,400
It's really catchy.

662
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,240
Really?

663
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,850
Sarang's really good at rapping. It suits her well.

664
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:53,860
This part is perfect for Sarang.

665

(Fuko starting her part)

667
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:19,420
I've never really rapped in my life.

668
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:23,170
My rap part is entirely in English, except for one line.

♫ Don't tell me it was, when it wasn't ♫

670

♫ Just a story from the past ♫

00:42:26,910 --> 00:42:30,460
♫ You know happy endings ain't for us ♫

672
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,340
What do I do?

673
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,110
I can do it.

674
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:36,840
From the moment we received the mission,

675
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:42,800
I didn't get anything I wanted in terms of the song, the part, or being the leader.

676
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:49,300
On top of that, I need to rap in English, even though I struggle with pronunciation.

677
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,430
I thought I was in big trouble.

678

(3:30 a.m.)

679
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,420
It's 3:30 a.m. right now.

680
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,410
When should we meet up?

681
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:03,100
You know we need to rehearse the song, too, right?

682
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,450
The song and choreography both at 11.

683
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:06,740
Okay.

684
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,290
We can do it, we can do it.

685
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,600
(Yoon Jiyoon continues practicing until late)

686

Yoon Jiyoon is passed out.

688

She's sleeping with her eyes open.

689
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,550
Right.

Oh, she woke up.

691
00:43:31,300 --> 00:43:33,090
Or no?

692
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:36,610
I'm so tired.

693
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:39,790
I feel so bad.

694
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,970
- Why?
- Because I'm not learning it fast enough.

695
00:43:43,970 --> 00:43:46,540
Unni. You're fast.

696
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:47,970
No.

697
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:50,250
There are so many people who are slower than you.

698
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:52,980
You do learn fast.

699
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:58,460
I was so grateful when Koko told me I was doing well.

700
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:04,190
Unni, will we do well in this mission?

701
00:44:04,190 --> 00:44:07,970
We better do well since it's the final.

702
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:11,270
I want to do well, but it's so hard.

703
00:44:11,270 --> 00:44:13,940
We can do well.

704
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,130
I want to do well in the final stage.

705
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:18,960
I will do a good job as the center.

706
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,800
I'll do my best to practice the vocal parts and show off a perfect all-rounder, Saebi.

707
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:33,740
(I-LANDERS fast asleep in dreamland)

708
00:44:34,850 --> 00:44:38,130
(10th place bed is empty?)

709
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:47,110
(Kim Gyuri is practicing alone at night)

710
00:44:48,940 --> 00:44:51,860
I want to do well since it's the last time.

711
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:55,410
I really have to do well. That's what I was thinking.

712
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:01,250
I don't know how late I need to practice,

713
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,860
but I will do my best to deliver a better performance.

714
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,070
I'm exhausted.

715
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:17,030
(Gyuri falls asleep on the practice room bench, exhausted from the practice)

716
00:45:18,460 --> 00:45:22,570
(The long, long first night of the final test ends)

717
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:30,620
It's incredible, as we expected.

718
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:33,840
The final test that will serve as the grand finale of I-LAND 2

719
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:37,710
will feature Producer Teddy's new songs.

720
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,320
Before we launch into the performances,

721
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:47,700
aren't you curious about the name of the I-LAND 2 debut team that will be born tonight?

722
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,280
So, so curious.

723
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,830
They'll be called by this precious name for the rest of time.

724
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:56,440
Also, I'm so curious what meaning it'll hold.

725
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:02,170
Revealing now the name of the iconic girl group

726
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:07,290
produced by Producer Teddy, born through I-LAND 2.

727
00:46:17,090 --> 00:46:18,930
(Whenever, wherever, whatever)

728
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:21,590
(=, soon, is, iz)

729
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,280
(N/a)

730
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:26,370
(I)

731
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:34,140
(izna)

732
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:38,430
Tonight's shining main character, izna.

733
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:40,330
It's izna!

734
00:46:41,690 --> 00:46:45,350
The name of the final debut group is izna.

735
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:48,610
izna. What a pretty name.

736
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:49,670
Yes, that's right.

737
00:46:49,670 --> 00:46:52,950
izna means being defined as myself, whenever, wherever, whatever,

738
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:58,190
and exudes confidence and certainty.

739
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:00,490
izna. The crowd is going wild.

740
00:47:00,490 --> 00:47:02,720
I like it so much.

741
00:47:06,050 --> 00:47:11,160
Yes, izna, who will spread out into the world with infinite potential.

742
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:15,740
You can follow their activity through the official account.

743
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:19,170
We hope you pay attention and show your love.

744
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,810
Producer Taeyang.

745
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,810
How do you feel now that the name of the debut group is revealed?

746
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:29,350
Does it sound like the name of a group that will receive as much love as BIGBANG?

747
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,930
Yes. izna. I think it's such a cool name.

748
00:47:33,930 --> 00:47:38,990
As you all know, when it comes to the name,

749
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:44,730
fans and the members will turn it into something cool.

750
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:50,080
What you create together with the members from here on out will be important.

751
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:58,100
I'm sure that'll lead to the creation of an incredible name in the future.

752
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,590
The name is already amazing,

753
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:04,690
but I hope you imbue it with even more amazing meaning moving forward.

754
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:12,680
I hope izna is able to receive Producer Taeyang's energy.

755
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:20,400
Producer Taeyang, it'd be great if you could shout out "fighting."

756
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:24,280
One, two, three!

757
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:27,050
izna, let's go!

758
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:41,320
Let's launch into the final test performances that will determine the debut members of izna.

759
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:44,810
Since they will be performing Producer Teddy's new songs,

760
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:47,930
these performances will also serve as first looks

761
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:53,020
into the flavor of the final debut group of izna.

762
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:56,530
The long-awaited final that determines the fate of who will debut.

763
00:48:56,530 --> 00:48:59,880
Who will be presenting the first performance?

764
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:03,920
It's none other than the "Fake It" Unit.

765
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:08,380
("Fake It")

766
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:12,990
Everyone in this unit advanced to Part 2, chosen by the producers.

767
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:16,890
And they've all been leaders.

768
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:21,480
It must've been a really smooth process, then.

769
00:49:23,350 --> 00:49:28,990
Let's dive into the "Fake It" Unit's story and their performance.

770
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:34,870
("Fake It" Unit - midpoint check)

771
00:49:36,510 --> 00:49:39,970
This is the final midpoint check day.

772
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:42,900
You worked so hard.

773
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:46,030
What did you think of the new song?

774
00:49:46,030 --> 00:49:48,330
Love it.

775
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,750
We poured our whole soul into it, so we're soulless at the moment.

776
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:56,030
We're soulless because we poured it into the songs.

777
00:49:56,030 --> 00:49:59,170
- Let's begin the midpoint check.
- Yes.

778
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,980
(The final midpoint check begins)

779
00:50:04,550 --> 00:50:06,460
("Fake It" Unit struggled with the standing mic and pair choreography)

780
00:50:06,460 --> 00:50:07,740
So confusing.

781
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:09,630
I think you're supposed to move like this.

782
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:11,230
This is tough.

783
00:50:11,230 --> 00:50:17,870
(How will the "Fake It" Unit's midpoint check go?)

784
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:20,270
What do I do?

785
00:50:45,210 --> 00:50:47,750
This part suits Mai well.

786
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,260
(Chorus part using the standing mics)

787
00:51:05,650 --> 00:51:09,960
(Ryu Sarang trying out being the main rapper for the first time)

788
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,860
Saebi's so sincere.

789
00:51:36,680 --> 00:51:38,680
So carefree...

790
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:51,070
To my surprise, the parts I was worried about did not stand out too much.

791
00:51:51,070 --> 00:51:53,150
Mai, I was so worried about you,

792
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,140
but you don't sound bad.

793
00:51:56,140 --> 00:51:58,670
Sarang, when you rap,

794
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,130
your tone is so unique and great.

795
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:08,220
But Fuko's part...

796
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,840
I want to hear others do it as well.

797
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:19,080
(Fuko struggled with the English rap)

798
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:26,050
(She was particularly lacking confidence during the midpoint check, too)

799
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:35,670
I felt like I didn't handle the part they entrusted me with well.

800
00:52:35,670 --> 00:52:38,710
The performance must be perfect,

801
00:52:38,710 --> 00:52:43,440
so I want to give the part to the person who can give it most life.

802
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,750
I want everyone to try singing this part.

803
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:47,350
Yes.

804
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:53,880
(Trying out the rap part upon Producer VVN's request)

805
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:02,760
I think Jungeun's it.

806
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:05,230
Fuko, could you sing that part?

807
00:53:06,730 --> 00:53:11,400
(Jungeun's part features vocals)

808
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,250
If we swap like this...

809
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:23,400
Jungeun and Fuko, swap your two parts.

810
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,940
Yes.

811
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:29,750
At first, I was really disappointed,

812
00:53:29,750 --> 00:53:35,150
but this was the best choice to make a perfect performance.

813
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:42,330
Now, I'm focused on doing it well. I need to do well.

814
00:53:42,330 --> 00:53:45,000
(Right after the midpoint check)

815
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,560
Should we analyze the lyrics of "Fake It" again?

816
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:50,190
Sounds good.

817
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:52,940
While I was listening, I couldn't imagine anything beyond.

818
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,560
It didn't feel like it was your story.

819
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,800
Pull out your personal experiences

820
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,110
and land on a concept that way.

821
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,580
So, "you're my oxygen."

822
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,190
Isn't that interesting?

823
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:07,250
That it makes you breathless when it's oxygen.

824
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:11,240
You need this love, but this love pains you.

825
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,830
- A bad guy.
- This is a bad guy.

826
00:54:13,830 --> 00:54:16,360
It's a bad guy,

827
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:17,980
but for this woman,

828
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:22,370
"That's all I need. I'm disarmed by a single word you say."

829
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,370
- She's a good girl.
- She's simple.

830
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:26,240
She's an easy girl.

831
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,890
Why is this easy girl dating a bad guy?

832
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,720
Why is she doing this? Must be hard.

833
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,300
But bad guys are more attractive.

834
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:37,510
But bad guys are more attractive.

835
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,310
Saebi, how do you know this?

836
00:54:39,310 --> 00:54:41,900
Everyone says that.

837
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:44,630
Not me. I like nice guys.

838
00:54:44,630 --> 00:54:47,550
Not me. I like nice guys.

839
00:54:47,550 --> 00:54:49,280
("Fake It" Unit's song analysis: the charm of a bad guy)

840
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,310
(Jeong Saebi, playing the bad guy - "You'll never escape my charm")

841
00:54:51,310 --> 00:54:53,170
(Ryu Sarang, playing Ryu Sarang - "I don't fall for things easily")

842
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:55,370
Where did you go earlier?

843
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:56,620
Tell me right now.

844
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:59,650
Sarang, you're so lovely, as always.

845
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,990
(Disarmed by a single word from the bad guy)

846
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,880
(Scene 2: in front of Ryu Sarang's house)

847
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:09,300
Let's break up.

848
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,430
Right now.

849
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:14,040
Don't you break up with me with such a pretty face.

850
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:16,790
Don't you break up with me with such a pretty face.

851
00:55:16,790 --> 00:55:20,620
This is like a TV drama.

852
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,210
(Can't believe I fall for bad guys...)

853
00:55:23,210 --> 00:55:26,770
I've never met a bad guy in real life.

854
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,860
I've only seen them on TV dramas.

855
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:31,410
Right, right. On dramas.

856
00:55:31,410 --> 00:55:34,910
I feel like I can't get into the romantic angle.

857
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:37,590
We don't know love.

858
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:41,760
We've only seen it in dramas. Except Mai.

859
00:55:43,410 --> 00:55:45,800
(Teasing Mai)

860
00:55:46,190 --> 00:55:49,090
(I don't know anything)

861
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:53,090
We really don't know love.

862
00:55:53,090 --> 00:55:56,700
(The love story is tough for I-LANDERS, who are love amateurs)

863
00:55:57,380 --> 00:56:01,800
What if we make it about our dreams?

864
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,170
Our dreams make us really happy, and we need it,

865
00:56:07,170 --> 00:56:09,650
but it also gives us grief.

866
00:56:09,650 --> 00:56:13,780
Of the four years I trained, half of that was struggles.

867
00:56:13,780 --> 00:56:16,980
Half?

868
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:19,160
More, more.

869
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,580
More than half.

870
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:25,750
We've rehearsed together for a long time.

871
00:56:25,750 --> 00:56:30,880
("Fake It" Unit went through thick and thin together as trainees)

872
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,180
Thinking back to old memories,

873
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:36,450
discussing what it was like when we were trainees...

874
00:56:36,450 --> 00:56:40,840
We were proud of how far we came.

875
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,950
It's funny thinking back to our trainee days.

876
00:56:42,950 --> 00:56:45,750
We had a lot of fun, too.

877
00:56:45,750 --> 00:56:49,270
There was a lot of fun, scary, funny stuff.

878
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:50,910
We fought so much.

879
00:56:50,910 --> 00:56:53,710
I fought so much with Jeong Saebi.

880
00:56:54,620 --> 00:56:56,660
She would say, "You keep doing it like this!"

881
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:59,650
and Saebi would say, "You did it like that!"

882
00:56:59,650 --> 00:57:01,750
I would say, "Apologize right now."

883
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:04,690
Jungeun would apologize and slam the door.

884
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:06,860
Was she really sorry?

885
00:57:06,860 --> 00:57:08,380
(Truth becomes more of a mystery...)

886
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:11,520
We went through thick and thin all together.

887
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:14,170
Coming to I-LAND, what I learned is

888
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,220
I don't think we could've done it without each other.

889
00:57:16,220 --> 00:57:17,770
That's real.

890
00:57:17,770 --> 00:57:22,300
We could only get this far together.

891
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,910
Thank you, everyone.

892
00:57:23,910 --> 00:57:26,490
(I-LANDERS, from good faith rivals to real friends)

893
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,980
When I first got to I-LAND,

894
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,570
I was so happy and excited just to perform

895
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:36,600
with my fellow trainees.

896
00:57:37,640 --> 00:57:40,280
The fact that someone will get eliminated

897
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,030
is so sad and heartbreaking and disappointing.

898
00:57:44,030 --> 00:57:47,180
Since this is the final performance,

899
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:48,570
I'll try my best and give it my all.

900
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:52,190
Make it perfect, all together.

901
00:57:52,190 --> 00:57:56,680
I want to showcase a performance

902
00:57:56,680 --> 00:57:59,590
where we each show off our charms.

903
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:05,600
We've spent two to three years together.

904
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,620
If we can express our story

905
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:11,450
of us dreaming together for this final performance,

906
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:14,390
- that would be great. What do you think?
- I like it.

907
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,900
Fighting.

908
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:19,500
(Renewing heart and mind by shouting "fighting")

909
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,200
("Fake It")

910
01:02:15,370 --> 01:02:17,970
We just watched the "Fake It" Unit's performance, that featured

911
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:20,880
I-LANDERS' nuanced emotional expression.

912
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,060
I am in such awe of them

913
01:02:23,060 --> 01:02:25,890
since it's been a mere week since they received the new song.

914
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,820
It hasn't even been a week

915
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:32,440
and pumping out this quality on live broadcast is no easy feat.

916
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:34,840
They're incredible.

917
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:39,410
Yes, I hope the producers feel the same way.

918
01:02:39,410 --> 01:02:41,610
Let's hear what the producers thought

919
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,820
by checking out their feedback.

920
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:49,510
First, Producer Taeyang. What did you think?

921
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:53,370
Oh, this performance was so amazing.

922
01:02:53,370 --> 01:03:00,920
Especially watching you deliver this level of performance on a live broadcast

923
01:03:00,920 --> 01:03:05,160
made me feel that you're a pro now,

924
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:07,750
and allowed me to enjoy the performance.

925
01:03:07,750 --> 01:03:12,540
You compared the love in the song with your dreams.

926
01:03:12,540 --> 01:03:16,090
I felt your desire and passion for your dreams.

927
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:22,140
Your performance felt like a cool, refreshing breeze on a summer night.

928
01:03:22,140 --> 01:03:24,740
Thank you, and great work.

929
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:32,070
Next, Producer VVN, who was part of creating "Fake It."

930
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:34,880
I'm sure you were especially on edge as you were watching.

931
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:37,240
What did you think about the performance?

932
01:03:38,140 --> 01:03:41,970
I don't know if the I-MATES and the viewers felt this, too.

933
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:47,240
For me, I felt the sentimental mood of the song and the elegant visuals

934
01:03:47,240 --> 01:03:52,000
forming the harmonious energy that really hit home.

935
01:03:52,060 --> 01:03:54,180
We've witnessed many performances,

936
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:59,160
but I felt like the style and visuals of "Fake It" suited them well.

937
01:03:59,160 --> 01:04:06,050
We proudly watched the contestants grow into their own colors as we produced.

938
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:08,650
Although this is the final performance,

939
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:12,520
I think it's also your beginning at the same time.

940
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:17,080
Great work, and thank you for being amazing.

941
01:04:19,940 --> 01:04:21,110
Thank you.

942
01:04:21,110 --> 01:04:26,820
Lastly, Producer Monika, please share your feedback about this performance.

943
01:04:26,820 --> 01:04:31,240
You shared that you don't know love well.

944
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:35,520
But it felt like you've experienced love many times.

945
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:40,910
It felt like I was watching the story of a person addicted to love

946
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,600
before my very eyes, and it was so moving.

947
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:49,580
To be honest, I was a little worried about the delivery.

948
01:04:49,580 --> 01:04:55,470
The choreography really called for emotional expressivity.

949
01:04:55,470 --> 01:05:01,800
The five of you really showed off your skills onstage.

950
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,860
Thank you so much.

951
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:15,100
We've now heard the overall positive producer feedback on the "Fake It" Unit's performance.

952
01:05:15,100 --> 01:05:20,870
Who amongst these five will be named an izna member?

953
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:28,150
Their debut hinges on your votes, I-MATES.

954
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:38,810
"Fake It" Unit, great work. Thank you.

955
01:05:48,970 --> 01:05:52,570
Currently, the final vote determining the members of the final debut group izna

956
01:05:52,570 --> 01:05:56,360
is taking place all over the world.

957
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:59,480
It's not too long before the voting closes.

958
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:04,660
If you haven't voted yet, I think you should hurry and vote.

959
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:08,330
Your votes have the power to debut five people.

960
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:10,230
Since everyone gets one vote,

961
01:06:10,230 --> 01:06:13,410
the rankings could drastically shift.

962
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:18,570
Please save your "I" so they can make it into the debut group.

963
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:27,340
We hope you cheer on your favorite "I"

964
01:06:27,340 --> 01:06:30,520
with your vote so she can debut.

965
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,890
Let's watch the second test performance.

966
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:40,010
The long-awaited final. The next performance is the "Drip" Unit.

967
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:44,160
("Drip")

968
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:47,370
"Drip" Unit members have all performed as centers.

969
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:50,370
I bet they'll show us some electrifying moments

970
01:06:50,370 --> 01:06:53,720
where it feels like they're all centers.

971
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:59,140
Revealing "Drip" Unit's story and performance now.

972
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:06,220
(Early morning before sunrise)

973
01:07:06,220 --> 01:07:07,500
(2F Practice Room - "Drip" Unit)

974
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,930
(Jiyoon first to show up, practicing)

975
01:07:11,350 --> 01:07:14,730
It's difficult movement after difficult movement.

976
01:07:14,730 --> 01:07:18,180
I keep practicing and practicing.

977
01:07:22,150 --> 01:07:24,980
Let's try the first verse.

978
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:29,560
("Drip" Unit rehearses under Jeemin's lead)

979
01:07:48,360 --> 01:07:53,220
(Yoon Jiyoon is not off-book with the lyrics due to being behind on choreography)

980
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,000
(Second verse begins next)

981
01:07:57,000 --> 01:08:02,640
I haven't internalized the choreography or the lyrics yet.

982
01:08:02,640 --> 01:08:07,440
I was worried that my falling behind would sour the mood.

983
01:08:09,580 --> 01:08:13,420
("Drip" Unit went through the entire choreography)

984
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:17,060
I think we can get through the second verse.

985
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,530
(Through the second verse?)

986
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,390
Second verse...

987
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:24,400
Let's go from the second verse.

988
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,300
Since we're good on the first verse.

989
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:28,130
Sounds good.

990
01:08:28,130 --> 01:08:30,560
(Beginning again from Koko's part in the second verse)

991
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,180
Your hands go like this.

992
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:45,970
(The beat keeps getting faster)

993
01:08:45,970 --> 01:08:48,380
- Next?
- Let's skip.

994
01:08:51,330 --> 01:08:55,650
(The members learn choreography faster and faster)

995
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:25,830
Why don't you guys work on this, and I'll work on what I need to?

996
01:09:29,150 --> 01:09:31,700
I can't follow. I can't do all that.

997
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:35,340
I haven't memorized the lyrics. I haven't done anything yet.

998
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:51,700
I can't even sing a single line yet. How am I supposed to move on?

999
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:57,810
(Yoon Jiyoon leaves the practice room tearing up)

1000
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:10,000
Everyone else is off-book,

1001
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:12,650
and I'm the only one who can't follow.

1002
01:10:12,650 --> 01:10:16,800
I was already impatient during rehearsal,

1003
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:22,240
and when they suggested to move on from the first verse,

1004
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:24,850
I felt even more rushed.

1005
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,710
(Jeemin came to find Jiyoon)

1006
01:10:29,140 --> 01:10:31,420
Jiyoon.

1007
01:10:32,860 --> 01:10:34,700
Are you okay?

1008
01:10:34,700 --> 01:10:38,410
We're a team, but I'm falling behind,

1009
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:42,420
and it felt like you guys were leaving me behind.

1010
01:10:42,420 --> 01:10:44,720
- Sorry.
- No.

1011
01:10:44,720 --> 01:10:46,830
I knew I was slow,

1012
01:10:48,120 --> 01:10:49,820
before we even began.

1013
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:52,810
I became more impatient knowing that.

1014
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:56,200
I should've put a stop to it.

1015
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,910
I'm sorry I didn't know.

1016
01:10:57,910 --> 01:10:59,560
I'm sorry.

1017
01:11:02,240 --> 01:11:04,260
Unni.

1018
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:05,430
I'm sorry.

1019
01:11:05,430 --> 01:11:07,660
("Drip" members apologize for not taking Jiyoon into consideration)

1020
01:11:07,660 --> 01:11:09,140
I'm sorry, Unni.

1021
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,680
Did you feel like we left you behind?

1022
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:13,750
I'm sorry that we didn't check in with you.

1023
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:16,730
- I'm sorry, too.
- It's hard, right?

1024
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:19,440
I'm sorry, we only thought of ourselves.

1025
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:22,090
We went too fast.

1026
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:27,020
("Drip" Unit all gathered in the practice room)

1027
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:29,440
Are there parts you're confused about?

1028
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,800
This...

1029
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,570
Let's go over the last part.

1030
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:39,440
(Rehearsal begins again, led by Jeemin)

1031
01:11:41,290 --> 01:11:45,240
- What do I do with my feet?
- Turn them out.

1032
01:11:56,310 --> 01:11:57,710
(There we go)

1033
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,320
(Monitoring after rehearsal)

1034
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:06,220
("Drip" Unit choreography shaping up)

1035
01:12:08,220 --> 01:12:09,770
(Did we succeed?)

1036
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:11,090
We did it.

1037
01:12:11,090 --> 01:12:12,940
Thank you.

1038
01:12:12,940 --> 01:12:15,370
- What? You can do it.
- You could do it all along!

1039
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:19,650
I thought they'd be frustrated with me,

1040
01:12:19,650 --> 01:12:24,980
but I was so thankful they understood me and wanted to go through it together.

1041
01:12:24,980 --> 01:12:27,690
Should we try to do the next part?

1042
01:12:27,690 --> 01:12:29,200
Practice.

1043
01:12:29,200 --> 01:12:32,060
- Shall we memorize?
- Yes.

1044
01:12:32,060 --> 01:12:34,440
Teach us this part.

1045
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:35,820
(Like this)

1046
01:12:37,130 --> 01:12:39,570
Up, down, down?

1047
01:12:44,650 --> 01:12:46,460
(Confidence up)

1048
01:12:46,460 --> 01:12:48,150
Unni!

1049
01:12:48,150 --> 01:12:51,400
- Good!
- So annoying.

1050
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:54,750
- We're almost done learning it.
- We're almost done.

1051
01:12:54,750 --> 01:12:57,960
("Drip" Unit deep in rehearsal, driving toward completion)

1052
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,680
(Perfection, even to the ending pose)

1053
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:09,450
So fun!

1054
01:13:09,450 --> 01:13:11,580
It's fun but exhausting.

1055
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:13,490
So fun.

1056
01:13:14,720 --> 01:13:18,130
("Drip" Unit showcasing rigorous choreography the more they practice)

1057
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,850
We did well.

1058
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:23,520
(And the next day)

1059
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:25,220
Let's go, everyone.

1060
01:13:26,220 --> 01:13:27,570
Jiyoon!

1061
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:30,150
(The ladies of I-LAND)

1062
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:32,660
Let's go.

1063
01:13:32,660 --> 01:13:35,550
(Kim Gyuri / Nam Yuju / Bang Jeemin / Yoon Jiyoon / Koko)

1064
01:13:35,550 --> 01:13:38,170
- Hey, Koko.
- Let me go first.

1065
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:39,600
(Cool girls are here)

1066
01:13:40,180 --> 01:13:42,310
What?

1067
01:13:43,310 --> 01:13:45,960
(What happened to the "Drip" Unit?)

1068
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,300
I want to hear your interpretation of your song.

1069
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:52,190
Could you share?

1070
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:57,190
Our interpretation is that we're confident that

1071
01:13:57,190 --> 01:14:02,840
we're so overwhelmingly charming that it's impossible to be anything else.

1072
01:14:02,840 --> 01:14:04,640
Keep casting a spell.

1073
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,870
I'm a charming person.

1074
01:14:06,870 --> 01:14:09,230
Keep doing it. Charming woman.

1075
01:14:09,230 --> 01:14:12,300
Charming woman.

1076
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,490
Charming woman.

1077
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:17,280
I'm a charming person.

1078
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:18,860
Hey, girl!

1079
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,630
- Open the door!
- Wow, salad!

1080
01:14:21,630 --> 01:14:24,250
(So into it that they're breaking down over attractive (?) salad)

1081
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:27,390
This is a really hard song,

1082
01:14:27,390 --> 01:14:29,800
but it's also really fun and exciting.

1083
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:34,470
I want to interpret this song well and deliver a good performance.

1084
01:14:34,470 --> 01:14:37,930
(Charming meal time for "Drip")

1085
01:14:37,930 --> 01:14:40,590
- Bon appetit.
- Okay!

1086
01:14:43,020 --> 01:14:44,390
Looks delicious.

1087
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:45,760
Looks delicious.

1088
01:14:45,760 --> 01:14:48,070
Do it with flair.

1089
01:14:48,100 --> 01:14:49,770
Do it with flair...

1090
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,150
How dare you lift a fork like that?

1091
01:14:54,150 --> 01:14:56,330
Do it like Gyuri.

1092
01:14:56,330 --> 01:14:58,390
Everyone, watch me.

1093
01:14:58,390 --> 01:15:00,620
Okay, sorry.

1094
01:15:00,620 --> 01:15:02,470
How do I do it?

1095
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:08,540
Jiyoon, you eat so fancy

1096
01:15:08,540 --> 01:15:10,490
You're a woman who eats with flair.

1097
01:15:10,490 --> 01:15:13,080
Jiyoon, what's up with your part right now?

1098
01:15:13,080 --> 01:15:14,570
Such vibes.

1099
01:15:14,570 --> 01:15:16,620
It's a part with vibes.

1100
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,860
(Trying not to laugh)

1101
01:15:18,860 --> 01:15:21,330
(Stay in character, everyone!)

1102
01:15:21,330 --> 01:15:23,300
Your part looks so cool.

1103
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,300
So cool.

1104
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,960
Guys, let's all part our hair like hers.

1105
01:15:29,550 --> 01:15:31,620
- Part?
- Yes.

1106
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:33,190
- Part?
- Yes.

1107
01:15:33,190 --> 01:15:34,420
Part...

1108
01:15:34,420 --> 01:15:35,690
(What do you think? Is this attractive?)

1109
01:15:37,850 --> 01:15:39,140
What do you think?

1110
01:15:39,140 --> 01:15:40,610
Don't laugh, Koko.

1111
01:15:40,610 --> 01:15:42,470
Okay, okay. Great.

1112
01:15:42,470 --> 01:15:44,060
A woman with flair.

1113
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:45,790
Cross your legs and lift your toes up.

1114
01:15:45,790 --> 01:15:48,050
Straighten your back,

1115
01:15:48,050 --> 01:15:50,280
and tilt your head.

1116
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:51,600
(Like this?)

1117
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,600
(I'm Koko, an attractive and confident woman)

1118
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:59,740
Did she pull a muscle?

1119
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,810
Not bad.

1120
01:16:03,810 --> 01:16:06,200
That was a perfect drip.

1121
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:12,820
This felt like the most close-knit team of my I-LAND experience.

1122
01:16:12,820 --> 01:16:18,620
This is really the final performance, and I don't want to regret a thing.

1123
01:16:18,620 --> 01:16:21,610
As long as we have fun onstage,

1124
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:27,390
I-MATES will feel that, and that'll make the performance great.

1125
01:16:28,610 --> 01:16:31,050
You can look forward to it.

1126
01:17:00,620 --> 01:17:03,360
("DRIP")

1127
01:19:59,010 --> 01:20:01,720
The final test that will determine the fate of the final debut.

1128
01:20:01,720 --> 01:20:04,680
We just watched the "Drip" Unit's performance.

1129
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,530
Wow, I'm overwhelmed. That was so cool.

1130
01:20:07,530 --> 01:20:11,480
Let's go right to the producer feedback.

1131
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:19,910
First, the person who was a part of creating this song.

1132
01:20:19,910 --> 01:20:23,890
Producer 24, what did you think?

1133
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:30,020
I had better go home quickly after watching this performance.

1134
01:20:30,020 --> 01:20:35,750
It made me want to write another song for them.

1135
01:20:35,750 --> 01:20:42,170
You made this new song yours in such a short period of time.

1136
01:20:42,170 --> 01:20:47,910
The performance was dripping with your charms.

1137
01:20:47,910 --> 01:20:49,680
Great work.

1138
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:56,450
Dripping... Thank you.

1139
01:20:56,450 --> 01:20:59,470
Next, she choreographed this final performance.

1140
01:20:59,470 --> 01:21:04,490
Producer Leejung, are you satisfied with the final product?

1141
01:21:04,490 --> 01:21:06,910
Yes, I'm very satisfied.

1142
01:21:06,910 --> 01:21:13,820
I also want to go home and choreograph whatever new song Producer 24 writes.

1143
01:21:13,820 --> 01:21:18,110
Also, just like the lyrics, I was fully immersed,

1144
01:21:18,110 --> 01:21:22,870
but at the same time, I felt a deep sense of sincerity.

1145
01:21:22,870 --> 01:21:27,070
It was so cool, and it also made me tear up.

1146
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:29,630
Thank you for the great performance.

1147
01:21:32,450 --> 01:21:36,260
Next, it's time for the final producer feedback of I-LAND 2.

1148
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:39,290
Producer Taeyang, go ahead.

1149
01:21:39,290 --> 01:21:42,960
I love this song so much, personally.

1150
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,340
I almost want it to be mine.

1151
01:21:46,340 --> 01:21:50,400
I thought this while watching this type of performance.

1152
01:21:50,410 --> 01:21:52,280
I watch for how well it goes, and you truly killed it.

1153
01:21:52,280 --> 01:21:54,590
but you truly killed it.

1154
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:59,490
It's beyond just doing a good job.

1155
01:21:59,490 --> 01:22:03,140
It felt like you really had fun onstage.

1156
01:22:03,140 --> 01:22:08,010
You were feeling the stage, and you were communicating with the audience.

1157
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:13,320
I'm so proud and happy. Great work.

1158
01:22:16,210 --> 01:22:21,240
That was the producers' feedback on the "Drip" Unit performance.

1159
01:22:21,240 --> 01:22:27,370
Who amongst the "Drip" Unit will be named an izna member?

1160
01:22:32,020 --> 01:22:34,560
For those of you who haven't voted yet,

1161
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:38,090
please make up your mind so they can debut.

1162
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:41,140
Voting closes soon.

1163
01:22:42,740 --> 01:22:47,580
"Drip" Unit, best of luck. Great work.

1164
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:56,870
We've now watched both of the final test performances.

1165
01:22:56,870 --> 01:23:02,010
There will be six members who will debut as part of izna.

1166
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:07,040
Five of them will be determined through the I-MATE votes.

1167
01:23:07,040 --> 01:23:10,390
Today's final result of the final SAVE VOTE

1168
01:23:10,390 --> 01:23:15,010
will be a sum of the preliminary votes and the live-broadcast votes.

1169
01:23:15,010 --> 01:23:18,310
You can only vote for the one person you want to help debut.

1170
01:23:18,310 --> 01:23:21,070
The single vote is such a huge variable.

1171
01:23:21,070 --> 01:23:26,160
I hear the I-LANDER rankings are fluctuating drastically.

1172
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:36,570
The world is cheering on and voting for the final debut group right now.

1173
01:23:36,570 --> 01:23:41,530
As of the midpoint check around 10:30 p.m.,

1174
01:23:41,530 --> 01:23:46,070
217 countries and regions have participated in the voting.

1175
01:23:46,070 --> 01:23:51,620
This is the largest number of participating countries and regions in history. Thank you.

1176
01:23:54,580 --> 01:24:00,040
Only your precious vote can make your I-LANDER dream come true.

1177
01:24:00,040 --> 01:24:02,410
Don't discount the importance of your vote,

1178
01:24:02,410 --> 01:24:06,610
and vote for the I-LANDER you want to see debut so you won't regret it.

1179
01:24:06,610 --> 01:24:09,430
For citizen producers watching right now,

1180
01:24:09,430 --> 01:24:12,280
we ask that you vote.

1181
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,700
The situation is dire.

1182
01:24:18,270 --> 01:24:20,300
Han Bin, did you vote?

1183
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:23,920
As a graduate of a survival program, I have voted.

1184
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:25,370
Have you voted?

1185
01:24:25,370 --> 01:24:29,380
I was waiting till I watched both performances first.

1186
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,490
I'll get on it right now.

1187
01:24:31,490 --> 01:24:34,110
Producers, please cast your vote when you have a moment.

1188
01:24:34,110 --> 01:24:36,200
And you, the celebrities sitting there, you, too.

1189
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,660
You, too. Everyone, please.

1190
01:24:39,660 --> 01:24:42,620
Did everyone vote?

1191
01:24:42,620 --> 01:24:46,130
You all voted? Got it, great.

1192
01:24:49,640 --> 01:24:54,110
Less than ten minutes remain until voting closes.

1193
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:59,630
Shortly, the final vote that determines the debut members closes.

1194
01:24:59,630 --> 01:25:02,060
There's really not much time left.

1195
01:25:02,060 --> 01:25:07,650
Please vote for the one person who want to see debut.

1196
01:25:08,620 --> 01:25:13,400
As we give I-MATES the final chance to vote,

1197
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,370
this is now a few days leading up to the finals.

1198
01:25:16,370 --> 01:25:19,240
Something happened that turned I-LAND upside down.

1199
01:25:19,240 --> 01:25:24,350
I wonder what shocking event took place. Let's see what happened.

1200
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,260
I-LANDERS, it's time to eat.

1201
01:25:30,260 --> 01:25:32,060
Let's eat.

1202
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:33,400
Sounds delicious.

1203
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,290
I'm hungry.

1204
01:25:36,290 --> 01:25:37,710
Huh? What?

1205
01:25:37,710 --> 01:25:39,920
Lunch boxes!

1206
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,480
What?

1207
01:25:42,420 --> 01:25:44,480
Unfamiliar lunch boxes?

1208
01:25:44,480 --> 01:25:49,740
Lunch boxes were laid out on the table. I was surprised.

1209
01:25:50,990 --> 01:25:54,620
I have a lunch box that I carry to training.

1210
01:25:54,620 --> 01:25:57,290
The lunch box that my mom packed for me...

1211
01:25:57,290 --> 01:26:02,000
I had no idea that we'd get lunch boxes. I was so happy,

1212
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:05,220
and it made me tear up.

1213
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:06,440
(Lunch box of love, prepared for the I-LANDERS by their parents)

1214
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,220
Koko's got one!

1215
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:12,600
I thought of my mom's face, and I wanted to cry.

1216
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:14,090
What do I do?

1217
01:26:14,090 --> 01:26:15,470
Jiyoon, Jiyoon.

1218
01:26:15,470 --> 01:26:16,910
How come I got so much food?

1219
01:26:16,910 --> 01:26:19,320
(Special lunchbox full of love)

1220
01:26:19,320 --> 01:26:22,860
Jiyoon, how come you have so much food?

1221
01:26:22,860 --> 01:26:25,640
(3 servings of marinated meat, 4 servings of kimchi stew, 4 servings of porridge, 3 servings of pasta)

1222
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:27,880
Dad, I can't eat all this...

1223
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:30,250
I was saying I crave croffle...

1224
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:31,420
- You got croffle?
- Yes.

1225
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,720
Wow, daebak.

1226
01:26:33,720 --> 01:26:35,910
There's a letter here, too.

1227
01:26:35,910 --> 01:26:38,090
Letter!

1228
01:26:38,090 --> 01:26:40,410
I can't read this right now.

1229
01:26:40,410 --> 01:26:42,520
I'm not going to cry.

1230
01:26:42,520 --> 01:26:44,550
I'm not crying, either.

1231
01:26:44,550 --> 01:26:47,050
Dear Jeemin, our beloved baby daughter.

1232
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:49,840
Jeemin, mom misses you so much right now,

1233
01:26:49,840 --> 01:26:52,310
and I want to run and hug you.

1234
01:26:52,310 --> 01:26:54,490
(Tears galore)

1235
01:26:54,900 --> 01:26:56,350
(Why are you crying?)

1236
01:26:57,120 --> 01:26:59,330
(I'm so sad)

1237
01:26:59,330 --> 01:27:01,840
Why are you crying, Sarang?

1238
01:27:01,840 --> 01:27:04,220
I'm more sad for some reason.

1239
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:07,030
Jeemin, every time...

1240
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:08,900
(Tear ducts at work)

1241
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:10,760
(Tears coming in)

1242
01:27:10,760 --> 01:27:13,720
Every time you complete each mission,

1243
01:27:13,720 --> 01:27:16,420
I'm so proud of you.

1244
01:27:16,420 --> 01:27:19,120
I'm not going to cry.

1245
01:27:19,930 --> 01:27:22,790
You know mom's your number one fan, right?

1246
01:27:22,790 --> 01:27:24,770
You know mom's your number one fan, right?

1247
01:27:24,770 --> 01:27:26,330
(Why?)

1248
01:27:26,700 --> 01:27:28,650
(More emotional than the letter recipient)

1249
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:32,920
Why are you crying?

1250
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:35,680
I'm not crying.

1251
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,360
I'm not crying yet.

1252
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:39,570
I'll read fast.

1253
01:27:39,570 --> 01:27:43,080
Jeemin, you've been working so hard chasing your dreams.

1254
01:27:44,240 --> 01:27:47,570
What a precious second opportunity you have at debut.

1255
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:51,910
It feels like a chance to heal your hardships thus far.

1256
01:27:53,640 --> 01:27:56,730
Fighting until the very end, and the family's cheering you on.

1257
01:27:56,730 --> 01:28:00,150
Love you, Jeemin. Love you so much. Fighting.

1258
01:28:04,760 --> 01:28:06,790
Saebi, do you want to go last?

1259
01:28:06,790 --> 01:28:08,090
(No, I can do it)

1260
01:28:14,130 --> 01:28:15,800
I'll go.

1261
01:28:19,460 --> 01:28:22,440
My daughter, 1370 days...

1262
01:28:22,440 --> 01:28:26,530
I'm so proud that each day you've been chasing...

1263
01:28:28,370 --> 01:28:32,260
I'm so proud that each day you've been chasing

1264
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:37,180
your dream has now added up to three years.

1265
01:28:37,180 --> 01:28:40,910
But at the same time, your mom's tearing up inside.

1266
01:28:40,910 --> 01:28:43,910
Thank you for being so brave through all the struggles,

1267
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:49,580
even when things were hard, when you were upset, and even when you wanted to give up.

1268
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:55,710
I'll be living my life to the fullest, just like you.

1269
01:28:55,710 --> 01:28:57,850
(Miss you, mom)

1270
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:07,520
It feels like it was just yesterday when you were begging to become an idol,

1271
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:11,080
but it's already been half a year.

1272
01:29:11,080 --> 01:29:15,330
I felt so sorry I was vehemently against it

1273
01:29:15,330 --> 01:29:19,190
when I watched your eyes shine and be happy onstage.

1274
01:29:21,170 --> 01:29:23,070
Believe in yourself until the end of the finals

1275
01:29:23,070 --> 01:29:26,160
and have fun, as you've done this whole time!

1276
01:29:26,160 --> 01:29:28,360
Love you, miss you.

1277
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,800
(Koko's mom's letter from Japan)

1278
01:29:35,140 --> 01:29:37,180
The Chinese characters are hard.

1279
01:29:40,370 --> 01:29:43,590
Koko, you went to Korea with determination.

1280
01:29:43,590 --> 01:29:47,000
Mom and dad respect you!

1281
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:52,110
The Japanese language is hard.

1282
01:29:52,110 --> 01:29:54,250
Mom is just so impressed

1283
01:29:54,250 --> 01:29:57,300
how much Korean you learned.

1284
01:29:59,000 --> 01:30:03,400
Koko, you are trying your best.

1285
01:30:03,400 --> 01:30:07,180
To us, Mom and Dad, you're the best girl in the whole world.

1286
01:30:07,180 --> 01:30:11,590
Fighting. We love you.

1287
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,810
(Mom's love, fully felt)

1288
01:30:15,420 --> 01:30:17,280
Dear Mai.

1289
01:30:18,660 --> 01:30:20,760
(Tear ducts opening up)

1290
01:30:22,930 --> 01:30:25,140
Huge, huge congratulations.

1291
01:30:25,140 --> 01:30:28,220
Final! So amazing.

1292
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:30,880
I had faith, but I was afraid.

1293
01:30:30,900 --> 01:30:33,300
Honestly, I haven't been able to sleep.

1294
01:30:35,580 --> 01:30:37,720
Jeong Saebi. You understand Japanese?

1295
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,920
You understand it?

1296
01:30:39,920 --> 01:30:41,950
(I don't understand it, but I can feel it)

1297
01:30:45,100 --> 01:30:48,990
I know how hard you work, Mai.

1298
01:30:49,990 --> 01:30:54,010
You never give up until you accomplish your dream.

1299
01:30:54,010 --> 01:30:58,540
All your friends and family in Japan are rooting for you.

1300
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:03,070
Love you from the bottom of my heart.

1301
01:31:06,290 --> 01:31:08,600
Dad, I'm sorry, but I'm not going to cry.

1302
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:11,310
You say that now, and the moment you open it...

1303
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:17,050
(Tears gearing up)

1304
01:31:17,050 --> 01:31:19,090
You're crying already.

1305
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:22,190
(Capital F understands vehemently)

1306
01:31:22,190 --> 01:31:23,530
Hilarious.

1307
01:31:23,530 --> 01:31:27,030
(Sentimentality fully charged)

1308
01:31:28,240 --> 01:31:30,570
She hasn't read a single word.

1309
01:31:30,570 --> 01:31:33,070
(Struggles to read a single word)

1310
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,550
My...

1311
01:31:38,310 --> 01:31:42,020
My beloved Ji-poop. It must be tough.

1312
01:31:42,020 --> 01:31:45,280
I think this is my first time writing you a letter by hand.

1313
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:48,320
It feels a little awkward and embarrassing.

1314
01:31:48,320 --> 01:31:53,990
You know how much I love you and believe in you, right?

1315
01:31:56,000 --> 01:31:58,420
You know better than anyone else.

1316
01:31:58,420 --> 01:32:03,680
I'm sending my signature kimchi stew and auntie's famous pasta. Eat and cheer up.

1317
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,580
It's a lot of food, right?

1318
01:32:05,580 --> 01:32:07,850
(That's why it was so much food)

1319
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,330
No matter what you're doing, where you are,

1320
01:32:12,330 --> 01:32:15,470
daddy loves you.

1321
01:32:17,010 --> 01:32:21,380
I've never received a handwritten letter from my dad.

1322
01:32:21,380 --> 01:32:25,690
Neither of us usually outwardly express ourselves.

1323
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:28,830
Seeing "I love you" written out so many times

1324
01:32:28,830 --> 01:32:30,950
was so moving.

1325
01:32:30,950 --> 01:32:33,760
I bet I was the...

1326
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:39,170
happiest person to receive a letter.

1327
01:32:40,270 --> 01:32:43,010
(Next, lunch boxes from parents)

1328
01:32:43,010 --> 01:32:44,510
Looks delicious.

1329
01:32:44,510 --> 01:32:47,360
Wow, looks so delicious.

1330
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:51,110
I love salmon, eel, galbi, everything.

1331
01:32:51,110 --> 01:32:53,930
Haven't had mom's cooking in so long.

1332
01:32:53,930 --> 01:32:55,790
(Big bite)

1333
01:32:56,580 --> 01:32:59,110
(Home cooking for the first time since entering the competition)

1334
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:08,690
I'm heating up the kimchi stew. I'll put one over there.

1335
01:33:08,690 --> 01:33:09,910
There's two?

1336
01:33:09,910 --> 01:33:11,850
There are two large containers.

1337
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:15,310
- Daebak.
- Daddy!

1338
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:18,130
(I-LANDERS sharing Jiyoon's dad's kimchi stew)

1339

(Koko trying kimchi stew for the first time)

1340
01:33:22,120 --> 01:33:24,250
What is this?

1341
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:25,920
Kimchi stew.

1342
01:33:25,920 --> 01:33:28,580
Wow. So tasty.

1343
01:33:28,580 --> 01:33:30,410
So tasty.

1344
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,490
(Kimchi stew quickly selling out)

1345
01:33:33,490 --> 01:33:36,310
Thank you for the food!

1346
01:33:36,310 --> 01:33:38,630
- Thank you for the food.
- It was so delicious.

1347
01:33:38,630 --> 01:33:40,530
I was so happy.

1348
01:33:40,530 --> 01:33:42,090
I was so happy.

1349
01:33:42,090 --> 01:33:44,490
For the first time in a long time,

1350
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:48,290
I felt happiness that was different from happiness that came from performing.

1351
01:33:48,290 --> 01:33:50,280
I felt so warm inside

1352
01:33:50,280 --> 01:33:52,810
and felt ready to give it my best till the end.

1353
01:33:52,810 --> 01:33:54,940
Jiyoon, your kimchi stew is top-tier.

1354
01:33:54,940 --> 01:33:57,100
I'll tell my dad.

1355
01:34:05,980 --> 01:34:10,420
I was tearing up watching the VCR.

1356
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:15,270
I visited I-LAND to listen to the contestant's struggles and chat with them,

1357
01:34:15,270 --> 01:34:18,810
but it was all edited out.

1358
01:34:19,660 --> 01:34:22,600
They must really miss their family

1359
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,060
being here, leaving everything behind.

1360
01:34:25,060 --> 01:34:29,370
I really felt that this meant a lot to them.

1361
01:34:29,370 --> 01:34:33,750
Yes, that's right. Preparing for the final was the toughest part.

1362
01:34:33,750 --> 01:34:37,870
I remember feeling better after my family cheered me on.

1363
01:34:37,870 --> 01:34:41,790
We have family here cheering on.

1364
01:34:41,790 --> 01:34:44,610
Wishing the best of luck to everyone.

1365
01:34:44,610 --> 01:34:48,760
Amidst this warm and fuzzy mood, I get to share with you

1366
01:34:48,760 --> 01:34:52,450
and we're nearing the end of the voting period.

1367
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:05,800
We will now close the I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN live-broadcast voting.

1368
01:35:08,180 --> 01:35:11,800
Shortly, the live-broadcast voting will close.

1369
01:35:11,800 --> 01:35:17,050
Five, four, three, two, one.

1370
01:35:17,050 --> 01:35:22,060
(Voting closed)

1371
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,710
Now, I-MATES decisions have concluded.

1372
01:35:30,710 --> 01:35:35,280
Thank you so much to the global I-MATES

1373
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:39,050
for voting for the I-LANDERS' dreams.

1374
01:35:39,050 --> 01:35:45,110
I'm curious about who will fulfill their dream of debuting tonight by getting chosen by the I-MATES.

1375
01:35:45,110 --> 01:35:50,330
Please keep cheering until the last moment the final debut team is assembled.

1376
01:35:50,330 --> 01:35:52,880
As the votes are tallied up,

1377
01:35:52,880 --> 01:35:58,740
let's chat with the sunbaenims here at the live broadcast studio.

1378
01:35:58,740 --> 01:36:03,160
First, all-rounder Jo Yuri.

1379
01:36:03,160 --> 01:36:05,020
Hello.

1380
01:36:05,020 --> 01:36:07,850
What did you think of the final performances?

1381
01:36:07,850 --> 01:36:10,880
Watching the final performances,

1382
01:36:10,880 --> 01:36:15,580
I really felt the passion and sincerity of the trainees.

1383
01:36:15,580 --> 01:36:19,310
They were so amazing, and I was touched.

1384
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:25,600
Yes. And if you were to share a word of encouragement to those who will debut today?

1385
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:34,270
I hope you get the results you want since you worked so hard. Fighting!

1386
01:36:35,180 --> 01:36:36,810
Thank you.

1387
01:36:36,810 --> 01:36:40,440
Next to her, Kep1er's Kim Chaeyeon and Hikaru,

1388
01:36:40,440 --> 01:36:43,740
who debuted through Girls Planet 999.

1389
01:36:43,740 --> 01:36:46,150
Hello.

1390
01:36:46,150 --> 01:36:50,560
Watching I-LAND 2, were you surprised by anything?

1391
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:56,390
They gathered from all around the world,

1392
01:36:56,390 --> 01:37:00,080
to rehearse together inside.

1393
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:03,950
It must've been hard to create perfect performances in such a short time.

1394
01:37:03,950 --> 01:37:08,120
I both resonate with and am also in awe of

1395
01:37:08,120 --> 01:37:13,160
them putting together perfect performances.

1396
01:37:14,980 --> 01:37:16,270
Thank you.

1397
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:19,280
Today, an immediate hoobae girl group will be born.

1398
01:37:19,280 --> 01:37:24,490
What would you say are the three most important elements of girl group teamwork?

1399
01:37:24,490 --> 01:37:25,920
Three elements?

1400
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:28,980
Understanding and caring for each other.

1401
01:37:28,980 --> 01:37:32,860
Deciding on a clear goal,

1402
01:37:32,860 --> 01:37:37,800
and everyone working toward that goal.

1403
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:43,170
And in that process, communicating with the members is crucial.

1404
01:37:43,170 --> 01:37:45,720
- Fighting.
- Thank you for your kind words.

1405
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:48,500
Next, Han Bin, your trusty teammates.

1406
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:50,930
ZEROBASEONE, who debuted through Boys Planet.

1407
01:37:50,930 --> 01:37:52,820
Zhang Hao, Kim Tae Rae, Han Yu Jin.

1408
01:37:52,820 --> 01:37:55,720
(ZEROBASEONE: Zhang Hao, Kim Tae Rae, Han Yu Jin)

1409
01:37:55,720 --> 01:37:58,230
I heard through the grapevine that

1410
01:37:58,230 --> 01:38:03,630
ZEROBASEONE members have been fans of I-LAND since the first episode.

1411
01:38:03,630 --> 01:38:06,600
Is there a particular reason why?

1412
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:10,190
We debuted through a survival program, too.

1413
01:38:10,190 --> 01:38:13,320
Since they're our direct hoobae...

1414
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:16,130
It was fun to watch. Fighting!

1415
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:21,210
What left an impression on you?

1416
01:38:21,210 --> 01:38:26,520
I feel like they were fed better than us.

1417
01:38:26,520 --> 01:38:28,040
I was jealous.

1418
01:38:28,040 --> 01:38:33,170
The moment that was memorable was

1419
01:38:33,170 --> 01:38:37,520
when Jiyoon was like, "I don't know."

1420
01:38:37,520 --> 01:38:40,510
I had so much fun watching.

1421
01:38:40,510 --> 01:38:44,360
Which I-LANDERS do you think will debut?

1422
01:38:45,230 --> 01:38:46,970
Share your honest thoughts.

1423
01:38:46,970 --> 01:38:51,160
My honest thoughts? I'm not sure if I should share this.

1424
01:38:51,160 --> 01:38:55,760
But I'm sure it'll be someone who shone the brightest onstage today.

1425
01:38:55,760 --> 01:38:58,610
What a great answer. Thank you.

1426
01:38:58,610 --> 01:39:02,110
Please share a word of encouragement to the

1427
01:39:02,110 --> 01:39:05,910
I-LANDERS who must be nervously awaiting the result.

1428
01:39:07,000 --> 01:39:10,750
Thank you for the performances today.

1429
01:39:10,750 --> 01:39:15,620
I can already see izna's bright future.

1430
01:39:15,620 --> 01:39:19,410
I can't wait. Fighting!

1431
01:39:22,830 --> 01:39:28,530
Next, may I ask you a wild card question, Somi?

1432
01:39:28,530 --> 01:39:29,940
Yes.

1433
01:39:29,940 --> 01:39:34,910
Jeon Somi, what does Mnet survival mean to you?

1434
01:39:34,910 --> 01:39:38,320
It's my origin story and genesis.

1435
01:39:38,320 --> 01:39:42,240
I was doe-eyed and bushy-tailed back then.

1436
01:39:42,240 --> 01:39:46,030
Lots of memories. It's complicated.

1437
01:39:46,030 --> 01:39:49,350
- I agree.
- I love Mnet survival.

1438
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:51,020
Thank you.

1439
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:57,590
Above all, the producers, who led them through their journey from the entrance test,

1440
01:39:57,590 --> 01:40:03,970
were the fuel behind the I-LANDERS' success.

1441
01:40:03,970 --> 01:40:06,460
To thank the producers,

1442
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:10,400
the I-LANDERS have prepared an adorable surprise.

1443
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:12,900
Revealing it now.

1444
01:40:16,380 --> 01:40:18,750
(FINAL midpoint check done)

1445
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,760
This was the final midpoint check.

1446
01:40:20,760 --> 01:40:23,610
Great work and we look forward to a great performance.

1447
01:40:23,610 --> 01:40:26,850
Thank you.

1448
01:40:26,850 --> 01:40:28,570
See you at the finals.

1449
01:40:28,570 --> 01:40:29,750
Fighting!

1450
01:40:29,750 --> 01:40:31,320
Thank you.

1451
01:40:31,320 --> 01:40:35,050
(Their eyes are wandering for some reason)

1452
01:40:35,960 --> 01:40:37,520
Fighting.

1453
01:40:37,520 --> 01:40:39,290
(As the producers are about to leave...)

1454
01:40:40,300 --> 01:40:41,600
(Suddenly, jelly hell begins)

1455
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:44,340
What's this? Something's happening.

1456
01:40:44,340 --> 01:40:46,620
Are we getting eliminated?

1457
01:40:46,620 --> 01:40:48,070
Seriously.

1458
01:40:48,070 --> 01:40:50,160
Let's get ready to pop out.

1459
01:40:50,160 --> 01:40:51,630
Yes, go...

1460
01:40:51,630 --> 01:40:54,010
Hurry, hurry.

1461
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,500
What is this?

1462
01:40:55,500 --> 01:40:56,810
What?

1463
01:40:56,810 --> 01:40:59,200
- What?
- Hello!

1464
01:40:59,200 --> 01:41:01,330
(What is the video that made the producers laugh?)

1465
01:41:01,330 --> 01:41:04,100
One, two, three. Hello!

1466
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,460
Today, we prepared

1467
01:41:06,460 --> 01:41:09,350
super special surprise for the producers!

1468
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:10,990
- Yay!
- What?

1469
01:41:10,990 --> 01:41:12,550
What are you doing?

1470
01:41:12,550 --> 01:41:13,880
What are you doing?

1471
01:41:13,880 --> 01:41:15,520
What is this?

1472
01:41:15,520 --> 01:41:17,280
(Love you)

1473
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,600
(Come back)

1474
01:41:19,260 --> 01:41:21,480
What are you doing?

1475
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,470
Are you going to make me cry?

1476
01:41:25,490 --> 01:41:27,530
(At that time, outside the practice room...)

1477
01:41:27,530 --> 01:41:29,840
(Fuko on a secret mission)

1478
01:41:32,010 --> 01:41:34,080
(Surprise cake is here)

1479
01:41:34,860 --> 01:41:37,170
- What?
- We made it.

1480
01:41:37,170 --> 01:41:39,640
There's writing on it.

1481
01:41:39,640 --> 01:41:42,200
(Special lettering cake from I-LANDERS)

1482
01:41:42,200 --> 01:41:45,480
What? When did you prepare this?

1483
01:41:45,480 --> 01:41:47,120
(Three hours before midpoint check)

1484
01:41:47,120 --> 01:41:49,020
This is perfect.

1485
01:41:49,020 --> 01:41:51,420
(I-LANDERS prepared a surprise event to commemorate the final midpoint check)

1486
01:41:52,200 --> 01:41:55,420
I've never received anything like this.

1487
01:41:55,420 --> 01:41:57,750
We have a small surprise for you.

1488
01:41:57,750 --> 01:42:00,090
We will now begin the award ceremony.

1489
01:42:00,090 --> 01:42:02,650
We will now begin the award ceremony.

1490
01:42:02,650 --> 01:42:03,880
So cute.

1491
01:42:03,880 --> 01:42:06,250
(Award!)

1492
01:42:07,300 --> 01:42:08,470
What award am I getting?

1493
01:42:08,470 --> 01:42:11,280
(To Producer Monika)

1494
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:13,850
I-LAND's mother.

1495
01:42:13,850 --> 01:42:16,310
Director Monika.

1496
01:42:16,310 --> 01:42:18,840
Through your sweet, tough love and motherly smile...

1497
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,580
Don't make me say it twice.

1498
01:42:20,580 --> 01:42:21,800
Wow.

1499
01:42:21,800 --> 01:42:23,600
You're an amazing woman.

1500
01:42:23,600 --> 01:42:26,070
For being am amazing mother to all I-LANDERS,

1501
01:42:26,070 --> 01:42:29,120
we award you this adorable award.

1502
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:32,350
Gosh, thank you.

1503
01:42:32,350 --> 01:42:35,850
Unni became a mother.

1504
01:42:35,850 --> 01:42:37,230
Mother...

1505
01:42:37,230 --> 01:42:39,850
(To Producer Leejung)

1506
01:42:39,850 --> 01:42:44,670
You're so sweet, so you're getting the Heart Attack Award.

1507
01:42:46,010 --> 01:42:49,090
You're so lovely from head to toe.

1508
01:42:49,090 --> 01:42:50,520
What is this?

1509
01:42:50,520 --> 01:42:51,630
There we go!

1510
01:42:51,630 --> 01:42:53,640
Yes! Wow!

1511
01:42:53,640 --> 01:42:55,860
So good.

1512
01:42:55,860 --> 01:42:59,510
Your charm turns our eyes into hearts,

1513
01:42:59,510 --> 01:43:02,020
so, we give you this award.

1514
01:43:02,020 --> 01:43:04,230
Thank you.

1515
01:43:04,230 --> 01:43:06,040
Thank you.

1516
01:43:06,840 --> 01:43:08,070
What award is this?

1517
01:43:08,070 --> 01:43:09,300
(To Producer VVN)

1518
01:43:09,300 --> 01:43:11,580
(Secretly looking forward)

1519
01:43:11,580 --> 01:43:14,060
What award is this?

1520
01:43:14,060 --> 01:43:16,790
Your beauty deserves the Statue Award.

1521
01:43:16,790 --> 01:43:22,920
(I-LAND's Statue Award: VVN)

1522
01:43:23,830 --> 01:43:26,600
Your candy-like eyes

1523
01:43:27,530 --> 01:43:29,720
and lethal jawline.

1524
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,960
You spoiled I-LANDERS with your beauty, therefore we award you.

1525
01:43:35,960 --> 01:43:37,910
From the I-LANDERS.

1526
01:43:40,020 --> 01:43:42,390
Thank you.

1527
01:43:42,390 --> 01:43:45,000
And lastly, to Producer 24...

1528
01:43:45,000 --> 01:43:47,020
(To Producer 24)

1529
01:43:47,020 --> 01:43:49,610
We award you an award.

1530
01:43:49,610 --> 01:43:50,940
I can't wait.

1531
01:43:50,940 --> 01:43:53,560
I really can't wait.

1532
01:43:53,560 --> 01:43:56,150
What award will he get?

1533
01:43:58,420 --> 01:44:00,890
(Reading the room)

1534
01:44:00,890 --> 01:44:04,780
(What will the name of the much anticipated Producer 24's award be?)

1535
01:44:04,780 --> 01:44:09,980
You can't treat a midpoint check this way.

1536
01:44:09,980 --> 01:44:12,640
What feedback could we possibly give you?

1537
01:44:12,640 --> 01:44:15,290
(What award will Producer 24 receive?)

1538
01:44:17,010 --> 01:44:19,710
Surprisingly Cute Award.

1539
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:21,080
(Cracking up, shocked)

1540
01:44:22,570 --> 01:44:24,840
(Shocked)

1541
01:44:26,150 --> 01:44:27,490
(The cutie who cannot raise his head)

1542
01:44:27,490 --> 01:44:30,030
"Surprisingly cute."

1543
01:44:30,030 --> 01:44:31,280
"Surprisingly cute."

1544
01:44:31,280 --> 01:44:33,590
You seem cold and scary on the outside

1545
01:44:33,590 --> 01:44:36,220
but you're warm and surprisingly cute on the inside.

1546
01:44:36,220 --> 01:44:38,990
You were very charming with us I-LANDERS.

1547
01:44:38,990 --> 01:44:41,540
On behalf of I-LAND, I present you with this award.

1548
01:44:41,540 --> 01:44:45,090
Wow. You really are surprisingly cute.

1549
01:44:45,090 --> 01:44:46,510
(The surprise cutie showing it off right away)

1550
01:44:46,510 --> 01:44:47,790
It's well made.

1551
01:44:47,790 --> 01:44:50,070
(An award that looks exactly like the cute producer)

1552
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:52,430
So cute.

1553
01:44:52,430 --> 01:44:56,680
(After the award ceremony, the gift exchange)

1554
01:44:56,680 --> 01:44:59,780
Is that mine? Thank you!

1555
01:44:59,780 --> 01:45:02,760
Thank you so much. I'm so excited.

1556
01:45:02,760 --> 01:45:04,580
- What is it? Did you make it?
- Yes.

1557
01:45:04,580 --> 01:45:07,950
It's so cute.

1558
01:45:07,950 --> 01:45:13,590
These are moru dolls we made especially for the producers.

1559
01:45:13,590 --> 01:45:15,270
Wait, is this my piercing?

1560
01:45:15,270 --> 01:45:17,160
That's right!

1561
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:20,510
Thanks! This is so cute!

1562
01:45:20,510 --> 01:45:22,330
Thank you.

1563
01:45:23,890 --> 01:45:27,230
Mine... is really big.

1564
01:45:28,710 --> 01:45:31,540
(Producer 24's doll is twice as big)

1565
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,020
I'm so touched.

1566
01:45:33,020 --> 01:45:36,110
You didn't even have enough time to practice, and this...

1567
01:45:36,110 --> 01:45:38,950
No wonder they didn't have the lyrics memorized.

1568
01:45:38,950 --> 01:45:41,010
Teacher!

1569
01:45:41,010 --> 01:45:43,340
This is so nice.

1570
01:45:43,340 --> 01:45:48,550
No matter what dreams you have, I hope they come true.

1571
01:45:49,810 --> 01:45:52,730
It really feels like the end.

1572
01:45:53,730 --> 01:45:55,290
- I know.
- Are you crying?

1573
01:45:55,290 --> 01:45:57,310
No.

1574
01:45:57,310 --> 01:46:01,160
- I'm happy.
- If you cry, it will be on air.

1575
01:46:01,160 --> 01:46:04,010
One, two, three! Thank you!

1576
01:46:04,010 --> 01:46:06,060
Thank you.

1577
01:46:06,060 --> 01:46:07,590
We're so thankful.

1578
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:11,490
(The moving, final surprise midpoint check complete)

1579
01:46:15,210 --> 01:46:16,860
Wow, these are so cute.

1580
01:46:16,860 --> 01:46:21,760
The producers are showing off their dolls from the I-LANDERS.

1581
01:46:21,760 --> 01:46:24,880
I'm so jealous of everything today.

1582
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:30,380
If you have the chance, please make one for me next time.

1583
01:46:30,380 --> 01:46:33,830
Please make one for me as well.

1584
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:37,120
I was reminiscing about my time with the masters.

1585
01:46:37,120 --> 01:46:40,470
I miss you, masters.

1586
01:46:41,820 --> 01:46:47,870
Producer Taeyang, you won the award for You Are So Cool Award.

1587
01:46:47,870 --> 01:46:51,290
Please give a little speech.

1588
01:46:51,290 --> 01:46:56,610
I couldn't be there that day, so I didn't receive the award directly.

1589
01:46:56,610 --> 01:47:01,640
I'm so happy to receive such a tremendous, meaningful award.

1590
01:47:01,640 --> 01:47:07,080
I want to thank my parents for giving me such a vibe at birth.

1591
01:47:07,080 --> 01:47:11,560
I also want to thank the staff of THEBLACKLABEL

1592
01:47:11,560 --> 01:47:15,730
who give me overwhelming support to maintain the force

1593
01:47:15,730 --> 01:47:18,800
and our fans. Thank you so much.

1594
01:47:18,800 --> 01:47:22,140
It's all because of you. Thank you.

1595
01:47:22,140 --> 01:47:24,880
Oppa means it. Every time.

1596
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:31,750
Producer 24, you won the Surprisingly Cute Award.

1597
01:47:31,750 --> 01:47:33,810
Are you happy?

1598
01:47:33,810 --> 01:47:37,490
It's something I hear from time to time.

1599
01:47:39,180 --> 01:47:41,230
I'm kidding.

1600
01:47:41,230 --> 01:47:42,870
It made me very happy.

1601
01:47:42,870 --> 01:47:48,990
I will make sure to keep being cute. Thank you.

1602
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:50,570
Thank you.

1603
01:47:50,570 --> 01:47:56,920
Anyway, that's not the only surprise event from the I-LANDERS.

1604
01:47:56,920 --> 01:48:00,580
I hear there's one more special gift awaiting.

1605
01:48:00,580 --> 01:48:03,310
Who is this event for?

1606
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:06,270
Let's see it right now.

1607
01:48:09,180 --> 01:48:12,910
(Busy preparing for the test)

1608
01:48:17,120 --> 01:48:18,820
No way. What?

1609
01:48:18,820 --> 01:48:21,560
(Saebi is frozen in her dance pose)

1610
01:48:21,560 --> 01:48:23,370
I-LANDERS.

1611
01:48:23,370 --> 01:48:24,620
(Why is she calling us?)

1612
01:48:24,620 --> 01:48:25,710
(Squirming)

1613
01:48:27,420 --> 01:48:30,150
- A special gift is here for you.
- What is it?

1614
01:48:30,150 --> 01:48:32,910
Please head to the living-

1615
01:48:32,910 --> 01:48:35,020
(They run after hearing "living room")

1616
01:48:35,020 --> 01:48:37,090
(Running faster than the speed of light)

1617
01:48:37,090 --> 01:48:39,260
(Strong people at the front)

1618
01:48:39,260 --> 01:48:41,940
What is this?

1619
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:44,890
(What is the special gift that arrived for I-LANDERS?)

1620
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:47,810
Handwritten letters from I-MATES!

1621
01:48:47,810 --> 01:48:49,130
Handwritten letters?

1622
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:50,370
(Letters from I-MATES)

1623
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:52,380
(Speechless)

1624
01:48:52,380 --> 01:48:56,070
(Handwritten letters from I-MATES from 216 countries)

1625
01:48:59,060 --> 01:49:00,820
Handwritten letters?

1626
01:49:00,820 --> 01:49:03,230
I'm so excited.

1627
01:49:04,860 --> 01:49:07,310
Someone from the UK wrote in Korean.

1628
01:49:07,310 --> 01:49:10,850
They're wishing me a happy birthday a month in advance.

1629
01:49:13,190 --> 01:49:15,040
What is it?

1630
01:49:15,040 --> 01:49:18,250
They did such a good job.

1631
01:49:18,250 --> 01:49:20,290
Wow.

1632
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:21,810
It's so...

1633
01:49:21,810 --> 01:49:23,890
(A Spanish I-MATE drew Senorita Jiyoon)

1634
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:25,130
(How Yoon Jiyoon reads a letter)

1635
01:49:25,130 --> 01:49:27,320
Wow.

1636
01:49:27,320 --> 01:49:30,210
Wow.

1637
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:32,310
Am I dreaming?

1638
01:49:32,310 --> 01:49:35,890
(Teary-eyed type)

1639
01:49:35,890 --> 01:49:37,780
(Teary?)

1640
01:49:37,780 --> 01:49:39,370
(Sobbing)

1641
01:49:39,370 --> 01:49:40,530
(What about Koko?)

1642
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,700
(Silently happy)

1643
01:49:42,700 --> 01:49:44,670
It's already so cool to see I-MATES from the stage.

1644
01:49:44,670 --> 01:49:48,610
Reading their letters was so cool.

1645
01:49:48,610 --> 01:49:52,360
Hi Sarang, I had the opportunity to send you a letter.

1646
01:49:52,360 --> 01:49:56,550
After you were the first to appear in Episode 1 of I-LAND,

1647
01:49:56,550 --> 01:49:59,830
you're the only one I've watched for.

1648
01:49:59,830 --> 01:50:01,590
Sarang!

1649
01:50:04,390 --> 01:50:07,750
Sarang, you are doing so well.

1650
01:50:07,750 --> 01:50:11,750
I don't want people to be disappointed in me.

1651
01:50:12,720 --> 01:50:15,430
I'm so anxious.

1652
01:50:17,530 --> 01:50:21,980
Don't feel too much pressure, and just enjoy performing.

1653
01:50:21,980 --> 01:50:28,390
I'm going to root for Sarang, no matter what she does.

1654
01:50:28,390 --> 01:50:31,850
Jeemin, when you're anxious about making a mistake onstage,

1655
01:50:31,850 --> 01:50:34,890
listen to the people who are rooting for you.

1656
01:50:34,890 --> 01:50:39,320
Unni, when I'm going through a difficult time or when I'm sad,

1657
01:50:39,320 --> 01:50:43,360
you're like a friend who gives me strength.

1658
01:50:43,360 --> 01:50:46,880
Hi Jiyoon, I'm a fan who cares about you so much.

1659
01:50:46,880 --> 01:50:51,800
The Jiyoon I saw on TV is so special.

1660
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,790
You are such a good person, so when I saw you-

1661
01:50:59,340 --> 01:51:02,790
You are such a good person, so when I saw you-

1662
01:51:06,640 --> 01:51:10,790
You are such a good person, so when I saw you lose confidence

1663
01:51:10,790 --> 01:51:15,570
or be disappointed that your hard work didn't pay off,

1664
01:51:15,570 --> 01:51:17,860
I was so heartbroken.

1665
01:51:20,500 --> 01:51:22,950
I did my best.

1666
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:26,910
- You did.
- But nobody knows.

1667
01:51:29,510 --> 01:51:32,590
Jiyoon, we know...

1668
01:51:35,220 --> 01:51:37,880
Jiyoon, we know you work so hard.

1669
01:51:37,880 --> 01:51:42,540
You're doing so well. Please know so many people root for you.

1670
01:51:42,540 --> 01:51:45,520
You're going to debut for sure. We love you, Yoon Jiyoon.

1671
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:51,220
(I love you, I will always root for you)

1672
01:51:51,220 --> 01:51:53,820
(I will always love you)

1673
01:51:54,820 --> 01:52:00,830
Dear I-MATES, thank you for giving me so much strength.

1674
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:04,710
I really cherish you. I love you.

1675
01:52:04,710 --> 01:52:06,550
I love you, too.

1676
01:52:06,550 --> 01:52:07,970
(Embarrassed)

1677
01:52:07,970 --> 01:52:10,420
I love you.

1678
01:52:10,420 --> 01:52:12,310
I love you always.

1679
01:52:12,310 --> 01:52:13,820
I love you.

1680
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:18,360
(I Will Always Love You)

1681
01:52:18,360 --> 01:52:23,320
(IWALY)

1682
01:52:45,580 --> 01:52:48,190
("IWALY")

1683
01:56:01,870 --> 01:56:06,540
The gift was a performance for I-MATES.

1684
01:56:06,540 --> 01:56:11,650
That was a special performance by the Final 10.

1685
01:56:11,650 --> 01:56:14,200
This song was written by Producer VVN.

1686
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:17,110
It was also a test song before Part 2.

1687
01:56:17,110 --> 01:56:20,130
I always love hearing this song.

1688
01:56:26,970 --> 01:56:31,990
Just like the title, it has so much love and gratitude for I-MATES.

1689
01:56:31,990 --> 01:56:34,180
Thank you for a great performance.

1690
01:56:34,180 --> 01:56:39,880
I hope the I-LANDERS' hearts came through to you all.

1691
01:56:43,250 --> 01:56:49,000
Alright, I'm hearing that the votes have been counted.

1692
01:56:50,540 --> 01:56:54,550
In a moment, we will find out who will achieve their dreams

1693
01:56:54,550 --> 01:56:57,800
of being in izna, the iconic girl group produced by Teddy.

1694
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:01,210
We will be announcing its debut group members.

1695
01:57:04,280 --> 01:57:08,280
Producer Monika, I'm sure you have mixed feelings right now.

1696
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:10,740
How do you feel?

1697
01:57:12,210 --> 01:57:18,020
I've been with I-LAND 2 while an entire season has changed.

1698
01:57:18,020 --> 01:57:24,710
They have grown tremendously during this time.

1699
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:31,110
I might be a producer, but often, I was the one learning.

1700
01:57:31,110 --> 01:57:39,520
The important thing is that today is not the end but their beginning.

1701
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:46,120
I'm happy to be with them on their first day.

1702
01:57:49,780 --> 01:57:53,110
The producers do not know the final results yet.

1703
01:57:53,110 --> 01:58:01,060
Producer 24, what's on your mind before the final decision?

1704
01:58:01,060 --> 01:58:07,100
Something I've emphasized since the start of I-LAND

1705
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:12,640
is that a member who has an irreplaceable, unique strength

1706
01:58:14,170 --> 01:58:17,250
is likely to be chosen.

1707
01:58:17,250 --> 01:58:20,160
You really are surprisingly cute. Thank you.

1708
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:22,540
Producer VVN, what about you?

1709
01:58:23,560 --> 01:58:28,650
There is no one left who is lacking in talent.

1710
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:34,360
I think people who are colorful and unique will win.

1711
01:58:35,720 --> 01:58:37,180
Thank you.

1712
01:58:38,000 --> 01:58:40,620
This is the last story of I-LANDERS,

1713
01:58:40,620 --> 01:58:44,950
who gave up everything else in order to debut.

1714
01:58:44,950 --> 01:58:49,240
In a moment, we will announce the members of izna,

1715
01:58:49,240 --> 01:58:53,130
the iconic girl group produced by Teddy.

1716
01:58:58,740 --> 01:59:00,770
(The last night in I-LAND)

1717
01:59:00,770 --> 01:59:04,360
Tomorrow is the last time we get to be onstage.

1718
01:59:04,360 --> 01:59:07,670
Tomorrow, we won't be here.

1719
01:59:07,670 --> 01:59:10,350
Really? We don't have to be here?

1720
01:59:10,350 --> 01:59:13,460
I feel like we'll be here again.

1721
01:59:13,460 --> 01:59:16,680
It seemed like it was never going to end.

1722
01:59:16,680 --> 01:59:19,400
It really is the Final Countdown.

1723
01:59:19,400 --> 01:59:22,250
I-LAND 2: Final Countdown.

1724
01:59:22,250 --> 01:59:25,340
(They perfectly copy the system's voice)

1725
01:59:25,340 --> 01:59:27,750
This is the 4th test toward debut.

1726
01:59:27,750 --> 01:59:30,570
- We won't be hearing that voice again.
- Right.

1727
01:59:30,570 --> 01:59:32,620
Bye, house.

1728
01:59:32,620 --> 01:59:34,870
It's really goodbye.

1729
01:59:34,870 --> 01:59:37,360
I thought I-LAND would never end.

1730
01:59:37,360 --> 01:59:39,110
Forever.

1731
01:59:39,110 --> 01:59:40,830
(Knock knock)

1732
01:59:40,830 --> 01:59:42,160
Hey!

1733
01:59:42,160 --> 01:59:44,560
Excuse me.

1734
01:59:44,560 --> 01:59:46,050
What are you holding?

1735
01:59:46,050 --> 01:59:48,080
It's our last night.

1736
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:50,710
- Should we have a sleepover?
- Yes!

1737
01:59:50,710 --> 01:59:53,640
(Falling asleep together on the last night so they're not lonely)

1738
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:56,570
Unni, me, too. Sleep next to me.

1739
01:59:56,570 --> 01:59:58,100
Let's all sleep together.

1740
01:59:58,100 --> 02:00:00,850
The four of us here.

1741
02:00:00,850 --> 02:00:04,110
(It's cramped, but we still want to sleep together)

1742
02:00:04,110 --> 02:00:06,330
It's the last day already!

1743
02:00:06,330 --> 02:00:07,970
I know.

1744
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:10,170
I can't believe it.

1745
02:00:10,170 --> 02:00:12,830
Do you remember when we first got here?

1746
02:00:12,830 --> 02:00:14,320
I do.

1747
02:00:14,320 --> 02:00:16,930
I-LAND was sparkling.

1748
02:00:16,930 --> 02:00:18,140
It was huge.

1749
02:00:18,140 --> 02:00:21,540
I was so surprised at how big the building was.

1750
02:00:21,540 --> 02:00:22,980
It was so cool.

1751
02:00:22,980 --> 02:00:26,580
I know I improved my skills and grew here,

1752
02:00:26,580 --> 02:00:28,630
but I also met such good people.

1753
02:00:28,630 --> 02:00:30,790
Totally agree.

1754
02:00:30,790 --> 02:00:35,020
I have so many precious memories.

1755
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:39,550
I have so many happy memories with my friends here.

1756
02:00:39,550 --> 02:00:43,480
It felt long but, at the same time, short.

1757
02:00:43,480 --> 02:00:47,960
It was an opportunity that I'll remember for life.

1758
02:00:49,150 --> 02:00:51,800
(The first day of I-LAND filming)

1759
02:00:51,800 --> 02:00:56,300
Hello, I'm Koko, I'm 17 years old, and I'm from Japan.

1760
02:00:56,330 --> 02:00:58,570
Nice to meet you.

1761
02:00:59,510 --> 02:01:03,790
I thought, "I'm finally here."

1762
02:01:03,790 --> 02:01:07,270
(I-LANDERS gathered here with the dream of debuting)

1763
02:01:08,290 --> 02:01:10,050
To me, I-LAND

1764
02:01:10,050 --> 02:01:13,800
means the beginning.

1765
02:01:13,800 --> 02:01:15,890
It's the beginning of my dreams.

1766
02:01:15,890 --> 02:01:19,680
This is the biggest opportunity of my life.

1767
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:23,180
It's a turning point and a beginning.

1768
02:01:23,180 --> 02:01:28,380
It's where I can grow and achieve my goals.

1769
02:01:28,380 --> 02:01:30,420
(But)

1770
02:01:31,310 --> 02:01:33,500
(They must survive I-LAND in order to debut)

1771
02:01:33,500 --> 02:01:36,300
Please make your way to GROUND.

1772
02:01:36,300 --> 02:01:40,480
If you perform it like that, the whole song becomes depressing.

1773
02:01:40,480 --> 02:01:41,840
It was really not good.

1774
02:01:41,840 --> 02:01:45,190
Here, there's no choice but to be ferocious.

1775
02:01:45,190 --> 02:01:49,550
I came here thinking, "I'm the best."

1776
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:52,610
I had to wonder, "What have I been doing all this time?"

1777
02:01:52,610 --> 02:01:57,670
I felt like I was sinking into a black hole.

1778
02:01:59,300 --> 02:02:01,790
I thought I would just stay in GROUND.

1779
02:02:01,790 --> 02:02:04,610
I'm so anxious.

1780
02:02:06,260 --> 02:02:07,570
I don't want to go.

1781
02:02:07,570 --> 02:02:12,120
(There were exhausting, challenging moments)

1782
02:02:14,050 --> 02:02:15,930
Are you having a hard time with anything?

1783
02:02:15,930 --> 02:02:17,690
I can help.

1784
02:02:17,690 --> 02:02:20,190
It's okay to cry.

1785
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:25,380
It's okay. I can do it.

1786
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,280
I feel grateful for my friends.

1787
02:02:28,280 --> 02:02:33,080
(I-LANDERS always supported each other)

1788
02:02:33,670 --> 02:02:36,600
There were many difficult moments.

1789
02:02:36,600 --> 02:02:42,280
But I'm determined to stay, just like how I came all the way here.

1790
02:02:42,280 --> 02:02:45,310
I can't imagine being anything except an idol.

1791
02:02:45,310 --> 02:02:47,550
I want this so badly.

1792
02:02:47,550 --> 02:02:50,500
(Finally, the moment the debut group is announced)

1793
02:02:50,500 --> 02:02:54,170
I'm so close to debuting.

1794
02:02:54,170 --> 02:02:58,690
If I survive the final, I can debut.

1795
02:02:58,690 --> 02:03:01,560
I really want to seize this opportunity.

1796
02:03:01,560 --> 02:03:04,550
I worked hard, so I'm confident.

1797
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:07,490
I really want to show you my debut.

1798
02:03:07,490 --> 02:03:09,840
I think I'm going to debut for sure.

1799
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,030
I really want to debut with I-LAND.

1800
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:15,790
I can debut.

1801
02:03:15,790 --> 02:03:18,270
I'm going to debut.

1802
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:23,270
(Revealing the final debut group now)

1803
02:03:35,230 --> 02:03:39,250
A savage 11-day survival game toward debut.

1804
02:03:39,250 --> 02:03:41,860
I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN.

1805
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:44,050
This is the final chapter.

1806
02:03:44,050 --> 02:03:46,410
At the end of this long journey,

1807
02:03:46,410 --> 02:03:52,000
who will debut, and who will lose at the last moment?

1808
02:03:53,770 --> 02:03:57,140
The iconic girl group produced by Teddy.

1809
02:03:57,140 --> 02:04:00,580
We will now announce its debut group members.

1810
02:04:07,080 --> 02:04:11,100
Currently, we have 10 I-LANDERS here.

1811
02:04:15,910 --> 02:04:21,790
Among them, only six will debut.

1812
02:04:21,790 --> 02:04:26,690
Who will experience the joy of becoming one of them?

1813
02:04:26,690 --> 02:04:33,320
We will announce the members of izna, chosen by the world.

1814
02:04:36,700 --> 02:04:40,100
First, we will announce the five members

1815
02:04:40,100 --> 02:04:44,400
determined by the I-MATE SAVE VOTE.

1816
02:04:45,540 --> 02:04:48,130
By the way, the votes today were very close.

1817
02:04:48,130 --> 02:04:50,880
It was fiercely competitive.

1818
02:04:50,880 --> 02:04:56,110
Before the vote closed, the ranks were flipped at one point.

1819
02:04:58,140 --> 02:05:00,610
For the final I-MATE SAVE VOTE,

1820
02:05:00,610 --> 02:05:06,810
voters participated from 217 countries and regions.

1821
02:05:08,070 --> 02:05:11,850
To the I-MATES who sent their support to the birth of izna,

1822
02:05:11,850 --> 02:05:14,080
thank you from the bottom of our hearts.

1823
02:05:19,680 --> 02:05:22,620
These are the final debut members who will work

1824
02:05:22,620 --> 02:05:25,920
as part of the iconic girl group produced by Teddy.

1825
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:32,420
We will now announce the first member of izna

1826
02:05:32,420 --> 02:05:36,140
who was chosen by the final I-MATE SAVE VOTE.

1827
02:05:43,210 --> 02:05:47,900
The first debuting member earned a total of

1828
02:05:47,900 --> 02:05:51,030
320,124 votes in the I-MATE SAVE VOTE.

1829
02:05:51,030 --> 02:05:54,540
She came in 4th out of 10.

1830
02:06:00,680 --> 02:06:04,210
In the Part 2 tests,

1831
02:06:04,210 --> 02:06:08,060
she once came in the top 3 of individual scores.

1832
02:06:22,250 --> 02:06:26,900
She also served as a leader.

1833
02:06:38,780 --> 02:06:42,160
4th place in the I-MATE SAVE VOTE,

1834
02:06:42,160 --> 02:06:46,010
this is the first debut member.

1835
02:06:56,470 --> 02:07:00,160
The first debut member of izna is...

1836
02:07:12,210 --> 02:07:14,180
Koko.

1837
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:16,540
(First member: 4th place of I-MATE SAVE VOTE, Koko)

1838
02:07:40,630 --> 02:07:41,600
Congratulations.

1839
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:45,060
Koko, please step to the front of the stage.

1840
02:07:47,470 --> 02:07:50,560
Koko has exceptional performance skills and energy.

1841
02:07:50,560 --> 02:07:53,910
In every performance, she demonstrated her stage presence.

1842
02:07:53,910 --> 02:07:59,150
Her growth led to the global I-MATES' choice and to debut.

1843
02:07:59,150 --> 02:08:01,140
Congratulations.

1844
02:08:04,360 --> 02:08:06,980
Koko, you are finally making your debut.

1845
02:08:06,980 --> 02:08:09,320
Please say a few words.

1846
02:08:09,320 --> 02:08:12,270
Hello. It's Koko.

1847
02:08:12,270 --> 02:08:14,590
(4th place, Koko, 320,124 points)

1848
02:08:14,590 --> 02:08:22,210
First, thank you, I-MATES, for voting for me.

1849
02:08:25,690 --> 02:08:31,500
I did not imagine that I would get to debut.

1850
02:08:31,500 --> 02:08:35,540
I am so happy and full of joy.

1851
02:08:37,560 --> 02:08:41,790
My 23 I-LANDER friends,

1852
02:08:41,790 --> 02:08:45,040
the whole staff and team,

1853
02:08:45,040 --> 02:08:49,510
I have so many people to thank.

1854
02:08:49,510 --> 02:08:53,100
I love you. Thank you.

1855
02:08:56,640 --> 02:08:58,830
Good evening, this is Koko.

1856
02:08:58,900 --> 02:09:07,500
Erm... I'm surprised that I'm able to debut right here.

1857
02:09:07,510 --> 02:09:09,950
And also,

1858
02:09:09,950 --> 02:09:12,760
to everyone who voted for me on I-MATE,

1859
02:09:12,800 --> 02:09:14,850
thank you so much.

1860
02:09:14,900 --> 02:09:18,480
Thank you so much for cheering me on.

1861
02:09:18,480 --> 02:09:21,870
This feels surreal. I can't believe it quite yet.

1862
02:09:21,870 --> 02:09:24,780
My mom and dad who gave me so much love.

1863
02:09:24,800 --> 02:09:29,490
You let me learn dance at the age of three

1864
02:09:29,490 --> 02:09:32,000
and let me do everything I wanted to do.

1865
02:09:32,000 --> 02:09:36,870
Thank you for believing in me and supporting me.

1866
02:09:36,870 --> 02:09:39,590
I am able to be here because of my family.

1867
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:44,930
I-MATES, thank you for your support.

1868
02:09:46,510 --> 02:09:48,610
Congratulations, Koko.

1869
02:09:48,610 --> 02:09:50,930
Please make your way to the debut group stage.

1870
02:09:54,420 --> 02:09:57,340
Koko, the first debut member,

1871
02:09:57,340 --> 02:10:00,630
has the incredible stat of being 173.5cm tall,

1872
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:04,220
as well as charismatic performance skills, dominating the stage

1873
02:10:04,220 --> 02:10:09,210
I look forward to seeing Koko as a member of izna.

1874
02:10:09,210 --> 02:10:13,650
I imagine Koko is a very happy girl today.

1875
02:10:13,650 --> 02:10:16,390
Once again, congratulations.

1876
02:10:26,940 --> 02:10:29,970
We will now announce the second member

1877
02:10:29,970 --> 02:10:33,750
of izna chosen by I-MATES.

1878
02:10:39,730 --> 02:10:41,650
The second debuting member

1879
02:10:41,650 --> 02:10:47,750
earned a total of 471,699 votes in the final I-MATE SAVE VOTE.

1880
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:51,020
She came in 3rd place.

1881
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:01,420
This member...

1882
02:11:01,420 --> 02:11:05,410
was part of the "Drip" Unit today.

1883
02:11:22,140 --> 02:11:26,980
In Part 2, she performed in the center position.

1884
02:11:54,920 --> 02:11:57,830
Coming in 3rd place in the I-MATE SAVE VOTE,

1885
02:11:57,830 --> 02:12:01,850
this is the second member to make her debut dreams come true.

1886
02:12:05,500 --> 02:12:11,600
The second member to be a part of the Teddy-produced group...

1887
02:12:24,280 --> 02:12:27,740
The second debuting member is Yoon Jiyoon.

1888
02:12:28,330 --> 02:12:31,830
(Second member: 3rd place of I-MATE SAVE VOTE, Yoon Jiyoon)

1889
02:12:48,280 --> 02:12:52,580
Congratulations, Jiyoon. Please step to the front of the stage.

1890
02:12:55,490 --> 02:12:58,340
Yoon Jiyoon is an I-LANDER with a unique voice

1891
02:12:58,340 --> 02:13:01,210
and intoxicating charms.

1892
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:05,000
With her singular personality and detailed delivery onstage,

1893
02:13:05,000 --> 02:13:07,880
she won the enthusiastic support of I-MATES.

1894
02:13:09,950 --> 02:13:11,530
I-LANDER Yoon Jiyoon,

1895
02:13:11,530 --> 02:13:13,060
it's been a turbulent journey,

1896
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:16,190
but thanks to the I-MATES, your dreams have come true.

1897
02:13:16,190 --> 02:13:18,980
Please say a few words.

1898
02:13:20,190 --> 02:13:23,060
When I began this journey,

1899
02:13:23,060 --> 02:13:28,690
I did not expect to come in 3rd place

1900
02:13:28,690 --> 02:13:32,450
and debut with the I-MATES' support.

1901
02:13:34,650 --> 02:13:38,180
I-LAND seemed endless, but it's over.

1902
02:13:38,180 --> 02:13:41,270
My debut felt so far away,

1903
02:13:41,270 --> 02:13:45,040
but now it's here.

1904
02:13:48,970 --> 02:13:56,050
I'm grateful to the five producers who taught us wholeheartedly.

1905
02:13:56,050 --> 02:13:59,880
Teddy is someone I look up to very, very much.

1906
02:13:59,880 --> 02:14:05,600
It's an honor to start my journey with him.

1907
02:14:05,600 --> 02:14:08,750
Producer 24, when I was a nobody,

1908
02:14:08,750 --> 02:14:12,450
you held my hand.

1909
02:14:14,120 --> 02:14:20,010
Thank you for making me the person I am.

1910
02:14:21,450 --> 02:14:25,390
If you've watched the show, you know this.

1911
02:14:26,450 --> 02:14:28,600
I...

1912
02:14:28,600 --> 02:14:32,150
the show did a great job of

1913
02:14:32,150 --> 02:14:35,380
portraying my personality in a multi-dimensional way.

1914
02:14:37,960 --> 02:14:42,400
Before the show, I was scared that

1915
02:14:42,400 --> 02:14:46,540
if people knew who I was, they would turn against me.

1916
02:14:46,540 --> 02:14:49,200
But those fears have calmed down now.

1917
02:14:49,200 --> 02:14:52,730
That's why I really want

1918
02:14:52,730 --> 02:14:56,510
to thank the producing team.

1919
02:14:59,540 --> 02:15:03,340
So many people cried and laughed alongside me

The second debuting member, Yoon Jiyoon

1928
02:15:36,110 --> 02:15:41,110
is a vocalist with a unique tone and lovely singing style.

1929
02:15:41,110 --> 02:15:44,290
She knows how to interpret a song with sensitivity to detail.

1930
02:15:44,290 --> 02:15:48,060
I can't wait to hear Jiyoon's voice ring out

1931
02:15:48,060 --> 02:15:50,700
to the world as a member of izna.

1932

1946
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:07,470
Today is Day 2115 since Jeemin started training.

1947
02:19:07,470 --> 02:19:10,290
She wanted to debut more than anyone else.

1948
02:19:10,290 --> 02:19:12,880
She improved upon her solid foundation in I-LAND,

1949
02:19:12,880 --> 02:19:18,450
finally receiving the gift of a debut from I-MATES.

1950
02:19:19,920 --> 02:19:24,070
Jeemin, you must have waited for this moment for a long time.

1951
02:19:24,070 --> 02:19:25,510
You must have a lot of emotions.

1952
02:19:25,510 --> 02:19:27,240
Tell us how you feel.

1953
02:19:27,240 --> 02:19:29,130
Please make it long.

1954
02:19:29,130 --> 02:19:32,530
(2nd place, Bang Jeemin, 591,495 points)

1955
02:19:32,530 --> 02:19:42,670
First, thank you, I-MATES, for believing in me and voting for me.

1956
02:19:42,670 --> 02:19:44,320
I...

1957
02:19:50,790 --> 02:19:54,430
went through many tough moments,

1958
02:19:54,430 --> 02:19:56,500
but thanks to the fans who supported me

1959
02:19:56,500 --> 02:20:02,930
and the producers who coached me, I was able to grow

1960
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:07,140
and make my debut.

1961
02:20:07,140 --> 02:20:12,470
I want to be someone who gives my fans strength.

1962
02:20:12,470 --> 02:20:18,270
Also, my family has cheered me on more than anyone else.

1963
02:20:18,270 --> 02:20:23,070

1964
02:20:26,110 --> 02:20:30,820

Please make your way to the debut group stage.

1969
02:20:46,420 --> 02:20:49,190
Bang Jeemin, the third debut member,

1970
02:20:49,190 --> 02:20:52,410
is a natural idol who makes us focus on her onstage.

1971
02:20:52,410 --> 02:20:56,810
She dominates the stage with the main character's energy.

1972
02:20:56,810 --> 02:20:59,490
It took her so long to get to her debut.

1973
02:20:59,490 --> 02:21:04,920
I hope she soars even higher and shines even brighter in izna.

1974
02:21:04,920 --> 02:21:10,380
I-LANDER Bang Jeemin, you don't have to be sad anymore.

1975
02:21:30,750 --> 02:21:35,980

(Fourth member: 1st place of I-MATE SAVE VOTE, Choi Jungeun)

1985
02:23:43,860 --> 02:23:47,630
Jungeun, please step to the front of the stage.

1986
02:23:49,020 --> 02:23:53,770
Choi Jungeun showed off her energetic voice and performance on each stage

1987
02:23:53,770 --> 02:23:57,290
and stood out in the eyes of the producers and I-MATES.

1989
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:05,280
and successfully made her debut. Congratulations.

1990

(1st Place, Choi Jungeun, 823,393 points)

1993
02:24:17,790 --> 02:24:22,990
I started Part 1 in 1st place.

1994
02:24:22,990 --> 02:24:27,660
I had a lot of challenges and fears.

1995
02:24:27,660 --> 02:24:35,430
Thank you for letting me debut in 1st place at the finals.

1996
02:24:36,700 --> 02:24:43,120
Thanks to the five producers who always helped me out,

1997
02:24:43,120 --> 02:24:46,260
I was able to grow so much.

1998
02:24:46,260 --> 02:24:52,510
I'm so thankful and happy that I got to make memories

1999
02:24:52,510 --> 02:24:55,570
in I-LAND with 23 of my friends.

2000
02:24:55,570 --> 02:25:02,640

And lastly, my precious I-MATES, thank you so, so much.

2004
02:25:29,090 --> 02:25:33,750
Without you, I wouldn't be here.

2005
02:25:33,750 --> 02:25:40,500
It's amazing to see so many fans in front of me. I'm so happy.

2006
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:47,160
And my WakeOn family that I spent four years with,

2007

thank you so much.

2008
02:25:53,690 --> 02:25:59,090
Choi Jungeun's journey on I-LAND might be over,

2009
02:25:59,090 --> 02:26:02,420
but I am starting over as Choi Jungeun in izna.

2010
02:26:02,420 --> 02:26:07,790
Please keep supporting me. Thank you.

2011
02:26:10,580 --> 02:26:14,350
Congratulations, please make your way to the debut stage.

2012
02:26:17,180 --> 02:26:21,630
The fourth member, Choi Jungeun, not only has strong vocals

2013
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:25,910
but is also an all-rounder who pulls off a dance performance.

2014
02:26:25,910 --> 02:26:29,200
She might be young, but she's a sharp leader.

2015
02:26:29,200 --> 02:26:35,390

Only one more person will debut through the I-MATE vote.

2021
02:27:26,960 --> 02:27:29,310
If your name is not called next,

2022
02:27:29,310 --> 02:27:33,230
the producers' choice will determine your fate.

2023

I-LANDER Ryu Sarang.

2038
02:31:30,770 --> 02:31:33,290
I-LANDER Jeong Saebi.

2039
02:31:38,080 --> 02:31:46,500
The two were neck-and-neck in the votes until the very end.

2040
02:31:48,390 --> 02:31:54,330
There is one winner who secured her debut through the vote.

2041
02:31:57,840 --> 02:32:00,820

(Fifth member: 5th place of I-MATE SAVE VOTE, Ryu Sarang)

2045
02:33:33,290 --> 02:33:38,490
Ryu Sarang is the final choice of the I-MATES.

2046
02:33:41,340 --> 02:33:48,330
Last week, Ryu Sarang was in 7th place, up for elimination.

2047
02:33:48,330 --> 02:33:51,310
Maybe her perfectionism, desperation, and ferocity worked.

2048
02:33:51,310 --> 02:33:55,310
She came in 5th place in the final vote, making her debut.

2049
02:33:55,310 --> 02:33:57,760
Congratulations.

2050
02:33:59,700 --> 02:34:05,770
Sarang, it must be moving to debut as the I-MATES' choice.

2051
02:34:08,750 --> 02:34:11,650
Please say a few words.

2052
02:34:16,190 --> 02:34:22,500
(5th place, Ryu Sarang, 319,693 points)

2053
02:34:22,500 --> 02:34:26,120
Hello, it's Sarang.

2054
02:34:27,940 --> 02:34:34,640
First, I want to thank the I-MATES, who supported me

2055
02:34:34,640 --> 02:34:43,980
during I-LAND and made my dreams of debut come true.

2056
02:34:44,890 --> 02:34:49,640
I was a trainee for a long time.

2057
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:55,060
There were so many scary moments.

2058
02:34:55,060 --> 02:35:01,330
I've fantasized about this moment countless times.

2059
02:35:01,330 --> 02:35:06,820
Now that it's real, I still feel like I'm dreaming and can't believe it.

2060
02:35:09,020 --> 02:35:15,860
I-LAND was a place where I learned and grew so much.

2061
02:35:15,860 --> 02:35:20,950
I was able to grow and get to where I am thanks to

2062
02:35:20,950 --> 02:35:25,970
so many I-MATES, the producers,

2063
02:35:25,970 --> 02:35:31,350
my 23 friends, the I-LAND crew, the WakeOn family,

2064
02:35:31,350 --> 02:35:35,170
AA staff, thank you so much.

2065
02:35:35,170 --> 02:35:41,220
Thank you to the teachers who taught me so much so far.

2066
02:35:41,220 --> 02:35:45,220
I am no longer trainee Ryu Sarang.

2067
02:35:45,220 --> 02:35:48,940
As Ryu Sarang, a member of izna,

2068
02:35:49,890 --> 02:35:55,880
I will not stop here. I will keep growing

2069
02:35:55,880 --> 02:36:03,240
and further, share the love I-MATES have given me.

2070
02:36:03,240 --> 02:36:05,560
Once again, thank you so much.

2071
02:36:05,560 --> 02:36:09,840
I'll keep working hard. I love you.

2072

Congratulations, please make your way to the debut stage.

2074
02:36:20,480 --> 02:36:23,400
The fifth debut member, Ryu Sarang,

2075
02:36:23,400 --> 02:36:28,170
is a transforming member who suits any formation.

2076
02:36:28,170 --> 02:36:31,260
She is particularly famous in China for her beauty.

2077
02:36:31,260 --> 02:36:36,380
Her content reached 180 million views.

2078
02:36:36,380 --> 02:36:40,730
I look forward to seeing an even better Ryu Sarang,

2079
02:36:40,730 --> 02:36:43,800
I-Sarang and izna Sarang.

2080
02:36:43,800 --> 02:36:47,120
Ferocious Sarang is love.

2081
02:37:34,320 --> 02:37:39,380
Five debut members have been chosen by the I-MATES.

2082
02:37:39,380 --> 02:37:43,130
There is only one spot left.

2083

There is only one more path to debut,

2084
02:37:46,900 --> 02:37:50,480
being chosen by the producers.

2085
02:37:51,490 --> 02:37:55,710
Who will join the debut group?

2086
02:38:04,140 --> 02:38:08,700
Producers, it's time to make your decision.

2087
02:38:16,730 --> 02:38:19,860
This must be a difficult choice.

2088
02:38:19,860 --> 02:38:22,790
They've been in a fierce debate for a while.

2089
02:38:22,790 --> 02:38:27,660
Please let us know as soon as you've decided.

2090
02:38:32,600 --> 02:38:36,800
The choice lies in the producers' hands.

2091
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:42,090
Who will be the last puzzle piece of the final debut group?

2092
02:38:46,710 --> 02:38:50,940
The chance of debuting is only 1 out of 5.

2093
02:38:50,940 --> 02:38:54,980
Only one person out of the five will debut.

2094
02:38:56,590 --> 02:39:00,840
The producers look at the future big picture, not the present.

2095
02:39:00,840 --> 02:39:03,680
Depending on what kind of vision they have for the group

2096
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:07,060
will determine their final choice.

2097
02:39:07,060 --> 02:39:09,950
Please make your decision carefully.

2098
02:39:09,950 --> 02:39:12,720
But this moment of waiting feels so cruel.

2099
02:39:12,720 --> 02:39:15,770
Who will be chosen?

2100
02:39:16,820 --> 02:39:20,910
Will the I-LANDER you support achieve her dream of debut?

2101
02:39:20,910 --> 02:39:24,590
Please keep watching until the end.

2102
02:39:58,420 --> 02:40:00,810
Looks like they've made their decision.

2103
02:40:00,810 --> 02:40:03,940
The final results have just been delivered to us.

2104
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:05,190
I'm so nervous.

2105
02:40:05,190 --> 02:40:09,250
I will take a peek first.

2106
02:40:09,250 --> 02:40:11,990
The two of us will go slowly.

2107
02:40:30,160 --> 02:40:33,220
After much deliberation,

2108
02:40:33,220 --> 02:40:39,360
who will be the sixth debut member the producers have chosen?

2109
02:40:47,020 --> 02:40:50,340
We will call out the names of the three candidates.

2110
02:40:50,340 --> 02:40:56,320
The two who are not called, unfortunately, are eliminated.

2111
02:41:09,680 --> 02:41:11,160
Announcing now.

2112
02:41:11,160 --> 02:41:13,430
The first candidate...

2113
02:41:31,770 --> 02:41:36,700
The first candidate is I-LANDER Jeong Saebi.

2114
02:41:47,220 --> 02:41:49,770
Next, the second candidate.

2115
02:42:01,340 --> 02:42:03,390
I-LANDER Fuko.

2116
02:42:19,130 --> 02:42:21,820
The third candidate.

2117
02:42:39,970 --> 02:42:42,240
I-LANDER Mai.

2118
02:42:44,900 --> 02:42:48,720
Please step to the center of the stage.

2119
02:43:07,460 --> 02:43:15,470
Who will earn the honor of debuting through the producers?

2120
02:43:30,220 --> 02:43:32,680
Jeong Saebi.

2121
02:43:32,680 --> 02:43:34,400
Fuko.

2122
02:43:36,620 --> 02:43:38,060
Mai.

2123
02:43:47,400 --> 02:43:51,350
At the end of the long journey of I-LAND, this member will

2124
02:43:51,350 --> 02:43:54,820
join izna as the producers' choice.

2125
02:44:26,330 --> 02:44:29,090
Who will be the honored sixth member?

2126
02:44:31,060 --> 02:44:33,690
We will reveal it shortly.

2127
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:50,360
We are broadcast live with Mnet

2128
02:44:50,360 --> 02:44:54,760
I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN's final announcements.

2129
02:44:54,760 --> 02:44:58,340
This is the moment where izna, the iconic girl group

2130
02:44:58,340 --> 02:45:03,970
produced by Teddy, is all coming together.

2131
02:45:10,710 --> 02:45:14,980
We will now announce the sixth debut member.

2132
02:45:18,650 --> 02:45:22,500
We will announce it right away without delay.

2133
02:45:23,500 --> 02:45:27,380
Only one will achieve her dreams as the producers' choice.

2134
02:45:27,380 --> 02:45:29,790
Jeong Saebi, Fuko, or Mai.

2135
02:45:29,790 --> 02:45:32,650
Who will it be among the three?

2136
02:45:36,760 --> 02:45:41,250
That honored name is in my hands right now.

2137
02:46:01,990 --> 02:46:05,620
The sixth debut member, chosen by the producers, is...

2138
02:46:38,450 --> 02:46:41,650
Congratulations, I-LANDER Mai.

2139
02:46:41,650 --> 02:46:45,480
(Sixth member: producers' choice, Mai)

2140
02:47:15,260 --> 02:47:19,550
Mai may look soft on the outside but tough on the inside. She's a hardworking I-LANDER.

2141
02:47:19,550 --> 02:47:25,300
Mai dreamt of becoming a K-Pop idol watching the first season.

2142
02:47:25,300 --> 02:47:28,850
She gave everything she had to this season as a contestant.

2143
02:47:28,850 --> 02:47:34,200
As a result, she is making her debut as the producers' choice.

2144
02:47:36,770 --> 02:47:41,490
Producer 24, I'm curious why you chose her.

2145
02:47:42,740 --> 02:47:49,410
One of the most important criteria for selecting debut members

2146
02:47:49,410 --> 02:47:55,330
is whether someone has a clear strength.

2147
02:47:55,330 --> 02:48:03,700
First, we consider Mai's iconic look to be a strength.

2148
02:48:03,700 --> 02:48:09,250
But Mai was not good enough to be chosen only based on that.

2149
02:48:09,250 --> 02:48:13,840
However, though it felt impossible,

2150
02:48:13,840 --> 02:48:21,000
she overcame her vocal weaknesses in a short period of time.

2151
02:48:21,000 --> 02:48:23,740
We were all very moved.

2152
02:48:23,740 --> 02:48:27,880
You made us want to be good producers for you.

2153
02:48:27,880 --> 02:48:32,770
We want to help her do well.

2154
02:48:40,490 --> 02:48:47,430
When I first came on board as a producer for I-LAND 2,

2155
02:48:47,430 --> 02:48:49,850
I laid out my own criteria.

2156
02:48:49,850 --> 02:48:56,250
I look at what's offstage just as much as what's onstage.

2157
02:48:56,250 --> 02:49:00,530
My criteria is the discipline you show offstage,

2158
02:49:00,530 --> 02:49:04,520
your attitude, your mindset.

2159
02:49:04,520 --> 02:49:09,150
I think she is the most ideal candidate in terms of those things.

2160
02:49:09,150 --> 02:49:17,010
We're going to spend seven long years with izna.

2161
02:49:17,010 --> 02:49:19,810
Thinking of the harmony among teammates, et cetera,

2162
02:49:19,810 --> 02:49:22,230
we thought we really needed Mai.

2163
02:49:22,230 --> 02:49:24,920
Above all, what I was most touched by

2164
02:49:24,920 --> 02:49:31,470
was how she stayed after midpoint checks to ask us for feedback,

2165
02:49:31,470 --> 02:49:36,870
and taking the initiative to learn.

2166
02:49:36,870 --> 02:49:42,930
That made us see and feel her potential. Congratulations.

2167
02:49:46,620 --> 02:49:51,910
Mai, you are the producers' choice after a long journey.

2168
02:49:51,910 --> 02:49:54,600
Please say a few words.

2169
02:49:56,300 --> 02:49:58,550
Hello, it's Mai.

2170
02:49:58,550 --> 02:50:09,600
First of all, thank you to those who helped me achieve my goal.

2171
02:50:09,600 --> 02:50:14,190
Producers Leejung, Monika, Taeyang,

2172
02:50:14,190 --> 02:50:20,150
Producer 24, VVN, thank you so much.

2173
02:50:21,620 --> 02:50:26,120
I-MATES, who have always supported me,

2174
02:50:26,120 --> 02:50:34,160
please know how much strength you give me.

2175
02:50:34,160 --> 02:50:41,130
I have learned so much through I-LAND.

2176
02:50:41,130 --> 02:50:49,770
Thank you, I-LAND staff, for giving me this opportunity to grow.

2177
02:50:56,170 --> 02:51:01,630
I might be the last person to debut,

2178
02:51:01,630 --> 02:51:11,840
but next to me are so many pretty, cute, charming girls.

2179
02:51:13,320 --> 02:51:21,830
Please keep supporting them even when I-LAND is over.

2180
02:51:22,820 --> 02:51:24,780
Hello.

2181
02:51:25,990 --> 02:51:31,040
Thank you so much for cheering me on all this time.

2182
02:51:33,300 --> 02:51:42,500
I learned and grew so much in I-LAND.

2183
02:51:42,500 --> 02:51:49,290
I'm grateful to the producers and staff of I-LAND for this opportunity.

2184
02:51:49,290 --> 02:51:52,600
All the staff of I-LAND, thank you so much.

2185
02:51:52,640 --> 02:52:01,030
And lastly, I wish to express my gratitude to my family, who is standing before me now.

2186
02:52:01,030 --> 02:52:02,480
Thank you so much.

2187
02:52:02,480 --> 02:52:07,700
I will keep growing for you. Thank you.

2188
02:52:09,980 --> 02:52:12,680
Once again, congratulations.

2189
02:52:12,680 --> 02:52:15,520
Please make your way to the debut group stage.

2190
02:52:16,620 --> 02:52:20,150
The sixth debut member, Mai,

2191
02:52:20,150 --> 02:52:23,710
has iconic looks and turns a small part into a killer one.

2192
02:52:23,710 --> 02:52:26,170
She is the "impact princess" with magical powers.

2193
02:52:26,170 --> 02:52:29,190
Through the special producing for the debut group,

2194
02:52:29,190 --> 02:52:36,670
I look forward to her impact and changes as a new member of izna.

2195
02:53:16,820 --> 02:53:20,350
The iconic girl group produced by Teddy, izna.

2196
02:53:20,350 --> 02:53:24,190
These are the final six members of the group.

2197
02:53:24,200 --> 02:53:32,300
You might be eliminated, unfortunately, the four of you did great work on this journey.

2198
02:53:37,540 --> 02:53:42,390
Producer Taeyang, please say a few final words.

2199
02:53:45,470 --> 02:53:50,530
Before I say goodbye, I have something to tell you.

2200
02:53:54,770 --> 02:53:58,510
When we were looking at the debut group,

2201
02:53:58,510 --> 02:54:05,770
we had a very hard time deciding among the three candidates.

2202
02:54:08,700 --> 02:54:13,700
Between the two left, we decided to choose

2203
02:54:14,880 --> 02:54:18,420
one additional member.

2204
02:54:22,870 --> 02:54:29,400
I think the debut group we have is very strong.

2205
02:54:29,400 --> 02:54:35,790
But one more person will complete our vision.

2206
02:54:36,910 --> 02:54:41,870
You're saying you're going to choose one more person?

2207
02:54:41,870 --> 02:54:43,790
Is that so?

2208
02:54:43,790 --> 02:54:50,050
Yes. We've decided that izna will have seven members.

2209
02:54:50,050 --> 02:54:54,760
We will announce the seventh member right away.

2210
02:55:27,040 --> 02:55:29,030
This was a very difficult choice.

2211
02:55:29,030 --> 02:55:34,620
I hope this member can be a hardworking part of the group.

2212
02:55:34,620 --> 02:55:39,460
Our final choice, the seventh member of izna is...

2213
02:56:16,140 --> 02:56:19,350
I-LANDER Jeong Saebi.

2214
02:56:26,130 --> 02:56:29,840
Saebi, congratulations.

2215
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:31,980
Congratulations!

2216
02:56:33,300 --> 02:56:39,610
The last member of izna is Jeong Saebi.

2217
02:56:41,280 --> 02:56:46,060
This program surprises us until the very end, as expected in the THEBLACK style.

2218
02:56:46,060 --> 02:56:50,580
We, the emcees, were quite surprised, too.

2219
02:56:51,480 --> 02:56:54,030
Jeong Saebi.

2220
02:56:54,030 --> 02:56:56,920
You are the seventh member of izna.

2221
02:56:56,920 --> 02:57:01,030
Take a breath, step forward. Get the mic slowly.

2222
02:57:01,030 --> 02:57:04,420
Please say a few words.

2223
02:57:19,860 --> 02:57:25,620
First of all, producers, I-MATES, thank you so much.

2224
02:57:25,620 --> 02:57:32,730
I will do my best with the opportunity you've given me.

2225
02:57:32,730 --> 02:57:34,410
Thank you so much.

2226
02:57:34,410 --> 02:57:40,440
Mom, dad, my beloved maternal grandma, grandpa,

2227
02:57:40,440 --> 02:57:42,830
my other grandma and grandpa,

2228
02:57:42,830 --> 02:57:48,210
my brother, my friends...

2229
02:57:48,210 --> 02:57:52,590
I love you and thank you for helping me get this far.

2230
02:57:52,590 --> 02:57:57,060
You are the ones who did that. Thank you.

2231
02:57:57,060 --> 02:58:07,720
And I-MATES, I have no words for how important you are to me.

2232
02:58:19,290 --> 02:58:25,070
I promised you I would keep making you happy.

2233
02:58:25,070 --> 02:58:31,130
I promise you again, and that will never change.

2234
02:58:32,430 --> 02:58:37,480
Producers, I'm thankful to each and every one of you.

2235
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:45,610
My 23 sisters and friends,

2236
02:58:45,610 --> 02:58:49,650
and Fuko, whom I wanted to debut with so badly...

2237
02:58:54,650 --> 02:59:01,020
The talent development staff at WakeOn, whom I love,

2238
02:59:01,020 --> 02:59:04,220
my dear voice teacher, dance teacher...

2239
02:59:04,220 --> 02:59:09,330
Thank you so much. I have too many people to thank.

2240
02:59:10,410 --> 02:59:15,510
I'm so lucky. I'm going to do my best.

2241
02:59:15,510 --> 02:59:19,080
I'm going to be an amazing artist who shines onstage.

2242
02:59:19,080 --> 02:59:24,290
I promise to be an artist who makes others happy.

2243
02:59:24,290 --> 02:59:26,730
Thank you.

2244
02:59:42,610 --> 02:59:47,220
Producer Taeyang, I'm curious about your reasons.

2245
02:59:47,220 --> 02:59:55,390
Yes. Saebi is one of the people who love the stage the most.

2246
02:59:55,390 --> 02:59:58,290
No matter what kind of performance, she immerses herself in it.

2247
02:59:58,290 --> 03:00:03,580
She's able to make the viewer fall into it as well.

2248
03:00:03,580 --> 03:00:07,780
That's going to be a good influence on the other members.

2249
03:00:07,780 --> 03:00:12,360
Performance is a big component of our vision for the group.

2250
03:00:12,360 --> 03:00:16,650
We felt we really needed Saebi.

2251
03:00:16,650 --> 03:00:18,280
Thank you.

2252
03:00:18,280 --> 03:00:20,130
Thank you.

2253
03:00:20,130 --> 03:00:27,120
Congratulations. izna is now complete with seven members.

2254
03:00:28,310 --> 03:00:32,090
Jeong Saebi, please make your way to the debut stage.

2255
03:01:23,830 --> 03:01:27,980
They may not have achieved their debut dreams in I-LAND,

2256
03:01:27,980 --> 03:01:32,570
but they endlessly proved their potential to get here.

2257
03:01:32,570 --> 03:01:38,190
Please keep rooting for these three contestants.

2258
03:01:40,900 --> 03:01:47,220
Please step to the center of the stage and say your goodbyes.

2259
03:01:48,160 --> 03:01:50,360
Please step this way.

2260
03:01:54,230 --> 03:01:56,090
The mic.

2261
03:02:06,730 --> 03:02:09,970
Hello, I'm Nam Yuju.

2262
03:02:11,850 --> 03:02:17,690
First, to the I-MATES who supported me until the finals,

2263
03:02:17,690 --> 03:02:20,420
Thank you so, so much.

2264
03:02:20,420 --> 03:02:24,380
I'm thankful for everything, and...

2265
03:02:24,380 --> 03:02:30,360
every moment I felt your love was a gift for me.

2266
03:02:30,360 --> 03:02:34,740
It's disappointing that today is my last.

2267
03:02:34,740 --> 03:02:37,700
But I'm not going to give up.

2268
03:02:37,700 --> 03:02:42,700
Some people worry that I'm going to give up and lay low.

2269
03:02:42,700 --> 03:02:45,220
I felt so sad and guilty.

2270
03:02:45,220 --> 03:02:47,070
I'm not going to give up.

2271
03:02:47,070 --> 03:02:50,850
When we meet again, please give me even more love.

2272
03:02:50,850 --> 03:02:53,280
I hope you can welcome me with open arms.

2273
03:02:53,280 --> 03:02:57,230
The 23 of us will now go our own ways.

2274
03:02:57,230 --> 03:03:00,620
I'm going to root for all 24 of our paths.

2275
03:03:00,620 --> 03:03:03,710
Let's meet again with smiling faces.

2276
03:03:03,710 --> 03:03:08,320
Everyone who worked hard offstage, the staff, the team,

2277
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:11,040
the teachers, thank you so much.

2278
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:13,570
I also have too many people to thank.

2279
03:03:13,570 --> 03:03:16,920
I don't want to bore you, so I'll keep it at that.

2280
03:03:16,920 --> 03:03:22,880
But Mom and Dad, I love you, and thank you for believing in me.

2281
03:03:22,880 --> 03:03:25,120
See you again so soon.

2282
03:03:25,120 --> 03:03:26,960
Thank you for everything.

2283
03:03:26,960 --> 03:03:30,800
This was Nam Yuju. Thank you.

2284
03:03:39,180 --> 03:03:42,890
Hello I-MATES, it's Gyuri.

2285
03:03:48,720 --> 03:03:51,590
I-LAND is over.

2286
03:03:51,590 --> 03:03:54,470
Unfortunately, I'm not making my debut here, but

2287
03:03:54,470 --> 03:04:02,920
I've learned so much from my 24 friends in I-LAND.

2288
03:04:02,920 --> 03:04:06,460
I haven't lived that many years yet,

2289
03:04:06,460 --> 03:04:11,820
but I don't think I've ever wanted anything so badly.

2290
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:15,180
This was such a special time for me,

2291
03:04:15,180 --> 03:04:18,570
and I learned so much.

2292
03:04:21,070 --> 03:04:24,100
I have so many people to be thankful for.

2293
03:04:24,100 --> 03:04:29,810
First, the I-MATES who are here or watching this onscreen,

2294
03:04:29,810 --> 03:04:32,490
I wanted to return your support by debuting,

2295
03:04:32,490 --> 03:04:38,180
and I'm sorry that I can't debut here.

2296
03:04:38,180 --> 03:04:43,380
But I'm going to keep challenging myself.

2297
03:04:43,380 --> 03:04:47,270
I'm not going to stop here. I'm going to run toward my debut.

2298
03:04:47,270 --> 03:04:49,190
Please keep supporting me.

2299
03:04:49,190 --> 03:04:55,410
My 24 sisters and friends, thank you for your support.

2300
03:04:55,410 --> 03:05:02,980
Producers, thank you for helping me grow so far.

2301
03:05:02,980 --> 03:05:06,280
My unnis who are going to debut, Saebi...

2302
03:05:06,280 --> 03:05:10,350
You all work so hard. I know you're going to do well.

2303
03:05:10,350 --> 03:05:12,310
Please keep supporting them.

2304
03:05:12,310 --> 03:05:15,240
Thank you. This was Gyuri.

2305
03:05:34,390 --> 03:05:36,950
Hello, it's Fuko.

2306
03:05:40,090 --> 03:05:41,730
First...

2307
03:05:42,770 --> 03:05:48,190
my 23 friends who went through I-LAND with me,

2308
03:05:48,190 --> 03:05:50,980
the five producers,

2309
03:05:52,270 --> 03:05:57,680
all the staff, thank you so much.

2310
03:06:00,360 --> 03:06:05,180
After my first try, I waited three years.

2311
03:06:06,210 --> 03:06:10,570
There has not been a moment where I didn't want this so badly.

2312
03:06:15,510 --> 03:06:18,960
I did my best every moment.

2313
03:06:20,660 --> 03:06:26,450
I think I gave it everything I had, so I have no regrets.

2314
03:06:31,380 --> 03:06:39,740
It made me so happy to have so much support from I-MATES.

2315
03:06:39,740 --> 03:06:46,540
I'm sorry that I can't debut with I-LAND,

2316
03:06:46,540 --> 03:06:53,710
but I'm going to work hard until the day my dreams come true.

2317
03:06:53,710 --> 03:06:59,450
Please believe in me and wait for me.

2318
03:07:00,570 --> 03:07:06,870
I made great memories and met great people in I-LAND.

2319
03:07:06,870 --> 03:07:15,880
I got to spend the most passionate days of my life here.

2320
03:07:17,870 --> 03:07:21,220
I'm not going to give up moving forward.

2321
03:07:21,220 --> 03:07:28,540
I-MATES, please keep cheering me on. Thank you.

2322
03:07:33,300 --> 03:07:37,530
I-MATES, good evening. This is Fuko.

2323
03:07:38,470 --> 03:07:41,110
Though I don't get to debut,

2324
03:07:43,760 --> 03:07:49,230
I got to spend very meaningful time that I cherish.

2325
03:07:55,480 --> 03:08:03,210
I will continue to work hard to stand on this stage again with all of you.

2326
03:08:09,090 --> 03:08:13,440
It will be great if you can continue to cheer me on.

2327
03:08:13,440 --> 03:08:22,920
And to my family, thank you for supporting me all this time.

2328
03:08:22,920 --> 03:08:24,920
Moving forward,

2329
03:08:26,050 --> 03:08:29,080
I won't give up.

2330
03:08:29,080 --> 03:08:33,950
I hope you can continue to watch over me until the time I debut.

2331
03:08:35,540 --> 03:08:37,980
Thank you so much.

2332
03:08:48,040 --> 03:08:53,140
Please send your encouragement and applause to the three.

2333
03:08:54,140 --> 03:08:56,890
You all did so well.

2334
03:08:56,890 --> 03:09:00,380
I'm going to be cheering you on.

2335
03:09:06,810 --> 03:09:10,720
Five members chosen by I-MATES,

2336
03:09:10,720 --> 03:09:13,780
and two members chosen by the producers.

2337
03:09:13,780 --> 03:09:18,320
A total of seven I-LANDERS have secured their debuts.

2338
03:09:18,320 --> 03:09:20,990
Those of you who are debuting...

2339
03:09:24,560 --> 03:09:27,670
Please step to the center of the stage.

2340
03:10:21,410 --> 03:10:24,850
Mnet I-LAND 2: FINAL COUNTDOWN has birthed

2341
03:10:24,850 --> 03:10:28,500
an iconic girl group produced by Teddy.

2342
03:10:28,500 --> 03:10:31,520
These are the final debut members of izna.

2343
03:10:39,570 --> 03:10:41,240
Koko.

2344
03:10:44,000 --> 03:10:46,480
(izna: Koko)

2345
03:10:47,830 --> 03:10:49,250
Yoon Jiyoon.

2346
03:10:49,250 --> 03:10:51,320
(izna: Yoon Jiyoon)

2347
03:10:55,350 --> 03:10:56,530
Bang Jeemin.

2348
03:10:56,530 --> 03:10:58,010
(izna: Bang Jeemin)

2349
03:11:01,800 --> 03:11:03,050
Choi Jungeun.

2350
03:11:03,050 --> 03:11:06,510
(izna: Choi Jungeun)

2351
03:11:08,800 --> 03:11:10,060
Ryu Sarang.

2352
03:11:10,060 --> 03:11:13,530
(izna: Ryu Sarang)

2353
03:11:17,400 --> 03:11:18,560
Mai.

2354
03:11:18,560 --> 03:11:21,100
(izna: Mai)

2355
03:11:25,720 --> 03:11:26,800
Jeong Saebi.

2356
03:11:26,800 --> 03:11:29,200
(izna: Jeong Saebi)

2357
03:11:34,440 --> 03:11:39,470
These seven achieved their dreams of becoming global idols.

2358
03:11:50,560 --> 03:11:55,980
Lastly, Producer Taeyang, please congratulate them.

2359
03:11:55,980 --> 03:12:01,960
Congratulations, members of izna, on your debut.

2360
03:12:03,450 --> 03:12:06,360
This was not an easy journey.

2361
03:12:06,360 --> 03:12:12,420
But I'm grateful that you overcame it and got here today.

2362
03:12:12,420 --> 03:12:15,350
Now, I-LAND is over.

2363
03:12:15,350 --> 03:12:17,750
This is a new beginning, as izna.

2364
03:12:17,750 --> 03:12:23,430
There might be more hardships and obstacles to come.

2365
03:12:23,430 --> 03:12:26,490
But if you remember all the things you went through here,

2366
03:12:26,490 --> 03:12:28,630
I don't think there will be anything you can't overcome.

2367
03:12:28,630 --> 03:12:32,400
You are no longer trainees but artists.

2368
03:12:32,400 --> 03:12:36,530
I look forward to meeting you on stage, artist to artist. Congratulations.

2369
03:12:43,740 --> 03:12:47,340
Thank you, I-MATES of the world,

2370
03:12:47,340 --> 03:12:52,410
for all your enthusiastic support and love so far.

2371
03:12:52,410 --> 03:12:55,360
I-LAND 2 might be over now,

2372
03:12:55,360 --> 03:13:01,250
but for izna, born tonight, their journey is just beginning.

2373
03:13:03,610 --> 03:13:08,440
The name "izna" means, whenever or wherever in the world,

2374
03:13:08,440 --> 03:13:10,640
everything can be defined by myself.

2375
03:13:10,640 --> 03:13:15,730
I hope you grow as artists who deliver confidence and courage.

2376
03:13:15,730 --> 03:13:19,540
Please keep rooting for them. I will, as well.

2377
03:13:20,540 --> 03:13:23,630
Welcome to THEBLACKLABEL!

2378
03:13:25,290 --> 03:13:27,850
We're going to say goodbye here.

2379
03:13:27,850 --> 03:13:31,020
It's been an honor to be with you.

2380
03:13:31,020 --> 03:13:36,070
I'm Sung Han Bin, the I-LAND Storyteller.

2381
03:13:36,070 --> 03:13:38,660
I'm Jeon Somi, Special Storyteller.

2382
03:13:38,660 --> 03:13:40,900
Thank you.

2383
03:16:03,720 --> 03:16:08,050
The I-LAND system is shutting down.

2384
03:16:15,570 --> 03:16:17,220
(Thank you for watching I-LAND 2)

2385
03:16:17,220 --> 03:16:18,900
(Please keep your eyes on izna)
