♫Like OOH-AHH♫

2705
01:43:00,960 --> 01:43:02,080
[Producer, 24: JIYOON?]

2706
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:05,170
[Performance Director, MONIKA: Did we misunderstand anything?]

2707
01:43:05,250 --> 01:43:06,960
[Performance Director, MONIKA: About JIYOON?]

2708
01:43:07,400 --> 01:43:09,190
Now I'll announce the eliminated contestants.

2709
01:43:07,540 --> 01:43:09,370
[And I-LAND2's first ever contestant to be eliminated.]

2710
01:43:09,370 --> 01:43:12,130
[Now seems to be the most nerve-wrecking moment on I-LAND.]

2711
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:13,590
[Please don't be me.]

2712
01:43:15,440 --> 01:43:17,350
[I have mixed feelings about this.]

2713
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:20,500
[Who will be the first contestant to be eliminated from I-LAND2: N/a?]

2714
01:43:20,710 --> 01:43:23,160
The last test to decide the common destiny.

2715
01:43:22,340 --> 01:43:24,990
[Unit Battle, I-LAND VS GROUND]

2716
01:43:23,260 --> 01:43:24,670
I-LAND versus GROUND?

2717
01:43:25,060 --> 01:43:27,130
[There will be 3 battles in total.]

2718
01:43:27,210 --> 01:43:31,190
[For every round GROUNDERS win, 3 contestants will be expelled from I-LAND.]

2719
01:43:30,980 --> 01:43:32,570
If we win all 3 rounds?

2720
01:43:31,260 --> 01:43:32,700
[If we win all 3 rounds?]

2721
01:43:32,650 --> 01:43:33,680
Then there will be 9 people expelled.

2722
01:43:32,700 --> 01:43:33,840
[There will be 9 people expelled from I-LAND right?]

2723
01:43:33,750 --> 01:43:35,550
There may be a big change.

2724
01:43:33,890 --> 01:43:35,790
[There may be a big change.]

2725
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,720
[I think we can win all 3 rounds.]

2726
01:43:38,490 --> 01:43:40,620
My heart stopped for a second.

2727
01:43:38,520 --> 01:43:40,820
[The mysterious footsteps walking towards I-LAND.]

2728
01:43:41,120 --> 01:43:42,480
[I'm here today.]

2729
01:43:42,810 --> 01:43:43,810
It's like a dream.

2730
01:43:46,990 --> 01:43:49,990
Her being here is already very unrealistic in itself.

2731
01:43:51,640 --> 01:43:52,940
-What should we do? -What should we do?
