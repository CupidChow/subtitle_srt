00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,880
[Episode 3]

4
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:38,360
You're suspected of stealing government secrets.

5
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,390
Are you going to turn yourself in to the Investigation and Arrest Unit

6
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,250
or do you want me to take you there?

7
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:58,000
Tell me then.

8
00:01:58,630 --> 00:01:59,789
How did you predict it?

9
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:01,510
What attracted my attention first

10
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:03,560
was the recent strange trend of Imperial Bank of China's stock price.

11
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,910
According to the information I found,

12
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:07,710
the strange trend of Imperial Bank of China's stock price in the past six months

13
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,720
is very similar to that of Yintong Bank

14
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,070
and Dahua Bank's stock prices

15
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:12,310
during the six months before their stock prices plunged.

16
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,190
And the two banks have been acquired by Central Bank.

17
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:15,070
Meanwhile, the recent trends of the stock prices

18
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,000
of Huaxin, Xingxia, and Dongsheng

19
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,260
are also very similar to that of Imperial Bank of China's stock price.

20
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,470
This is not a coincidence at all.

21
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:19,960
The transaction information of these stocks shows

22
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,720
Kunpeng Industries participated in the stock trading.

23
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,829
On the surface, the operator of Kunpeng Industries

24
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,190
is Mr. Liu.

25
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,470
Actually, its real owner is you.

26
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,070
Central Bank.

27
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,829
Why?

28
00:02:32,230 --> 00:02:33,829
Kunpeng flies high in the sky

29
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,160
and then considers flying southward.

30
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,320
Then how did you know

31
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:39,910
my real intention?

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,200
If I want to improve the strength of Central Bank,

33
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,640
I would do the same thing.

34
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:47,070
Do you know me well?

35
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,410
I guess

36
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,000
you have collected almost all the shares

37
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,230
from private investors in the market

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,960
and you are also discussing

39
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,160
with other major shareholders of Imperial Bank of China.

40
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,950
I don't know how it's been going.

41
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:59,120
But if Zhang Mingquan of Imperial Bank of China

42
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,150
can't buy back the stocks in the market

43
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:02,710
and can't handle your greenmail attempt,

44
00:03:02,710 --> 00:03:04,030
the dispersed ownership structure

45
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:06,280
will lead to the transfer of the control of the bank.

46
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,260
By that time,

47
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,600
Huaxin, Xingxia, and Dongsheng

48
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,510
will definitely make the same mistake

49
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,860
and be acquired by you.

50
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,550
Are you really just an evening student?

51
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:20,680
Isn't it... obvious?

52
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:23,350
No.

53
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,760
I mean your plan is very clever

54
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,110
and profound.

55
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:27,870
It's well-hidden.

56
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,160
No need to flatter me.

57
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,470
Is this everything you want to tell me?

58
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:34,030
No.

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,490
I still want to work in Central Bank.

60
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,250
Impossible.

61
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,990
I already told you the reason.

62
00:03:37,990 --> 00:03:39,310
I can sign a confidentiality agreement.

63
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:41,190
If any information is leaked, you can kill me yourself.

64
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:42,040
I

65
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,680
work in Central Bank to fight a war.

66
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,670
But you want to work in Central Bank to support your family.

67
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,880
Although you are very capable,

68
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:49,430
you lack faith.

69
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,430
I don't think you can handle the pressure.

70
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,630
Sir, I think you have misunderstood me.

71
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,240
You wanted to recommend me to Bank of Communications before.

72
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,350
I refused.

73
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,350
Because I know I can't make a lot of money with you,

74
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,880
but I might be able to do something big with you.

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,110
You asked me before

76
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,750
whether this is a prosperous time or a troubled time.

77
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,080
I didn't dare to answer.

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,510
Actually,

79
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:07,630
it's already a troubled time.

80
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:08,880
The trouble is not on the battlefield,

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,230
but in Nanjing and Shanghai.

82
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:11,840
The trouble was at today's dinner party.

83
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,720
The big shots drank wine and had fun.

84
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,430
They exploited civilians to benefit themselves.

85
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:16,800
So, since I knew your plan,

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,920
I've been glad.

87
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,589
I think I can have a chance

88
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,640
to change the greedy and evil financial industry

89
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,350
with you.

90
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:22,790
Unfortunately...

91
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,590
Central Bank

92
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,160
can't hire you

93
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,080
because you broke a taboo.

94
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,540
Sorry that I have disturbed you.

95
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,600
Wait.

96
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:52,820
I

97
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:54,070
still need a personal assistant.

98
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,270
Report to Secretary Huang next Monday.

99
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:59,050
Thank you, Sir.

100
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,720
Thank you, Sir.

101
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,110
That's enough. Stop bowing.

102
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:02,910
I don't want to be mourned by you.

103
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:04,920
Thank you, Sir.

104
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,520
You told me about serving the country.

105
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,900
It sounded a bit empty.

106
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,310
But now,

107
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,970
I hope these words

108
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:14,150
can become your belief and motivation.

109
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,740
Got it.

110
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,000
You should know

111
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,440
many Chinese people

112
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,400
are still eating tree bark and grass roots.

113
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,460
Even in Shanghai,

114
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,820
there are hundreds of thousands of people living in slums.

115
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,270
I hope you won't forget your original intention.

116
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:24,940
I won't.

117
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,710
Now, repeat your original intention.

118
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,350
Serving the country.

119
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,080
Say it again.

120
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:31,470
Serving the country.

121
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,630
Carve these words into your bones

122
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,830
and let them flow in your blood.

123
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,830
If you let me down,

124
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,500
I'll kick you out myself.

125
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,190
Okay.

126
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:38,760
Remember that.

127
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:39,620
Remember that.

128
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:42,250
Thank you, Sir.

129
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:45,870
Sir.

130
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,480
What's wrong?

131
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,240
Well...

132
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:50,110
Can you write me a confirmation letter?

133
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:50,640
I'll...

134
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,830
give it to Secretary...

135
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,830
Secretary Huang.

136
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,550
Are you worried that I'll break my promise?

137
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:55,550
No, no, no.

138
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:21,510
[Shen Tunan]

139
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,860
Wait. It's not dry yet.

140
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:34,830
With this confirmation letter,

141
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,030
you can sleep well tonight, right?

142
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,150
Yes. Yes.

143
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:39,159
Let's go.

144
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,720
Let me take you to meet some important people.

145
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:50,620
Let me introduce.

146
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,780
This is Wei Ruolai, my personal assistant I just hired.

147
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,600
Assistant?

148
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,120
Yes.

149
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,950
She is my younger sister, Shen Jinzhen.

150
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:57,880
Younger sister?

151
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,120
Don't we look alike?

152
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:03,870
Yes.

153
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:05,240
You look alike.

154
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:09,150
How long have you known him?

155
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,750
Did you investigate his background

156
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,680
before making him your assistant?

157
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:15,190
He's from a poor family.

158
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,870
He came to Central Bank for an interview before.

159
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:18,470
He got full marks in the written exam.

160
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:19,560
He has a good character

161
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,760
and is very capable.

162
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,590
You just met him and you've decided to make him your assistant.

163
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:23,700
It's too risky.

164
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:27,040
Before I find out his background,

165
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,800
I won't assign any important task to him.

166
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,560
Don't worry.

167
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,210
Do you want to reconsider?

168
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,270
Leave.

169
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,760
Do you know my sister?

170
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,450
No, we just...

171
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,030
met before.

172
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:45,840
Where?

173
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:46,830
On the street.

174
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:48,280
We competed for a rickshaw.

175
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,470
But I failed.

176
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:51,360
It's normal.

177
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:53,820
Even I am no match for her, not to mention you.

178
00:07:54,150 --> 00:07:54,680
Let's go.

179
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,480
Chief Deng.

180
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,350
Wei Ruolai.

181
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,150
Assistant?

182
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:18,490
We all saw

183
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,190
Ruolai's wonderful performance

184
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,450
during the interview.

185
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,210
I really admire him.

186
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:25,560
I've hired him to be my personal assistant.

187
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,290
This can solve all our worries.

188
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,020
Since

189
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,790
you said so,

190
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:33,429
what else can I say?

191
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:35,390
But if anything goes wrong,

192
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:35,950
you should take responsibility.

193
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:36,710
I will.

194
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,710
Work hard in the future.

195
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,350
Thank you.

196
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:42,610
Thank you, Chief Deng.

197
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,380
Slow down.

198
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,230
He drank it all.

199
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:02,260
It's fine.

200
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:03,840
Wine is for people to drink.

201
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,750
It's up to you how you want to drink it.

202
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,810
But remember this.

203
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,110
Don't drink too much

204
00:09:08,110 --> 00:09:10,770
and make yourself a fool in front of so many VIPs.

205
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:12,910
Mr. Yu.

206
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,710
Come with me.

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,440
You're leaving so soon?

208
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,640
I was looking for you.

209
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,040
It's too late. I'm old.

210
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:19,990
We should go back early.

211
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,710
Okay. I apologize if my reception doesn't live up to your expectations tonight.

212
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:22,710
Don't stand on ceremony.

213
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,590
Are you okay?

214
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,860
Let me introduce someone to you before you leave.

215
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,490
This

216
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,010
is my personal assistant, Wei Ruolai.

217
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,940
Nice to meet you.

218
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:31,740
Young man, you are handsome.

219
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,470
Since you are Consultant Shen's assistant,

220
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:34,320
learn from him

221
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,670
and you will be successful

222
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:36,670
in the future.

223
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,510
Mr. Yu, let me see you off.

224
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,870
No need for that.

225
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:41,550
It's okay.

226
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,390
Thank you, Chief Deng.

227
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:43,630
See you.

228
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,000
See you, Mingquan.

229
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,730
Chief Kang,

230
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:57,150
why are you sitting here alone?

231
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,450
I saw you

232
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,030
having fun outside just now, right?

233
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,960
I'm tired. I'm here to take a break.

234
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,480
When they were catching Gao Feng just now,

235
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,420
thank you so much for what you did.

236
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:05,380
No big deal.

237
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:07,470
Let me introduce.

238
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:10,910
This is Wei Ruolai, my personal assistant I just hired.

239
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,470
This

240
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:13,990
is Kang Shaojie,

241
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:14,990
the chief of the Military Law Department of the Shanghai Garrison Command.

242
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,070
Call him Mr. Kang.

243
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:17,310
Mr. Kang.

244
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:18,440
This young man looks energetic.

245
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:18,950
Yes.

246
00:10:19,790 --> 00:10:20,440
Wei.

247
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,390
Yes.

248
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:22,870
Where are you from?

249
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:23,550
Jiangxi.

250
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:25,290
Which city in Jiangxi?

251
00:10:25,790 --> 00:10:26,480
Ji'an.

252
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,470
Ji'an.

253
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,540
When did you come to Shanghai?

254
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:34,110
Three years ago.

255
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,930
In the 16th year of the Republic of China.

256
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,100
It was during the period of cleansing members of the Communist Party.

257
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,190
Chief Kang,

258
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,480
do you think Ruolai is a member of the Communist Party?

259
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,480
Not really.

260
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,140
I just think it's a bit coincidental considering the time and location.

261
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,510
So I mentioned it.

262
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:58,290
Sorry, Wei.

263
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,400
It's okay, Mr. Kang.

264
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,750
It's normal that you suspect me.

265
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,050
But I'm indeed not a member of the Communist Party.

266
00:11:02,050 --> 00:11:03,610
I know you're not.

267
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:05,270
Otherwise, even if I don't say it in front of you,

268
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,030
I'll secretly ask someone to investigate you.

269
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,990
You can investigate me.

270
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,230
You can even ask someone to follow me 24/7.

271
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,390
This guy is smart.

272
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:12,150
Yes.

273
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:15,070
Do you want me to give you a ride?

274
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:18,110
Not just that. He also wants your food and wine.

275
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,190
Drink a toast to Mr. Kang now.

276
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:20,950
Yes, Sir.

277
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,800
Wei,

278
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,490
cherish the opportunity.

279
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,760
Learn from Mr. Shen.

280
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:30,990
If you need me in the future,

281
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:31,920
just let me know.

282
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:33,410
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

283
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,440
This is Western wine. Drink slowly.

284
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,950
He drank it all again.

285
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,280
I'm impressed by how much he can drink.

286
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,420
He's young.

287
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,070
Ruolai,

288
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:48,930
leave us alone.

289
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:52,160
Chief Kang and I have something important to talk about.

290
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:02,890
Chief Kang.

291
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,490
Do you really think he is suspicious?

292
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:11,390
Whether he's a member of the Communist Party or not,

293
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,880
considering your identity,

294
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:14,800
you should be cautious,

295
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,470
since you suddenly have a stranger around you.

296
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:20,190
Better safe than sorry.

297
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:43,240
Wei?

298
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,470
Wei.

299
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,980
Wei! Wei!

300
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,190
What happened?

301
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:49,230
Did you drink?

302
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,510
You drank so much.

303
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:52,390
A little.

304
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,760
Wei, if Central Bank won't hire you, just forget it.

305
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,280
You can go somewhere else.

306
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,480
No.

307
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:00,920
Wei.

308
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,390
Eat.

309
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,270
What is it?

310
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:08,220
Food.

311
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:09,480
Delicious food?

312
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,410
Okay, I'll eat it later.

313
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:13,040
Later?

314
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:15,030
Now.

315
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,130
Okay.

316
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,280
It's very delicious.

317
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,630
Delicious.

318
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:25,880
Where did you get it?

319
00:14:27,830 --> 00:14:30,230
I took it from Shen Tunan's place.

320
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:32,550
Shen Tunan?

321
00:14:34,990 --> 00:14:37,120
Shen Tunan of Central Bank.

322
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:43,130
His house is very big.

323
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:47,440
It has European-style spiral staircases

324
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:50,000
and crystal chandeliers

325
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,470
embedded with diamonds.

326
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,340
Even...

327
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:58,370
Even his servants wear the best leather shoes.

328
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:00,730
I've never been there.

329
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:01,450
Wei,

330
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,910
why did you go there?

331
00:15:02,910 --> 00:15:03,990
Take a guess.

332
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,070
You went there to be a waiter.

333
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:08,880
A waiter.

334
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,580
Nonsense.

335
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,020
I...

336
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:16,230
I went there to make waiters serve me.

337
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,590
You don't believe me?

338
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,510
I believe you.

339
00:15:21,190 --> 00:15:22,070
Let me show you.

340
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,340
From tomorrow onwards,

341
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:31,580
I'll be Shen Tunan's assistant.

342
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,010
Confirmation letter.

343
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:41,100
Mr. Wei Ruolai,

344
00:15:41,270 --> 00:15:43,680
you have been hired...

345
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,520
as my...

346
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,210
assistant.

347
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:54,630
The confirmation letter has been delivered. Please come to Central Bank to go through the procedures tomorrow.

348
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,030
Shen Tunan.

349
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,030
You have been hired by Central Bank?

350
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:01,950
I have been hired by Central Bank.

351
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:04,750
Great!

352
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,000
Wei,

353
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,350
I knew you could do it.

354
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,420
I have been hired by Central Bank.

355
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:17,340
Your tough days are finally over.

356
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:19,710
In the future,

357
00:16:21,670 --> 00:16:23,330
no matter what you want to eat,

358
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:24,380
just tell me.

359
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,250
Okay.

360
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:27,800
What will you take me to eat?

361
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:28,590
Western food.

362
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:29,720
Western food. Okay.

363
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,390
Red wine.

364
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,990
We'll buy new clothes and new leather shoes.

365
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:34,990
New leather shoes.

366
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:36,320
Everything will be new.

367
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,390
From now on,

368
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:40,270
I will share everything good with you.

369
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,120
Okay.

370
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,410
Wei.

371
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,390
Wei is here.

372
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,950
He's here.

373
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:19,890
Wen said you've got a job.

374
00:17:21,339 --> 00:17:23,480
Wen said you've got a job.

375
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,359
Job? What job?

376
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,329
Central Bank.

377
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:29,010
Central Bank.

378
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,190
Central Bank.

379
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:30,990
A large bank

380
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:32,630
has hired Wei.

381
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:34,630
They asked Wei to be a consultant...

382
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:36,940
A consultant?

383
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,500
A consultant's assistant.

384
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,150
An assistant is also an official.

385
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:43,160
If he does a good job, he can even get a car provided by the company.

386
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,230
Do you know Mercedes-Benz?

387
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,030
What's that?

388
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:47,150
I didn't say that.

389
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,200
Who said that?

390
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,800
Me.

391
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:53,360
The executives of Bank of Communications

392
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,130
have been given imported cars.

393
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,590
I'm sure Central Bank will give you a nice car too.

394
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,490
Shen,

395
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:00,120
you are from a good family.

396
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,520
You are straightforward

397
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,910
and generous.

398
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:05,130
As long as you work hard there,

399
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,320
he won't treat you badly.

400
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:08,940
Uncle,

401
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:10,690
you know Mr. Shen too?

402
00:18:11,990 --> 00:18:13,030
If it's a few years ago,

403
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,470
he should bow and call me Uncle

404
00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:17,190
if he saw me.

405
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:20,240
Stop bragging.

406
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:22,710
Wei is going to work in a large bank.

407
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,390
He'll tell us

408
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:25,270
a lot of inside information.

409
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:25,550
That's right.

410
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:26,870
We can make a fortune together.

411
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,070
Good.

412
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,040
He can't.

413
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,080
That's illegal, Ms. Zhou.

414
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,780
We can't... can't harm Wei.

415
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:35,590
You're such a bootlicker.

416
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,130
Fine. I don't want any inside information.

417
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:38,890
Wei,

418
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,950
when you make a lot of money

419
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:41,920
and get rich,

420
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,800
don't forget everyone here.

421
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,440
That's right. Don't forget us.

422
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,670
Don't worry.

423
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,080
We are sensible.

424
00:18:48,110 --> 00:18:49,840
We won't borrow money from you.

425
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,270
Ruolai,

426
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:55,430
after you go to work in the bank,

427
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,150
you can learn skills slowly.

428
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,110
There he goes again.

429
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:01,940
Remember. Don't be greedy.

430
00:19:01,970 --> 00:19:02,630
What? What does that mean?

431
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,510
Also, you should control your desire.

432
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,290
In the financial industry,

433
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,380
it's not about who can make more money

434
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:14,180
or who can make money faster.

435
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:15,750
Then what is it about?

436
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,250
It's about who can live longer.

437
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:23,500
You win

438
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,390
by not losing.

439
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:29,840
You guys don't understand what I mean.

440
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,170
You

441
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,640
will understand gradually.

442
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,230
Central Bank is a chartered national bank.

443
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,720
It was established on November 1, 1928.

444
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:49,720
It's the top financial institution in China.

445
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:51,820
The business office on the first floor belongs to the business bureau.

446
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,320
This is the front desk lobby.

447
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,990
Usually, we would handle ordinary projects

448
00:19:54,990 --> 00:19:56,590
at the front desk.

449
00:19:57,190 --> 00:19:57,950
Central Bank's requirement

450
00:19:57,950 --> 00:19:59,870
for the receptionists

451
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,470
is showing the most sincere service attitude.

452
00:20:04,810 --> 00:20:06,260
The Department of Issuing,

453
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:08,470
the Administration of Foreign Exchange, the Department of National Treasury,

454
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:09,550
the Department of Government Ethics,

455
00:20:09,550 --> 00:20:10,710
and the Legal Affairs Office are on the second floor.

456
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,600
Chief Deng

457
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,910
is the officer of Central Bank's Department of Government Ethics.

458
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:15,590
He is responsible for political education

459
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:17,450
and political background check.

460
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,190
Central Bank would strictly check

461
00:20:19,190 --> 00:20:21,490
every employee's political background.

462
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:23,420
I believe all of you have passed it.

463
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:24,410
Come with me.

464
00:20:24,450 --> 00:20:26,160
This is the business office.

465
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,550
Try to keep quiet after you come in.

466
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:31,040
This place

467
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:31,990
is mainly responsible

468
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:35,030
for the reconciliation of account statements and the verification of accounts.

469
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,910
Our staff members

470
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,640
have to verify the accounts more than five times a day

471
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,030
to ensure nothing would go wrong

472
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:42,160
in the bank accounts.

473
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,070
But Secretary Huang,

474
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:44,730
do we have to be as fast as them?

475
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,980
This should be your basic skill.

476
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,130
This

477
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:53,000
is the safe management office.

478
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,320
Don't touch anything after you come in.

479
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:01,490
Maybe some of you

480
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,910
will work here.

481
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:04,350
This place is mainly responsible

482
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,030
for storing and keeping our clients' personal

483
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,380
and valuable things.

484
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,520
Ten gold bars.

485
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,610
Since you are going to work in a bank,

486
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:24,370
you should learn to control your desire for money.

487
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,030
You'll see more in the future.

488
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,870
Are you done looking at them?

489
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:29,410
Let's go.

490
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,310
My office

491
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:33,610
is the secretary's office on the second floor.

492
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:35,110
If you need my help in the future,

493
00:21:35,110 --> 00:21:36,380
you can find me there.

494
00:21:37,660 --> 00:21:38,540
You

495
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:41,680
will be assigned to different positions

496
00:21:42,170 --> 00:21:43,910
according to your results in the exam and your preferred positions.

497
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:45,560
We'll inform you later.

498
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:48,990
Any questions?

499
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:50,400
No.

500
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,250
Dismiss.

501
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,030
Thank you, Secretary Huang.

502
00:21:53,030 --> 00:21:53,870
Thank you.

503
00:21:53,870 --> 00:21:54,630
Thank you, Secretary Huang.

504
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:55,630
Secretary Huang.

505
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,880
Secretary Huang.

506
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,520
I want to ask where Mr. Shen's office is.

507
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,640
Why do you want to see him?

508
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,230
I'm his assistant.

509
00:22:09,790 --> 00:22:10,790
I remember now.

510
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,090
Wei Ruolai, right?

511
00:22:12,750 --> 00:22:13,550
Yes.

512
00:22:14,990 --> 00:22:15,720
Come with me.

513
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,880
Mr. Shen works at the Economic Research Department.

514
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,940
It's next to the secretary's office.

515
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,760
Where do you live?

516
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:28,600
I live on Qibao Street.

517
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,430
Do you come to work by tram every day?

518
00:22:34,430 --> 00:22:34,950
Yes.

519
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,480
And I need to transfer once.

520
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,400
Fortunately, the traffic congestion is not very serious.

521
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,280
You'd better rent a house nearby.

522
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,900
Considering your salary,

523
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,630
you should be able to afford it.

524
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,050
No.

525
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:45,690
I...

526
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,930
am used to living there. I don't plan to change it.

527
00:22:47,930 --> 00:22:49,010
Fine.

528
00:22:50,070 --> 00:22:51,760
But when others ask you,

529
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,390
you'd better not tell them you live on Qibao Street.

530
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,160
Why?

531
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,510
Think about it yourself.

532
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:08,190
Mr. Song,

533
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,310
I suggest

534
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,670
we should punish people like Gao Feng seriously.

535
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:12,030
I don't think it's too much even if he is executed by shooting.

536
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:14,590
We should take into consideration whose man he is.

537
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,510
After all, we still need to show some respect to Kong Yongzhi.

538
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,170
I think we have managed to make an example of him.

539
00:23:20,790 --> 00:23:23,030
In the future, the voice of those who object to the reform in the industry

540
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,050
will be lower and lower.

541
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,440
Do whatever you want with Imperial Bank of China.

542
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,080
Okay.

543
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:34,800
Come in.

544
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:36,630
Sir,

545
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,550
today is Wei Ruolai's first day at work.

546
00:23:38,550 --> 00:23:40,010
He said he wants to see you.

547
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:41,310
Mr. Shen.

548
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,230
You have joined the company.

549
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:46,560
It's your first day at work.

550
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:48,270
You should

551
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:48,950
cheer up.

552
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:49,800
Okay.

553
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:52,470
During your work time,

554
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,010
apart from the tasks I directly assign to you,

555
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:54,810
you should

556
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,070
listen to Congyun.

557
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:57,970
Thank you.

558
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:00,330
Congyun,

559
00:24:00,790 --> 00:24:02,840
keep an eye on him. He has a lot of shortcomings.

560
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,840
Don't worry, Sir.

561
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,430
I will discipline him.

562
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,870
Ruolai,

563
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:09,440
I specially

564
00:24:09,710 --> 00:24:11,170
recruited you.

565
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,030
So I have to remind you.

566
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:14,310
Central Bank

567
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,630
is not a place

568
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,920
where ordinary people can be admitted.

569
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:17,720
In the future,

570
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,430
you must try your best

571
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,730
to stand out in the daily examinations and regular assessments.

572
00:24:20,730 --> 00:24:21,790
Don't embarrass me.

573
00:24:21,790 --> 00:24:22,370
Got it.

574
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:27,810
Congyun, get the car ready.

575
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:28,920
Come with me

576
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,680
to meet Imperial Bank of China's major shareholders.

577
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:31,680
It's almost time.

578
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:32,520
Yes, Sir.

579
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:35,670
Ruolai, get prepared too.

580
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:37,780
It's time to end

581
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,390
the battle with Imperial Bank of China.

582
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,830
Go to the stock exchange with me this afternoon.

583
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,750
Yes, Sir.

584
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:42,560
Sir,

585
00:24:42,710 --> 00:24:44,000
it's Ruolai's first day at work.

586
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,200
He doesn't know anything.

587
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,760
Why don't you let me go with you?

588
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,190
It's fine. I'll just ask him to make some records.

589
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:50,120
Don't slack off.

590
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:50,790
Okay.

591
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,390
Okay.

592
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:58,050
Mr. Yu,

593
00:24:58,110 --> 00:24:59,720
please save me.

594
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:00,750
I'm afraid this time, Shen Tunan

595
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,950
is going to take drastic measures against me.

596
00:25:02,950 --> 00:25:04,610
The expansion of Central Bank

597
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,830
has become a general trend.

598
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:09,520
You won't be the first

599
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,120
or the last one.

600
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,580
How about this?

601
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:16,120
You help me maintain control of Imperial Bank of China.

602
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,270
After this,

603
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:20,380
I'll give you a 10% stake in the company.

604
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:24,010
You'll be in charge of Imperial Bank of China, okay?

605
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:27,800
What do you mean?

606
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,150
You're forcing Shen Tunan

607
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,670
to take measures against me.

608
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,140
No, no, no.

609
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,480
I can help you.

610
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,120
But you should

611
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,150
continue to be the person in charge.

612
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:42,990
Don't worry.

613
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:45,190
I'm not helping you for money.

614
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:48,870
We share a common lot.

615
00:25:49,070 --> 00:25:51,070
The fox mourns the death of the hare.

616
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:54,670
This time, I must make him and Nanjing know

617
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:57,480
Huangpu River is not Qinhuai River.

618
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,590
I invited you guys here today

619
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,000
to let you know

620
00:26:01,510 --> 00:26:03,510
after Imperial Bank of China is acquired by Central Bank,

621
00:26:03,510 --> 00:26:05,510
you can still gain the same benefits

622
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,780
as those you gained in Imperial Bank of China.

623
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:07,750
I can

624
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,550
promise you this now.

625
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:10,950
Under the control of Central Bank,

626
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:11,750
highly advanced management systems

627
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:14,070
will be introduced to Imperial Bank of China.

628
00:26:14,070 --> 00:26:15,830
The income and expenses and dividends

629
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,990
will increase.

630
00:26:20,510 --> 00:26:21,510
Consultant Shen,

631
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:23,390
we all know

632
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,000
Deputy Director Gao Feng

633
00:26:25,270 --> 00:26:26,400
has been put in jail.

634
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
Everyone is happy.

635
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:29,310
That's right.

636
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,230
Everyone

637
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,070
is expecting

638
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:33,390
a unified, stable,

639
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:34,750
and well-ordered

640
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:36,190
financial market.

641
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,270
Okay.

642
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:38,520
You can rest assured.

643
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,430
It won't take long for this day to come.

644
00:26:40,430 --> 00:26:40,990
Good.

645
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:41,910
Come on.

646
00:26:41,910 --> 00:26:43,230
Let's drink a toast to Consultant Shen together.

647
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:44,160
Thank you.

648
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:44,680
Cheers.

649
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,590
Thank you.

650
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:50,870
Sir,

651
00:26:50,870 --> 00:26:52,280
I want to celebrate in advance.

652
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:53,720
We have persuaded these shareholders.

653
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,870
Now we just need to gain a 3% stake

654
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,360
from the market

655
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,520
to have a 51% stake in the company.

656
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:01,000
Then we can have absolute control over Imperial Bank of China.

657
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Zhang Mingquan will be out by that time.

658
00:27:03,870 --> 00:27:04,870
We can't let our guard down.

659
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,800
The biggest uncertainty now is the second-largest shareholder,

660
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:08,560
Yu Shiqing.

661
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:11,240
Congyun.

662
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:14,460
When you have time,

663
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,550
go to Lixin Accounting Institute

664
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,800
and visit Wei Ruolai's former teachers and classmates

665
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,990
to find out his background.

666
00:27:18,990 --> 00:27:20,390
Investigate his family background

667
00:27:20,390 --> 00:27:21,510
and political orientation.

668
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,010
Got it.

669
00:27:22,070 --> 00:27:23,200
And go to the library

670
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:25,140
to get me his borrowing history.

671
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,320
Borrowing history?

672
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:27,600
Just do what I told you.

673
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,200
Keep this between you and me.

674
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:30,470
Okay.

675
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:01,230
Who are you?

676
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,190
Get lost.

677
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:04,790
Hello.

678
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,440
I've told you everything I know.

679
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,400
I've told you who my superior and subordinate are.

680
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:18,600
I even helped you set up a trap

681
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,510
to kill my own comrade.

682
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,590
I also told you about Rixin Bookstore,

683
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:23,590
which has nothing to do with us.

684
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:25,050
You have caught Li Shengda.

685
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:26,380
What else do you want me to say?

686
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,350
You can't go too far.

687
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:35,490
Who do you think you are?

688
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:37,270
How dare you talk to me like this?

689
00:29:37,270 --> 00:29:38,430
If the captain hadn't stopped me,

690
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:40,630
I would have taken you to prison personally

691
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:43,310
and made you experience the torture tools one by one.

692
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:45,120
I promise every inch of your skin

693
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,290
wouldn't be intact.

694
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,920
Get out of the way!

695
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:53,260
Sir, let's go.

696
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,630
Stop here.

697
00:31:09,790 --> 00:31:10,390
Thank you.

698
00:31:58,920 --> 00:31:59,600
Bro.

699
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:12,490
The killer had a clear objective.

700
00:32:12,910 --> 00:32:15,170
The killer went straight to the targets.

701
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:18,070
These two people were already unconscious

702
00:33:18,350 --> 00:33:19,610
before they were shot.

703
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,810
How did you know?

704
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,710
If they got shot when they were standing,

705
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,310
their blood would have splattered on the wall.

706
00:33:32,950 --> 00:33:33,390
Biao,

707
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:35,900
take these two back for testing.

708
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,710
And check the residuals

709
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,140
in their mouths, oesophagi, stomachs, and intestines.

710
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,010
Bro, by the way,

711
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:44,060
our sniper said

712
00:33:44,390 --> 00:33:45,990
the killer should be a woman.

713
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,610
She disguised herself as a cleaner and sneaked in.

714
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:49,730
It was a woman.

715
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,160
Her height is between 1.62 and 1.65 meters.

716
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,070
If I knew this would happen,

717
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:04,750
we should have taken her down

718
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:05,950
at all costs that day.

719
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:09,550
Bro,

720
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,870
Gu Lun is dead.

721
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:14,219
What should we tell Mr. Kang?

722
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,080
What do you think?

723
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:22,760
I'll take responsibility.

724
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,290
Don't...

725
00:34:23,310 --> 00:34:23,969
Li Shengda.

726
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:26,389
Interrogate Li Shengda,

727
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,239
who Gu Lun told us.

728
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,040
Immediately.

729
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:29,670
Okay.

730
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:35,120
[The Chartered Stock and Produce Exchange, Shanghai]

731
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,440
Are you nervous?

732
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:04,590
No, Sir.

733
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:05,430
No?

734
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:06,870
I don't think you were so cautious

735
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:08,130
during the interview.

736
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,750
I wasn't a member...

737
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:11,710
of the company at that time, right?

738
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:12,720
You brat.

739
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,510
Mr. Shen,

740
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,650
according to your order,

741
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:25,230
the personnel, money, and transaction steps are all ready.

742
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,680
Zhang Mingquan is here too.

743
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,740
He came with Mr. Wang of Xingxia Bank.

744
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:31,600
Looks like Zhang Mingquan

745
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,120
has asked Mr. Yu for help.

746
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:34,390
Ruolai,

747
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:37,470
how much do you know about Xingxia Bank?

748
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:40,320
Xingxia Bank is Mr. Yu's important business.

749
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,200
It has strong capital strength.

750
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:44,360
If we rely solely on the capital strength,

751
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:47,940
both sides may suffer losses and maybe we'll even suffer a backfire.

752
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,520
An arrow shot cannot be brought back.

753
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,450
We have to fight this battle today.

754
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:52,180
Okay.

755
00:35:52,950 --> 00:35:54,790
Can we delay the accumulation

756
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:57,190
and apply for more money from the Treasury Department?

757
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:57,760
It's a good idea.

758
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:58,590
But you forgot one thing.

759
00:35:58,590 --> 00:35:59,880
Opportunities wait for no one.

760
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:00,870
If we submit an application,

761
00:36:00,870 --> 00:36:02,190
when we get the approval and the money,

762
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,510
it will be too late.

763
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,070
Mr. Liu.

764
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:07,820
Sir.

765
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,390
Since they have taken measures,

766
00:36:09,390 --> 00:36:11,230
let's carry out the second plan.

767
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:11,960
Adjust

768
00:36:11,990 --> 00:36:13,350
the financial status of each account now.

769
00:36:13,350 --> 00:36:14,280
Yes, Sir.

770
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:30,170
[The Chartered Stock and Produce Exchange, Shanghai Ltd.]

771
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,880
Why are you nervous?

772
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,790
With Mr. Yu's help,

773
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,960
we won't

774
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,150
lose this battle.

775
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:39,710
Of course.

776
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,120
The stock price of Imperial Bank of China is normal.

777
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,320
Looks like Shen Tunan

778
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:49,930
has given up after knowing the difficulties.

779
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,590
Bad news!

780
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:05,780
Mr. Wang, bad news!

781
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,060
Why are you panicking?

782
00:37:07,470 --> 00:37:10,600
Xingxia... Xingxia's stock price has been decreasing.

783
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,600
Someone is short selling Xingxia?

784
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:33,450
Hurry!

785
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,950
Gather our funds and fight back.

786
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:35,430
Go now.

787
00:37:44,790 --> 00:37:45,310
Sir,

788
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:47,310
we have encountered intense resistance

789
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:48,390
since Xingxia's stock price decreased to about 2.9 yuan.

790
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,680
Mr. Wang took action.

791
00:37:52,230 --> 00:37:53,990
Shift our target from Xingxia

792
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:55,020
to Xinhe.

793
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,510
Make sure

794
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,470
the offensive is more aggressive.

795
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,590
Yes, Sir.

796
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:15,760
Okay.

797
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:17,310
Okay.

798
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:17,910
Okay.

799
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,790
Got it.

800
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:20,630
So?

801
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,100
Xingxia's stock price is rising steadily.

802
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,630
Wang.

803
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,430
Wang.

804
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:29,880
Xinhe...

805
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:32,070
Xinhe's stock price is decreasing.

806
00:38:40,030 --> 00:38:40,840
Mr. Yu,

807
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:43,410
something is wrong today.

808
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,190
Someone wanted to short sell Xingxia.

809
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,210
We just stabilized its stock price.

810
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,390
But Xinhe Cotton Yarn's stock price started to decline.

811
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:50,230
Xinhe is our core asset.

812
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,190
Don't panic.

813
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,450
Gather our funds

814
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,240
and do our best to raise Xinhe's stock price.

815
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
This time, we must teach him a lesson,

816
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:57,680
make him scared,

817
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:58,590
and defeat him completely.

818
00:38:58,590 --> 00:38:59,760
Got it, Sir.

819
00:39:20,790 --> 00:39:21,440
Sir,

820
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:23,580
Xinhe's stock price is surging.

821
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:25,650
Tell Mr. Liu

822
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,000
to shift our target from Xinhe to Jinlong.

823
00:39:31,490 --> 00:39:32,690
Do you have a problem?

824
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:33,390
No.

825
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:36,980
If we do it this way, I don't think we'll have enough money.

826
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,220
Okay, I'm on it.

827
00:39:45,470 --> 00:39:46,090
Tell us.

828
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:49,390
Tell us.

829
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:10,620
Kill...

830
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:12,630
Kill me...

831
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,160
Kill me if you dare!

832
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:20,840
Kill me!

833
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:22,350
Louder.

834
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:24,800
It can make you

835
00:40:24,830 --> 00:40:26,120
brave and fearless.

836
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:28,720
You just won't tell us.

837
00:40:28,990 --> 00:40:30,230
You are quite tough.

838
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,660
But what's the point?

839
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,180
If you die,

840
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:35,510
who will remember you?

841
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:38,350
I heard that after people die,

842
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:41,230
they will go to Heaven.

843
00:40:42,830 --> 00:40:43,830
Your child

844
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:44,770
and your woman

845
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,950
will soon

846
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,980
meet each other in Heaven.

847
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:52,250
I'd like to know

848
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,990
what Heaven for the members of the Communist Party is like.

849
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,120
Li Shengda,

850
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:02,270
we just met.

851
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:04,110
You don't know me.

852
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:05,520
I

853
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:06,690
am reasonable

854
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,450
and I'm a man of my word.

855
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,630
As long as you tell me what I want to know,

856
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:11,880
I'll give you

857
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,860
whatever you want.

858
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:21,260
Mr. Liu. Mr. Liu.

859
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,070
Short sell Jinlong Cement.

860
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:23,470
Okay.

861
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,900
Make Jinlong's stock price as low as you can.

862
00:41:36,710 --> 00:41:37,400
This...

863
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:38,550
Wang,

864
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,510
this is strange.

865
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,710
Imperial Bank of China is fine.

866
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,030
But someone has been short selling

867
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:43,560
Mr. Yu's Xingxia,

868
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,070
Xinhe,

869
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:44,990
and Jinlong

870
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,150
one after another.

871
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,160
Hello.

872
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:51,280
Mr. Yu,

873
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,950
Jinlong is under attack.

874
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,190
Its stock price has declined almost 50%.

875
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,650
And it's still declining.

876
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:57,390
Gather

877
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,640
all our money

878
00:41:58,760 --> 00:41:59,640
to stabilize it first.

879
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,550
I'll think of a way to get more money.

880
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:02,670
Okay, got it.

881
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:03,510
Well...

882
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:04,590
Well, what about Imperial Bank of China?

883
00:42:04,590 --> 00:42:06,120
Of course we should help it.

884
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,820
Imperial Bank of China is their ultimate target.

885
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,580
Mr. Shen.

886
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:12,680
Sir,

887
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,510
we don't have enough money.

888
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,730
Jinlong's stock price is going up.

889
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,490
Mr. Liu,

890
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,390
calm down.

891
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,420
We should be composed now.

892
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:52,310
Do you know what I'm doing?

893
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:53,310
Giving a warning.

894
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:56,730
Do you think if I have succeeded?
