And

199
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,130
you have to

200
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,900
escort me out of Shanghai safely.

201
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:28,360
Are you crazy?

202
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,470
My brain was cut open.

203
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,670

204
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,220

205
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,090

206
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,530
I can give you the gold bars.

207

But i have to hear your info first

208
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,650

209
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,030
if it's worth it.

all the underground parties in Shanghai

212
00:11:01,510 --> 00:11:03,710
will be eradicated.

213
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,860
Is that worth it?

214
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:10,060
Eradicate them all.

216
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:27,030
When will the hole in my stomach go away?

217
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,780
Three or four days.

218
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:29,730
Don't worry.

219
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,950
When I was your age,

220
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,900
I climbed trees to get a bird's nest and broke my leg.

221
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:36,630
I was hospitalized for months.

222
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,210
You can climb trees?

223
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,630
Not just that.

224
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,390
I can even catch loaches,

225
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:43,190
hunt hares, and run away

226
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:44,580
after poking hornets' nests.

227
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,540
One time,

228
00:11:45,570 --> 00:11:47,570
a bunch of hornets chased me.

229
00:11:47,590 --> 00:11:48,510
Only your dad

230
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,340
got bit all over his face.

231
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,960
He ignored me for half a year.

232
00:11:53,290 --> 00:11:54,250
My dad said

233
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,510
you had to be disciplined all the time when you were little.

234
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,750
Me?

235
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
He had to be disciplined all the time.

236

He always thinks he's smart

237
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,610
and glib,

238
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,130
and tricked me countless times.

239
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:06,860
I wanted to

240
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,430
study abroad in America,

241
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,610
but he insisted on Germany

242
00:12:09,610 --> 00:12:10,880
and made me follow him.

243
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,350
In Germany, I wanted to study philosophy,

244
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,410
but he insisted on engineering.

245
00:12:16,290 --> 00:12:18,810
What China needs now is not philosophers

246
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:20,190
but actual experts.

247
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,580
Do you understand?

00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,340
Why don't you learn it

249
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:26,570
instead of making me?

250
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:27,510
You're so

251
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:28,380

00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:52,860
can we party with courtesans there?

390
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:29,600
Wake up.

391
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:30,470
Wake up!

392
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,030
Wake up!

393
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,990
Help!

394
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:43,570
Help!

395
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,540
Help!

396
00:22:58,310 --> 00:22:59,240
Call the doctor!

397
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,130
Call the doctor!

398
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:00,690
Okay.

399
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:04,200
Wake up.

400
00:23:04,470 --> 00:23:06,080
Wake up.

401
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,320
Come here!

402
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:08,760
Yes.

403
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:09,590
Yes.

404
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:11,910
Give him CPR.

405
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:14,300
Aren't you trained?

406
00:23:14,300 --> 00:23:15,060
Do it!

407
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:46,900
Who was it?

408
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,650
Who was it?

409
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,490
Who's trying to kill you?

410
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,190
Hurry up.

411
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,340
Who's trying to kill you?

412
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,590
Who?

413
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,130
I didn't see them.

414
00:23:58,550 --> 00:23:59,990
I think...

415
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,330
Who are they?

416
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,180
-Make it clear!
-Excuse me.

417
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:04,460
Make it clear.

418
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:05,290
Move aside.

419
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:08,710
Relax.

420
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:09,940
You're safe now.

421
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,040
Relax.

422
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:13,380
It's okay.

423
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,410
It's not safe here.

424
00:24:14,410 --> 00:24:15,210
Transfer him.

425
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:16,190
No.

426
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,510
He just had a big surgery.

427
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:18,910
We need to observe him...

428
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,090
Okay.

429
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,900
I'll get him discharged

430
00:24:22,030 --> 00:24:22,820
right away.

431
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:31,420
Relax.

432
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,890
You're fine.

433
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,350
You're fine.

434
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:41,280
Get out.

435
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,810
Follow me.

436
00:25:04,310 --> 00:25:05,710
What happened at this hour?

437
00:25:05,710 --> 00:25:07,680
The patient in Special Care Unit 3 almost died.

438
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,560
He was just rescued

439
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,490
and insisted on being discharged.

440
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,830
The communists are everywhere.

441
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,970
If you don't tell me,

442
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:24,660
they'll still kill you sooner or later.

443
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,460
I can send more men to protect you.

444
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:36,600
But I can't guarantee the communists

445
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,080
won't get desperate.

446
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,720
A wise man submits to circumstances.

447
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,030
Now you look like one of us.

448
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,050
Brother.

449
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:46,520
How is it?

450
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,780
We've searched everywhere.

451
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:50,910
Nothing.

452
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,740
Brother.

453
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,530
How about

454
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,220
we leave tomorrow morning?

455
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,540
Why?

456
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,950
Roadblocks are everywhere

457
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,210
because of the strike.

458
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,100
It's hard to travel at night.

459
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:09,440
Our imported cars all have flat tires.

460
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,780
Are you afraid of being ambushed

461
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,620
by communists on the way back?

462
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,930
Li Shengda is a nuisance to the communists.

463
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,480
They're always watching him.

464
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:28,260
He's a time bomb.

465
00:27:31,550 --> 00:27:33,610
Do you think he really saw the killer?

466
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,550
I think he's trying to stall time.

467
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,750
He wants to escape the hospital.

468
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:39,920
So he made an excuse

469
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:40,660
to fool us.

470
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,620
When he gets the gold bars,

471
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:43,760
he'll try to run away

472
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,820
like last time.

473
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,300
Then send more men to watch him.

474
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,520
If he still can't name the person

475
00:27:54,590 --> 00:27:56,190
after getting the gold bars,

476
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,020
tie him up

477
00:28:00,790 --> 00:28:01,870
and skin him alive.

478
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,570
Don't worry.

479
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,710
I'll get the gold bars for you.

480
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:22,550
If we catch the communist,

481
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,490
you'll earn a great merit.

482
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,230
Thank you, Captain Lin.

483
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,180
Forget about merits.

484
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,170
Please just keep me

485
00:28:32,670 --> 00:28:33,740
alive.

486
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,870
Can you walk?

487
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes.

488
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,410
Give this to Mom.

489
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,420
Slowly.

490
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,850
I'll hold your hand.

491
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,020
Slowly.

492
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,210
Miss Shen, Madam Shen.

493
00:28:56,550 --> 00:28:57,680
What a coincidence.

494
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,490
Captain Lin?

495
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,290
Let’s go back first.

496
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,890
Be careful.

497
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:06,260
You are...

498
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:08,330
Yu is sick and hospitalized.

499
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:10,660
Captain Lin, why are you here?

500
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,020
For work.

501
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:17,110
Transferring a criminal.

502
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,730
Thank you for your hard work.

503
00:29:25,770 --> 00:29:27,550
Go on with your work then.

504
00:29:27,590 --> 00:29:28,070
Okay.

505
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,760
She smells so good.

506
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,470
Auntie, why do you smell so good?

507
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:39,010
Let's go.

508
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,710
She uses Italian handmade

509
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:44,390
shampoo and body wash.

510
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,820
They're from Mrs. Yu.

511
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:47,390
The only set in Shanghai.

512
00:29:51,690 --> 00:29:52,500
Nonsense!

513
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,310
It wasn't an order,

514
00:29:55,330 --> 00:29:56,730
yet you acted on your own?

515
00:29:57,110 --> 00:29:58,110
It's my fault.

516
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,160
Punish me however you want.

517
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,410
I did send my niece to the hospital.

518
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:05,860
The enemy was right in front of me.

519
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:07,590
I had no chance to report to you.

520
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,540
You failed to kill him,

521
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:10,830
so he might recognize you.

522
00:30:10,830 --> 00:30:12,440
I shot him secretly.

523
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,700
I went over after he collapsed.

524
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:17,000
He couldn't have seen me.

525
00:30:18,590 --> 00:30:20,460
Just in case.

526
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:21,700
The Investigation and Arrest Unit has experts.

527
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,680
Through description,

528
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,680
they can draw your face accurately.

529
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,390
You came to my banquet before.

530
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,220
Lin Qiaosong might recognize you.

531
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,760
How did you fail last night?

532
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,690
Everything was going well.

533
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,080
I sneaked into his ward

534
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,320
while he was asleep

535
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,270
and smothered him with a pillow.

536
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:40,940
I only left after I confirmed

537
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:41,810
he died.

538
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:42,360
To think

539
00:30:42,390 --> 00:30:44,100
Lin Qiaosong would return then.

540
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:45,640
He saved him again.

541
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:46,650
It was all in vain.

542
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:48,450
Why is Li Shengda so hard to kill?

543
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,260
Did he see your face?

544
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,830
I don't know.

545
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,470
I was dressed as a nurse

546
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,340
and masked.

547
00:30:55,730 --> 00:30:56,490
But

548
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:58,760
when he was about to leave

549
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,850
this morning,

550
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,540
he looked at me weirdly.

551
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:04,790
You've been exposed.

552
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,520
You must leave right away.

553
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,270
Leave tomorrow.

554
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:11,560
I'll arrange for it

555
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:12,610
right now.

556
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,020
No.

557
00:31:16,030 --> 00:31:17,490
What will you do if I leave?

558
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,150
I have an emergency plan.

559
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:23,970
They're coming to my shop,

560
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:26,400
which means my identity has been exposed.

561
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,280
I'll try to evacuate as soon as possible.

562
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,050
Can I trust you?

563
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,060
Are you lying to me?

564
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,030
I know you can't let go.

565
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,470
But the situation is urgent.

566
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,780
We can't risk it.

567
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,150
I can't abandon you.

568
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,070
As long as you're alive,

569
00:31:44,070 --> 00:31:45,240
there's hope.

570
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:46,630
A revolution

571
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,070
takes a long time.

572
00:31:49,910 --> 00:31:51,270
As long as we're alive,

573
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,780
we'll meet again.

574
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,530
Yu is much better now.

575
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:49,660
It was all thanks to Ruolai.

576
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:52,430
The doctor said it'd be troublesome

577
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,630
if we were later.

578
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:54,620
Thank god.

579
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,750
I'm glad she's fine.

580
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:56,950
Don't worry too much.

that if gold is involved,

659
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,150

for confidentiality?
