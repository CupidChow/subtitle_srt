00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,430
Who else dares to do this?

6
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,000
Your brother is an official of the government.

7
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,660
Besides, he's working under Mr. Song's orders.

8
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:53,000
Who dares to make trouble for such a big matter?

9
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,250
Honestly,

10
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,380
if you have the guts, then fight face to face.

11
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:01,020
It's cowardly to do an assassination.

Sister-in-law.

It's almost been 40 minutes. He still hasn't come out.

22
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,650
Excuse me.

23
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,410
Sorry, excuse me.

Excuse me.

Excuse me.

How is he?

27
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,020
Mr. Shen was shot and is still under rescue.

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,320
It's okay.

29
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:11,020
Don't worry.

30
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,230
He will be fine.

31
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,690
He will be fine.

32
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,750
The heavens will bless him.

33
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,230
Tunan, you will be fine.

You will be fine.

The doctor is out.

38
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:25,260
The wound has been treated,

39
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,950
but the patient lost too much blood and needs a blood transfusion.

40
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:28,390
The hospital's blood bank is low.

41
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:30,190
Draw my blood.

42
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,710
The patient has type O blood. Who has type O?

43
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:32,670
Doctor, I do.

44
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:33,780
I'm his sister.

45
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,670
Draw mine.

46
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:35,380
Follow me.

50
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,250
I have type B.

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
I have type A.

52
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:48,170
I don't know my blood type.

53
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:49,180
I can check it.

54
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,920
Nurse!

55
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,700
Nurse!

56
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:24,910
Hurry and pull out the needle.

57
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,430
Hurry up.

58
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:26,190
Okay.

59
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:28,260
Wait.

60
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,910
Why are you pulling out the needle?

61
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,960
Miss, you have severe anemia.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,200
If you continue,

63
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,590
you may go into shock anytime.

64
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm fine.

65
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:37,100
Have you transfused enough blood?

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,710
No,

67
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:39,950
but your physical condition doesn't allow more.

68
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:41,670
-I said it's okay. Keep going.
-No, miss.

69
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:42,740
I'm a doctor. If we continue,

70
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,110
your life may be in danger.

71
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:44,909
Doctor, draw my blood.

72
00:04:44,909 --> 00:04:46,120
I just checked it. I have type O.

73
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,850
Draw mine.

74
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:48,190
Okay.

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:48,430
Hurry.

76
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,190
Help the patient down.

77
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,500
Help support her.

78
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:58,900
Nurse.

79
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,230
Get ready.

80
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:01,090
Prepare to draw blood.

81
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,350
Young man, come.

82
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:05,920
I'm okay.

83
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,360
Relax.

84
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:12,190
Relax.

85
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,330
Clench your hand.

86
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,340
Don't worry.

87
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,300
The patient is stable.

88
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,940
Don't worry too much.

89
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,210
Thank you.

90
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,670
You can let go now.

Are you okay?

94
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,350
I'm fine.

95
00:05:57,470 --> 00:05:58,980
You're done. We can't draw more from you.

96
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,470
It's okay. I'm young.

97
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,420
How is Mr. Shen?

98
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:05,840
The patient

99
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:07,650
is basically fine now.

100
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,560
He's just lost too much blood.

101
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,960
If we give him a little more,

102
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,220
he should wake up soon.

103
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,460
Okay.

Don't worry. Take a rest.

105

Okay?

00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,240
Okay.

108

It's rare to have some peace.

114

Let's have some alone time.

115
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,510
I'm fine.

116
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,270
Sit.

The doctor said

120
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,980
if you came half an hour later, you...

121
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,220
You'd be dead.

122
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,510
It's not that serious.

123
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,210
It's not that serious.

124
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,630
I don't care.

125
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:08,810
In the next six months,

126
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,680
you need to take good care of yourself.

127
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:13,510
Don't do any work.

128
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,000
You can do it

129
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,550
after you recover.

130

In my heart,

134
00:08:29,430 --> 00:08:30,230
you are the important thing

135
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:31,490
You're the only thing.

Can't you let them die for the country instead?

Okay.

139
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,419
Okay.

140
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:41,789
I'll let them go.

Miss Shen, you are here.

154
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,030
Why did you come out?

155
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,310
It's too stuffy in the room, so I came out for some fresh air.

Are you okay?

157

I'm fine.

This is

160

for me?

Thank you.

Even more important.

169

I mean it.

Mr. Shen has a great ambition.

Sir, there's no way out. What should we do?

194
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:57,430
Sir!

195
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,070
Get off.

196
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,090
Don't move!

197
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,320
I'm Shen Tunan from the Central Bank.

198
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,450
Someone is after me.

199
00:11:52,700 --> 00:11:53,580
Take him back.

200
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:02,270
You all go out and stand guard.

201
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:03,080
Yes.

202
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,060
Mr. Shen,

203
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:14,360
you're safe now.

204
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:15,990
We also caught one alive.

205
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,950
Thank you for saving my life, Captain Lin.

206
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:19,470
I have something important to do today.

207
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,800
Let's meet another day.

208
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,710
I'm not blaming you.

209
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,410
Hurting oneself to trick others works,

210
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,070
but you could've just shot me.

211
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,270
Why did you have to hurt yourself?

212
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:28,070
Shoot you?

213
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:30,980
Would they care if you got shot?

214
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:32,830
Assassinating an important political figure

215
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,540
is the only way to create public discourse

216
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,430
that the higher-ups will pay attention to.

217
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,230
I must be

218
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:39,170
the one who got shot

219
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,970
for Yu Shiqing to back down.

220
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:42,680
Understand?

221
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:43,570
Yes.

222
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:46,940
But I think Lin Qiaosong is very smart.

223
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:48,950
He must have found something amiss.

224
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,930
Mr. Shen, what a coincidence.

225
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:55,680
How did you know this room could save your life?

226
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:00,810
Knowing who's trying to kill me is more important now.

227
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,390
Don't worry.

228
00:13:02,570 --> 00:13:03,480
We'll interrogate him when we get back.

229
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,590
I'll give you the result as soon as possible.

230
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,190
Thank you.

231
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:13,320
So what if he finds out?

232
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,930
That was a temporarily-rented apartment

233
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,480
with a random red flag.

234
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,150
It didn't even have an owner.

235
00:13:19,150 --> 00:13:21,550
It was just a coincidence that we met there.

236
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:23,470
Also, I've anonymously asked

237
00:13:23,510 --> 00:13:25,900
the Astor House Hotel to leave Mr. Kang a note.

238
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,470
Mr. Kang has a long-term room there.

239
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,330
Transfer me to Astor House Hotel.

240
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:30,800
Communist?

241
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,550
Captain, no one here.

242
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,080
Captain,

243
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:39,780
no one here.

244
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:40,350
Captain.

245
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,320
no one here.

246
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,300
Sir,

247
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:45,130
this room.

248
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:51,180
He knew there was news about Communists

249
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,430
and told Lin Qiaosong to investigate it.

250
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,090
What does it have to do with me?

251
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:56,830
Sir,

252
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:59,750
everyone was worried about you after you got hurt.

253
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,350
Mr. Song

254
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,630
even called several times

255
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:02,790
to ask about you.

256
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:06,480
It's not enough.

257
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:09,480
I want Chairman Chiang's support.

258
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:10,710
I must let Chairman Chiang

259
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:12,270
hear these voices.

260
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,120
The proposal

261
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,670
to take back tariff autonomy can only be

262
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:18,660
fully solidified after he makes a statement.

263
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:20,650
Understood.

264
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,550
I'll contact

265
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:23,110
Nanjing's Central Daily News

266
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,710
and have them make a series of reports

267
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:25,710
on this proposal.

268
00:14:25,710 --> 00:14:26,230
Go.

269
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:26,950
Okay.

270
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,130
Sir, please rest well.

271
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,330
I'll get back to work.

272
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:33,740
Come in.

273
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:37,740
Miss Shen.

274
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,890
You look like you've recovered.

275
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,300
-Have a good rest these days.
-You’ve recovered fast.

276
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,430
Don't worry about the bank.

277
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:46,240
You can eat now.

278
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,500
I have a good appetite.

279
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,030
Chocolate?

280
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:52,250
Studying in Germany was stressful.

281
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,420
I always had anemia,

282
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:55,000
so you always bought me chocolate.

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,720
This time, you have to replenish yourself.

284
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,710
You still remember?

285
00:14:57,710 --> 00:14:58,310
Of course.

286
00:14:58,970 --> 00:15:00,750
Sir, are you okay?

287
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:01,830
Not really.

288
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:04,710
He's kidding.

289
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:07,640
I heard that

290
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,500
you gave me a lot of blood.

291
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,430
I can't repay such a big favor.

292
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:12,480
You don't have to, sir.

293
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,310
It's my duty.

294
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,700
Luckily, my blood type matched with yours.

295
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,150
Miss Shen gave a lot too.

296
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,010
She couldn't even walk steadily.

297
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,500
I was sleepy.

298
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,360
I didn't sleep well a few days ago.

299
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:23,430
Ruolai,

300
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,100
the effect of your speech

301
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,630
at the vote was great.

302
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:29,080
It shook the various social circles.

303
00:15:29,270 --> 00:15:30,860
Looks like I was right about you.

304
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,990
Sir, you flatter me.

305
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:34,700
Although I wrote the speech,

306
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,550
you commented on the key parts

307
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,140
and organized the logic.

308
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,120
Otherwise,

309
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,300
no matter how loud I screamed,

310
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,980
it would still sound powerless.

311
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,580
Is it the Central Bank's tradition

312
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,990
to flatter each other?

313
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:47,980
But you did a good job with flattering.

314
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,220
Tunan, are you going to give him a bonus.

315
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,140
I'm not flattering him.

316
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,220
I'm telling the truth.

317
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,300
You weren't there.

318
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,940
I was injured on the way.

319
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,140
The scene was a mess.

320
00:15:55,350 --> 00:15:56,620
Mr. Jiang and Deng Ze

321
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:57,580
were at a loss.

322
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,020
Ruolai

323
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,300
saw that trouble was brewing,

324
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,620
so he ran to the stage and gave a speech.

325
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,580
He made Zhang Mingquan and Yu Shiqing

326
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,110
unable to lift their heads.

327
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,220
Someone told me the whole process afterward.

328
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:11,080
It was full of passion and energy.

329
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,510
Wei Ruolai,

330
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:14,770
good job.

331
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,540
Thank you, sir.

332
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,820
Wei Ruolai, I didn't expect it.

333
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:19,920
You're not bad.

334
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:22,340
Congratulations on your great achievement.

335
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:23,300
It's my duty.

336
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:25,180
You must be rewarded for your contribution.

337
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:25,910
Jinzhen,

338
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:27,040
I'm bedridden,

339
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:28,670
so you treat Ruolai to a good meal

340
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,500
to express my gratitude.

341
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,260
-Okay.
-Sir,

342
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,990
no need.

343
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,510
It's his treat. Don't push back.

344
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:33,950
I'll choose a place and take advantage of this.

345
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:34,860
Hurry up.

346
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,940
I'll show you the real Shanghai.

347
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,940
Thank you, sir.

348
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:38,860
Eat well.

349
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,500
Okay.

350
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,410
Come on.

351
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:29,100
Order whatever you want.

352
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,300
Make yourself at home.

353
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,160
We'll order our own dishes, okay?

354
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,180
Okay.

355
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,660
Have you decided what to eat?

356
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:43,740
This one.

357
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:47,020
I'll order this.

358
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,820
You want this?

359
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,290
Yes.

360
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:52,850
Okay.

361
00:17:57,150 --> 00:17:57,950
Miss Shen.

362
00:17:58,820 --> 00:18:00,150
We'll order one of this.

363
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:00,660
Okay.

364
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,190
I'll tell the musician now.

365
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:04,960
Musician?

366
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:07,500
Didn't you want to listen to the violin?

367
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,190
Yes.

368
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,430
Let me look at the other things.

369
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,740
Shall I order for you?

370
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:20,970
Sure.

371
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,340
You can order.

372
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,070
What do you usually like to eat?

373
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:25,950
Is there anything you don't eat?

374
00:18:25,950 --> 00:18:26,580
No.

375
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:27,960
Wonton, noodles, pot stickers...

376
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:28,960
Anything is fine.

377
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,680
This is a Western restaurant.

378
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:39,870
Let's try something else today.

379
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,420
How about steak?

380
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,820
Okay, that's fine.

381
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,460
One medium sirloin.

382
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,920
It tastes better this way.

383
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,740
Then add one salad, one shrimp,

384
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:53,020
and two servings of mushroom soup.

385
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,500
Also one serving each

386
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,740
of this, this, and this.

387
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,060
Okay.

388
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,380
And escargot too.

389
00:18:58,030 --> 00:18:58,980
Okay, just a moment.

390
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,750
Thank you.

391
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,290
Snails are edible too?

392
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,950
They're like river snails.

393
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,100
You ordered so much.

394
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,660
Won't it be very expensive?

395
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:14,780
Don't worry.

396
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,020
My brother is paying. What are you scared for?

397
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,670
Besides,

398
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:19,180
we gave him so much blood.

399
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,870
He's supposed to treat us to dinner.

400
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:21,900
We have to replenish ourselves

401
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,700
by eating.

402
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:24,710
Also, I'm telling you.

403
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,620
My brother is very stingy.

404
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,420
It's not easy to get a meal out of him.

405
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,350
Don't hold back.

406
00:19:29,870 --> 00:19:30,500
Okay.

407
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:31,980
Okay.

408
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,870
Sorry, sir.

409
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,420
It's not visitation hours.

410
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,660
Mr. Shen,

411
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:47,610
sorry for disturbing you.

412
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:48,940
It's okay. We're friends.

413
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:49,470
Go ahead.

414
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:50,060
Okay.

415
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,860
Sit.

416
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,690
You came—

417
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,440
Have a seat.

418
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,750
What can I do for you?

419
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,020
You are injured.

420
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,730
I’m worried,

421
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:31,810
so I couldn't help but visit you.

422
00:20:31,850 --> 00:20:33,030
It's just a minor injury.

423
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,030
I'll be fine after a few days of rest.

424
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Here's the thing.

425
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:41,660
I heard from my men

426
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:42,790
that

427
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,010
they heard a gunshot first that day.

428
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,530
Then you and Secretary Huang

429
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,590
came in to get help.

430
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,110
The killer's car

431
00:20:49,230 --> 00:20:50,500
only entered the alley

432
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,180
after my men went out.

433
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,540
So,

434
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,410
who shot the gun?

435
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:05,150
What do you think?

436
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,700
The caliber of the bullet

437
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:10,280
in your body doesn't match

438
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,500
the killer's gun.

439
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:12,460
I am

440
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,600
quite confused about this.

441
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,500
Just say what you want to say.

442
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,490
It's boring to play dumb.

443
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,960
Mr. Shen, here's the thing.

444
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,510
I heard that Mr. Song is planning

445
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,710
a Tax Police Regiment

446
00:21:39,230 --> 00:21:39,990
and invited

447
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,460
Wen Yingxing, who graduate from West Point, to be the head.

448
00:21:42,460 --> 00:21:43,920
All positions will be new.

449
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,820
You and Mr. Song are close.

450
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,820
Can you make a recommendation?

451
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,830
What, you don't like working here with Mr. Kang

452
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:50,660
and want to work elsewhere?

453
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,300
Not me.

454
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,090
I'm a crude man.

455
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,430
I'm only suitable for the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

456
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,020
It's my men.

457
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,860
They are under great pressure to support their families.

458
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,890
I want them to work in a department with good benefits,

459
00:22:00,890 --> 00:22:01,730
but only you

460
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,810
can help me with this.

461
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,630
You move fast.

462
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,200
You put spies everywhere

463
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,440
in the government departments.

464
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,050
They're all your informants, aren't they?

465
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,810
I'm completely devoted to the Party.

466
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:17,270
I have a clear conscience.

467
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:18,580
Fine.

468
00:22:18,870 --> 00:22:19,910
If there's a chance,

469
00:22:19,910 --> 00:22:21,950
I'll make the recommendations personally.

470
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:22,350
Per...

471
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,270
Personally.

472
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,270
Mr. Shen,

473
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,700
thank you.

474
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:31,580
How's the interrogation with the assassin?

475
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,710
He already admitted

476
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,620
it was Zhang Mingquan's orders.

477
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,450
Then, that's just a small fry.

478
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,620
If you want a good meal,

479
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,220
we need to catch the big fish.

480
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,740
I just want to know

481
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,830
what role Yu Shiqing played

482
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,980
in this assassination case.

483
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,100
What is it?

484
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,660
Mr. Yu.

485
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,180
What are you doing?

486
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,640
Just tell me what's wrong.

487
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:02,830
The assassin we sent

488
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:05,020
was caught alive by Lin Qiaosong.

489
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,030
What?

490
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,150
What's the situation?

491
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:10,150
The informant from the garrison command told me.

492
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:11,190
I'm afraid

493
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:12,660
he's already exposed me.

494
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,150
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

495
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,600
I just found out.

496
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,390
Who would have thought that Lin Qiaosong would be there?

497
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,900
Mr. Yu, what should we do?

498
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,180
You were the one

499
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,980
who finalized the decision to kill Shen Tunan.

500
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:30,980
Who finalized it?

501
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:34,020
Tell me.

502
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,950
When did I make the decision?

503
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,840
You want to get us involved?

504
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,420
I'm afraid

505
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,550
the cost is far from enough.

506
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:49,710
Do you think I'm discussing with you?

507
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:53,780
Lin Qiaosong,

508
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,520
as long as I'm willing,

509
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,430
I can take you down

510
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:58,160
from this position at any time.

511
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,660
You should know Mr. Kang's temper and character.

512
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,790
Between you and I...

513
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,520
Who do you think he'd choose?

514
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,280
You.

515
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,300
But Mr. Shen,

516
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,020
before I fall,

517
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,360
I'll definitely take a bite out of you first.

518
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,780
Don't worry.

519
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,590
I will take care of

520
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,120
your family.

521
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:25,900
Mr. Yu.

522
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,620
Mr. Yu, I was wrong.

523
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:28,670
It was my mistake.

524
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:31,060
I was wrong, Mr. Yu.

525
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,590
I didn't act cleanly.

526
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:35,620
Mr. Yu, I was wrong.

527
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,950
I was foolish.

528
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:37,790
I was wrong.

529
00:24:38,450 --> 00:24:39,180
Mr. Yu,

530
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:40,160
I can still help you

531
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,620
do many other things.

532
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:43,060
Save me.

533
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,220
Save me.

534
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,410
It was my mistake.

535
00:24:45,410 --> 00:24:46,240
Alright.

536
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,260
Shut up.

537
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,470
Shen Tunan is righteous and selfless,

538
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:53,910
but the people who work under him

539
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,340
have families to support.

540
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,180
We both work loyally for the Party.

541
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,250
We have the same enemy.

542
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,440
To be honest,

543
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:08,860
with Nanjing's support,

544
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,570
ignorant old men like Yu Shiqing

545
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:14,150
will be eliminated sooner or later.

546
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,550
Which side should you choose?

547
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,190
Go back and think about it.

548
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,750
Please pause.

549
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:55,420
Excuse me,

550
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:57,440
can you change to a cheerful piece?

551
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:58,490
The Lark.

552
00:25:58,510 --> 00:25:59,270
Are you sure?

553
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,380
Yes.

554
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:03,380
But we never play this kind of piece in the restaurant.

555
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,300
Do you know it?

556
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,200
Yes.

557
00:26:44,530 --> 00:26:51,520
[Jiren Hospital]

558
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:01,960
Sir,

559
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,020
I was looking for you.

560
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,460
Speak.

561
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,590
We found Li Shengda.

562
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:06,660
Where?

563
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,920
The emergency room in the back building.

564
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,630
He's still in a coma.

565
00:27:12,190 --> 00:27:13,980
The doctor said he was shot in the chest,

566
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,410
but his heart is on the right side.

567
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:17,610
Otherwise, he would have died long ago.

568
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,110
Captain Lin.

569
00:27:35,410 --> 00:27:36,200
Captain Lin.

570
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,310
How is he now?

571
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:45,640
He's survive.

572
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,170
The bullet was removed,

573
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:49,220
but his head was severely injured.

574
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,820
There should be hematoma in his skull.

575
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,220
That's why he's in a coma.

576
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:54,920
Can he wake up?

577
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,050
It depends on luck.

578
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,340
The probability of waking up

579
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,310
is half and half.

580
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,560
No smoking in the hospital.

581
00:28:41,270 --> 00:28:42,000
Captain Lin.

582
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,480
I'm sorry.

583
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,310
Can he have surgery now?

584
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,100
Not at the moment.

585
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:07,140
He was shot and lost too much blood.

586
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,140
His bodily functions can't keep up.

587
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:10,070
He needs to recover.

588
00:29:10,070 --> 00:29:10,910
For how long?

589
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,460
We'll do it as soon as possible.

590
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,220
If we inject imported nutrition injections,

591
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,140
he should heal faster.

592
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,740
Then do it.

593
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:18,730
Wake him up

594
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:20,290
at all costs.

595
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:46,950
It's pretty.

596
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,860
It just sounds

597
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:50,860
a little sad.

598
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,890
This piece

599
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,000
is called Requiem.

600
00:30:58,140 --> 00:31:01,070
It's usually to remember a close one who passed away.

601
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,430
No wonder.

602
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,310
Who did you think of?

603
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,750
I thought of my brother.

604
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,000
He had an accident recently

605
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:14,340
and passed away.

606
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,040
My condolences.

607
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,220
Mr. Kang,

608
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,740
this is all I have.

609
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:28,520
Please help me.

610
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,820
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

611
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,810
You're out of your mind.

612
00:31:33,270 --> 00:31:36,260
How dare you assassinate the special advisor of the Central Bank?

613
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,940
And after the incident, instead of repenting,

614
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:40,710
you bribe me about the case.

615
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,070
No, Mr. Kang—

616
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,620
Guards!

617
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,540
Mr. Kang!

618
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,220
Punish him severely!

619
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,780
Mr. Kang!

620
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,060
Who else is involved in the assassination?

621
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:48,350
Get to the bottom of this!

622
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:48,860
Mr. Kang!

623
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,410
Take him away.

624
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:51,660
Mr. Kang, please have mercy.

625
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,690
Mr. Yu, please say something!

626
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:55,780
Mr. Kang.

627
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,740
Mr. Kang.

628
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,590
Mr. Kang,

629
00:31:57,590 --> 00:31:59,410
Mingquan came here

630
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,300
just to ask you for pointers.

631
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,870
There's no need to be so extreme.

632
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,910
This case is too big. I have no choice.

633
00:32:07,220 --> 00:32:08,940
I can only handle the case impartially.

634
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,590
Sorry.

635
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:10,790
Take him away.

636
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:11,180
Yes.

637
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,910
Mr. Kang!

638
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:13,110
Mr. Kang!

639
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:14,830
I beg you.

640
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,030
Please.

641
00:32:18,090 --> 00:32:18,940
It seems

642
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:22,240
that Mr. Kang has a successful career.

643
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:24,110
You won't give anyone favors.

644
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:25,500
Okay.

645
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:27,440
I'll take my leave then.

646
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,270
Mr. Yu!

647
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,070
Mr. Yu, wait.

648
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,000
Leave us.

649
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,180
Mr. Yu, calm down.

650
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:41,570
Calm down.

651
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,210
This matter

652
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:45,570
is not set in stone.

653
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:48,100
Just tell me what you want.

654
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,100
Gold bars, stocks, or real estate?

655
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,420
Say whatever you want.

656
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,160
We're friends.

657
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:56,120
It’s not good to talk about money.

658
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,480
I want you to help me

659
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:00,900
befriend someone.

660
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:03,460
Who?

661
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,670
Big Sister.

662
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:30,240
When I was young,

663
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,680
my brother taught me many skills.

664
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:37,300
He always said that it's good to be a jack of all trades.

665
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,590
If I had more skills,

666
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,500
even if he and our parents passed away,

667
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:45,450
I'd still be able to support myself.

668
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:46,780
So,

669
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,230
the living

670
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,760
must live well.

671
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:53,220
Whether alive or not,

672
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:55,220
everyone's life

673
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,960
has its own meaning.

674
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:00,470
Some people's deaths

675
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,250
are lighter than a feather,

676
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,870
while some people's

677
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,370
have a greater weight than a mountain.

678
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,060
Which one do you think

679
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,590
your brother's death is?

680
00:34:22,659 --> 00:34:23,389
I don't know,

681
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:25,460
but

682
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:27,960
he must have died for his faith.

683
00:34:28,550 --> 00:34:29,940
I think he had no regrets

684
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,300
before he died.

685
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:36,000
Absolutely.

686
00:34:50,949 --> 00:34:51,550
Enough.

687
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:07,480
The tattoo on your back is from the Green Gang.

688
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,420
It's easy to identify you.

689
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,670
We can also follow the clues

690
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,780
and find your family.

691
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,820
If you touch my family,

692
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,070
I won't let you go even as a ghost.

693
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,340
Calm down.

694
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm still discussing it with you.

695
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:26,420
Just tell the truth.

696
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,000
Did Zhang Mingquan

697
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,490
act under Yu Shiqing's orders

698
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,890
for this assassination?

699
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:35,230
We only accept Zhang Mingquan's orders.

700
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,260
Yu Shiqing?

701
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,250
Never seen him.

702
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,780
What are you doing this for?

703
00:35:42,150 --> 00:35:43,820
All you have to do is say yes.

704
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,580
Before I shoot you,

705
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,180
I'll find a corpse to replace you.

706
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,460
You go back and escape

707
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:49,380
with your family.

708
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:50,340
I’ll help you

709
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,740
deal with the Green Gang.

710
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:54,830
No one will hunt down a dead person,

711
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:56,140
right?

712
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:00,990
Captain Lin.

713
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:03,100
Yu?

714
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:04,320
Why are you here?

715
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,630
Mr. Kang wants to see you. It's urgent.

716
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,020
Mr. Kang.

717
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,750
From now on,

718
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,990
we are family.

719
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:15,340
Let me tell you.

720
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:16,870
Big Sister

721
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:18,110
thinks highly of you.

722
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:20,340
Next, it's up to you.

723
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,290
Do your best.

724
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,130
Do you hear me?

725
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,460
Thank you for your introduction.

726
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:26,300
But...

727
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,670
This opium business...

728
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:32,150
What?

729
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,360
Are you scared?

730
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,900
You have the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

731
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,860
Who dares

732
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,900
to check your goods in Shanghai?

733
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,240
Come on.

734
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,700
Opium is strictly prohibited

735
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:46,020
by the upper level.

736
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,680
I can be beheaded if anything goes wrong.

737
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:52,260
The more prohibited it is, the more profitable it is.

738
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,570
Big Sister has Mr. Kong behind her.

739
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,700
As long as you get this support,

740
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,430
you won't have to worry

741
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:00,000
about making a fortune.

742
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,360
Seriously.

743
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,560
Let's go.

744
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,820
Of course,

745
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,480
if you don't want to do this,

746
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:21,510
it's not too late for you to back out.

747
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,400
How about this?

748
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,490
Think about it a bit more,

749
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,180
okay?

750
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:28,260
Mr. Yu.

751
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,230
I'll do it.

752
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:34,300
From now on,

753
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,840
I'm counting on you

754
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,000
for my future.

755
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:49,320
Happy cooperation.

756
00:37:49,850 --> 00:37:50,980
Happy cooperation.

757
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:34,860
Mr. Kang.

758
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,190
This is

759
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:04,090
the one caught alive from Shen Tunan's assassination, right?

760
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,000
Yes.

761
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,450
I heard that Shen Tunan

762
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,190
is keeping an eye on this case.

763
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,260
Shen's public assassination is a big case.

764
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,930
Everyone is watching this.

765
00:39:18,550 --> 00:39:19,950
The only one caught alive

766
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,700
died in your hands,

767
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,070
in the Investigation and Arrest Unit's jail.

768
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,360
You're embarrassing me!

769
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:34,020
How can I explain this to Shen Tunan?

770
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:35,140
Come,

771
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,390
take his gun.

772
00:39:39,700 --> 00:39:41,100
What are you waiting for?

773
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:42,950
Sorry, Captain Lin.

774
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,100
You want to fight me?

775
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:50,420
Come.

776
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:52,400
Hit me here if you dare.

777
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:56,460
I know you have a backer in Nanjing.

778
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,180
If you don't accept it, you can report me to them.

779
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:59,900
I'll be waiting for you.

780
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,650
Sir, say something nice.

781
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,340
Get lost!

782
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,770
Mr. Kang,

783
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,040
I don't think this is suicide.

784
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,940
This is murder.

785
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,780
I request for a forensic scientist to intervene.

786
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,240
Don't change the subject.

787
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,100
You're not part of the Investigation and Arrest Unit anymore.

788
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,680
It's none of your business.

789
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:21,730
Mr. Kang,

790
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:23,300
this man was obviously hung up

791
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,100
after he died.

792
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,060
Those who die by hanging

793
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,060
have their tongues out.

794
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,670
Drive him out!

795
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:27,300
Mr. Kang!

796
00:40:27,820 --> 00:40:29,540
This is so obvious.

797
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:30,330
Why—

798
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:53,670
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

799
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:58,180
Are you eating?

800
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,360
Have you eaten?

801
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,120
Yes.

802
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,110
This is the Central Bank's budget.

803
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,420
It includes the military expenditure details

804
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:11,230
for the second half of the year.

805
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:13,120
I don't know if it's useful or not.

806
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:16,240
I'll transfer it to Jiangxi as soon as possible.

807
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:20,090
This time, the Central Bank took back tariff autonomy

808
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:21,860
and has sufficient funds.

809
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,110
They increased the funding

810
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:24,180
to the arsenal too.

811
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:25,060
I feel

812
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,220
a new round of "encirclement" is about to begin.

813
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:29,180
Your brother

814
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,700
is very troublesome.

815
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:32,790
Without him,

816
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,310
the Central Bank wouldn't have been revitalized so quickly.

817
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:36,770
If only this kind of talent

818
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,370
can come to Jiangxi.

819
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:41,220
What we lack are financial talents.

820
00:41:41,330 --> 00:41:42,460
Impossible.

821
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,280
My brother is a firm follower

822
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,550
of the Three Principles of the People.

823
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,280
Every time we talk about faith,

824
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,190
there's no way for me communicate with him.

825
00:41:49,190 --> 00:41:50,260
We always fight.

826
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,180
It's okay.

827
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,740
Communism depends on actions

828
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:54,740
instead of words.

829
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,540
One day,

830
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:58,540
he will witness the darkness and corruption of the Kuomintang.

831
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:00,140
We'll have a chance then.

832
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,580
That day will come.

833
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,140
By the way,

834
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:06,300
when I treated Wei Ruolai to dinner,

835
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,260
he said the Central Bank will make a big move

836
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,750
to avenge my brother soon.

837
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,040
What do you think it'll be?

838
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,470
My brother's enemy is Yu Shiqing.

839
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:18,350
He said before

840
00:42:18,670 --> 00:42:21,190
that he'd continue to acquire the private bank.

841
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:21,940
I'm guessing

842
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:25,020
they will acquire Xingxia Bank maliciously.

843
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,300
Xingxia Bank?

844
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,630
Xingxia Bank has been in international trade for many years.

845
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,710
The tungsten ore mine in Jiangxi Soviet

846
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:33,640
can't make sales

847
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:35,880
because of Xingxia's interference.

848
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,030
It's our tungsten ore trade's biggest obstacle.

849
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:41,340
Our superiors have asked us

850
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:43,000
to get rid of Xingxia long ago,

851
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,640
but we couldn't find a way.

852
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,300
This is a good chance.

853
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:47,720
Do you need me

854
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,420
do something for the organization?

855
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:50,420
Keep an eye on him.

856
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,650
Just report to me

857
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,410
about your brother's actions.

858
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:55,880
Okay.
