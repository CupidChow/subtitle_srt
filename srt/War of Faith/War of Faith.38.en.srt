00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,960
In the battle at Songmao Ridge,

3
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:55,560
our army lost tens of thousands of people.

4
00:01:58,229 --> 00:01:59,840
But we still failed.

5
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,940
This is the last barrier in the Jiangxi Soviet zone.

6
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,560
To avoid further losses,

7
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:11,360
the Central Committee has decided

8
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,590
on a strategic relocation.

9
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,470
Relocation?

10
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:15,000
Where to?

11
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,800
We are not sure yet.

12
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,000
But considering our special relationship

13
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,630
with Chen Jitang,

14
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:23,280
this transfer may pass through Guangdong.

15
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,150
I'm here this time

16
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,210
to accompany the chief to negotiate.

17
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:27,670
If we leave like this,

18
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:29,280
what happens to the bank?

19
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,400
What about the tungsten ores?

20
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,710
Are we going to give our

21
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:33,280
hard-earned assets to the enemies?

22
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
We're leaving to keep the flame alive.

23
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,150
The bank

24
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,070
and the tungsten ores

25
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:38,870
are important.

26
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,360
But can they be more important

27
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,820
than our comrades' lives?

28
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:43,910
So the Central Committee has decided that

29
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,590
all comrades on the Guangzhou line

30
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:47,190
must evacuate immediately.

31
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,150
Chief Lei,

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,870
can we wait a little longer?

33
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,360
You've been exposed.

34
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,630
We can't take any more risks.

35
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,030
I know.

36
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,070
But look,

37
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,800
this is the money we got from this batch of tungsten ore.

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,030
If we really need to relocate,

39
00:02:58,030 --> 00:02:59,680
we will need a lot of guns, ammunition,

40
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,960
and medical supplies.

41
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
I want to exchange the money for supplies

42
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,240
and bring them along.

43
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:09,680
No.

44
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,710
It's too risky.

45
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,630
Trust me, Chief Lei.

46
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,910
I will bring the supplies back to

47
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,080
Jiangxi Soviet before the troops move.

48
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,680
I'm going too.

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,150
Me too.

50
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,630
Me too.

51
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,030
Let's do it.

52
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,590
We've brought many people along this time.

53
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:19,190
Chunmiao,

54
00:03:19,310 --> 00:03:21,030
let's pick some more suitable candidates.

55
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,240
Okay, no problem.

56
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,470
Chief Lei, leave it to us.

57
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,800
Don't worry, Chief Lei.

58
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:26,680
Leave it to us.

59
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,190
Mr. Yan, this is the payment for the tungsten ore.

60
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:33,190
I hope to trade the cheque for medicine,

61
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,070
salt, ammunition, and portable radios as soon as possible.

62
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:36,070
This is the list.

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:44,750
The supplies are no problem.

64
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,280
I'll offer you a fair price.

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,590
But I want the transcript

66
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,000
and the private ledger of the tungsten ore trade.

67
00:03:52,310 --> 00:03:53,710
I want the original copy.

68
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:55,370
No problem.

69
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,940
I'll give it to you when the goods arrive.

70
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,030
These are the supplies

71
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:11,070
the military supplies for the “bandits” north.

72
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:12,720
Shen Tunan is keeping watch.

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,240
Whether they can be safely transported out of Guangdong

74
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,240
depends on you.

75
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,730
I'll try my best.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
Special Commissioner.

77
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:26,000
We have noticed frequent activities by the Guangdong Army lately.

78
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,830
Upon investigation, we found out that

79
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,950
a lot of military supplies were being dispatched.

80
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,280
The war at Songmao Ridge

81
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,240
has determined the Communist's defeat.

82
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,170
I think they want to take the chance

83
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,310
to seize the territory.

84
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:37,830
Wei Ruolai sold that batch of tungsten ore.

85
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,120
He has a large sum of money at hand.

86
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,600
He won't be returning empty-handed.

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,130
Then this batch of supplies

88
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:44,310
must be sold to the Communist Party.

89
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,360
If Zong's supplies were to leave Guangzhou,

90
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,720
they could only take one of two paths.

91
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,630
The Guangzhou–Hankou railway by land,

92
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,870
or the Beijiang River by water,

93
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,870
heading north.

94
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:58,150
He suffered a loss once on the Guangzhou–Hankou railway.

95
00:04:58,150 --> 00:04:58,950
This time,

96
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,280
he might take the waterway.

97
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:18,750
Is Wei Ruolai going by the waterway

98
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,390
or the railway?

99
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,920
We're not sure,

100
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,920
Mr. Yan.

101
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,240
Why don't I

102
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,260
send someone to investigate?

103
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,830
Just send someone

104
00:05:33,270 --> 00:05:35,470
to keep an eye on Lin Qiaosong's people.

105
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:38,490
Good idea, Mr. Yan.

106
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,860
Lin Qiaosong wants to catch them.

107
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,720
We'll just wait to catch him.

108
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,270
Keep an eye on him.

109
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,270
Will this batch of supplies worth 200,000 silver coins

110
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:48,680
be safely returned to us

111
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,530
or sent out of our borders?

112
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:52,680
It's all up to you now.

113
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:53,750
Rest assured, Mr. Yan.

114
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,610
With me around,

115
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:55,830
I'll make the Communists

116
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,070
surrender the supplies.

117
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,000
Last time,

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,720
Wei Ruolai really got us.

119
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,000
Luckily, Lin Qiaosong had no evidence.

120
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,310
Commander Chen can vouch for you.

121
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
Who dares to target you?

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,310
These supplies are important,

123
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,630
but more importantly,

124
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:15,560
is what Wei Ruolai has.

125
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,000
We must get it back.

126
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,920
This way.

127
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,190
Be careful.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,160
Put it on that cart.

129
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,240
Buddies,

130
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,360
these boxes are small.

131
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,920
One for each of you, okay?

132
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,600
Thank you.

133
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:32,800
You're welcome.

134
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,190
Come on.

135
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,190
Hurry up.

136
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,240
Captain.

137
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:44,920
How did it go?

138
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:45,830
I got them.

139
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,540
Sulfanilamide

140
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,190
and morphine.

141
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,480
The Guangdong Army sure is generous.

142
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,120
Even our soldiers on the front line don't get to use these.

143
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,190
Go back to work.

144
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,240
Don’t get caught.

145
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
Yes, Captain.

146
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,010
Special Commissioner.

147
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,830
Gang

148
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,310
sneaked into the transport warehouse

149
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,390
and randomly checked four boxes of goods.

150
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,520
They were filled with these supplies.

151
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,330
Special Commissioner.

152
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:16,430
This time,

153
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,070
you got it wrong.

154
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:20,520
Wei Ruolai must be taking the railway.

155
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:24,480
I don't understand

156
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:26,390
why Wei Ruolai

157
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,450
wants to fail twice in the same place.

158
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,000
Did he

159
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,240
predict your guess

160
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,830
and did the opposite?

161
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:34,830
No.

162
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:37,360
I'll go with you this time.

163
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:38,720
No need.

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,430
I'll go by myself.

165
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:40,150
I have to go.

166
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,360
About the tungsten ore incident,

167
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,830
Nanjing was unhappy.

168
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,680
This time, I must catch Wei Ruolai myself

169
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,040
to make amends.

170
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:53,760
Special Commissioner.

171
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,150
This batch of supplies

172
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,950
is the last supplies the Communists

173
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:59,010
are transporting to Jiangxi Soviet.

174
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,190
They will definitely risk their lives to protect it.

175
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,360
In this carriage,

176
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,070
you might die.

177
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:05,310
So?

178
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,360
It's dangerous.

179
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,280
Do you think I'm afraid of death?

180
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:16,800
Alright.

181
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:31,600
Biao!

182
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:43,730
Bow long have we known each other?

183
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,960
Seven years.

184
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,210
They all looked down on me.

185
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,320
They wouldn't even let me be their driver.

186
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,510
Only you were nice to me.

187
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,840
Burn me more paper money

188
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,790
and send some money to my mom.

189
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,400
What are you doing, Biao?

190
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,600
Come on!

191
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,080
I'll fight with you!

192
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:45,550
We must work hard

193
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,000
to kill all the communists in Shanghai

194
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,150
and return to Nanjing.

195
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,570
You're going out again?

196
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:24,670
Song Shoutian.

197
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,030
Meijuan misses you every day.

198
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,960
She even dreams about you.

199
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,030
She told me

200
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,960
you are her only family.

201
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,330
What do you want now?

202
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,270
You don't want her anymore?

203
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:36,120
Are you out of your mind?

204
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,750
Wenbiao, what are you doing?

205
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,030
Brother.

206
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,480
This is not the time to be merciful.

207
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,270
He must die. He knows our plan.

208
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:49,750
Brother-in-law.

209
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,000
Take care.

210
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,750
Your brother is dead.

211
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,440
I killed him.

212
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:15,800
He was sent to Jiangxi Soviet as an undercover

213
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,510
and betrayed us.

214
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:22,810
I really had no choice.

215
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:41,670
You promised me.

216
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,910
You promised me, Lin Qiaosong.

217
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,120
You promised me you would find him.

218
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,870
Why aren't you dodging?

219
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:10,000
There's a secret drawer under the bed.

220
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:12,360
It contains all my savings.

221
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,080
I probably won't

222
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:18,850
return from this mission.

223
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,840
Take the money,

224
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,250
go to Hong Kong,

225
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,880
and live a good life with someone else.

226
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:44,670
Lin Qiaosong, you bastard!

227
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:52,630
If we meet again in our next life,

228
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,790
I'll definitely marry you.

229
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:30,120
Cadets.

230
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,870
Wolves travel thousands of miles to eat meat.

231
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:35,910
What do you fight to the death

232
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,240
on the battlefield for?

233
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,130
There is a train

234
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,550
carrying 200,000 silver coins

235
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:43,840
worth of supplies.

236
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,960
Your mission is to capture it.

237
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:46,790
After you succeed,

238
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,840
all the supplies will be yours.

239
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,670
I only want his head.

240
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,510
Yes, sir!

241
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,390
We will complete the mission.

242
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,150
Comrades,

243
00:14:13,150 --> 00:14:14,670
from the moment we get on the train,

244
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,270
the fierce battle with Shen Tunan is inevitable.

245
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:18,080
I guess

246
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,320
Yan Youmin

247
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,780
will join this battle too.

248
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:22,840
Wasn't he on our side?

249
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:25,720
We both profited from the tungsten ore trade.

250
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,720
But this time,

251
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,510
due to the strategic relocation, the Red Army

252
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:30,360
has lost its value to the Guangdong Army.

253
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,150
Besides, we used them to cover for us

254
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:33,360
when we transported tungsten ore last time.

255
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,490
They'll try to get back at us this time.

256
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,200
This operation

257
00:14:37,670 --> 00:14:40,130
is bound to cause bloodshed and sacrifices.

258
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,290
Let's do it!

259
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,390
Move!

260
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,790
Who are you?

261
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:35,840
Where is Hua?

262
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,030
Hua's father died.

263
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,550
He went back for his funeral.

264
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:39,960
I'll work for him for two days.

265
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,600
You look like you've done this before.

266
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,030
Yes.

267
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:44,480
I worked on the Wuhan railway for two years.

268
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,720
I'll be in your guidance, Captain.

269
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:47,630
Alright.

270
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:48,870
Work hard.

271
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,120
Sanqiangzi.

272
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,790
You worked as a railway worker in Wuhan.

273
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,960
This time, you are in charge of

274
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:58,870
the steamer at the head of the train.

275
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,390
Okay, leave it to me.

276
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,320
Company commander Kong.

277
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,200
Lead Chunmiao

278
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,120
and those from the Special company

279
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,960
to keep the cargo cabin safe.

280
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:05,550
Alright.

281
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:13,910
Yuanbao.

282
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:15,440
Follow me and pretend to be train attendants.

283
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,570
Let's play it by ear.

284
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:17,320
Okay.

285
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:33,320
Come in.

286
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,150
How is it?

287
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:38,390
Sir,

288
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:39,840
I've checked the carriages behind.

289
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
I didn't find Wei Ruolai.

290
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,440
What about the last three carriages?

291
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,600
They were locked.

292
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,720
Yan Youmin's men are in the front carriage.

293
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,750
He's trying to take them down as well.

294
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,550
The Communist Party is weak right now.

295
00:16:50,550 --> 00:16:52,280
Yan Youmin chose a good timing.

296
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:53,510
Sir.

297
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:55,080
When will you do it?

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,870
No hurry.

299
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:56,870
Guangzhou and its vicinity

300
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:59,330
are under the control of the Guangdong Army.

301
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,960
We'll talk after we get out of Hua County.

302
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,550
Yes.

303
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:20,960
Captain Li.

304
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,880
The train will pass Hua County soon.

305
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,400
Don't miss anyone.

306
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:25,920
Yes.

307
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:27,460
Rest assured, Mr. Yan.

308
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,790
Attention!

309
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,400
Right dress.

310
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,270
Look forward.

311
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,440
Everyone!

312
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,310
Get ready!

313
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:57,790
Yes.

314
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,680
Turn right. Turn left.

315
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
Run!

316
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,160
You...

317
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,070
Who are you?

318
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:18,590
It doesn't matter who I am.

319
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,590
Without my order,

320
00:18:20,590 --> 00:18:22,240
this train cannot stop.

321
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:23,480
Okay.

322
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,000
Go.

323
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,030
Stop the train!

324
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,740
Stop the train!

325
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:08,000
Why isn't the train stopping?

326
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,110
I don't know either.

327
00:19:20,310 --> 00:19:21,270
What?

328
00:19:22,310 --> 00:19:23,770
The train hasn't stopped.

329
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,480
Why didn't you set a roadblock?

330
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,830
Are you stupid?

331
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:34,640
Good thing Secretary Xiao is on the train.

332
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,110
Erbao, take someone to the front

333
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,110
and force the train to stop.

334
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:39,480
Yes, sir!

335
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,310
The rest of you, follow me to the back to get the goods.

336
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,110
Yes, sir!

337
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,400
Find the goods.

338
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,930
Hua County hasn't stopped.

339
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:51,830
Isn't it perfect?

340
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:53,680
The Guangdong Army

341
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:54,400
and Wei Ruolai are both on the train.

342
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,030
if they fight,

343
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,400
we can watch them fight.

344
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,110
Hurry up.

345
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,070
Find them.

346
00:20:01,070 --> 00:20:01,920
Yes.

347
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,550
If we fail this mission,

348
00:20:07,550 --> 00:20:08,920
our career

349
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,590
will end here.

350
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,960
Not necessarily.

351
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,190
Even if we don't do anything,

352
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:18,070
Yan Youmin won't let this train

353
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,590
leave Guangdong.

354
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:38,830
Get out of the way!

355
00:20:48,750 --> 00:20:51,010
They're fighting. Let's watch the show.

356
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:55,210
Shen Tunan, aren't you tired?

357
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,120
Since we boarded the train,

358
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:04,720
you've been buying time for Wei Ruolai.

359
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:05,780
What are you doing?

360
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,590
Shen Tunan.

361
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:10,440
All the things you've done since returning from Communist-controlled areas.

362
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,790
Do you take me for a fool?

363
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:13,200
Since ancient times,

364
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,480
noble and civil official families

365
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,750
rarely produced rebels.

366
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,680
Why did you and Shen Jinzhen

367
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,720
betray Kuomintang?

368
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,110
Why? Say something!

369
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,400
I know you're high-minded.

370
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:28,960
Even when a gun is pointing at you,

371
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,690
you do not lose your composure.

372
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,550
Do you know what the

373
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,070
higher-ups think of you?

374
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,790
A bucket of shit.

375
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,240
Stinky dung.

376
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,590
Did you think they viewed you

377
00:21:42,590 --> 00:21:43,790
as some kind of great, capable,

378
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,400
and benevolent individual?

379
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,830
Let me tell you the truth.

380
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,880
Once the communists are over, Guangzhou will be gradually reclaimed.

381
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,160
They will send their men to take over Guangzhou.

382
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:52,830
You

383
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,590
will become useless.

384
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:57,160
Your death is the order of the higher-ups.

385
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,720
Don't be surprised.

386
00:22:02,550 --> 00:22:04,790
Don't look like you didn't expect this from them.

387
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,070
Don't be eager to leave when you're dead.

388
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:07,200
Wait for Wei Ruolai.

389
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,550
The two of you can

390
00:22:08,550 --> 00:22:11,280
look for Shen Jinzhen on the other side together.

391
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,750
Farewell.

392
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:17,350
Sir!

393
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:33,310
The special commissioner colluded with the Communist Party.

394
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:35,040
I have executed him on the spot.

395
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:36,270
Move!

396
00:22:36,270 --> 00:22:36,920
Yes.

397
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:24,920
Retreat!

398
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:50,750
Get on the last carriage.

399
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:57,350
Kong!

400
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,240
Sir.

401
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:23,000
Sir.

402
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:31,310
Congyun.

403
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:44,720
Congyun.

404
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:52,480
Sir!

405
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:55,030
I...

406
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:56,440
I always

407
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:00,790
knew.

408
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,070
Back at

409
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,800
Yangquan Restaurant...

410
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,590
You are so smart.

411
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,480
How...

412
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,520
How could you have let them know your bottom price?

413
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:19,960
Is this a trap

414
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:22,880
set up by you and Wei Ruolai?

415
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,310
Why?

416
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,550
When I was in Ruijin,

417
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,830
I saw a different kind of life

418
00:25:32,830 --> 00:25:34,240
for ordinary people.

419
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:37,160
I also saw another possibility

420
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,620
for the country's future.

421
00:25:40,110 --> 00:25:41,570
I struggled for a long time

422
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,200
before I finally made up my mind.

423
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,160
I'm sorry.

424
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,240
I'm sorry.

425
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:53,510
I'm sorry.

426
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:55,240
Congyun.

427
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,520
I can't accompany you anymore.

428
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,830
I asked my classmates

429
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,750
to send this latest bulletproof vest

430
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,440
all the way from America.

431
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,590
It suits you.

432
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,310
Wei Ruolai! You are so lucky.

433
00:27:58,310 --> 00:27:59,550
You never die.

434
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,350
I have to thank you this time.

435
00:28:02,510 --> 00:28:03,750
Nanjing gave the order

436
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:05,030
to kill Shen Tunan.

437
00:28:05,030 --> 00:28:07,350
I had no choice but to rely on you.

438
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,830
A party politician must die at the hands of the Communist Party.

439
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,400
When you and Shen Tunan go to the other side,

440
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,860
remember to say hello to Shen Jinzhen for me.

441
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,280
You're also responsible

442
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,030
for Jinzhen's death.

443
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,480
She died for her faith.

444
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,240
Although she died, she remains alive through faith.

445
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:04,510
Sir.

446
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:06,480
I know it was you.

447
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,010
Otherwise, I couldn't have completed the task.

448
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:17,960
Comrade Jinzhen

449
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,820
gave me a book called Das Kapital.

450
00:29:20,310 --> 00:29:21,440
Reading it saved me.

451
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:22,750
I sincerely hope

452
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,440
it can save you too.

453
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,400
I used to think that Jinzhen's ideology

454
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,060
was too childish and extreme.

455
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,840
But after going through so many things,

456
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,860
I think the most childish and extreme person

457
00:29:41,070 --> 00:29:41,920
is me.

458
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,010
Comrade Jinzhen once said

459
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:49,410
you would join the Communist Party

460
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,760
and become our comrade for sure.

461
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,160
Don't move.

462
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:55,880
Put it down.

463
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,110
The Guangdong Army is guarding Shaozhou Station.

464
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,710
I can cover you as you alight.

465
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:06,480
No need.

466
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:08,980
Take care of yourself.

467
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:11,590
I hope one day,

468
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,350
we can fight together.

469
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,510
The last three carriages are carrying military supplies.

470
00:31:31,510 --> 00:31:32,510
Board the train and check them.

471
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,510
Watch the train.

472
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,400
Yes.

473
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,110
Don't move.

474
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,750
I'm a special commissioner of the Southern Jiangxi Economic Embargo Division.

475
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:43,270
Tu Nanshen.

476
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:44,110
I have my ID.

477
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:52,350
Sir.

478
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:19,160
Sir, they are rocks!

479
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,490
Open all of them. Hurry!

480
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,310
Yes.

481
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,200
Here too, it's all rocks.

482
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,880
Sir, it's all rocks.

483
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,350
Sir, it's all rocks.

484
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,400
Ruolai,

485
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,170
no matter what happens in the future,

486
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:17,270
remember your original intention.

487
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,480
Don't be like me.

488
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:20,200
I only cared about winning and losing

489
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,000
and forgot my true intention.

490
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:24,410
In Jiangxi Soviet,

491
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,650
I saw the shape of a modern country.

492
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,480
I also saw the class integration

493
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,550
that no previous dynasties achieved.

494
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:31,480
I saw another way of living

495
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,160
for the common folks.

496
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:33,920
I also saw

497
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,050
another possibility for our country.

498
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,610
At that moment, I had to admit that

499
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:39,920
the Communist Party

500
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:41,400
has matured.

501
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:43,310
Compared to them,

502
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,920
our Kuomintang has done

503
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,310
too little for the people.

504
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,770
I hesitated for a long time

505
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,960
and finally made up my mind.

506
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:00,240
Hello.

507
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,770
Please publish this for me.

508
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,630
Thank you.

509
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,010
Come, give me a hand.

510
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,480
Be careful.

511
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,150
Take it.

512
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,020
Handle them with care.

513
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:03,550
Be careful.

514
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,920
Thank you for your hard work, comrade Chunmiao.

515
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,190
You must be tired from such a long journey.

516
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:09,850
It's my duty. We finally transported them here.

517
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:11,070
Let everyone get back to work.

518
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:11,480
Okay.

519
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,360
Thank you.

520
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,110
Come on.

521
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:14,960
Slow down, comrade.

522
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:21,590
Shen Tunan is keeping a close watch.

523
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,400
So we can only create a distraction

524
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:23,920
and transport the goods in secret.

525
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,230
We'll openly take the railway

526
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,190
but secretly

527
00:35:26,550 --> 00:35:28,480
take the Beijiang River waterway.

528
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,320
How can we make them think

529
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:31,780
we're taking the railway?

530
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,480
Transfer to a different warehouse.

531
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:34,760
Lin Qiaosong and Yan Youmin

532
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,110
will definitely send someone to investigate.

533
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:37,550
You'll be in charge

534
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:38,800
of showing him the crate

535
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,550
carrying medical supplies.

536
00:35:42,030 --> 00:35:43,800
How would I know who the spy is?

537
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,480
Transporters have large bone structures.

538
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,630
Their veins are prominent.

539
00:35:46,630 --> 00:35:47,550
They often bend their backs for work

540
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,210
so they tend to hunch a little.

541
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,320
Their calves are more toned too.

542
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,030
People without these traits are all spies.

543
00:35:55,030 --> 00:35:57,110
People tend to trust the facts they find,

544
00:35:57,110 --> 00:35:59,280
especially untrusting people like Lin Qiaosong.

545
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
So we must focus

546
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:02,630
everything on the train.

547
00:36:02,630 --> 00:36:03,760
The moment they see through our act,

548
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
they will stop the cargo ships in the Beijiang River immediately.

549
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,000
So no matter how much sacrifice we have to make,

550
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,150
we have to put up

551
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:10,030
a perfect show.

552
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,400
Get on the last carriage!

553
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,360
Salute!

554
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,920
Recover.

555
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:27,760
In October 1934,

556
00:37:28,030 --> 00:37:30,480
after the fifth failed anti-encirclement operation,

557
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:33,510
to evade the Kuomintang army's encirclement,

558
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:34,480
the Central Revolutionary Military Commission

559
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,880
of the Communist Party Central Committee decided

560
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,630
to lead the main Red Army,

561
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:39,150
consisting of 86,000 soldiers,

562
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:42,110
and depart from Ruijin, Gucheng, and Jiangxi

563
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:44,590
to carry out a strategic relocation.

564
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,360
The Long March

565
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,800
began.

566
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:49,590
The Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank

567
00:37:49,590 --> 00:37:52,000
was incorporated into the column directly under the Central Military Commission.

568
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,550
The 15th Brigade

569
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:56,880
began their long journey.

570
00:37:57,230 --> 00:37:58,360
Are we just leaving like this?

571
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,190
What's wrong?

572
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,630
I'm a little sad.

573
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,090
This is where my dream started.

574
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:09,590
Comrades.

575
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,550
No one wants to leave here.

576
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,110
We don't know

577
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:17,130
what the future is like.

578
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:19,120
I remember Chairman Mao once said,

579
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,770
"A single spark can start a prairie fire."

580
00:38:22,030 --> 00:38:23,830
We have over 160 carrying poles.

581
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,480
Our cash printing machines

582
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,800
and coin-minting machines

583
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,480
are not only the bank's treasures,

584
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,940
but also sparks of flames.

585
00:38:30,280 --> 00:38:31,230
Our bank

586
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,190
was built from scratch.

587
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,840
That itself is a miracle.

588
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,150
Although it may be the smallest bank

589
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:37,450
in the world right now.

590
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:38,940
You can even call it

591
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,070
a bank on the go.

592
00:38:42,070 --> 00:38:42,670
But

593
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,960
as long as we keep the flame alive,

594
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:47,400
one day, it will spread like wildfire

595
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,630
across China!

596
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,480
Yes, it will!

597
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:51,920
Yes.

598
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,400
It will!

599
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:55,230
When I first left my hometown,

600
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,630
I was filled with curiosity and anticipation

601
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:59,440
for the Western world in Shanghai.

602
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,080
Tempered by blood and fire,

603
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,110
I became a determined revolutionary

604
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:06,150
from the ignorant youth I was.

605
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,610
When I left for the second time,

606
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:11,070
I was no longer a youth.

607
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,230
But my passion is still there.

608
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:15,710
I believe,

609
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,280
sooner or later,

610
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,030
we will return proudly

611
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:20,550
to our homeland.

612
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:26,110
October 1935,

613
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:28,590
after arriving in the Northern Shaanxi Revolutionary Base area,

614
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:30,480
I continued to work in finance.

615
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,000
Until December 1936,

616
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,760
I was arranged to go back

617
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,960
to Shanghai under a different identity

618
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,010
to meet comrade Guyan, an undercover party member.

619
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:43,000
Over there,

620
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,760
we will work together

621
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,070
to create a new financial legend.

622
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,630
Something major happened in Xi'an.

623
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:11,190
Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng advised Chiang Kai-shek on military action.

624
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:13,280
Newspaper!

625
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,360
Something major happened in Xi'an.

626
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,230
Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng advised Chiang Kai-shek on military action.

627
00:41:20,230 --> 00:41:21,000
Newspaper!

628
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,960
Give me a copy.

629

630
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,110

633

Shanghai Stock Exchange.
