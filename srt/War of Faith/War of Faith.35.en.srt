1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,280
Jinzhen's in the city?

3
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,470
Yes, Ruolai too.

4
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:39,650
They must be looking for Qian Fengshi to buy salt.

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:44,840
Do whatever you need

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,430
to get evidence of Qian Fengshi's communist ties.

7
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,920
But before the deal,

8
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,789
don't meddle with them.

9
00:01:49,789 --> 00:01:51,000
What about Shen Jinzhen?

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,430
She's my sister

11
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,270
but also a communist.

12
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,150
Pardon me then.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,350
Wait.

14
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,070
Let me remind you.

15
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,360
Jinzhen's great at shaking off pursuers.

16
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,590
Don't worry.

17
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,280
Since they're here for Qian Fengshi,

18
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,400
we just need to keep an eye on him.

19
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:08,960
Okay.

20
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,150
Hello?

21
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,310
Hello.

22
00:02:22,030 --> 00:02:23,000
Mr. Yan.

23
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:26,110
Long time no see.

24
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:27,680
What can I do for you?

25
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,000
Ganzhou's account

26
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,120
this month is atrocious.

27
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,240
It's all because of the new special commissioner.

28
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,370
I've investigated.

29
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:34,960
His

30
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,240
real name is Shen Tunan.

31
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,000
He's sent by Chiang from Nanjing.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,360
He blocked Sanjiang Kou.

33
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,840
We can't get our goods out.

34
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,150
We have no choice.

35
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,150
You have one month

36
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,680
to solve the problem,

37
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,620
or you can retire and go back to Jiangmen.

38
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:51,070
Mr. Yan.

39
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,190
Mr. Yan!

40
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,080
These darn debtors.

41
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,400
I'm not made of money!

42
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,710
Where are you from?

43
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:22,970
I'm returning from visiting relatives.

44
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:30,690
Where are you from?

45
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,290
We are together.

46
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,120
Go.

47
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,870
The pass code book of Sanjiang Kou's boats

48
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,329
must be with your brother.

49
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:43,590
If we get it,

50
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,470
we can end the lockdown.

51
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,840
I know.

52
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,030
But my brother is very vigilant.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,120
I've to find the right time to do it.

54
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,190
Okay, be careful.

55
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,070
You too.

56
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,070
We have

57
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,840
something on Qian Fengshi.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,640
I'm afraid he'll get desperate.

59
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:03,280
Got it.

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,390
Boss.

61
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,600
The money's on the table.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,390
Okay. Take care, sir.

63
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:21,360
Fortune telling.

64
00:04:21,829 --> 00:04:23,390
Get some advice.

65
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:25,340
Want a reading?

66
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,190
Fortune telling.

67
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,830
Get some advice.

68
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,150
Fortune telling.

69
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,040
Get some advice.

70
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:35,750
Sir.

71
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,880
Sir, want a reading?

72
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,240
Stop.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,630
Let me read your fortune.

74
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,240
How dare you

75
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,440
swindle people here?

76
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,360
Sir, things mustn't be going well for you lately.

77
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,240
Mr. Liu.

78
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Your forehead, cheekbones, and lifespan

79
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,870
are all red.

80
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:53,970
What do you mean?

81
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:56,240
It means

82
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,040
you recently lost money,

83
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,190
a place,

84
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:01,240
and maybe even met with death threats?

85
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,640
I'll kill you if you keep talking nonsense.

86
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,750
Brother.

87
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,740
Where are you from?

88
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,560
Ruijin.

89
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,920
Sir.

90
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:21,430
Lin Qiaosong found traces of Ruolai

91
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:23,560
through an inspection at Qian's area.

92
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:25,960
What about Jinzhen?

93
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,040
We lost her.

94
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,190
After they separated,

95
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,360
she disappeared.

96
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,650
Got it. Go back to work.

97
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:37,070
Yes.

98
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:47,830
Brigade Commander Qian.

99
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:49,150
I'll make it short.

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,510
I'm the negotiator of Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank,

101
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,560
Wei Ruolai.

102
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,130
I'm here to discuss business with you.

103
00:05:56,950 --> 00:05:59,010
Communism suppression is tight now.

104
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,160
Cooperating with you again

105
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:02,950
will get me killed.

106
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:04,750
What if it's a dead end?

107
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,480
On the surface,

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:10,800
the fight for control of Sanjiang Kou

109
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:11,920
appears to be

110
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,240
between you and Shen Tunan,

111
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,190
but it's really between

112
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,050
Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Jitang.

113
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,030
Shen Tunan is doing well now.

114
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,950
But how will you explain

115
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,750
to Chen Jitang?

116
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,870
A communist like you

117
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:29,360
doesn't have to worry about this.

118
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,680
No matter what,

119
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,800
I am the general of the army.

120
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:38,150
I have

121
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:40,270
a lot of your accounts.

122
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,070
For the past few years,

123
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:43,630
you've been supporting Jiangxi Soviet's construction.

124
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:44,600
How dare you threaten me?

125
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,240
If I have the accounts,

126
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,040
Shen Tunan has them too.

127
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:50,560
You're now Chen Jitang's beloved general.

128
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,600
Shen Tunan's wary and can't provoke you.

129
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,430
But if you

130
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,430
can't offer Chen Jitang money,

131
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,920
you'll be useless to him.

132
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,630
By then,

133
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:00,760
will he still protect you at all costs?

134
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,180
What goods do you want?

135
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
Salt.

136
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,070
We have salt.

137
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:26,560
Brigade Commander.

138
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:29,240
We have a batch of top-grade salt

139
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,950
from Guangdong.

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:35,190
Unfortunately, we don't have a new pass.

141
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,040
It's at Taojiang Pier.

142
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,310
It can't get in.

143
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,480
So we're going to

144
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
send it back.

145
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,680
Deputy Chief Wei.

146
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,120
If you really have a way

147
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,920
to transport salt out of Tunan's hands,

148
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,360
I will

149
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,720
do business with you.

150
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,310
Okay.

151
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,750
You're forthright.

152
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:03,480
We'll take this batch of salt.

153
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:21,630
Hello.

154
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:23,080
Excuse me.

155
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,370
It's time for her medicine.

156
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:30,310
But she just fell asleep.

157
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,000
Let's wait a while then.

158
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,360
Yu, look.

159
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,870
Let's eat a little.

160
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,000
It's okay.

161
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:38,270
Then I will

162
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:41,000
peel your favorite oranges for you, okay?

163
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,600
Then I'm sure

164
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,840
you will eat it.

165
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,390
Aunt?

166
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,150
Aunt?

167
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
Is that you?

168
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,550
Aunt.

169
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,030
I missed you so much.

170
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,360
Where have you been?

171
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,600
I couldn't find you.

172
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,600
It's okay.

173
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,840
I'm here to see you.

174
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,390
Okay, be good.

175
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:44,790
You'll get better.

176
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,240
You will.

177
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,360
Yu.

178
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,390
I'll talk to your mom.

179
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:53,670
I'll be back soon,

180
00:11:53,670 --> 00:11:54,440
okay?

181
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,270
Aunt.

182
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:57,480
Don't go.

183
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,910
I'm not leaving.

184
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:03,080
I'm going to talk to your mom.

185
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,080
I'll be back soon.

186
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,600
Liar.

187
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,750
Once I let go,

188
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,960
you'll run away again.

189
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,390
I promise you

190
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,000
I'll visit you often from now on.

191
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,030
So, promise me

192
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:20,870
to get better, okay?

193
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Promise.

194
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,080
I'll put you to sleep, okay?

195
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,120
Lie down.

196
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,870
Close your eyes.

197
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,790
Sleep.

198
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:46,240
Are you here

199
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,960
for a mission?

200
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,630
Can I help?

201
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,750
Yes.

202
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,780
But I don't need it.

203
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,000
Why?

204
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,880
Because it'll hurt my brother.

205
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,480
I'm sorry.

206
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,120
I have no choice.

207
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:09,670
If

208
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:12,600
your mission is completed,

209
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,960
what will happen to him?

210
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,830
If Sanjiang Kou can't be sealed,

211
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,450
his capabilities will be questioned.

212
00:13:23,790 --> 00:13:24,790
He might be fired.

213
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:25,910
Really?

214
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,240
Because of me,

215
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,670
Nanjing

216
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:31,670
doesn't trust him as before.

217
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,320
And he's a sinner now.

218
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,160
He can't afford this.

219
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,320
I mean,

220
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,200
he'll only

221
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,960
be fired?

222
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:43,010
According to normal procedures,

223
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,600
he'll be interrogated first.

224
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:48,440
After he's cleared of communist suspicions,

225
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:49,840
he'll be expelled from the party

226
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,910
and fired.

227
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,240
His career will be over.

228
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:56,730
Let me help you.

229
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,480
I said I don't need it.

230
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,440
I'm also

231
00:14:01,670 --> 00:14:02,750
helping myself,

232
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,720
him,

233
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:06,910
and our family.

234
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:09,730
Only in this way

235
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,670
will our family

236
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,080
have hope.

237
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,240
Go and trim that side.

238
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,360
Be careful.

239
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,320
Be careful.

240
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:24,630
Be gentle.

241
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,320
What are you doing?

242
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,720
You too.

243
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,730
Don't fool around all the time.

244
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,870
Be careful.

245
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
Look at the flowers.

246
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:33,840
Thank you.

247
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Pour it properly.

248
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,630
Look.

249
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:38,720
Pick up the leaves.

250
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,760
Madam, you're back.

251
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,440
Hello, Madam.

252
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:45,390
Mrs. Zhang.

253
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,270
Call everyone to the kitchen.

254
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,240
Recently, Yu's food

255
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,720
has been getting worse.

256
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,180
Is this the best you can do?

257
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,630
Sorry, Madam.

258
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,260
I'll get everyone to the kitchen now.

259
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:58,550
Xiaoju!

260
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:01,360
Everyone, put down your work.

261
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,110
Follow me

262
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:03,170
to the kitchen now!

263
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,150
The study is there.

264
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,950
I'll take you.

265
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:09,720
Hello, Sir.

266
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,120
You're back, Sir.

267
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,840
Mrs. Zhang.

268
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,150
Madam is back.

269
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,440
She was so angry.

270
00:16:19,630 --> 00:16:20,320
Why?

271
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,910
She complained about the food,

272
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,840
so we made a few more dishes today.

273
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,250
Where's she now?

274
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,630
I saw her go to the study.

275
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,030
Jinzhen.

276
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,240
It's me.

277
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:44,750
Sister-in-law.

278
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:45,550
Your brother's back.

279
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:46,030
Leave!

280
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,440
It's too late.

281
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:58,640
Take this.

282
00:16:59,200 --> 00:16:59,960
Take a look.

283
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,030
Ganzhou's too dangerous.

284
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,350
Don't ever come back.

285
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,440
Leave.

286
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,369
Sister-in-law.

287
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,400
Thank you.

288
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:07,680
Bye.

289
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:08,790
Go.

290
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:10,069
Go now.

291
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:31,960
Why are you back?

292
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,590
I was bored in the hospital.

293
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,400
So I came back to get a book.

294
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:39,310
But I saw your bookshelf

295
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:40,750
was too dirty,

296
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,350
so I wanted to wipe it for you.

297
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:43,750
I said

298
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,720
no one's

299
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:46,550
allowed in my study.

300
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,310
Me neither?

301
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:53,070
Okay.

302
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,310
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:08,400
What's the use of saying sorry now?

304
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,200
You could have left then,

305
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:12,600
but you insisted on coming.

306
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,000
I was going to

307
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,920
suggest Kuomintang take over Jiangxi,

308
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,330
so everything can go back on track.

309
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:25,400
But what I saw

310
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:27,880
at Jiangxi Soviet this time

311
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,200
was not what I thought.

312
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,640
I heard

313
00:18:34,270 --> 00:18:36,440
Ruijin's doing well

314
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,770
in the Communist Party.

315
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:39,920
The people live and work in peace,

316
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,000
and prosper.

317
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:46,810
Jinzhen must've told you this, right?

318
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:58,880
Come in.

319
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:04,550
Have a seat.

320
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:12,680
How was it?

321
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,960
I've got the code book.

322
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,880
Sanjiang Kou's finally unsealed.

323
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:18,680
Great.

324
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:20,110
Contact Qian Fengshi

325
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,400
to prepare the salt

326
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:23,310
and send it back safely.

327
00:19:23,310 --> 00:19:23,960
Okay.

328
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,960
You've been exposed many times in the hospital.

329
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,030
Leave Ganzhou now.

330
00:19:27,030 --> 00:19:28,480
Leave the rest to us.

331
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:31,480
Okay.

332
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:34,200
Be careful.

333
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:35,590
Don't worry.

334
00:21:24,830 --> 00:21:25,720
Brigade Commander Qian.

335
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,200
I'll leave the salt to you.

336
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,270
Please hurry.

337
00:21:28,270 --> 00:21:29,640
The ship is ready.

338
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,240
What's the code?

339
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,720
Use other goods to pass customs.

340
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,320
Then switch it with the salt.

341
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:39,350
After it passes Sanjiang Kou,

342
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:41,000
in the guise of armed robbery,

343
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,480
we'll get the goods.

344
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,240
Even if Shen Tunan finds out,

345
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,310
you can explain it.

346
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,110
If it can pass,

347
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,030
let's do as we agreed.

348
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:50,590
Okay.

349
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,270
Thank you.

350
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,310
Same to you.

351
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,680
Come on.

352
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:04,160
Listen.

353
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,030
Once the goods are sorted out, set sail.

354
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:06,920
Yes, Sir.

355
00:22:11,310 --> 00:22:13,590
Where are the porters from?

356
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:15,830
I’ve checked.

357
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,030
They're Su’s.

358
00:22:17,790 --> 00:22:19,160
Those bastards.

359
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,120
They do anything for money.

360
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,260
Once this deal is done,

361
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,350
kill them all.

362
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:27,320
Understood.

363
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,880
Brothers, retreat!

364
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:36,270
Do it!

365
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,830
Sir, it's salt.

366
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:13,360
Special Commissioner, you want to see me?

367
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,000
I heard you had a special operation last night.

368
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,920
Aren't the communists buying salt?

369
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,790
Last night,

370
00:23:19,790 --> 00:23:22,240
we caught Qian Fengshi's ship transporting salt for them

371
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,590
on the spot.

372
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,350
Good.

373
00:23:25,750 --> 00:23:27,790
We also put arsenic in the salt.

374
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,640
In a few days,

375
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:35,310
the Communist-controlled areas will be in chaos

376
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:37,200
due to the poisoning,

377
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,240
and we can make a sneak attack.

378
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:41,570
Lin Qiaosong, how dare you act on your own?

379
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,920
You're evil!

380
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,250
Special Commissioner.

381
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,400
Calm down.

382
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:48,200
I knew you'd disagree,

383
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,460
so I didn't inform you.

384
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,750
I’ll let Shen Jinzhen go too.

385
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,790
For what?

386
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,540
It doesn't matter.

387
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,440
You can report directly

388
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,000
to Nanjing

389
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,590
if you're against the poisoning.

390
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:06,520
Let's hear what Nanjing has to say.

391
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,640
I'll leave if there's nothing else.

392
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,550
Goodbye.

393
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:35,310
Do you like it?

394
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,960
Let's go back and rest

395
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,310
after getting some sun, okay?

396
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:40,000
Okay.

397
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:44,790
Yu.

398
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,750
Look who's here.

399
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,640
Mom, I'm scared.

400
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:51,400
Don't be.

401
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:52,350
Come on, baby.

402
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,110
That's Dad.

403
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Call Dad.

404
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:57,640
Dad.

405
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,270
Yu.

406
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,440
Yu.

407
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,130
Have you learned anything recently?

408
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,880
Tell Dad.

409
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:12,400
It's "Enlightenment of Vocal Rhythm".

410
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
Really?

411
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,960
You've learned "Enlightenment of Vocal Rhythm"?

412
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
Can you recite it to me?

413
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:23,720
Tea versus wine. Ode versus poetry.

414
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:26,000
Swallows versus warblers.

415
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,400
Planting flowers versus planting bamboo.

416
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,880
Falling catkins versus gossamer.

417
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,880
Zhi Bo is wise and giving,

418
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:37,070
so his state councilor swallowed burning charcoal for him.

419
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:38,960
Mr. Yang is virtuous,

420
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,590
so people erected a monument of tears for him.

421
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:42,750
Yu, you're amazing.

422
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:44,280
You memorized everything.

423
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,920
Do you know what "Mr. Yang is virtuous" means?

424
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,920
Mr. Yang is Yang Hu,

425
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,590
a virtuous general in ancient times.

426
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:52,270
Yes.

427
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:54,550
Do you know what Yang Hu's virtuous act is?

428
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm not taught that yet.

429
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,000
Then let me tell you, okay?

430
00:25:59,000 --> 00:25:59,750
Sure.

431
00:25:59,750 --> 00:26:00,720
Let me tell you.

432
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,000
Let's sit on the chair.

433
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,160
Let me tell you.

434
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,960
Come.

435
00:26:05,750 --> 00:26:06,750
Let me tell you.

436
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,160
Once,

437
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:10,160
Yang Hu

438
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,880
led an army to Wu State.

439
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,590
When he got to Wu State,

440
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,240
he acted in good faith

441
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:17,750
for the people and army of Wu.

442
00:26:18,590 --> 00:26:20,160
Their battles were always

443
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,590
arranged

444
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:22,990
and never a sneak attack.

445
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,440
Once,

446
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:27,200
Wu generals attacked Yang Hu.

447
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,070
So Yang Hu killed them.

448
00:26:29,070 --> 00:26:31,240
But he also gave them proper funerals

449
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:34,000
and reciprocated with courtesy.

450
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,720
Because Yang Hu

451
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,310
admired them for their bravery.

452
00:26:39,310 --> 00:26:43,110
Just like how you killed Xiaoyun’s dad?

453
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,110
Something like that.

454
00:26:51,110 --> 00:26:52,750
You're like Yang Hu.

455
00:26:53,270 --> 00:26:55,310
Yang Hu's a good person,

456
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,960
so you're also a good person.

457
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,960
Am I right?

458
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:02,270
Dad?

459
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,550
Yes.

460
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:05,720
You're right.

461
00:27:06,590 --> 00:27:09,640
There are things a gentleman should and shouldn't do.

462
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,440
I promise you that no matter what I do,

463
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,110
I'll do my best

464
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,920
and try to be a good person,

465
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,400
so as not to let you down, okay?

466
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,440
Okay.

467
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:25,960
You're the best.

468
00:27:44,310 --> 00:27:45,200
Congyun.

469
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,460
What's wrong, Sir?

470
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:53,070
You're like Yang Hu.

471
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:55,590
Yang Hu's a good person,

472
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:58,240
so you're also a good person.

473
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:01,640
Pass my order.

474
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,560
Contact the Communist Party with plain code.

475
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,640
Yes, Sir.

476
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:06,880
What should I tell them?

477
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,080
The salt is poisoned.

478
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,480
Sir.

479
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,590
Lin Qiaosong's been planning this for a long time.

480
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:16,200
Is it appropriate?

481
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,240
Why not?

482
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,440
We want to impose an economic blockade

483
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,770
on the Communist Party,

484
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,400
not to poison the people.

485
00:28:23,790 --> 00:28:25,390
There are things a gentleman

486
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:26,550
should and shouldn't do.

487
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,480
But you're suspected of colluding with communists.

488
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,070
I know you're worried about me.

489
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:32,000
But it's fine.

490
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,590
I'm upright.

491
00:28:33,590 --> 00:28:34,450
I'm not afraid.

492
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,440
Also,

493
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:37,790
don't let Lin Qiaosong find out.

494
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,110
Get it done as soon as possible.

495
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:40,030
Yes, Sir.

496
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,160
This is a plain-code telegram from Shen Tunan,

497
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,920
saying the salt that's transported back

498
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,400
is mixed with arsenic.

499
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,860
He advised us not to eat it.

500
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,880
What do you think?

501
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,070
Chief Lei.

502
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:53,790
I think it's fake

503
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:55,440
and he's trying to scare us,

504
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,270
so we dare not

505
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:57,680
eat the salt we risked our lives

506
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,720
to bring back.

507
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,830
He's too cunning.

508
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:02,030
It's possible indeed.

509
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,480
But from what I know about him,

510
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,680
I don't think he's lying.

511
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:08,960
But

512
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,000
our people were involved throughout the process

513
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:12,000
from Guangdong Army

514
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,270
to the salt warehouse.

515
00:29:13,270 --> 00:29:14,350
It couldn't have been poisoned.

516
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,750
It could've been poisoned beforehand.

517
00:29:15,750 --> 00:29:16,550
Impossible!

518
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,720
Qian Fengshi's greedy for money.

519
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
If he sold us poisonous salt,

520
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,590
we'd stop doing business with him,

521
00:29:21,590 --> 00:29:24,120
and he'd have to deal with us getting revenge.

522
00:29:25,790 --> 00:29:26,960
The salt concerns

523
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,240
the people's safety.

524
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,110
Seal the salt first.

525
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:31,270
You have three days

526
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:33,680
to find out if it's poisoned.

527
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,550
Yes.

528
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,310
Ruolai, how is it?

529
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:40,590
Did you find anything?

530
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:41,790
The salt bags were sealed well

531
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:43,070
to prevent moisture.

532
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,200
But some salt bags

533
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,480
have surface damages of about 7 mm long.

534
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,440
This isn't right.

535
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,270
How about this?

536
00:29:50,270 --> 00:29:52,110
Check the salt from the damaged bags

537
00:29:52,110 --> 00:29:52,880
for me.

538
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:53,550
Okay.

539
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:54,440
I'll go now.

540
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,240
Ming Da, I'm loyal to Kuomintang.

541
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:57,590
We're against communists,

542
00:29:57,590 --> 00:29:58,590
not the general public.

543
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,590
We shouldn't poison

544
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,830
the salt.

545
00:30:00,830 --> 00:30:01,400
The people

546
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,590
in Jiangxi Soviet will just

547
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:03,680
hate us more

548
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:05,000
and we'll lose more trust.

549
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,440
Tunan, your previous arrest had already

550
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,900
aroused much suspicion about your loyalty.

551
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,110
They might

552
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:13,350
use this to create a narrative.

553
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:14,550
So,

554
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:16,000
you must be wary,

555
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,590
especially of Qian Fengshi.

556
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:18,240
Don't worry.

557
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,920
I have a plan for him.

558
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:24,070
If he's colluding with communists, even Commander Chen can't save him.

559
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,030
Sir.

560
00:30:27,590 --> 00:30:30,390
Fortunately, Nanjing didn't pursue this matter.

561
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:35,550
You sent the telegram to Jiangxi Soviet?

562
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:36,550
It's me.

563
00:30:37,270 --> 00:30:39,200
You're especially concerned about the communists

564
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,920
after coming back from Jiangxi Soviet.

565
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:41,880
They aren't communists.

566
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,590
They're innocent people.

567
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:44,480
I don't want to poison the salt

568
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,240
and kill innocent people.

569
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,680
I don't want to be evil.

570
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,160
Am I wrong?

571
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,560
Communist Party members are not innocent!

572
00:30:50,790 --> 00:30:52,590
They're Kuomintang's enemies.

573
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:54,070
Special Commissioner.

574
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:56,920
You can't be sympathetic.

575
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,550
There's no world without bloodshed.

576
00:30:58,550 --> 00:30:59,640
Don't forget

577
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:01,200
they once wanted to kill you.

578
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,590
Lin Qiaosong.

579
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:03,790
I'm warning you.

580
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:05,720
You're here to cooperate with me.

581
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:07,200
If you keep acting on your own,

582
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,590
our cooperation is over.

583
00:31:08,590 --> 00:31:09,720
I'm warning you too.

584
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,550
My loyalty to Kuomintang

585
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,840
comes before everything else!

586
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,590
Ignorant.

587
00:31:20,270 --> 00:31:21,400
Say that again.

588
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,400
I said you're ignorant.

589
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,830
You don't understand Mr. Shen's ambition.

590
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,270
I can shoot you anytime.

591
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,550
Are you done?

592
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:31,590
Just you wait.

593
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,920
Think about how to deal with Qian Fengshi

594
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,790
with that energy instead!

595
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:44,480
We found

596
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,880
five bags of poisoned salt on that ship.

597
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:47,680
They used

598
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,550
cone-shaped objects to poke a small hole

599
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,400
to add the arsenic.

600
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,680
The purity of the arsenic is high.

601
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,000
They are crystals,

602
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:54,920
not the usual minerals

603
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,750
available at Chinese medicine shops.

604
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:57,960
It's a highly-concentrated

605
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,880
compound purified in the lab.

606
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,200
A total of about 5 to 700 grams.

607
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,720
That much arsenic

608
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,380
would've killed many people!

609
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,750
Those bastards.

610
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,590
Around the holes,

611
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:10,550
we also found

612
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:12,880
high concentrations of phosphoric acid,

613
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,270
commonly known as gun oil.

614
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,310
The holes must've been made with bayonets,

615
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,240
which are maintained with gun oil.

616
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:19,720
Can you separate out

617
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,790
the poisoned salt?

618
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,680
Yes.

619
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,240
The lab is still checking.

620
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,400
It'll take a week.

621
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,880
We can give it out then.

622
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,880
That's great.

623
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,160
Never

624
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,000
buy salt from Guangdong Army again.

625
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,640
We were lucky to be warned this time.

626
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,480
We might be tricked next time.

627
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,240
But I don't understand why

628
00:32:37,750 --> 00:32:39,010
Qian Fengshi did that.

629
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:41,440
It was discovered in time

630
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:42,980
and no harm was caused.

631
00:32:43,750 --> 00:32:44,610
We'll look into

632
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,460
the poisonous salt later.

633
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:48,160
A Mexican dollar machine

634
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:49,160
is about

635
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,550
to arrive.

636
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,550
Through a water route, the transportation line comrades

637
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:54,720
have transported it from Shanghai to Yudu.

638
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,750
That's great.

639
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:57,550
Both southern Jiangxi and Guangzhou acknowledge Mexican dollars.

640
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,200
We can make them ourselves with the machine.

641
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,350
We can trade directly in Kuomintang-controlled areas.

642
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:01,880
It's much more convenient.

643
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,590
Yes.

644
00:33:02,590 --> 00:33:04,270
It's all thanks to our comrades in Shanghai.

645
00:33:04,270 --> 00:33:05,400
Such an important machine

646
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,200
must be transported back to the money factory as soon as possible

647
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,350
so the enemy can't wreak havoc.

648
00:33:08,350 --> 00:33:09,080
I'll go then.

649
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:10,680
I'll protect it

650
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,350
with my life.

651
00:33:12,350 --> 00:33:13,640
Get Chunmiao too.

652
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,400
She's in Yudu.

653
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:15,860
She can come back with you.

654
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:20,350
Stop!

655
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:21,880
Stop running!

656
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,640
Did you take care of everyone else?

657
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,440
Yes.

658
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:31,350
Sir.

659
00:33:31,830 --> 00:33:33,230
We've taken care of them.

660
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,960
Brigade Commander.

661
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:41,310
Everyone involved has been eliminated.

662
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:43,350
We'll stop selling salt

663
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:44,750
to the communists.

664
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:47,750
Shen Tunan's trying to mess with me.

665
00:33:49,790 --> 00:33:50,680
Bring it on.

666
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,590
He'll die in my hands.

667
00:33:54,310 --> 00:33:55,710
Brigade Commander Qian.

668
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,260
What a coincidence

669
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,310
to meet you here.

670
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,240
Captain Lin.

671
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,000
Working

672
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
at this late hour?

673
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,190
This is...

674
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:08,840
Captain Lin.

675
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,800
I just met a few communists and killed them on the spot.

676
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,860
It doesn't matter.

677
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:13,730
It doesn't matter.

678
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,320
Brigade Commander Qian.

679
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:20,150
I'm officially arresting you

680
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,610
for communist ties.

681
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:29,000
Lin Qiaosong.

682
00:34:30,710 --> 00:34:32,150
Get it straight.

683
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:34,400
This is Ganzhou.

684
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
Messing with me when I have countless men backing me?

685
00:34:43,230 --> 00:34:43,760
Stop!

686
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:45,090
What are you doing?

687
00:34:52,030 --> 00:34:53,710
Are you trying to

688
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,150
resist arrest?

689
00:34:55,150 --> 00:34:56,630
Stop labelling me.

690
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,670
Show me the evidence,

691
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,550
or get lost

692
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,760
right now!

693
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:03,490
You used Su's Porters to send salt to communists.

694
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,260
It was even in batches.

695
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,630
Su’s has 70 to 80 porters.

696
00:35:09,630 --> 00:35:10,800
Could you have

697
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,440
killed them all?

698
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,230
Captain Lin.

699
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,030
Your words are too cryptic.

700
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:25,030
Now,

701
00:35:25,030 --> 00:35:25,960
it's getting late.

702
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,280
I have work to do.

703
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,840
If there’s nothing else,

704
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,000
goodbye.

705
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,190
Thank you, guys.

706
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:50,000
Those bastards.

707
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,000
How dare he arrest me

708
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:55,600
when he couldn't stop cars?

709
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,630
Now it's up to Shen Tunan.

710
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,480
Brothers of the Guangdong Army,

711
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,400
you've been fighting wars all year round.

712
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:26,150
This money

713
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,360
is to reward you.

714
00:36:28,550 --> 00:36:30,030
How could a special commissioner

715
00:36:30,030 --> 00:36:31,440
get so much money?

716
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,670
To be honest,

717
00:36:33,150 --> 00:36:34,360
the money

718
00:36:34,670 --> 00:36:35,880
is not mine.

719
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:38,720
It belongs to Brigade Commander Qian.

720
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,840
He's in Ganzhou

721
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,800
earning dirty money

722
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:44,030
by intercepting your military pay.

723
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,000
Just in

724
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,230
the past six months,

725
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:49,290
he withheld three months of your pay.

726
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,670
I really want to know

727
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,230
if he's poor

728
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:54,400
or evil!

729
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,480
Not only did he

730
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:59,440
do something so despicable for money,

731
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,670
but he also colluded with communists to smuggle tungsten ore.

732
00:37:02,670 --> 00:37:04,270
I've reported all his crimes

733
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,210
to the Suppression Headquarters.

734
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,230
Soon,

735
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,190
he'll be put to trial.

736
00:37:10,150 --> 00:37:11,550
In less than half a month,

737
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,030
the Guangdong Army will send other officials

738
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:14,280
to take over his work.

739
00:37:14,590 --> 00:37:15,710
If any of you

740
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:16,960
are not convinced,

741
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,840
stand out now

742
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,670
and I'll convince you.

743
00:37:29,590 --> 00:37:30,110
Okay.

744
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:31,280
Line up.

745
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,640
Take your money!

746
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,150
Yes!

747
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,670
Yangchun noodles and wontons!

748
00:37:50,670 --> 00:37:51,550
No appetite?

749
00:37:55,550 --> 00:37:56,760
Yeah.

750
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,230
I've been busy lately.

751
00:37:58,630 --> 00:38:00,280
I can't sleep or eat well.

752
00:38:01,590 --> 00:38:03,110
How about you catch up on sleep

753
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:04,840
and get some Chinese medicine?

754
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,320
It's okay.

755
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,710
I can push through.

756
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,880
I've been looking for you.

757
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,550
So you're here.

758
00:38:12,550 --> 00:38:13,320
How is it?

759
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:14,480
Is the Mexican dollar machine here?

760
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,880
Yes,

761
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,480
but one of the bearings is faulty.

762
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,590
Faulty bearings?

763
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:21,710
Maybe it got damaged during the transport.

764
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:22,670
It's our responsibility.

765
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:24,190
Can you fix the bearing?

766
00:38:24,190 --> 00:38:26,250
I'm not sure. It depends on the model.

767
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,590
I'll try with other tools too.

768
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:29,190
Let's go.

769
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:29,550
Okay.

770
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,000
Wait.

771
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:31,440
Eat first.

772
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:33,400
I'll eat after it's fixed.

773
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,190
Let's go.

774
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,710
How is it?

775
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:41,670
Change it.

776
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:49,880
It's fixed.

777
00:38:50,230 --> 00:38:51,000
Great.

778
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:52,110
This machine

779
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:53,590
is so important to us.

780
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,630
In this way,

781
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,070
we can make the Mexican dollars ourselves.

782
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:59,470
It'll be convenient for us in Kuomintang-controlled areas.

783
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,590
Now that it's fixed,

784
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,110
I'm suddenly hungry.

785
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,670
Make me something delicious.

786
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:05,230
Sure. Come on.

787
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:06,550
I'll make you some noodles.

788
00:39:06,550 --> 00:39:07,960
Add more chili!

789
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:54,670
Song Shoutian!

790
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:56,550
Don't move!

791
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:02,320
To think it's you.

792
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:04,670
I'm here to help!

793
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:05,800
Help with what?

794
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,280
To avoid misunderstandings,

795
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,320
I set up a trap in the bearing

796
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:09,440
on purpose.

797
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,880
As long as it's forced damage,

798
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,840
the engine oil will spray out onto you.

799
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,030
Anything else to say?

800
00:40:14,030 --> 00:40:15,880
Did you blow up the mine too?

801
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:16,920
Speak up!

802
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:17,880
Is your boss

803
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,880
Lin Qiaosong?

804
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:20,030
Nonsense!

805
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,440
Don't slander revolutionary comrades like this!

806
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,550
When you blew up the mine in Pangu Mountain,

807
00:40:25,550 --> 00:40:28,000
we found the residuals of explosives at the entrance.

808
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,400
It was picric acid ammunition,

809
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
the filler for artillery shells.

810
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,000
It's powerful but unstable.

811
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,320
Jinling Arsenal once exported it,

812
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,920
But it was eliminated soon.

813
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,670
When Lin Qiaosong was in Shanghai's Dare-to-Die Corps,

814
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,760
he used it often.

815
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,550
He's the only user in China now.

816
00:40:44,070 --> 00:40:44,920
Why did you

817
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,400
betray the revolution?

818
00:40:50,670 --> 00:40:51,960
To save my sister.

819
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,320
Kong.

820
00:40:56,550 --> 00:40:58,190
My sister is my only family

821
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,480
in this world.

822
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,630
Have you ever thought

823
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,230
if your identity is exposed,

824
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:15,630
your sister will be doomed?

825
00:41:15,630 --> 00:41:16,360
I know.

826
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,630
Lin Qiaosong won't let her go.

827
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,330
You still have a chance.

828
00:41:28,590 --> 00:41:30,590
As long as you don't expose yourself,

829
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:32,990
you still have a chance to save your sister.

830
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,230
You want me to

831
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,760
keep in touch with Lin Qiaosong?

832
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:38,960
If you cooperate,

833
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,360
you'd be earning merits.

834
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,590
You can only live

835
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:46,270
if Lin Qiaosong dies.

836
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:04,880
Brother!

837
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:05,680
What's wrong?

838
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,400
I couldn't find water.

839
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,660
Something's up ahead.

840
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,070
Hide.

841
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:10,550
Hurry!

842
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:17,000
What happened?

843
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,360
I saw Niu Chunmiao

844
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:19,280
leading a team.

845
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,480
Everyone, work harder.

846
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,030
When we get to the Yunmen Ridge,

847
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:26,550
we'll get a good rest.

848
00:42:26,550 --> 00:42:27,590
Okay.

849
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,670
Be alert.

850
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:30,270
What are they transporting?

851
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:31,110
I don't know.

852
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:35,360
Be on guard.

853
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,030
Biao, come with me.

854
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:36,550
Yes.

855
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,280
Yunmen Ridge?

856
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,380
It's really top-grade tungsten ore.

857
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,070
Where's the map?
