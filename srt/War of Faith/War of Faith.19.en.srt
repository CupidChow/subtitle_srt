00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:52,530
I want to see if our men are outside.

00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,090
It's none of your business.

I...

11
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,070
I want a roast duck.

12
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,430
And a bottle of brandy.

13
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,750
I'm fine with

Mr. Kang will be here soon.

22
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,550
You'd better think through

At this time,

only Yu Shiqing

62
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:53,860

Mr. Yu, we have an informant

74
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,740

75

who was almost killed by his party.

76
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,050
He said after he confessed,

77

Yes.

87

She eliminates traitors for the Communist Party.

88
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:11,730
Think carefully.

89
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,310
If she can prove

90
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:15,320
she wasn't there that night,

91
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,790
you're dead.

92
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,750

94
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,110

95
00:08:27,310 --> 00:08:28,060
But I'm sure

96
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:29,270
she was the killer in the ward

97
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,350
last night.

98
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,120
I-I was on morphine

99
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,990
and unconscious in bed.

100
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:37,990
Suddenly,

101
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,250
there was a unique fragrance.

102
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,020
Then I saw someone

103
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,590
flying in from outside the window.

104
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,920
She even tried to smother me with a pillow.

105
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,040
Fortunately, Captain Lin came in time

106
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,950
and saved me.

107
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,890
In the hospital this morning,

108
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:54,020
I smelled that fragrance again.

109
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:03,110
It's Shen Jinzhen.

110
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,550
Women use similar perfumes.

111
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,990
It can't be evidence.

112
00:09:09,230 --> 00:09:10,200
She uses

113
00:09:11,070 --> 00:09:12,150
some Italian

114
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:14,680
handmade shampoo and body wash.

115
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,410
Mrs. Yu gave them to her.

116
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,660
It's the only set in Shanghai.

117
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:23,990
Please verify this

118
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,300

120
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,300
Wait a minute.

121
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,200
I once ran a fragrance store.

122
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:30,920
I...

123
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,270
I know a little about fragrances.

124
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:38,190
When I entered the ward last night,

125
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:39,910
I did smell

126
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:41,360
a faint aroma

127
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,350
but didn't pay attention to it.

128
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:43,830
Yes.

129
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,510
It must be her.

130
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:51,630
I've asked.

131
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:53,100
It's a gift

132
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:55,730
from the rep of the Italian company OTO Melara.

133
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,000
My wife

134
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,480
did give one set to Mrs. Shen.

135
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:02,870
There are only two in Shanghai now.

136
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,090
One is for my wife

137
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,230
and the other for the Shen family.

138

154

it's major.

She works for the key department of the arsenal.

156
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,550
If she's convicted,

157
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:59,640
so many others would be unveiled.

158
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,060

162
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:09,840
What's the rush?

163

164

But don't worry.

166

167
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,350

00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,270
I just want the gold bars.

00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,120
Dear passengers,

198
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,800
the train to Suzhou has been delayed

199
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,210
for half an hour.

200
00:13:50,270 --> 00:13:51,600
Please wait patiently.

201
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,290
Make way!

202
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,300
Excuse me.

203
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,700
Make way!

204
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:07,920
Make way!

205
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,870
Sit.

206
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:35,320
Hello?

207
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,380
Mr. Kang's order.

208
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,070
Li Shengda is not there, right?

209
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:43,130
Go in.

210
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:43,790
Why?

211
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,640
Go in!

212
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:45,480
Why?

213
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:46,910
What...

214
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,780
What are you doing?

215
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:51,920
Why?

216
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:52,740
What do you mean?

217
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,340
Sit there.

218
00:14:53,890 --> 00:14:54,660
Sit there!

219
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:56,350
Okay, go ahead.

220
00:14:56,390 --> 00:14:57,560
Mr. Kang ordered you

221
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,500
to kill him on the spot.

222
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,460
Wait.

223
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,640
Isn't he Shen Jinzhen's witness?

224
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,690
Mr. Kang can't beat Shen Tunan.

225
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,290
Instead of making a fuss, we'd better kill him.

226
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,960
Mr. Kang said

227
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,490
this was done by the communists.

228
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:13,100
You'll be rewarded.

229
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:13,770
Yes.

230
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,140
Was that a gunshot on the sixth floor?

231
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,190
Miss Shen, do you need a car?

232
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,670
There are many people on the platform.

233
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,230
You can't board the train.

234
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,720
There are only three ways to leave.

235
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,070
I'm luckier.

236
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,790
It seems we are destined.

237
00:18:09,390 --> 00:18:10,770
We sure are.

238
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,310
Miss Shen.

239
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,590
Today's weather is bad.

240
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,250
You shouldn't travel.

241
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:23,720
We'll take you home.

242
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:33,960
Please.

243
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:37,950
Thank you.

244
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,070
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

245
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:03,270
Mr. Kang.

246
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:05,430
Mr. Kang, we caught Shen Jinzhen.

247
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,420
Good job.

248
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,250
Does her gun match?

249
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:09,910
No.

250
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:12,930
She's carrying a FN M1910,

251
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,630
not a Colt M1911.

252
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:19,450
It's okay.

253
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,300
If it's not with her,

254
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,320
it's at home.

255
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,880
Get a search warrant

256
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:26,350
to enter Shen Residence legally.

257
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,270
Yes.

258
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,660
One more thing.

259
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:32,650
Go ahead.

260
00:19:34,970 --> 00:19:35,900
Say it!

261
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:39,160
Astor House Hotel called to say

262
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,320
Li Shengda ran away with the gold bars.

263
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,640
He even killed several of our men.

264
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:44,610
He ran away?

265
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:47,530
Can't you even watch one

266
00:19:47,530 --> 00:19:48,410
person?

267
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:50,750
What's wrong with you?

268
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:51,770
Idiots.

269
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,940
Any clues?

270
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,550
Not yet.

271
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:05,620
What are you waiting for?

272
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,700
Gather everyone to search!

273
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:08,950
Yes.

274
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:09,700
Go!

275
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,200
Yes.

276
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,510
Name?

277
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,710
Speak!

278
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,660
I'm asking you!

279
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,090
Mr. Kang.

280
00:20:29,550 --> 00:20:30,510
Jinzhen.

281
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,950
Long time no see.

282
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:32,930
Mr. Kang.

283
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:35,390
I didn't expect to see you here.

284
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,790
May I ask

285
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,880
why you arrested me?

286
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,400
Did they hurt you?

287
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,510
No.

288
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:46,000
Captain Lin doesn’t have the guts.

289
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,450
Then it isn't an arrest.

290
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,960
I invited you here to ask you

291
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,630
to cooperate with the investigation.

292
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:56,930
What investigation?

293
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,970
Li Shengda's murder.

294
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,130
Isn’t that case closed?

295
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,320
Wei Ruolai has been released too.

296
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:05,520
Why isn't it over yet?

297
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,210
What you said is pointless.

298
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,470
You saw him

299
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,020
in the hospital this morning.

300
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,430
You mean the person

301
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,000
Captain Lin was going to transfer?

302
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:22,460
Did he die?

303
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,750
When?

304
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,750
How?

305
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:31,130
Think about it.

306
00:21:31,930 --> 00:21:34,010
On December 27,

307
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:35,930
where were you

308
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:37,950
and what were you doing?

309
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:39,620
December 27?

310
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,320
Let me think.

311
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,200
I was at the arsenal that night.

312
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,420
Many colleagues can testify to it.

313
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,620
What about last night?

314
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:51,280
Do you have alibis

315
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,240
in the hospital too?

316
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,170
Yes.

317
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:56,040
Chief Kang,

318
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,050
what do you mean?

319
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,030
You’re suspected of murdering Li Shengda.

320
00:22:04,410 --> 00:22:06,410
But he was still alive this morning.

321
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,870
Have you lost your memory?

322
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,270
A failed attempt.

323
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,780
Calm down.

324
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,590
Where is the evidence?

325
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,670
The evidence...

326
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:19,430
Don't be anxious.

327
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:22,920
No one serves the main dish first.

328
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:29,890
Li Shengda

329
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,520
named you

330
00:22:33,590 --> 00:22:34,560
as his killer.

331
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,940
It's getting interesting.

332
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,940
I still have the same questions.

333
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,060
Did he die?

334
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:43,020
When?

335
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:43,970
How?

336
00:22:44,350 --> 00:22:45,580
If he didn't die,

337
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:46,950
where is he now?

338
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:49,870
Does he have valid proof that it's me?

339
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,600
We acquitted Wei Ruolai

340
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:55,750
because the gun and bullet didn't match.

341
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,500
If you want to convict me,

342
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,440
at least find the weapon first.

343
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:02,370
Or can you slander the innocent

344
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,870
without any evidence now?

345
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:06,800
Jinzhen.

346
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,160
Do you think

347
00:23:09,190 --> 00:23:10,800
I won't do anything to you

348
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,430
because your brother backs you up?

349
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,510
Do what?

350
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,950
You mean torture?

351
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:21,490
Torturing a senior employee of the arsenal

352
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:23,270
during its busiest period

353
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,680
of Jiangxi's anti-communist campaign?

354
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:28,440
Chief Kang, I have to ask,

355
00:23:28,970 --> 00:23:30,410
what do you want?

356
00:23:30,430 --> 00:23:31,890
You don't have to label me.

357
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:33,220
Listen.

358
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,770
Your brother can handle anything else,

359
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:37,570
but it's useless

360
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,420
if it involves communism.

361
00:23:41,190 --> 00:23:41,860
Got it.

362
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,180
I, Shen Jinzhen, report that

363
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Chief Kang is an underground party member.

364
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:50,590
Fine.

365
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:52,720
Evidence?

366
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,340
Sorry.

367
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:55,590
I don't have

368
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:56,610
the evidence yet.

369
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,600
But since I dare to testify,

370
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,750
you must investigate it.

371
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:01,880
Isn't this

372
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:03,870
what you're doing?

373
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:09,270
Smile all you want now.

374
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,840
Soon, you'll be bawling your eyes out.

375
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:14,960
Fine.

376
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:17,150
Let’s continue

377
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:20,450
when Li Shengda gets here.

378
00:24:25,790 --> 00:24:26,640
Mrs. Shen.

379
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,340
Excuse me.

380
00:24:29,030 --> 00:24:30,560
I'm just following orders.

381
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,160
Whose orders?

382
00:24:32,430 --> 00:24:33,690
Chief Kang of Garrison Command.

383
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:34,610
Lin Qiaosong.

384
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:35,710
Don't go too far.

385
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,240
It's an official investigation.

386
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,640
Don't give us a hard time.

387
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:40,720
Search!

388
00:24:46,470 --> 00:24:47,640
Bring Yu down.

389
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:55,740
You said it's a business trip to Suzhou.

390
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,140
But I checked

391
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,890
and they said there's no such thing.

392
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:02,300
Indeed.

393
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,100
The factory in Suzhou

394
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,300
needs an oil inspection every quarter.

395
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,250
I have to prepare for

396
00:25:08,490 --> 00:25:10,620
the heavy production load in advance.

397
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:14,170
For a business trip,

398
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:16,170
do you need a family portrait?

399
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,930
Some parts are faded.

400
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,200
A decent photo studio in Suzhou

401
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,560
is good at retouching.

402
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,110
So I thought I could go and fix it too.

403
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,930
What studio? Address?

404
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:30,110
Ruyue Photo Studio,

405
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,870
at the West Gate of Soochow University.

406
00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,330
It's advertised in Shen Bao Newspaper.

407
00:25:33,330 --> 00:25:34,490
No hesitation.

408
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,170
If you're not guilty,

409
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:38,030
at the station,

410
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,210
why did you flee?

411
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:42,780
I'm so forgetful.

412
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:44,430
When I arrived at the station,

413
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,180
I realized I left behind some documents

414
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,270
and had to go back.

415
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,370
But the station was packed,

416
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:50,990
so I had to take a shortcut.

417
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:51,870
Am I right?

418
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:58,510
Jinzhen.

419
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:01,180
I used to

420
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,630
like you.

421
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,380
I thought you were smart

422
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,970
and elegant.

423
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,150
It was rare

424
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,370
for a Shanghai socialite.

425
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,850
You flatter me.

426
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,430
Your political circle in Shanghai

427
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,120
is unique too.

428
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:19,460
What about it?

429
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:22,160
Don't businessmen ride on officials' coattails?

430
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,130
For you,

431
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,810
it's the other way around.

432
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:26,020
How unique.

433
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:30,390
That's an overstatement.

434
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:34,310
Your brother and I

435
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,320
are both devoted to Kuomintang.

436
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,420
Or we can say he contributed more than me.

437
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,660
All I know is arresting and killing communists.

438
00:26:43,910 --> 00:26:47,160
He helped the nation develop by rectifying the financial system.

439
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,560
I don't want to see

440
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,650
a genius like him

441
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:52,530
being dragged down by his family.

442
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:54,060
Are you threatening me?

443
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,280
Not really.

444
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:56,720
I want to help you

445
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:58,500
and the Shen family.

446
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:01,930
Once the news of you being a communist

447
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:02,770
gets out,

448
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,840
what will happen to your brother?

449
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,660
His career will be doomed.

450
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:13,150
What will happen to your sister-in-law

451
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,300
and niece?

452
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,300
Last year, Cai was captured in Nanjing

453
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,450
when he was most prosperous.

454
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:22,720
His son wasn't even eight years old.

455
00:27:22,830 --> 00:27:25,030
He's still digging coal in Huaibei now.

456
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,490
I doubt

457
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,860
you want your niece

458
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,730
to be sold into prostitution.

459
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,230
Don't be nervous.

460
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:40,600
We are all friends.

461
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,750
I can't be cruel

462
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:46,360
to you and your brother.

463
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,620
As long as you confess,

464
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:49,270
I can handle it

465
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:50,540
under wraps

466
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:52,620
and it won't affect his career.

467
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:54,010
But

468
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,430
if we find out the truth,

469
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,540
it's different.

470
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,450
Everyone is watching.

471
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,200
I can only do my job.

472
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,350
Tell me.

473
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,600
When did you join the Communist Party?

474
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:10,130
In Europe

475
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,720
or just recently?

476
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,270
Captain,

477
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,320
it's not in the backyard.

478
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,980
Captain, it’s not in the study.

479
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:36,260
Captain, we’ve searched upstairs.

480
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:36,900
Nothing.

481
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,140
Same here.

482
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,600
No one found the Colt M1911?

483
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:43,110
No, not even a gun.

484
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,470
Let's go.

485
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,510
Don't go.

486
00:28:48,910 --> 00:28:49,640
Captain Lin.

487
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:51,160
Since you're here,

488
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,120
why don't you

489
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:54,910
search thoroughly?

490
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,510
Don't say the Shen family

491
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:58,110
hindered the investigation

492
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,220
later on.

493
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,520
You're exaggerating.

494
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,470
Not at all.

495
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,220
Mrs. Wang, go get the camera.

496
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,630
Take photos of the home

497
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,110
and send it to the press tomorrow

498
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:08,630
to show everyone

499
00:29:08,650 --> 00:29:11,110
the military power of the Garrison Command.

500
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:13,850
We'll send people over to restore everything.

501
00:29:13,850 --> 00:29:14,640
No need.

502
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:17,310
What did you do to Shen Jinzhen?

503
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,830
She's just assisting in the investigation.

504
00:29:18,830 --> 00:29:20,510
I can't tell you

505
00:29:20,530 --> 00:29:21,950
the details. Goodbye.

506
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,910
Lin Qiaosong.

507
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:27,110
If you dare lay a finger on Shen Jinzhen...

508
00:29:27,110 --> 00:29:27,710
Whatever.

509
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:34,670
Mrs. Wang.

510
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,240
Take her upstairs.

511
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:37,310
Yes, Madam.

512
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,360
Mom, I'm scared.

513
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:42,780
Don't be afraid.

514
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,380
Go upstairs with Mrs. Wang.

515
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,730
I'll be there soon, okay?

516
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:47,460
No!

517
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,120
Be good.

518
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,150
Be good.

519
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:50,800
I'll be right there.

520
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:51,590
Be good.

521
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:56,690
Mom, hurry up.

522
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:57,630
Okay.

523
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,880
Connect me to Mr. Shen at Room 416.

524
00:30:42,590 --> 00:30:43,350
Everyone,

525
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:45,150
after Chairman Chiang has a rest,

526
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,550
he'll meet you in person.

527
00:30:48,350 --> 00:30:49,190
Tunan.

528
00:30:50,910 --> 00:30:52,540
Later, you go in first.

529
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:54,010
He wants to see you alone.

530
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,910
Alone?

531
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,200
Yes. You're young and promising,

532
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,100
and Chairman Chiang values you.

533
00:31:00,310 --> 00:31:01,910
You have a promising future.

534
00:31:02,930 --> 00:31:05,080
Ming Da, you've been following Chairman Chiang.

535
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:07,080
Please guide me in the future.

536
00:31:08,150 --> 00:31:08,780
Sure.

537
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:10,230
With merits,

538
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,760
you'll soar to new heights.

539
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:13,600
Thank you.

540
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:27,930
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

541
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,600
You must be hungry.

542
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,900
What do you want to eat?

543
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,540
I have no appetite.

544
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,010
Mr. Kang.

545
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,510
Let's not waste time.

546
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,370
Bring out

547
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,720
the evidence,

548
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,270
or let me go.

549
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,970
Or torture me to force a confession.

550
00:31:58,970 --> 00:32:01,080
But look at me.

551
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:02,760
I probably can't handle it.

552
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:03,980
By the way,

553
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,020
with my status,

554
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,210
if the confession is retracted,

555
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:09,810
can you really handle it?

556
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,350
This is the Garrison Command,

557
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:12,510
not the arsenal

558
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,710
or Shen Residence.

559
00:32:14,750 --> 00:32:16,070
Mr. Kang, I'm tired.

560
00:32:16,090 --> 00:32:16,650
It's late.

561
00:32:16,650 --> 00:32:17,500
-Mr. Kang.
-I'll get some sleep.

562
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,560
Li Shengda is here. We're on standby.

563
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,820
Heard that?

564
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,590
It's your last chance.

565
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,110
Seize it.

566
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,270
He's finally here.

567
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,780
Invite him in

568
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,680
so I can confront him.

569
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:36,730
I'll give you ten seconds.

570
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:38,920
It's your last chance

571
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,870
to turn yourself in.

572
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,160
Thank you, Chief Kang.

573
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,250
But

574
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,900
I still want to confront him.

575
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:51,540
Ten.

576
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:53,430
Nine.

577
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,880
Eight.

578
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,100
Seven.

579
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,530
Six.

580
00:32:58,230 --> 00:32:59,070
Five.

581
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,030
Four.

582
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:02,670
Three.

583
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:04,110
Two.

584
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,980
Okay, I'll say it.

585
00:33:10,270 --> 00:33:11,790
That's right.

586
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,560
A wise man submits to circumstances.

587
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,290
Don't worry.

588
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,960
If you tell me the truth,

589
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,900
I'll guarantee your family's safety.

590
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,310
I've thought about

591
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:23,130
your question.

592
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:26,600
Mixed vegetables rice and pork rib soup.

593
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,470
You asked me what I wanted to eat.

594
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,230
I can't think of anything else.

595
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:31,990
That's all.

596
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,220
Shen Jinzhen!

597
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:36,720
By the way,

598
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:38,280
you just said

599
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,970
you can keep my family safe.

600
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,450
Does Nanjing know this?

601
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:46,550
If I'm really a communist,

602
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:48,440
you're in collusion.

603
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,740
As a senior Kuomintang member,

604
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,600
I strongly condemn you!

605
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,070
You're on your own now!

606
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:21,980
Hello?

607
00:34:22,010 --> 00:34:22,980
Hello, Mrs. Shen.

608
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,639
I'm Ruolai.

609
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:24,199
Ruolai.

610
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:24,940
Is everything okay at home?

611
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,360
Jinzhen was arrested

612
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,670
and my house was searched.

613
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,429
I-I haven't been able

614
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:30,360
to reach Mr. Shen.

615
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,260
I called his room,

616
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:32,070
but no one answered.

617
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:32,969
I'm so worried.

618
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:33,880
Don't worry.

619
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,070
I'll figure it out.

620
00:34:35,070 --> 00:34:36,219
I'll figure it out.

621
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,120
Mom.

622
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,510
Yu.

623
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:47,949
I'm coming.

624
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
Don't cry, my baby.

625
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,420
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

626
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:59,020
Don't be afraid. Let's go back to the room.

627
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,230
Mom, I'm scared.

628
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:02,840
Don't be afraid. Let me tell you a story.

629
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,590
Hello.

630
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:15,790
Is this the Nanjing Police?

631
00:35:15,790 --> 00:35:16,960
I want to report a case.

632
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,350
The suspect is Huang Congyun.

633
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,810
He lives at Central Hotel.

634
00:35:19,990 --> 00:35:21,970
He's planning to assassinate Shen Tunan, the advisor of Central Bank.

635
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:23,050
Find him now.

636
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,270
We've searched everywhere

637
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:28,080
but didn’t find the Colt M1911.

638
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,430
Where’s Li Shengda?

639
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,260
We haven't found him.

640
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,150
Useless

641
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,880
idiots.

642
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,420
Morons!

643
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:39,960
Dimwits!

644
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:41,400
You watched him, right?

645
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,500
Scram!

646
00:35:42,910 --> 00:35:43,710
Get lost!

647
00:35:50,630 --> 00:35:51,630
What should we do?

648
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,890
Mr. Kang.

649
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,600
We must find Li Shengda first.

650
00:35:59,830 --> 00:36:00,890
We lost the witness

651
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,080
and didn't find the physical evidence.

652
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,830
Shen Tunan will be here soon.

653
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,730
Shen Jinzhen is a communist.

654
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
She has to be.

655
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:08,770
Mr. Kang.

656
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:11,820
Shen Tunan is at Nanjing to meet Chairman Chiang.

657
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:14,560
It's different from when we dealt with Wei Ruolai.

658
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,630
Nanjing will think we are

659
00:36:15,630 --> 00:36:16,940
deliberately targeting Shen Tunan

660
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,500
and the Central Bank's new policy.

661
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,520
If we can't follow up with this,

662
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,000
we'll all be doomed!

663
00:36:25,850 --> 00:36:26,980
Mobilize everyone.

664
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:29,850
We must catch Li Shengda.

665
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:30,360
Yes.

666
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:40,150
Hello.

667
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,200
I just got a call.

668
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,520
Today's meeting is cancelled.

669
00:37:06,590 --> 00:37:07,550
Mr. Shen,

670
00:37:08,030 --> 00:37:09,890
you'd better go back to Shanghai.

671
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:14,280
Ming Da,

672
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,380
can you tell me why?

673
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,030
A Kuomintang proponent

674
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:19,480
should keep their reputation

675
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,450
clean.

676
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:41,950
Sir.

677
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:45,810
Something happened at home.

678
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,120
What happened?

679
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,310
Wei Ruolai made a false police report

680
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:54,310
to get to you.

681
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:55,290
Why?

682
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,380
Miss Shen

683
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,360
was arrested by the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

684
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,670
For ties with communism.

685
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:00,850
Lin Qiaosong brought men to your house

686
00:38:00,850 --> 00:38:02,180
to search for evidence.

687
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:08,800
Pack up.

688
00:38:08,830 --> 00:38:09,440
We'll leave for Shanghai now.

689
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:09,850
Yes.

690
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,780
Gosh.

691
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:18,840
Those bastards.

692
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,100
This mat is all messed up.

693
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,750
Seriously.

694
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,610
Evildoers

695
00:38:30,630 --> 00:38:32,230
will get their retribution.

696
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:46,460
Tell us what happened last night.

697
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,190
The more detailed, the better.

698
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:50,110
I was on duty yesterday.

699
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,180
Two of Lin Qiaosong's men

700
00:38:52,310 --> 00:38:53,740
came to get gold bars.

701
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,570
Ten gold bars.

702
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,680
I kept my eye on them

703
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:56,940
and eavesdropped.

704
00:38:57,150 --> 00:38:58,940
They said Li Shengda was alive

705
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:01,340
and staying at Astor House Hotel.

706
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,670
So I went there.

707
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,840
I heard the gunshot at the hotel lobby.

708
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,270
Li Shengda

709
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,790
was covered with blood and ran out with a case.

710
00:39:08,790 --> 00:39:10,050
I wanted to follow him,

711
00:39:10,410 --> 00:39:12,270
but then I recalled you telling me

712
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,060
to inform you

713
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,680
when something big happens.

714
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,920
So I called your house

715
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:17,910
to contact you.

716
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,770
You know everything after that.

717
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:24,350
Do you think Jinzhen's arrest

718
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,630
is related to Li Shengda?

719
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,120
No.

720
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,250
Impossible.

721
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,730
How could Miss Shen be involved with communists?

722
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:32,470
But without evidence,

723
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:34,510
Mr. Kang and Lin Qiaosong wouldn't dare do this.

724
00:39:34,510 --> 00:39:36,840
They arrested her and searched the house.

725
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:38,370
Something must be suspicious with Jinzhen.

726
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:39,080
Sir,

727
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:40,560
there weren't any evidence

728
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:41,780
when I was arrested too.

729
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,710
They arrest people as they wish.

730
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,420
They chose to arrest her when you were in Nanjing.

731
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:47,950
They must be targeting you.

732
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,710
So we shouldn't step forward now.

733
00:39:50,910 --> 00:39:52,370
We can contact the arsenal

734
00:39:52,550 --> 00:39:53,950
and put pressure on them.

735
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:57,790
Release her!

736
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:58,940
Release her!

737
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:00,500
[The Nation Belongs to All Citizens]

738
00:39:59,180 --> 00:39:59,940
Release her!

739
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,800
Release her!

740
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:02,420
Release Shen Jinzhen!

741
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,820
Release Shen Jinzhen!

742
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,290
[Release Shen Jinzhen]

743
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,170
Get Chief Kang out here!

744
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,550
Shen Jinzhen is the core engineer

745
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:07,410
of our arsenal!

746
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,840
You can't arrest her for no reason!

747
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:09,840
Objection!

748
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:11,160
Release Shen Jinzhen!

749
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:12,540
Release Shen Jinzhen!

750
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:14,610
Release her!

751
00:40:14,630 --> 00:40:19,510
Objection!

752
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,340
Release her!

753
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:22,050
Mr. Weng.

754
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,520
Mr. Weng, thank you.

755
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,330
Don't mention it.

756
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:26,090
Jinzhen is our core engineer.

757
00:40:26,450 --> 00:40:28,580
Bullying her is bullying our arsenal.

758
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,010
If you need any help,

759
00:40:30,030 --> 00:40:31,440
we'll go all out for you.

760
00:40:32,270 --> 00:40:33,440
Let everyone

761
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,300
have a rest.

762
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,170
Wait for my news.

763
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,060
Okay.

764
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,360
All right!

765
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:41,250
I have an appointment with Chief Kang.

766
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:41,780
I'm Shen Tunan.

767
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,620
Okay, hang on.

768
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,580
I'll make a call.

769
00:40:50,210 --> 00:40:50,870
Chief Kang.

770
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,120
Central Bank's Shen Tunan.

771
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:52,680
Yes!

772
00:40:55,070 --> 00:40:55,670
Please.

773
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,220
Not you guys.

774
00:41:00,470 --> 00:41:01,600
Wait for me outside.

775
00:41:01,670 --> 00:41:02,310
Yes.

776
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:08,390
Don't worry.

777
00:41:08,470 --> 00:41:09,820
Miss Shen will be fine.

778
00:41:10,930 --> 00:41:11,970
How do you know?

779
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,000
If Miss Shen is really a communist,

780
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,500
Mr. Shen would know.

781
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:20,530
You're right.

782
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:22,270
Mr. Shen is sharp.

783
00:41:22,290 --> 00:41:23,520
He'd have noticed it.

784
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,550
And Miss Shen's of a high status.

785
00:41:25,550 --> 00:41:27,390
Without solid evidence,

786
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,060
they wouldn't use force.

787
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:30,440
A forced testimony

788
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:31,600
won't count anyway.

789
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:34,610
I hope so.

790
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:40,730
Tunan.

791
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:41,800
So sorry.

792
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:44,860
I should've waited for you to come back.

793
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:48,200
But Li Shengda suddenly confessed about his suspicions

794
00:41:48,450 --> 00:41:50,880
of Jinzhen colluding with the communists.

795
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,150
We dare not neglect it.

796
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,060
Have you interrogated her?

797
00:41:54,060 --> 00:41:55,060
Not really.

798
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:56,930
I invited her over for a brief chat

799
00:41:56,930 --> 00:41:58,480
and let her go right after.

800
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:00,140
It's the same as last time.

801
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:02,010
A lack of evidence.

802
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:03,520
We have evidence.

803
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,100
But Tunan,

804
00:42:06,470 --> 00:42:08,290
are you sure you want to ask about this?

805
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,410
If I don't ask, will you let me go?

806
00:42:10,880 --> 00:42:11,560
Fine.

807
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:13,270
I'll be frank then.

808
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:15,540
Do you remember

809
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:17,960
Li Shengda, the one who Wei Ruolai

810
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,000
tried to kill?

811
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:20,470
He's not dead yet.

812
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:22,900
He identified his killer

813
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:23,920
as Jinzhen.

814
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:24,910
Twice.

815
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:26,700
Mr. Kang,

816
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:29,350
are you sure it's my sister Shen Jinzhen?

817
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:31,230
You know her.

818
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:32,820
She's a pampered kid.

819
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:35,180
She can only play the piano with her hands.

820
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,210
Also, she has always been by my side.

821
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,170
I swear

822
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,860
she'd have no chance to join the Communist Party.

823
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,310
Li Shengda is in my hands.

824
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,380
He can testify anytime.

825
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,200
In order to thwart Jiangxi's plan

826
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,840
to suppress communism,

827
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:49,850
a communist traitor

828
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,540
is slandering the backbone of the arsenal.

829
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:53,440
If this delays the ammunition production,

830
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,230
Mr. Kang,

831
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:55,420
you'll...

832
00:42:55,930 --> 00:42:56,900
be an accomplice.
