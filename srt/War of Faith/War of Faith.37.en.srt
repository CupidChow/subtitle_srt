1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:50,229
This Chen Jitang

3
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:51,920
really has some skills with the economy.

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,750
Guangzhou's level of prosperity

5
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,400
is almost at the same level as Shanghai.

6
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,030
Sir,

7
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:58,910
Lin Qiaosong has arrived in Guangzhou.

8
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,630
He was restricted by the Suppression Headquarters in Ganzhou

9
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,680
and could only cooperate with me to the best of his abilities.

10
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,240
Now that he's here,

11
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,630
he has free rein.

12
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,360
Do you think Nanjing sent him here

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,960
to keep an eye on you?

14
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:17,190
It's expected.

15
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:21,470
How's the work arrangement here?

16
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:23,280
Lin Qiaosong is quite efficient.

17
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,470
He caught a big fish in just a few days.

18
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,800
It's a local gang.

19
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,280
They sold tungsten ore to the Japanese on the sea

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,740
and were caught red-handed during the deal.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,329
What new tricks do you have?

22
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,310
Show me.

23
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,470
I can handle it.

24
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,610
Special Commissioner.

25
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,480
Put him down.

26
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,170
Let him rest for a while.

27
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,800
Didn't you hear the Special Commissioner?

28
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,870
He said

29
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:00,080
to put him down.

30
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,890
Stop pretending to be good.

31
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,590
You people

32
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,470
just want money.

33
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:19,840
Tell me.

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,960
How much do you want?

35
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:22,590
Hai Laoqi,

36
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,470
leader of the Triad Society's Wo Shing Tong.

37
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:25,360
You're quite a big figure.

38
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,360
I know all of that,

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,060
but let me tell you.

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,620
Other than smuggling,

41
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,400
you have another crime that is too big for you to carry.

42
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,870
You are not the customs anti-smuggling squad?

43
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:35,840
We are not.

44
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,840
You were arrested

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,070
by the Inspection Department's operation team.

46
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,600
We don't arrest smugglers.

47
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,120
We're after the communists.

48
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,870
Don't slander me.

49
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,430
Smuggling?

50
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:47,400
I admit it.

51
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:50,470
But colluding with communist is slandering.

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,600
Tungsten ore is sourced from Jiangxi.

53
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,430
Your supplier is the Communist Party.

54
00:03:55,430 --> 00:03:57,590
We've investigated all of this.

55
00:03:58,280 --> 00:03:59,810
You're dead meat this time.

56
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:02,730
Are you scared?

57
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:06,280
If you knew colluding with the Communist Party could get you killed,

58
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
what were you doing earlier?

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,370
I really didn't know he's a communist.

60
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,310
Come, take it.

61
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,100
Hurry, take it.

62
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,480
Captain Zhou.

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,750
This is the delivery list.

64
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:29,810
Please have a look.

65
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:34,680
Mr. Cheng, no problem.

66
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,430
I can tell Mr. Yan's handwriting

67
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,480
at a glance.

68
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,120
Have a safe trip.

69
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,150
Thank you.

70
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
The goods are all loaded.

71
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,270
The train will leave after they finish checking.

72
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:47,870
Okay.

73
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:48,870
Let's go.

74
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,480
I've confirmed with Hans from Germany

75
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,630
via telegram.

76
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:17,190
The deal is fine.

77
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:21,430
The previous deals went well,

78
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,390
but this one has a big volume.

79
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,510
Make sure nothing goes wrong.

80
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,720
Got it.

81
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,000
After all, this industry

82
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
has to stay underground.

83
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,580
It's a secret deal every time.

84
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,490
If we want the goods,

85
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,440
we wait for the supplier to contact us.

86
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:44,270
They'll give us a note

87
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,040
that says the time and place

88
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:48,320
of the exchange.

89
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,150
We'll pick up the goods at the scheduled time

90
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,950
and place,

91
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
and leave the money there.

92
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,720
Do you remember

93
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,720
the messenger's characteristics?

94
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,950
He's tall

95
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
and muscular.

96
00:06:03,510 --> 00:06:05,430
He doesn't have a local accent.

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,000
What accent does he have?

98
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,460
It's sounds like one from southern Jiangxi.

99
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,920
Every time he comes,

100
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,670
he would buy a lot of seafood.

101
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,680
It doesn't look like he's buying it for his family.

102
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:18,680
It's like he's buying for a restaurant.

103
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,750
One of my men

104
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,780
thought he saw him at Shanwei Street.

105
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,680
If you see him again,

106
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
will you be able to recognize him?

107
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,360
Yes.

108
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,430
I have photogenic memory for people.

109
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,480
Captain Lin,

110
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,680
take Master Hai to Shanwei Street secretly.

111
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,740
Find this person as soon as possible.

112
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,150
Yes.

113
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,870
Sir, come eat here.

114
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,150
We have special seafood today.

115
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,070
It's our signature dish.

116
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:47,720
Let's eat here.

117
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,360
Please.

118
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,930
Table for three.

119
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,080
There are only a few left.

120
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,070
Did you remember correctly?

121
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,830
Yes.

122
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,430
Kong.

123
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:10,800
Sir.

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,040
Kong, there are spies.

125
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,830
Sorry.

126
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,680
Why are there spies?

127
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,870
Did we get exposed?

128
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:26,950
Probably.

129
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:29,010
I just saw Hai Laoqi and Lin Qiaosong.

130
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,120
They're looking for me.

131
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:30,630
Who?

132
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:31,950
Hai Laoqi and who?

133
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:32,830
Lin Qiaosong.

134
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,380
Lin Qiaosong is in Guangzhou?

135
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:38,480
Oh no

136
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:41,430
He is with Hai Laoqi.

137
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,250
It means he's also after the tungsten ore.

138
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,470
This is troublesome.

139
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,240
Would you like to eat?

140
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:49,950
No.

141
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,040
Thank you.

142
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,070
Is he here?

143
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,750
No.

144
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,600
He's not here.

145
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:11,680
Is that him?

146
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,630
No.

147
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,240
Take two men upstairs.

148
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,740
Check the kitchen too.

149
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,680
Okay.

150
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,510
Keep an eye on him.

151
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,080
Yes, sir!

152
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,750
Biao, lighter.

153
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:37,510
Lighter.

154
00:08:58,960 --> 00:08:59,630
Not here.

155
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,550
Let's go to the next restaurant.

156
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,750
How is it?

157
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,200
They left.

158
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,920
I don't think we're exposed.

159
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,840
Captain, Special Commissioner,

160
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,270
Hai Laoqi's pick-up locations

161
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,790
are all circled in red.

162
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,270
They're very cunning.

163
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:26,470
The pick-up location changes every time,

164
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,030
but there'll always be a pattern to follow.

165
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:31,720
Isn't that right, Special Commissioner?

166
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,670
Yes.

167
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:41,440
Captain Lin, it seems that you've learned the method

168
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,790
of finding the counterfeit money factory in Shanghai.

169
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,320
We used to be rivals, and we're comrades now.

170
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,790
Isn’t that good, Special Commissioner?

171
00:09:46,790 --> 00:09:48,270
Why don’t you show me

172
00:09:48,270 --> 00:09:49,600
how to find the pattern.

173
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,960
There are only two ways to transport tungsten ore

174
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,120
from southern Jiangxi to Guangzhou.

175
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
It's either by rail

176
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,630
or by water.

177
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:59,150
So these pick-up locations

178
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:00,600
will definitely be concentrated

179
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,860
near the train station

180
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,870
or

181
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,270
near the dock.

182
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,910
Hai Laoqi said a batch of goods will arrive today.

183
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:09,710
The location happens to be near the train station.

184
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,030
Special Commissioner, what are your orders?

185
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:28,080
Huangsha Station will cooperate.

186
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,790
The train came from Shaozhou.

187
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,480
It declared it's transporting coal, right?

188
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,720
Yes, it will arrive at 3 p.m.

189
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,870
Shaozhou

190
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,510
isn't far from southern Jiangxi.

191
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,370
Tungsten ore looks like coal too.

192
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,630
Is everything ready?

193
00:10:46,630 --> 00:10:47,890
Nothing will go wrong.

194
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:50,360
Tell the men along the line to not to alert them.

195
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,720
Let them in first.

196
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,360
Yes.

197
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,240
Gentlemen,

198
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,790
this is the goods list of this train.

199
00:11:07,790 --> 00:11:08,720
Please check it.

200
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
It's coal from Shaozhou, right?

201
00:11:11,910 --> 00:11:13,150
Train number 5156.

202
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,390
Yes.

203
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,450
Cigarette for you.

204
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,320
Cigarette?

205
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,600
Check the back carriage.

206
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,000
Yes.

207
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,160
Stay here for a while.

208
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,030
Okay.

209
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,170
No problem.

210
00:11:47,270 --> 00:11:48,870
It's all coal. They can pass.

211
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,120
They can pass.

212
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,630
Okay.

213
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:56,960
Sir,

214
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,310
you can go now.

215
00:11:58,630 --> 00:11:59,510
See you, sir.

216
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,700
The next stop is Huangsha.

217
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:03,670
Let's go.

218
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,280
Mr. Huang, everything is ready.

219
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,600
Hello.

220
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,630
They're on their way.

221
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,230
They'll arrive at Huangsha Station in an hour.

222
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Catch them alive.

223
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,750
No problem,

224
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,660
as long as they cooperate.

225
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,260
We're here.

226
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,020
We're here.

227
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:03,750
Why is it all men outside?

228
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:06,530
There are no elderly or children.

229
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,160
You're right.

230
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,240
It could be a trap.

231
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,600
Don't worry.

232
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,150
Come with me.

233
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:26,840
I'm from the Inspection Department.

234
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,120
Get out of the way. Go.

235
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,030
Hurry up.

236
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:30,910
Hurry up.

237
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:31,510
Get down.

238
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,670
Go away.

239
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,750
Go away.

240
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:51,000
Hurry up!

241
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,320
Captain,

242
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,120
no one is in the carriage.

243
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,520
They have fast reflexes.

244
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:57,600
Unfortunately, there are too few of us.

245
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,000
We can't surround it completely.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,120
Huangsha Station is more complex than Shanghai Station.

247
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,450
It's hard to supervise.

248
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,480
As long as the goods are still here,

249
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,390
we'll catch the people sooner or later.

250
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:05,960
Yes.

251
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:06,630
Go!

252
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:08,390
Hurry!

253
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,080
Go!

254
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,200
Why are you here?

255
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,030
We're here to help you.

256
00:14:15,030 --> 00:14:15,670
Retreat.

257
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:16,270
Go!

258
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:31,320
Hurry up!

259
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,080
This is coal.

260
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,440
It's indeed tungsten ore.

261
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,080
Shen Tunan.

262
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,000
Special Commissioner,

263
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,740
the goods are all here,

264
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,290
but the people escaped.

265
00:15:56,670 --> 00:15:59,600
Didn't you say you're good at catching people at train stations?

266
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,790
We're short-handed this time.

267
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:01,320
We couldn't complete the encirclement.

268
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,380
No need to explain.

269
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,390
I'm not blaming you.

270
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,150
The goods are still here.

271
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:08,270
We'll wait for them to appear.

272
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,910
Yes.

273
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,790
There's roughly

274
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:21,390
a dozen tons of tungsten ore.

275
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:22,600
Pretty much.

276
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,510
How long do you think smugglers

277
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,600
like Hai Laoqi would take to sell this batch of goods?

278
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,320
Hai Laoqi only deals with 2-3 kilograms.

279
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:30,960
Over 10 tons

280
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,920
is far beyond his capabilities.

281
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:33,870
So,

282
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,360
there must be some big shot behind him

283
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,270
involved in the smuggling of commodities.

284
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:39,960
If it's the smuggling of commodities,

285
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,240
the customs must know about it.

286
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,910
Someone in the higher-ups must be supporting him.

287
00:16:43,910 --> 00:16:45,030
Special Commissioner,

288
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:45,870
other than being

289
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:47,600
Chen Jitang's butler, Yan Youmin is also

290
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,480
the supervisor of Canton Customs.

291
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,270
Captain Lin,

292
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,790
with your personality,

293
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,200
what would you do

294
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,860
if you encountered something like this?

295
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,400
I'll give the beast a warning.

296
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,920
Then give it a serious warning.

297
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,240
I'd like to see

298
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,440
how the beast will roar

299
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,750
when it's angered.

300
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,829
Stop!

301
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,829
Stop!

302
00:17:19,349 --> 00:17:20,200
Who are you?

303
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,680
The Inspection Department is working on a case.

304
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,030
Tell your men to come out.

305
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:26,150
The Special Commissioner has something to say.

306
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:26,680
Yes.

307
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,750
You are all staff of Canton Customs.

308
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:39,400
You guard the government's doors against smuggling,

309
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,930
but please take a good look.

310
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,590
A dozen tons of tungsten ore

311
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:45,070
just slipped past

312
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:46,000
under your nose.

313
00:17:46,310 --> 00:17:47,710
The government's losses

314
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,440
are nearly 10,000 yuan just in tariffs.

315
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,240
Who will take the responsibility for this?

316
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,200
Who?

317
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:56,330
Please don't be angry.

318
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,680
We failed to catch the smuggling.

319
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,590
We will investigate it thoroughly.

320
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,320
Captain Lin.

321
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,510
Take him away.

322
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,070
Yes.

323
00:18:05,590 --> 00:18:06,790
What are you doing?

324
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:08,200
I'm British.

325
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,240
You have no right to arrest me.

326
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,160
Mr. Smart,

327
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,270
according to Article 8 of the Anti-smuggling Ordinance,

328
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,750
tariff evasion is a crime

329
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,640
for both Chinese and foreigners

330
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:16,840
and must be punished.

331
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,310
Do you think you're above

332
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,640
the law of China?

333
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm going to the Chinese Maritime Customs Service.

334
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,200
I want to see Frederick Maze.

335
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,660
Are you resisting arrest?

336
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll shoot you.

337
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,380
Try it if you don't believe me.

338
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,930
You want to see Frederick Maze?

339
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:33,110
Yes.

340
00:18:33,110 --> 00:18:34,400
You think he can protect you

341
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
just because he's your compatriot?

342
00:18:37,110 --> 00:18:37,960
Mr. Smart,

343
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,480
we have evidence that you took bribes.

344
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,270
Do you think Frederick Maze will danger himself

345
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,680
to protect you?

346
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:46,770
Let me emphasize it again.

347
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:49,160
The days of foreigners like you

348
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,960
taking advantage of the customs

349
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,270
are coming to an end.

350
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,680
Take him away.

351
00:18:54,030 --> 00:18:54,880
Send him to the Nanjing government.

352
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:55,920
Yes.

353
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,440
Go.

354
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,440
The position of the anti-smuggling squad's chief

355
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,750
is vacant now.

356
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,300
Who will take over?

357
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,450
Captain Lin,

358
00:19:07,510 --> 00:19:09,400
you will take over this position

359
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,060
during the tungsten ore case.

360
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:14,640
Yes.

361
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,070
Special Commissioner.

362
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,470
Mr. Yan, long time no see.

363
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,030
You’re impolite.

364
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,270
Why didn't you tell me

365
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,830
when you came to Guangzhou?

366
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,830
I didn't have time.

367
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:35,400
I just solved a case here

368
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,720
and seized some goods.

369
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,440
Look.

370
00:19:38,030 --> 00:19:39,480
A dozen tons of tungsten ore.

371
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,880
A dozen tons, Mr. Yan.

372
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,720
Anti-smuggling

373
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,310
seems to be the Canton Customs's job.

374
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,880
I don't think

375
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,270
you have the authority.

376
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,720
This is Mr. Kong's handwritten official document.

377
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,400
Take a look.

378
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,880
Recently, the smuggling

379
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,720
of tungsten ore between Jiangxi and Canton has been rampant.

380
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,030
Countless people have colluded with or aided communists,

381
00:20:09,030 --> 00:20:10,160
so Nanjing

382
00:20:10,160 --> 00:20:12,110
appointed me as the Special Commissioner

383
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,110
to set up a special task force

384
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:14,640
to handle the tungsten ore case.

385
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,880
It also emphasizes that,

386
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:16,790
when necessary,

387
00:20:16,790 --> 00:20:18,400
I can use all resources.

388
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,030
So now, the Canton Customs

389
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:23,480
is temporarily taken over by our special investigation team.

390
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:24,240
Mr. Yan?

391
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,070
Mr. Yan?

392
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,510
Any problems?

393
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:31,590
You have Mr. Kong's authorization,

394
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,940
so the Canton Customs will do our best

395
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,110
to cooperate fully.

396
00:20:35,110 --> 00:20:35,960
Good.

397
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,750
Tonight, let's have a welcoming party for the Special Commissioner

398
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,030
at Ball Club.

399
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,440
No need to have a party

400
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,720
for now.

401
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,200
Mr. Yan,

402
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,310
look at all these goods.

403
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:48,110
If I don't find the mastermind,

404
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:49,910
I won't be able to sleep at night.

405
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,110
The siege on communists is in full swing now.

406
00:20:52,110 --> 00:20:53,400
If I find out this batch of goods

407
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,510
really has something to do with the Communist Party,

408
00:20:55,510 --> 00:20:57,270
it'll be a big case.

409
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:58,590
It might even alert

410
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,160
the chairman.

411
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,680
We will focus on the investigation.

412
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:09,920
As I said,

413
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,080
we will cooperate fully.

414
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,310
Thank you.

415
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,710
If the tungsten ore falls into their hands,

416
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,010
there might be changes

417
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:26,920
with Hans's side.

418
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,440
No,

419
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,040
didn't we already negotiate with Hans before?

420
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:32,590
Hans wants tungsten ore.

421
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,410
He doesn't care whose it is.

422
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:35,880
Besides, he and Shen Tunan

423
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,350
were classmates for years.

424
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:38,350
What should we do?

425
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,480
There are only two ways

426
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,010
to negotiate this deal now.

427
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,880
Either we lower the price

428
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,310
or we supply them faster.

429
00:21:47,310 --> 00:21:48,510
You mean

430
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,590
we have to give it to Hans

431
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:53,110
at a lower price and faster speed than Shen Tunan.

432
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,400
Let's just transport the goods to Hans from Ball.

433
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,110
We'll be faster than them.

434
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:56,830
I'll go then.

435
00:21:56,830 --> 00:21:57,880
Are you going on a suicide mission?

436
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,350
The Ball warehouse

437
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,720
is guarded 24 hours a day.

438
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,050
How can you get in there?

439
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,510
Got it.

440
00:22:06,510 --> 00:22:07,510
I'll kill Lin Qiaosong

441
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:09,110
and disguise myself as him.

442
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:11,240
I'll make the guards leave and let you in.

443
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:14,100
Wouldn't it be easier if you just killed Shen Tunan?

444
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,930
It's a good idea to move the guards,

445
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:20,990
but we need to think about

446
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,160
who will do it.

447
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:23,160
We have intercepted

448
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,310
all of the Communist Party's tungsten ore

449
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:26,510
and got in touch with Hans.

450
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,830
However, I'm worried that

451
00:22:27,830 --> 00:22:29,240
they will lower the price.

452
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,030
Good job.

453
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,400
It took us a lot of effort

454
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,350
to intercept the tungsten ore.

455
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,160
The least I can do

456
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:35,960
is accept 72 silver coins per 50 kilograms.

457
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,790
Remember. The key of this trip

458
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:40,110
is not only to cut off the Communist Party's tungsten ore trade line,

459
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,720
but also to build our own

460
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,270
tungsten ore trade line.

461
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,310
Got it.

462
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:45,400
Don't worry, sir.

463
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
The result will come out in a few days.

464
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:48,440
Thank you.

465
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,640
Finish up with Guangdong as soon as possible.

466
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:53,160
I'll personally celebrate for you in Nanjing.

467
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:53,880
Okay.

468
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,110
Before the deal is done,

469
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:00,920
anything might happen.

470
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:03,030
So, from now on,

471
00:23:03,030 --> 00:23:04,880
unless they have a customs declaration form

472
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
with my personal signature, vehicles are only allowed

473
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,030
to enter.

474
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,480
No one can go out.

475
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,310
Don't worry.

476
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:11,400
I've installed

477
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:13,070
a pressure detector in the tungsten ore's zone.

478
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:14,920
If a box of tungsten ore is moved,

479
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,400
the alarm will go off.

480
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,480
In addition, I've arranged

481
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,920
at least two heavy machine guns on the rooftops

482
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,880
with guards 24 hours per day

483
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,160
to prevent a maritime invasion.

484
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,310
I've also arranged patrols outside at all times.

485
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:24,480
Special Commissioner,

486
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,680
for this mission,

487
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,400
you only need to be responsible for your own duties .

488
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,880
Leave the rest to me.

489
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,310
Good job.

490
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,110
Keep an eye on Yan Youmin.

491
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,160
Wei Ruolai may contact him

492
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,350
at any time.

493
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,920
Report to me immediately

494
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,960
about even the smallest things.

495
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:41,030
Yes.

496
00:23:41,030 --> 00:23:41,960
Lin Qiaosong and Shen Tunan

497
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,110
followed us to Guangzhou.

498
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:44,350
It means they already know

499
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:46,310
we're doing business with Yan Youmin.

500
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,680
Last time at the train station,

501
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:49,070
they didn't catch Yuanbao and I.

502
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:51,110
They must be watching Yan Youmin now.

503
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,590
Meanwhile, Yan Youmin was supposed to trade with us,

504
00:23:53,590 --> 00:23:55,030
but he hasn't seen us yet.

505
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:55,880
Yan Youmin is probably

506
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,240
looking for us all over Guangzhou now.

507
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,160
Plus, we have

508
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
evidence of his deal.

509
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,680
He'd love to kill me now.

510
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
So,

511
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:04,160
you want to...

512
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:04,920
That's right.

513
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:05,880
If I ask him to meet me,

514
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,000
he will definitely come.

515
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,960
Then Lin Qiaosong will follow closely behind too.

516
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,590
No, it's too dangerous.

517
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,990
We are already short-handed in Guangzhou.

518
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,830
I don't need to actually show up.

519
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:16,560
Just make him think I'm coming.

520
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:19,960
Yangquan Restaurant is our party's territory.

521
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:20,880
If we meet there,

522
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,480
Yan Youmin will think

523
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,790
I'm meeting him there

524
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:23,960
for safety.

525
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:24,920
At that time,

526
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:27,490
give him a sufficiently attractive bait.

527
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,030
Where is Chief Lei and Yan Youmin's

528
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,110
signed document?

529
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:35,270
In the box.

530
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,160
Sanqiangzi, go take a photo

531
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,310
and send it to Mr. Yan.

532
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,270
Hurry up.

533
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,480
By then, Mr. Yan will definitely go to the restaurant.

534
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,030
Lin Qiaosong will also follow over.

535
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,240
We'll have enough time

536
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
to transport the tungsten ore away.

537
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,720
Any news on Wei Ruolai?

538
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,310
Not yet, Mr. Yan.

539
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,510
He suffered so many losses at the train station.

540
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,570
I don't think he'll dare to come back.

541
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,200
We must cut ties now.

542
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,050
We can’t be affected

543
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,270
by the tungsten ore at all.

544
00:25:09,270 --> 00:25:10,110
But Mr. Yan,

545
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:12,830
Shen Tunan has the tungsten ore now.

546
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,030
He won't give us a single penny.

547
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:15,480
Sir.

548
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:16,720
Come in.

549
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,100
Mr. Yan, there's a letter for you.

550
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,580
Tungsten wire?

551
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:26,510
Where is the messenger?

552
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:28,310
He left after handing this over.

553
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,200
Hurry and follow him.

554
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:29,680
Hurry!

555
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:30,400
Yes.

556
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,590
Wei Ruolai.

557
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,030
I knew

558
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:40,240
he would threaten me with this.

559
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,200
Mr. Yan,

560
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:49,720
Shen Tunan has the tungsten ore now.

561
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,790
We'll be in trouble if this is added to the mix.

562
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:52,920
Wei Ruolai

563
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:54,900
wants to drag me down with him.

564
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
What should we do now?

565
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:05,030
Let's do as he says.

566
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,250
Don't push him too hard.

567
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:10,970
Otherwise, he might act out of desperation.

568
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,200
At this point,

569
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,960
we can only take one step at a time.

570
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,290
Seize the opportunity,

571
00:26:23,110 --> 00:26:24,400
destroy the evidence,

572
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:27,080
and silence him.

573
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:42,960
Stop!

574
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,400
Who are you?

575
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,110
Don't move!

576
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,230
I'll kill you if you move.

577
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:50,310
Who are you?

578
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,350
A messenger.

579
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:52,350
Tonight,

580
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:55,350
Yangquan Restaurant will treat Mr. Yan to dinner.

581
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,510
Three years

582
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,790
passed in the blink of an eye.

583
00:27:09,790 --> 00:27:11,160
I heard your news

584
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,030
from the German Ambassador.

585
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:13,240
I didn't expect you to be in Guangzhou.

586
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,830
What kind of fate do we have?

587
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,880
I saw news of your death

588
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,830
on the Shanghai newspapers.

589
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,480
I even cried.

590
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:23,070
I felt regretful.

591
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,680
As an old Chinese saying goes,

592
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:26,680
drive someone into a fatal position and he will rise from the ashes.

593
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:28,080
Those things from before

594
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,830
are nothing to me now.

595
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:34,830
Then why did you suddenly contact me?

596
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,680
As far as I know,

597
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,160
Germany has never stopped

598
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,030
preparing for war these years.

599
00:27:41,350 --> 00:27:42,830
The demand for tungsten ore

600
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,160
is higher and higher.

601
00:27:44,750 --> 00:27:45,830
I just want to know

602
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:47,240
where Rhine Metal

603
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:49,350
imports your tungsten ore from?

604
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:51,550
All tungsten in the world is from China.

605
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,030
All Chinese tungsten is in Jiangxi.

606
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:55,850
Unfortunately,

607
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,200
Jiangxi

608
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,830
is not under the Kuomintang's control.

609
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,000
Where do you think I should import tungsten ore from?

610
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:03,680
Hans,

611
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,510
I came to Guangzhou this time

612
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:07,590
on behalf of the Kuomintang government

613
00:28:07,590 --> 00:28:09,920
just for the case of tungsten ore smuggling.

614
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:11,350
I can tell you clearly

615
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:12,880
all the smuggling routes

616
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,830
of tungsten ore to Guangzhou

617
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,310
have been cut off by us.

618
00:28:16,750 --> 00:28:18,270
If anyone wants to buy tungsten ore in the future,

619
00:28:18,270 --> 00:28:19,880
including you, Hans,

620
00:28:20,510 --> 00:28:21,840
they can only come to me.

621
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,040
It's useless to go to other people.

622
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,480
Also,

623
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,510
you should know very well

624
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,240
about the war situation in Jiangxi.

625
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:36,350
You mean Jiangxi

626
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:40,000
will return to your control soon?

627
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,070
What do you think?

628
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:14,880
Hello?

629
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,350
Yan Youmin's car is on the move.

630
00:29:16,350 --> 00:29:17,000
Okay.

631
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,640
Notify the Special Commissioner that Yan is on the move.

632
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,310
Yes.

633
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:33,720
Special Commissioner, Captain wants me to tell you

634
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,380
that Yan Youmin is on the move.

635
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:42,070
Hans, I can't chat any longer today.

636
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,160
I can see that.

637
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:46,880
You have more important things to do.

638
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:48,370
Before I leave,

639
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,480
let me tell you something.

640
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:52,640
We intercepted

641
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,350
a large batch of tungsten ore from the communists.

642
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,000
This batch is currently stored

643
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,860
in the customs warehouse at Ball.

644
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,730
The dock is right beside it.

645
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:00,790
If you need it,

646
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,590
I can have them load the ship

647
00:30:03,110 --> 00:30:03,830
and set sail now.

648
00:30:03,830 --> 00:30:04,680
Of course, I can even

649
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,070
fill out the customs declaration form for you.

650
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:07,960
But that batch of tungsten ore

651
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,030
was seized by you.

652
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,790
You had no expenses.

653
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:15,830
For our future cooperation to have a good start,

654
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,480
you should lower the price

655
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,510
a bit more.

656
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,350
How much do you want?

657
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,440
Seventy silver coins per 50 kilograms.

658
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:30,790
Seventy silver coins per 50 kilograms.

659
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:34,920
You learned how to bargain

660
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,180
after living in China.

661
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:38,440
But let me be frank with you.

662
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,160
The minimum price given by the Kuomintang government

663
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,350
is not that low.

664
00:30:42,160 --> 00:30:44,270
I can help you fight for a lower price,

665
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,160
but this will be

666
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,000
up to Mr. Kong.

667
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,240
He is abroad now.

668
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:50,070
I need to discuss

669
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,510
the final price with him.

670
00:30:52,510 --> 00:30:55,000
I'll give you five days

671
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:58,750
to confirm the final deal price.

672
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:02,350
Then we can sign the contract.

673
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,440
Wish us a pleasant cooperation.

674
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,510
Cheers.

675
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,440
See you.

676
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:41,160
Go to the dock.

677
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,110
Who are you?

678
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:50,960
Who are you?

679
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:53,390
Picking up the tungsten ore.

680
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:57,110
Captain Lin said

681
00:31:57,310 --> 00:31:58,440
that the tungsten ore can't leave the warehouse

682
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:01,170
without the Special Commissioner's signature.

683
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,400
Mr. Hans of Rhine Metal

684
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:06,130
just made a deal with your Special Commissioner.

685
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,920
He signed it personally.

686
00:32:07,920 --> 00:32:08,920
See for yourself.

687
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,310
Wait.

688
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
But we have to forge the customs declaration form too.

689
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,640
That's easy.

690
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:29,440
I imitated Shen Tunan's signature

691
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,920
and signed some documents before.

692
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,590
I just don't know the price

693
00:32:32,590 --> 00:32:33,320
he gave Hans.

694
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,880
Do you have the 72 Industries Business Daily from these days?

695
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:39,590
Yes.

696
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:45,920
Here.

697
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:09,200
Ask the captain if this is true.

698
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,230
Okay.

699
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,240
Wait a minute.

700
00:34:01,110 --> 00:34:02,150
What's the situation?

701
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,210
Yan Youmin is here.

702
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,190
Wei Ruolai is not here yet.

703
00:34:04,190 --> 00:34:05,110
Keep watching.

704
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:05,590
Yes.

705
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,590
Okay.

706
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:08,770
I'll go in and meet Yan Youmin.

707
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:10,030
Sir,

708
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,670
isn't it too dangerous for you to go in alone?

709
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,960
It's okay. He won't dare to do anything to me.

710
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:14,800
When Captain Lin arrives,

711
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,230
tell him to guard the outside.

712
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:16,800
I'll go in first.

713
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,280
Okay.

714
00:35:01,070 --> 00:35:01,760
Who is it?

715
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:03,440
What are you here for?

716
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,440
Bullet delivery.

717
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,110
Okay, put it here.

718
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:06,840
Help yourself.

719
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:07,280
Okay.

720
00:35:46,670 --> 00:35:47,590
What's wrong?

721
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:48,440
Yan Youmin is here,

722
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:49,920
but Wei Ruolai hasn't arrived.

723
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,000
Where's the Special Commissioner?

724
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,000
He went in.

725
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,230
Fool.

726
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,360
Listen carefully.

727
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,030
Guard the front and back doors.

728
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,920
If you see Wei Ruolai, you don't need permission.

729
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,280
Act immediately.

730
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,320
Yes.

731
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,070
Go.

732
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:02,590
Captain,

733
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,280
the Special Commissioner and Hans

734
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,960
have basically reached an agreement.

735
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,160
Seventy silver coins per 50 kilograms.

736
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:09,960
Are you sure?

737
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,510
I heard it with my own ears.

738
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:12,770
They even shook hands.

739
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:16,150
Looks like negotiations went well.

740
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,840
You let Mr. Shen go in alone?

741
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,110
What if something goes wrong?

742
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,880
You're really something.

743
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:23,710
Captain.

744
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,280
What’s wrong?

745
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:25,230
They said someone brought

746
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:26,800
a customs declaration form signed by the Special Commissioner

747
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,880
to transport the tungsten ore away.

748
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:28,590
Which company?

749
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:29,590
Rhine Metal.

750
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:33,190
That means Mr. Shen reached a deal with Hans.

751
00:36:33,190 --> 00:36:34,990
Otherwise, he wouldn't sign it.

752
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,590
Go confirm it.

753
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,440
See if the declarations form

754
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,030
says 70 silver dollars per 50 kilograms.

755
00:36:41,030 --> 00:36:42,480
If yes, let them go.

756
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,150
If not, arrest them all.

757
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:44,670
Yes.

758
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:45,470
Are you crazy?

759
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,630
That's the German representative of Rhine Metal.

760
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,920
Can you not delay Mr. Shen's business?

761
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:50,120
If he's problematic,

762
00:36:50,230 --> 00:36:52,290
I don't care which country he's from.

763
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,840
When did the Special Commissioner go in?

764
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:55,070
It's been a while.

765
00:36:55,070 --> 00:36:55,670
Let's go.

766
00:36:57,110 --> 00:36:57,910
Lin Qiaosong.

767
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,110
Yes,

768
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,760
it's 70 silver dollars per 50 kilograms.

769
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,360
Did you look at the signature?

770
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,800
It's the Special Commissioner's own signature.

771
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,320
Yes.

772
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,640
Grant access.

773
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,400
Yes,

774
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,440
Okay,

775
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,710
go in.

776
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,070
Hurry up.

777
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,590
Move those two first.

778
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,400
Put them here.

779
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:24,710
Hurry up.

780
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,160
Here, support that side.

781
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,230
Help me.

782
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,000
Be gentle.

783
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,840
It’s lively here.

784
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:53,800
Mr. Yan,

785
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:55,960
you have a good appetite tonight?

786
00:37:56,590 --> 00:37:58,120
Is your friend not here yet?

787
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,110
Sir, Rhine Metal

788
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:02,510
have taken the goods.

789
00:38:02,510 --> 00:38:03,880
They should be on the ship now.

790
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:05,140
Everything went well.

791
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,280
What ship?

792
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,800
Oh no.

793
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:13,440
Everyone!

794
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,960
Go to the dock!

795
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,480
Get in the car.

796
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,360
Go to the dock.

797
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:34,710
Remove the plank.

798
00:38:40,670 --> 00:38:42,530
Remove it on that side too. Hurry.

799
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:58,960
Everyone,

800
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,320
get on the anti-smuggling boat.

801
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,070
Take the heavy machine guns.

802
00:39:01,070 --> 00:39:01,880
Lin Qiaosong.

803
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,030
Hurry up.

804
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:04,400
Doggie,

805
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,760
Kong,

806
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,220
the ship has left the dock.

807
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,760
Yes.

808
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,630
Hurry up!

809
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,800
Hurry, get on the anti-smuggling boat!

810
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,400
Hurry up!

811
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:17,880
Hurry!

812
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:28,880
Hurry!

813
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:30,110
Get on the boat!

814
00:39:31,510 --> 00:39:32,190
Hurry!

815
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:33,670
Get on the anti-smuggling boat.

816
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:34,630
Pull the alarm.

817
00:39:44,070 --> 00:39:46,280
Stop that ship at all cost!

818
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:01,230
Let's go.

819
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,440
Put out the fire!

820
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:06,920
What are you waiting for?

821
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,510
Put out the fire!

822
00:40:09,510 --> 00:40:10,150
Hurry!

823
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:11,880
Put out the fire!

824
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:14,800
Find a way to put out the fire.

825
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,500
What are you doing?

826
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,510
How did the tungsten ore get out?

827
00:40:21,510 --> 00:40:23,360
Why is it on the cargo ship?

828
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,160
Customs declaration form.

829
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,360
Put out the fire!

830
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,690
Special Commissioner,

831
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,090
your signature is here.

832
00:40:32,150 --> 00:40:33,480
This is not my handwriting.

833
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,230
I've never signed this customs declaration form.

834
00:40:35,230 --> 00:40:35,800
This...

835
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:37,870
What about the price?

836
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:38,670
This price

837
00:40:38,670 --> 00:40:39,800
is exactly the same as the price

838
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,760
you negotiated with Hans,

839
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,090
Special Commissioner.

840
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
Are you asking me?

841
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:46,590
You're asking me?

842
00:40:46,590 --> 00:40:47,440
When I negotiated with Hans,

843
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,840
only your agent was there.

844
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,480
Either he revealed it to Wei Ruolai,

845
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:51,230
or you did.

846
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:53,960
Special Commissioner,

847
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,360
please watch your language.

848
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,150
Don't insult our loyalty

849
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:57,230
with your doubt.

850
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,590
My men risk their lives

851
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:58,920
for the Kuomintang.

852
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,380
What's the use of loyalty?

853
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:02,070
The tungsten ore is gone.

854
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,180
What's the use?

855
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:06,800
Okay.

856
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,190
Special Commissioner,

857
00:41:09,190 --> 00:41:10,280
I will

858
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,960
report this truthfully to the Suppression Headquarters.

859
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,710
If it's my fault, you can punish me however you want.

860
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:14,670
But now,

861
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:16,360
the goods have left Guangzhou.

862
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,800
We can't let the people leave Guangzhou too.

863
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,840
Then go catch them.

864
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:19,510
Go!

865
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:20,030
Yes.

866
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,360
Tell them to get in the cars.

867
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,070
Yes.

868
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:24,330
Get in the cars. Hurry.

869
00:41:36,190 --> 00:41:38,790
The goods have been shipped out successfully.

870
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:40,000
What will you do

871
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,630
about the next batch?

872
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,000
Don't worry.

873
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,510
As long as we have the tungsten ore,

874
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,440
the shipment won't be a problem.

875
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:48,760
Will Wei Ruolai be arrested?

876
00:41:49,230 --> 00:41:50,160
It's hard to say.

877
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,880
But he has been in danger countless times

878
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:54,760
and he's gotten away each time.

879
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,280
If I can see him again,

880
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,230
I should have another drink with him.

881
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,440
From now on, I will only

882
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:04,630
negotiate the tungsten ore deal with Wei Ruolai.

883
00:42:04,630 --> 00:42:05,710
Mr. Hans,

884
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:06,840
I can use the lowest price

885
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,880
and the fastest speed

886
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,030
to give you the tungsten ore.

887
00:42:09,030 --> 00:42:11,400
You don’t have it in your hands now.

888
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,030
How will you give it to me?

889
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,960
I can't trust you now.

890
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,760
Sixty-five silver coins per 50 kilogram.

891
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:17,690
What do you mean?

892
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,030
I can sell it to you

893
00:42:19,030 --> 00:42:20,670
at a price of 65 silver coins per 50 kilograms.

894
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:22,230
This is the lowest price I can offer.

895
00:42:22,230 --> 00:42:23,150
I believe

896
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:26,190
Shen Tunan can give me a lower price.

897
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:27,920
Why don't you ask him tonight?

898
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:29,480
Seventy silver coins

899
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:31,190
was the lowest price that China exported tungsten ore for

900
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,110
last year.

901
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,710
From what I know about the Kuomintang,

902
00:42:33,710 --> 00:42:34,960
they're corrupted

903
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,480
and trade profits are exploited at all levels.

904
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,960
They won't give a price lower than this.

905
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,320
If what you said is true,

906
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,280
we'll meet at the dock tonight,

907
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,920
but you must find a way

908
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,110
to send the tungsten ore to the ocean freighter.

909
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:50,400
Then our deal will be completed.

910
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,960
Okay, no problem.

911
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,360
I'll wait for you at the dock.
