[War of Faith]

00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,820
[Episode 13]

4
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:43,870
Is something bothering you?

5
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,110
No, Sir.

6
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,170
There shouldn't be a money issue.

7
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:52,430
You'll get your salary tomorrow, right?

8
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:53,870
Yes.

9
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:58,100
I make 15 silver dollars a month, so I...

10
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:01,830
So I've given you a raise.

11
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:04,360
Now you'll make 50 silver dollars a month.

12
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,350
50?

13
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:07,430
50.

14
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,300
Why are you so surprised?

15
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,950
We're all witnesses to

16
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,150
your performance in the Central Bank.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,410
You deserve the raise.

18
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,190
Work harder!

19
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:20,650
A salary of 50 silver dollars is just a start.

20
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:30,270
Ruolai,

21
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:33,620
you were put through a lot in the past.

22
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:34,950
Focus on your job from now on.

23
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,829
I'm sure your life

24
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,740
will get better day by day.

25
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:44,190
Will you go home for the Chinese New Year?

26
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,030
No.

27
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,500
My hometown is war-ridden.

28
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:48,750
My father said

29
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,200
I might get in danger on my way home,

30
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,660
so he told me not to go back.

31
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,820
It's the communists' fault.

32
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,490
People can't reunite with their families.

33
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,950
Chairman Chiang sent Zhang Huizan to deal with the problem,

34
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:00,710
but he ended up being captured by the communists.

35
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:01,550
You see,

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,320
the communists are escalating their acts!

37
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:07,360
But I've been told by the people from my hometown

38
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,060
that the communists are from poor families.

39
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,040
Whether they put up a fight or not,

40
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:11,790
their lives are constantly threatened.

41
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:12,610
That's why they'd rather roll the dice.

42
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:13,570
I'm warning you,

43
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,470
it's fine to say these words to me,

44
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,560
but never say them in public. Got it?

45
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:20,650
Got it.

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,700
After the Chinese New Year,

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,790
Mr. He Yingqin, chief of the Military Administration Department,

48
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,630
will go to the field headquarters in Nanchang to supervise the soldiers.

49
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,030
Only when peace is restored in the country

50
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,890
can there be a stable environment for development.

51
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,820
In your family,

52
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,710
there isn't any other communist except your brother, right?

53
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:42,670
No. Just my brother.

54
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:44,829
That's good.

55
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:48,260
Now that you have to stay in Shanghai,

56
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:50,100
I'd like to invite you over for the Chinese New Year.

57
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,840
We'll spend the eve of it together.

58
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,070
Let's play fireworks,

59
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:54,530
and have a reunion dinner.

60
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,510
Isn't it a bit inappropriate, Sir?

61
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:57,060
Just come along.

62
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,340
There aren't many people in my family.

63
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,200
We'll be merrier with you around.

64
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,760
But first things first,

65
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,040
don't bring me any gifts,

66
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,350
and don't drink alcohol with Jinzhen.

67
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,260
Why?

68
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,790
I'm afraid she'll flip the table when she gets drunk.

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,330
[29th]

70
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,270
Wen!

71
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:46,830
You've been cooking the paste for the whole morning.

72
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:47,390
Is it finished yet?

73
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:48,190
Yes!

74
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:49,850
Wei!

75
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,730
The Chinese New Year's coming.

76
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:52,690
Let's paste some Spring Festival Couplets!

77
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,020
Come on, give me a brush!

78
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:55,530
Sir!

79
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,020
Sir!

80
00:04:57,510 --> 00:04:59,320
Have you written the couplets for the door yet?

81
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,440
Yes.

82
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,240
Read it. What does it say?

83
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:06,240
It'll look great on the door.

84
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:10,620
"Every year is a tough year."

85
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,490
What's that?

86
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,710
He just wouldn't say something nice about the new year!

87
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:18,970
Read the lower scroll.

88
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:20,580
Read the lower scroll!

89
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:24,860
"I can build a home everywhere."

90
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,290
Not bad!

91
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:28,780
I fit the profile.

92
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,700
I feel at home wherever I am!

93
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:32,430
If any place can be your home,

94
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:34,220
why don't you live on the streets?

95
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,820
He can make a home out on the streets!

96
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,680
The streets aren't a good choice!

97
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,670
Here comes the top scroll!

98
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,400
"May wealth come to us!"

99
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,230
Great!

100
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,710
This one is good!

101
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,360
We've worked our tails off for a whole year.

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,030
What do we want? Money!

103
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,590
More money!

104
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:53,280
Hurry up with the cutting!

105
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:53,909
Sure!

106
00:05:53,909 --> 00:05:55,150
We'll have a reunion dinner when this is done.

107
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:55,750
Okay!

108
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,630
Wei, you're invited too!

109
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:59,909
Ms. Zhou, will there be meat for the dinner?

110
00:05:59,909 --> 00:06:01,770
Don't just feed us with vegetables and tofu!

111
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:03,970
Brat, are you looking down on me or what?

112
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,640
It's the Chinese New Year. We've gotta throw a decent dinner!

113
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,790
That's right!

114
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:10,060
There's gonna be liquor and meat. Just enjoy, alright?

115
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,370
Yeah!

116
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:13,420
Paste the couplets!

117
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:15,980
Wei! Wei!

118
00:06:16,130 --> 00:06:16,940
Wei! Wei!

119
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,080
Wei.

120
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,520
During the dinner party,

121
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,920
I'll give you a surprise.

122
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,560
What surprise?

123
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:26,830
You'll know when the time comes.

124
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,540
Wei! Wei, come here!

125
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,050
Wish you be happy and prosperous!

126
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:32,310
Today,

127
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,610
the reunion dinner is my treat.

128
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:35,980
Help yourself!

129
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Sure!

130
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:38,300
Dig in! Have fun!

131
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,260
Whether or not

132
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,240
you made big money in the last year doesn't matter.

133
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:44,970
Now a new year is about to begin.

134
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:47,180
Having fun is the most important thing!

135
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,550
Dig in! Chug it!

136
00:07:49,530 --> 00:07:50,530
Come on, Ms. Zhou.

137
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,270
Come here.

138
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:53,210
Ms. Zhou, Happy Chinese New Year!

139
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:56,380
Wish you all the best!

140
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,510
Happy Chinese New Year!

141
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,130
Ms. Zhou must've spent a fortune on this!

142
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:06,860
There's braised pork and fish!

143
00:08:07,850 --> 00:08:08,680
Ms. Zhou's

144
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:11,000
tough exterior hides a soft heart.

145
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,710
She feels sorry for us since we can't go home for this festival.

146
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:13,290
Yeah.

147
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,420
Are you feeling homesick?

148
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,370
I miss my mother and my little sister,

149
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,250
plus Dahuang,

150
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:22,750
the dog I grew up with.

151
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,670
Happy Chinese New Year!

152
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,930
Let's work harder in the new year.

153
00:08:25,930 --> 00:08:27,710
We'll make more money for our families.

154
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,310
Absolutely!

155
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,940
Come on.

156
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,540
Auntie!

157
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:32,789
Eat some more!

158
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,620
Fengju, come with me.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,760
There are big crabs. Come on! Eat the crabs!

160
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,700
Listen, everyone!

161
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Alright. Let me say a few words!

162
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,550
Isn't she beautiful?

163
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,090
This is my niece, Fengju.

164
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:50,670
Happy Chinese New Year!

165
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,410
Happy Chinese New Year!

166
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:52,470
What a pretty girl!

167
00:08:53,190 --> 00:08:53,780
Fengju,

168
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,940
this is Wei Ruolai, who I told you about.

169
00:08:56,970 --> 00:08:58,780
He works in the Central Bank.

170
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,790
Ruolai.

171
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:03,430
Scootch over, you!

172
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:03,870
Okay!

173
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:04,690
Go over there!

174
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:07,540
Fengju, sit down. Sit next to Wei.

175
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,040
Thanks.

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,750
Ms. Zhou, what is this about?

177
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,920
Didn't I tell you?

178
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,820
Surprise.

179
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:14,570
This is the surprise I got you!

180
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:17,450
Sit here. Sit!

181
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:19,630
Fengju...

182
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:22,510
She works in a foreign firm.

183
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,060
You two have a lot in common.

184
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:25,910
A single lady, and a single man

185
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,760
make a couple!

186
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:29,720
Fengju,

187
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,060
in your spare time,

188
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,400
try going out with Ruolai.

189
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:34,460
You need to spend some time together.

190
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,990
You can go to the movies, have coffee,

191
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,230
or dine together.

192
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:39,670
Wei! Wei!

193
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:41,830
Why don't you talk to Fengju?

194
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,310
Ms. Zhou.

195
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,840
Eat some more!

196
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:45,900
I haven't proposed a toast to you yet!

197
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:47,820
Have a nice chat!

198
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,980
Come on!

199
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:54,710
Make a toast!

200
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,590
Ruolai,

201
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,580
do you plan to buy a house?

202
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,630
No.

203
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,830
Why not?

204
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,790
I-I can't afford a house.

205
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,830
I've heard

206
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:10,110
that the Central Bank employees have high salaries.

207
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,740
A regular clerk

208
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:13,900
at least earns over 10 silver dollars a month, right?

209
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:15,990
Plus, there would be

210
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,500
year-end bonuses and subsidies.

211
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:19,710
Right.

212
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,930
Let's have a drink!

213
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:22,910
I do make a decent income,

214
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:25,290
but I've sent every paycheck home.

215
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,010
You let your parents manage your money?

216
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:28,690
Yes.

217
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,990
You're a good son.

218
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,500
It's what I should do.

219
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:37,960
Do you have other family members

220
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,360
other than your parents?

221
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,360
I have a fiancee.

222
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,480
Our families got us engaged when we were little.

223
00:10:47,630 --> 00:10:49,560
She's my neighbor, so we're close.

224
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,680
You're a young man living in a new era.

225
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:57,050
Do you still approve of arranged marriages?

226
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,650
No.

227
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,560
But my fiancee is very nice.

228
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:00,700
She's been helping

229
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,560
to take care of my parents at home.

230
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,920
So I feel like I owe her a huge favor.

231
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,240
I must pay it back.

232
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:10,070
You can make it up to her financially.

233
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:11,150
Yes. That's right.

234
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,280
I'm planning to

235
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:15,370
give her all I can earn in the first 30 years of my career.

236
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:19,700
Wen, have some crabs.

237
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,120
Happy Chinese New Year!

238
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:26,930
We've gotta have a drink!

239
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:27,930
Come on. Cheers!

240
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,590
Cover up for me.

241
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,570
I need to go to Mr. Shen's.

242
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,410
Off you go!

243
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,370
But...

244
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,030
Ruolai!

245
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,810
Ruolai!

246
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,990
Who are you?

247
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,000
You're Fengju, right?

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,670
Happy Chinese New Year!

249
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:41,030
Ruolai!

250
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:41,990
Eat something!

251
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,850
I'm not hungry.

252
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,730
Let me tell you something.

253
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:46,660
Wei is a nice guy.

254
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:48,510
He's all kind and upright,

255
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:51,140
with only a tiny foible.

256
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:52,630
What is it?

257
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,110
When he's drunk,

258
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:55,400
he tends to beat women.

259
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,920
Eat some more!

260
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:05,290
Fengju! Fengju! Fengju!

261
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:06,440
Where are you going?

262
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,060
What's wrong?

263
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,830
What kind of person have you introduced to me?

264
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,590
Wei's quite nice, isn't he?

265
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:17,050
You shouldn't be picky at this age.

266
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:18,260
Haven't I told you?

267
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:19,570
Wei works in the Central Bank...

268
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,640
Auntie, let's change the subject.

269
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,190
The problem isn't if he's a good fit for me.

270
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,030
A marriage was arranged for him when he was little.

271
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,990
Do you know that?

272
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,680
How can I be a third wheel?

273
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:33,230
An arranged marriage?

274
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,720
How is that possible?

275
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
Who is it?

276
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,620
Meijuan!

277
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:10,430
It's time you went on the stage.

278
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,030
Mr. Tang from Hengtong Firm

279
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,260
has written us a big fat check.

280
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,870
He just wants you to sing a song!

281
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,070
I'm having my period.

282
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,830
I feel sore and painful. I can't sing today!

283
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,240
Please just get over with it.

284
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:22,190
It's the Chinese New Year.

285
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:23,830
He has rented the whole place.

286
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:25,710
We can't just turn him down, right?

287
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,590
If you don't come out,

288
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,090
they might start a riot here!

289
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:28,870
Whatever!

290
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,230
How is it relevant to me?

291
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,090
Anyway, today,

292
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:31,950
I'm not gonna sing.

293
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:32,480
I dare him

294
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,690
to smash the whole place!

295
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,350
Song Meijuan!

296
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,900
You think you've earned the right to be defiant?

297
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,160
What's wrong with you?

298
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,170
She does have the right to be defiant.

299
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,240
Go and tell Mr. Tang

300
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:43,360
that Song Meijuan's not available today.

301
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,020
If he wants, I can sing for him.

302
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,950
I got it. You're hurting me!

303
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,880
What brought you here?

304
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,110
Are you still angry?

305
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,470
It's the Chinese New Year.

306
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:32,490
I came here to see you.

307
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,830
Why is your room so cold?

308
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,840
Is the heater broken?

309
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:42,250
The boiler workers have gone home for the Spring Festival.

310
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,510
They won't be back until after a few days.

311
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,290
How come your hands are so cold?

312
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,510
I'm fine.

313
00:14:53,530 --> 00:14:55,190
I have a great frostbite cure.

314
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,390
My hands are cold!

315
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
I'm not even afraid of death.

316
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,070
Would coldness bother me?

317
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,920
Your hands will be warm soon.

318
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:14,580
Do you wanna play fireworks later?

319
00:15:17,070 --> 00:15:17,830
No.

320
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,600
Then what do you wanna do?

321
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,400
I wanna stay with you

322
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:23,990
in the room together.

323
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,300
Close your eyes.

324
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,660
What are you doing?

325
00:15:38,070 --> 00:15:38,830
Keep quiet.

326
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:01,740
Do you like it?

327
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,230
For what it's worth, this year's over.

328
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,430
In the upcoming year,

329
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,640
try not to cause new trouble to me.

330
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,780
I don't wanna hunt for anyone anymore.

331
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,190
You're a better masseuse than your older brother.

332
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,490
He once gave me a bone-setting treatment.

333
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,660
I nearly became paralyzed.

334
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:49,730
Do you think I'll be able to find him?

335
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,380
I'm still helping you look for him.

336
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:01,450
Earlier on, I frequently dreamed about him.

337
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:04,349
When I woke up, I started

338
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,530
thinking maybe he had been long dead.

339
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,730
Don't talk nonsense.

340
00:17:13,569 --> 00:17:15,770
A new year has begun. Why the crazy talk?

341
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,150
These are the exact moments

342
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,220
when I think of him.

343
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,290
In childhood, during every Spring Festival,

344
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,490
I would ride on my brother's shoulders,

345
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,790
paying visits to

346
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,800
friends and relatives.

347
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,030
My brother

348
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,140
is the only family I have

349
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,100
in this world.

350
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,560
I assure you

351
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,350
that I'll find him.

352
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:54,110
When your brother and I were on the Northern Expedition,

353
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:54,850
he and I both

354
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:56,600
escaped from the jaws of death.

355
00:17:56,710 --> 00:17:57,800
Later, he said

356
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,530
he had a mission to do.

357
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:01,880
I've never heard from him since then.

358
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:05,580
Let's suppose he's still alive.

359
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,580
Even if he can't find me,

360
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:12,240
he would try to contact you,

361
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:13,860
wouldn't he?

362
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:17,530
Maybe

363
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,990
something's holding him back.

364
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,270
Get rid of those foolish ideas.

365
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,910
As long as your brother is alive,

366
00:18:32,910 --> 00:18:34,170
even if he is in Europe,

367
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,050
I'll go and rescue him.

368
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,760
Never lose hope as long as you're breathing.

369
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,050
Alright.

370
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,200
It's a joyful occasion.

371
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:54,980
You need to cheer up.

372
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:01,630
Sir!

373
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:03,910
Sir!

374
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,270
Sir!

375
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,110
Go.

376
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,700
Sir!

377
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,550
Sir!

378
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:14,270
At this time of the year,

379
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:16,250
he'd better have something important to tell me.

380
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:16,810
Sir!

381
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:18,280
Sir!

382
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,370
What now?

383
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:23,810
We've caught the man who's suspected of robbing Zhang Mingquan.

384
00:19:23,830 --> 00:19:24,490
Where is he?

385
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:25,620
In a watchmaker's shop.

386
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:28,580
♫Good bunnies♫

387
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,830
♫Open the door♫

388
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,880
♫Do not come back♫

389
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,290
Sweet and sour pork ribs.

390
00:19:35,290 --> 00:19:37,140
Braised fish.

391
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,870
Chicken soup.

392
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,670
And fried shrimps.

393
00:19:40,690 --> 00:19:42,110
The main dish is a roast duck with eight fillings.

394
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:44,700
Your brother has brought his A-game.

395
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:47,120
I don't like Dad's cooking.

396
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,440
Your dad is a great cook.

397
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,590
Why don't you like his cooking?

398
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:50,750
It's too salty.

399
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:54,550
That's my fault.

400
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:55,950
I'm terribly sorry.

401
00:19:56,550 --> 00:19:58,780
When your dad and I studied in Germany,

402
00:19:58,820 --> 00:19:59,620
I got hungry

403
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,070
so I made him cook for me.

404
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,860
I enjoyed strong flavors,

405
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,760
which influenced his cooking style a bit.

406
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,020
But don't you worry about it.

407
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:06,630
Later,

408
00:20:06,650 --> 00:20:07,980
I'll tell your dad

409
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,870
to put less salt in the food, okay?

410
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,240
I remember there was a time

411
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,550
when your brother cooked for me.

412
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:15,750
We were still

413
00:20:15,770 --> 00:20:16,740
dating at that time.

414
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,730
In spite of all the hard work he did,

415
00:20:18,950 --> 00:20:20,430
the rice was burned,

416
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
and the kitchen was nearly blown up.

417
00:20:22,990 --> 00:20:24,680
And you still married him after that?

418
00:20:24,680 --> 00:20:26,740
If I were you, I would've ditched him.

419
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,950
Mom, why did you marry Dad?

420
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,250
Your dad and I

421
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:39,030
knew each other when we were kids.

422
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:40,990
Our families have been friends for generations.

423
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:42,150
So, when I was little,

424
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,830
my parents had us get engaged.

425
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,450
Later on, my father had a failed investment.

426
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,070
My mother

427
00:20:47,110 --> 00:20:49,040
wanted me to marry your dad sooner.

428
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:50,980
But your dad disagreed.

429
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
He insisted on

430
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,550
going to Germany

431
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,590
for education.

432
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,050
He wanted me to go with him.

433
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,030
But at that time, I thought

434
00:20:58,050 --> 00:20:59,780
he just didn't want to marry me,

435
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,980
so I

436
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,540
broke off the engagement.

437
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,230
And then?

438
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,510
Then...

439
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,950
Then I had a big fight with my mother,

440
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:08,230
and ran away from home.

441
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:10,140
I came to Shanghai alone to make a living.

442
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,910
I did many different jobs.

443
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,960
I was once an actress,

444
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:16,430
though I never played the lead.

445
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,470
Your mom

446
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,930
was an amazing actress.

447
00:21:20,150 --> 00:21:21,810
If it hadn't been for your dad,

448
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,680
she would've become a superstar.

449
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,480
I want to be a superstar.

450
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,630
Then you've gotta work extra hard.

451
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:31,810
One year, I was working as a waitress

452
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:34,310
at a firework party.

453
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,270
At that time,

454
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:38,170
your father came to me,

455
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,800
with a stern look on his face.

456
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,520
Miss Su.

457
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:49,410
Excuse me.

458
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,180
Thank you.

459
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:57,350
Miss Su,

460
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,290
I understand that you're eager for freedom.

461
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,080
But our families have been friends for generations.

462
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:03,770
What's more, we already

463
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:05,470
got engaged when we were little.

464
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,440
In my opinion,

465
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:08,780
breaking off the engagement without discussion

466
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,840
is a highly irresponsible behavior.

467
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,230
For that matter,

468
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,960
I strongly protest against and condemn your act.

469
00:22:15,270 --> 00:22:16,400
What happened then?

470
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:17,590
After that,

471
00:22:18,030 --> 00:22:19,890
your dad and I got into a big fight.

472
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,030
Our meeting ended in a sour note.

473
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:22,700
However, from then on,

474
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:25,310
I kept running into your dad

475
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,600
in various occasions.

476
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:28,050
He'd always

477
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:29,900
come up and talk to me.

478
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,500
Gradually,

479
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:33,370
I stopped being mad at him.

480
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,160
I remember,

481
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,570
at the firework party on another Chinese New Year's Eve...

482
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:40,870
Miss Su,

483
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,780
can I trouble you for a favor?

484
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,040
I'm going to work in Nanjing.

485
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:47,700
As you know, I am

486
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:49,420
terrible at taking care of myself.

487
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,150
I can barely look after myself.

488
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:51,900
So,

489
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,270
would you say our engagement is still valid?

490
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,460
Cishu,

491
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:00,940
I actually fell in love with you when I was young.

492
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,770
I went abroad

493
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:05,790
in preparation for a promising future

494
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:09,080
where I'd be able to build a comfortable life for you.

495
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,700
I hope to

496
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,150
spend the rest of my life with you.

497
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:48,240
Therefore,

498
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,980
I'm so blessed to have met your dad.

499
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:53,780
I also hope that when you grow up,

500
00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:55,990
you'll be as happy as I am.

501
00:23:56,430 --> 00:23:57,510
I got it!

502
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,760
More food's on the way!

503
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:01,780
Here.

504
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:06,230
What's with you?

505
00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:08,230
You're setting a bad example for Yu.

506
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:10,170
Auntie, you're naughty.

507
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,470
You'll have to kneel in the ancestral hall later.

508
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:13,800
It's not the scary part.

509
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:15,600
The worst is that your dad's

510
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:16,710
gonna nag and nag.

511
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,940
It can drive me crazy!

512
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,310
Come with me to wash your hands.

513
00:24:20,310 --> 00:24:20,950
Hold on.

514
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:22,600
I'm waiting for a guest.

515
00:24:23,190 --> 00:24:23,720
Who is it?

516
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:24,460
Mr. Shen!

517
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,860
Mr. Wei has arrived.

518
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,100
Mrs. Shen, Happy Chinese New Year!

519
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,430
Happy Chinese New Year.

520
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,190
Speak of the devil!

521
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:32,990
Is there a present for me?

522
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,150
What did I tell you?

523
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:35,110
Do I get to have a present?

524
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:36,510
Come on. Meet my little girl.

525
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:38,090
-This is Yu, my daughter.
-Why don't you go say hi?

526
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:39,490
Here's a present for you.

527
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:40,550
Shen Jinzhen?

528
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,040
Try not to make it so obvious.

529
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:44,840
Open the present. Do you like it?

530
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:46,830
-It's a doll! Thank you!
-Don't spill out my secret.

531
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:47,820
Or I'll hate you!

532
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,670
You've got a present for the new year!

533
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:57,010
Mr. Xu is indeed a wonderful tailor.

534
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:57,930
Come with me.

535
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:00,630
Happy Chinese New Year.

536
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:01,700
Happy Chinese New Year.

537
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:02,380
Sit here.

538
00:25:03,430 --> 00:25:05,290
Shouldn't it be Miss Shen's seat?

539
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:08,700
Just sit down.

540
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,070
I'm taking Yu to wash her hands.

541
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:17,740
Nice suit.

542
00:25:18,430 --> 00:25:19,110
Thank you.

543
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,960
Sir, it's him.

544
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,040
He took Zhang Mingquan's watch here, trying to sell it.

545
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,070
I picked it up somewhere!

546
00:25:28,070 --> 00:25:29,670
I-I didn't steal it!

547
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:34,100
Where exactly did you find it?

548
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,420
A trash can

549
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,090
near the New Show Club.

550
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,420
That night,

551
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,680
I saw a young man throw it away.

552
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,460
Do you remember what he looked like?

553
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,440
It's too dark. I didn't catch a clear look.

554
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:48,720
But when he left,

555
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:51,490
the person who greeted him...

556
00:26:18,030 --> 00:26:20,670
I-I-I...

557
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:21,580
Who was it?

558
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,700
I...

559
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,840
Are you gonna say it or not?

560
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,070
You wanna keep us in suspense?

561
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:30,470
Say it!

562
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:31,680
I'll say it!

563
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:35,290
Who was it?

564
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:37,090
It's Mr. Qian.

565
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,550
Mr. Qian from the Axe Gang?

566
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:39,230
Yes.

567
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,310
You mean Qian Shaoliang?

568
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:40,990
Yes.

569
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,370
After

570
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:44,720
exchanging a few words,

571
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:47,250
that young man got in Mr. Qian's car and left.

572
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:58,920
Sir,

573
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,900
this case is in the charge of Mr. Kang.

574
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,740
Shall we...

575
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:10,480
Give Qian Shaoliang a call.

576
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:12,550
He'd better give us an explanation.

577
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:13,350
Take him away.

578
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:18,350
I already told the truth!

579
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,260
I already told the truth!

580
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,270
I already told the truth!

581
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:24,960
Come on.

582
00:27:24,990 --> 00:27:25,990
Raise our glasses!

583
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:26,720
Here it goes.

584
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,650
It's the beginning of a new year.

585
00:27:28,650 --> 00:27:29,350
Everything's taking on a new look.

586
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,310
I wish all of us

587
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:30,950
a Happy Chinese New Year.

588
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,160
May all our dreams come true!

589
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,270
Happy Chinese New Year!

590
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,750
Happy Chinese New Year!

591
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:36,400
Cheers!

592
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:37,360
Cheers!

593
00:27:41,170 --> 00:27:41,890
Dig in, Ruolai.

594
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:43,150
Auntie's gonna get you

595
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:46,110
-a piece of your favorite sour and sweet pork ribs.
-Ruolai, help yourself.

596
00:27:46,110 --> 00:27:46,790
Thank you.

597
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:50,660
Thank you.

598
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,740
Yu, you're such a good girl.

599
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:54,840
Dad, didn't you tell me?

600
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,080
Reciprocity

601
00:27:56,230 --> 00:27:57,320
is a virtue.

602
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:58,640
That's right.

603
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,710
I put food in your bowl,

604
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,820
but you put food in his bowl in return.

605
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:04,580
How is that reciprocity?

606
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,040
But you and Mr. Wei are gonna be a couple!

607
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,070
Kiddo, don't talk nonsense!

608
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:11,330
Who am I coupling with?

609
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,870
This gentleman right here!

610
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,550
Who said that?

611
00:28:14,630 --> 00:28:15,680
My mom!

612
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:17,580
When did I say that?

613
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,760
You're making it up!

614
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:20,580
You said it a moment ago.

615
00:28:20,620 --> 00:28:22,880
When you were bringing out food from the kitchen,

616
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,670
I heard you saying to Dad,

617
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:25,630
"This man seems nice.

618
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:26,680
Train him for two more years,

619
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,150
and he'll probably be good enough for Jinzhen."

620
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:29,910
Yu,

621
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,600
you've spilled out everything

622
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,210
Mom and Dad said in private!

623
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,510
Sister-in-law!

624
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,910
Your sister-in-law just thinks

625
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,400
you're at the proper age to get married.

626
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,490
Don't even bother to explain.

627
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,930
I've got used to this.

628
00:28:40,110 --> 00:28:41,380
As soon as

629
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:42,290
you two see a man

630
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:44,900
in Shanghai, you can't wait to fix me up with him.

631
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:45,980
Hey, Ruolai.

632
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,590
Let me make a toast to you.

633
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:48,680
Happy Chinese New Year.

634
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,670
Happy Chinese New Year, Mrs. Shen.

635
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,260
Fine.

636
00:28:50,570 --> 00:28:51,970
This is a happy occasion.

637
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,350
I'll give you

638
00:28:53,430 --> 00:28:54,590
the satisfaction.

639
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:56,210
Come on.

640
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,500
The husband that Yu has arranged for me.

641
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,550
My brother did the cooking himself.

642
00:28:59,550 --> 00:29:00,870
Mr. Wei, eat it!

643
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,860
It's a sweet and sour pork rib.

644
00:29:03,050 --> 00:29:04,250
Thank you, Miss Shen.

645
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,840
Bottoms up!

646
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,630
You didn't have many drinks.

647
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,440
What's wrong?

648
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,690
Your face's all blushed.

649
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:14,320
Dig in!

650
00:29:14,350 --> 00:29:15,600
Sorry. That was ridiculous.

651
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
No worries.

652
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,530
Down it!

653
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,750
Wei Ruolai?

654
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:22,970
Are you sure?

655
00:29:23,090 --> 00:29:23,670
Yes.

656
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:24,910
I’ve confirmed it on the phone

657
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,110
with Qian Shaoliang.

658
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:26,820
It’s him.

659
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:32,680
He's just a tiny bank clerk.

660
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:36,340
How did he have the guts to commit a robbery?

661
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:40,710
Are the employees of the Central Bank underpaid?

662
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,710
Money wasn't his target.

663
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:43,510
The gun was.

664
00:29:44,180 --> 00:29:44,710
I suspect

665
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:45,850
that the man who assassinated Li Shengda

666
00:29:45,850 --> 00:29:46,380
was him.

667
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,810
He had the time and motive.

668
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,920
8 Bam.

669
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,480
Captain Lin.

670
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,290
Congratulations.

671
00:30:03,910 --> 00:30:05,970
You're about to achieve something great.

672
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:07,100
Why would you say so?

673
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:11,930
Wei Ruolai

674
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,980
is Shen Tunan's assistant.

675
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,430
Despite other people's opposition,

676
00:30:16,430 --> 00:30:18,210
Shen Tunan hired him to work in the Central Bank.

677
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,040
A few days ago,

678
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:21,980
during the voting about the tariff management right,

679
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,840
this young man gave a speech on Shen Tunan's behalf.

680
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,550
There's a deep meaning to this matter.

681
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,900
You wanna shake up Shen Tunan

682
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,300
by attacking Wei Ruolai?

683
00:30:35,450 --> 00:30:36,580
Where is Wei Ruolai?

684
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,470
My people went to his place,

685
00:30:38,860 --> 00:30:40,730
and found out that he had gone to Shen Tunan's house.

686
00:30:40,730 --> 00:30:41,530
Shall we

687
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,960
arrest him after his visit is over?

688
00:30:46,370 --> 00:30:47,230
No need to wait.

689
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:52,350
Arrest him in the Shen Tunan's house.

690
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:55,290
Turn it into a circus.

691
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,920
Make a high-profile arrest.

692
00:30:59,060 --> 00:30:59,720
Got it!

693
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:01,720
9 Dots.

694
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,590
I won!

695
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:05,670
You won again.

696
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,150
You won again?

697
00:31:07,350 --> 00:31:08,190
Why is it always you?

698
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:09,150
What can I do about it?

699
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:10,630
I'm very lucky!

700
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:13,070
Today you're having great luck!

701
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,140
Go on with it!

702
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:18,560
Mr. Yu,

703
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,370
Happy Chinese New Year, though it's a bit early.

704
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:24,170
I've prepared a great present

705
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,170
for you.

706
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:27,190
Yes!

707
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,550
Back in Germany,

708
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,370
when it's time to prepare dinner on Chinese New Year's Eve,

709
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,520
it's always me who did everything,

710
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,530
while someone

711
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,380
busied in nothing but eating.

712
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,130
Where does that come from?

713
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,590
Didn't I wash the dishes and cleaned the table?

714
00:31:51,590 --> 00:31:53,220
I checked out the dishes you washed.

715
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,660
They were all sticky and oily.

716
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,600
Don't say that.

717
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,230
Jinzhen is wonderful girl.

718
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:58,950
She's also very diligent.

719
00:31:59,140 --> 00:32:00,830
She's adored by a lot of people

720
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,140
in the arsenal.

721
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:04,670
Plus, among all the ladies in Shanghai,

722
00:32:04,670 --> 00:32:06,540
my auntie's the prettiest!

723
00:32:06,570 --> 00:32:07,900
She plays piano too!

724
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,050
She has held concerts before!

725
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,360
What do you think?

726
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,570
Don't you feel like

727
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,070
you're in Yong'an Department Store

728
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:20,300
when it's having a big sale

729
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,900
during the Chinese New Year?

730
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:24,330
I don't feel it that way.

731
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:25,240
I really think

732
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:26,410
you're talented and brilliant.

733
00:32:26,410 --> 00:32:27,750
Are you just flattering her?

734
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:28,610
No. No.

735
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,160
Sir, I'm telling the truth.

736
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,350
I guess most of the girls

737
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,060
who study abroad would usually

738
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,660
major in literature or art.

739
00:32:35,910 --> 00:32:38,080
But Miss Shen chose to study war industry.

740
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,960
That's what I find admirable.

741
00:32:40,270 --> 00:32:41,260
It happened because of me.

742
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,380
I told her...

743
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:43,590
Alright. Stop it.

744
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:44,570
I can't agree more

745
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:45,680
with what Ruolai said.

746
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,120
Jinzhen has been

747
00:32:47,790 --> 00:32:49,230
influenced by you.

748
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,720
She'd like to devote herself to the country.

749
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,350
In Shanghai,

750
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,720
there are so many socialites,

751
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,150
but none of them are like her.

752
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,030
She's unique.

753
00:32:56,230 --> 00:32:56,980
In the whole country,

754
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,640
can anyone be parallel to her?

755
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:00,520
No one!

756
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,790
Cut it out!

757
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,440
Miss Shen,

758
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:05,500
I'd like to make a toast to you.

759
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:06,160
For what?

760
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:08,470
Mr. Shen works in the finance industry,

761
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,740
while you focus on guns and ammunition.

762
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,000
You're both dedicating yourselves to the country,

763
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,780
and striving to meet the same goal.

764
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,580
Well said.

765
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,910
Wait.

766
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,500
That's nicely phrased.

767
00:33:17,610 --> 00:33:18,090
Come on.

768
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,500
Let me propose a toast.

769
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:20,500
I wish our country

770
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:22,090
will no longer be weak

771
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:23,600
and weary,

772
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,080
and will soon resume

773
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,350
its top position in the world!

774
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,630
Resume its top position in the world!

775
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:43,510
Take it.

776
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:44,610
Sir.

777
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,000
Are you missing home?

778
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:48,530
A little.

779
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,320
I know how it feels.

780
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,640
Back then in Germany,

781
00:33:57,870 --> 00:33:58,890
when I couldn't sleep on the eve of Chinese New Year,

782
00:33:58,890 --> 00:34:00,440
I'd tell my roommates

783
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:02,110
that it's a tradition to stay up in that special occasion.

784
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,040
But in fact,

785
00:34:03,390 --> 00:34:04,250
I just got so homesick

786
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:05,510
that I couldn't sleep.

787
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,520
You were far away from your motherland.

788
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,590
I bet your homesickness

789
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,050
was way severer than mine.

790
00:34:13,469 --> 00:34:15,030
At that time, I made up my mind

791
00:34:15,030 --> 00:34:16,120
to come back here

792
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,380
after I finished my studies.

793
00:34:18,550 --> 00:34:20,010
I vowed to help our country

794
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:21,630
grow stronger,

795
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,270
and relieve it from the bullying and contempt

796
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,199
of imperialism,

797
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,159
so that our next generation

798
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:30,070
won't have to leave their motherland to study abroad.

799
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:31,790
Instead, the children in those powerful countries

800
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:33,360
would come and study in China.

801
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,710
In terms of foreign relations,

802
00:34:34,710 --> 00:34:35,810
I hope our country's diplomatic representatives

803
00:34:35,810 --> 00:34:37,610
can stick to their contentions.

804
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:39,080
About economy,

805
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,330
I hope our country's products

806
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,870
can be exported to every part of the world.

807
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,190
I long for the day when we become one of the world's biggest economies.

808
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:46,250
I hope our country,

809
00:34:47,330 --> 00:34:48,270
and our government,

810
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:49,350
will no longer indulge or tolerate

811
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,550
the corrupted officials and the privileged class.

812
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:52,980
When these dreams come true,

813
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,860
every Chinese man and woman

814
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:55,679
will be proud of their homeland.

815
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:57,690
It'll happen one day, Sir.

816
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,880
Let's work hard for it.

817
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,120
Fireworks!

818
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:06,030
Come on. Let me lift you up.

819
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:07,310
Happy Chinese New Year!

820
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,640
Happy Chinese New Year!

821
00:35:08,990 --> 00:35:11,590
Happy Chinese New Year!

822
00:35:12,590 --> 00:35:13,590
Make a wish now!

823
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:14,230
Make a wish, Yu.

824
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:14,670
Okay!

825
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:17,330
I hope

826
00:35:17,350 --> 00:35:19,190
Auntie will be as happy as I am

827
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,910
every day in the future.

828
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:23,000
I'm deeply moved.

829
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:25,540
I feel like my love for you has been responded!

830
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,400
You should make a wish too.

831
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:28,510
Okay.

832
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:31,510
I hope

833
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,900
the arsenal will be soon shut down,

834
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,100
and there won't be war again.

835
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,630
The future should be like the scene in Shanghai tonight!

836
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:42,830
You'll be out of work if the arsenal is closed down.

837
00:35:42,830 --> 00:35:45,730
I've wanted to say goodbye to that job for a long time.

838
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:46,530
The two of you,

839
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:47,790
go and eat some glutinous rice balls.

840
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:48,770
Okay. Time for some glutinous rice balls.

841
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:50,740
Let's have some glutinous rice balls!

842
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,200
She's gonna be out of work!

843
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,130
What wish did you make?

844
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:07,720
Tell me about it.

845
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,160
I hope

846
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,090
the country won't be stricken by war again.

847
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,690
I hope everyone can be happy.

848
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,380
I hope everything Mr. Shen does will be a success,

849
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:20,910
and that he'll achieve his aspirations soon.

850
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,100
Happy Chinese New Year.

851
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:55,830
Biao,

852
00:36:57,900 --> 00:36:59,420
when we nail this case,

853
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,560
we'll be one step closer to Nanjing.

854
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,260
Mr. Shen,

855
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:25,620
Happy Chinese New Year.

856
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,670
Now it's the eve of it.

857
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,870
Captain, it's too early to wish me a Happy Chinese New Year.

858
00:37:29,870 --> 00:37:31,220
For the safety of your residence,

859
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,770
and to ensure you and your family

860
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,900
will have a Happy Chinese New Year,

861
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,980
I have to be here.

862
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:36,330
Just cut to the chase.

863
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:39,130
Can we have a word in private?

864
00:37:39,160 --> 00:37:39,680
No need.

865
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm a man of integrity.

866
00:37:40,990 --> 00:37:43,390
There's nothing I need to hide from others.

867
00:37:44,290 --> 00:37:45,690
Then I'll level with you.

868
00:37:46,180 --> 00:37:48,980
Previously, an informant of mine named Li Shengda

869
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,330
was assassinated.

870
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,660
Coincidentally,

871
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:52,720
Zhang Mingquan came and reported a crime,

872
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,520
saying that his gun was taken away at the New Show Club.

873
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,920
We found an eyewitness.

874
00:37:57,340 --> 00:37:58,940
This eyewitness identified

875
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:00,480
the robber

876
00:38:00,500 --> 00:38:02,100
as your personal assistant,

877
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:03,160
Wei Ruolai.

878
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:10,620
Captain Lin,

879
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:12,750
would you mind telling me

880
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,370
who this eyewitness is?

881
00:38:14,370 --> 00:38:15,430
It's an old beggar.

882
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:18,270
He said after you robbed Zhang Mingquan,

883
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:20,200
you threw his wallet and pocket watch

884
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,480
into a trash can.

885
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,850
He happened to see all that.

886
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:24,890
So you think you can arrest me

887
00:38:24,910 --> 00:38:25,630
based on a beggar's statement?

888
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:26,710
We're from the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

889
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:28,550
We wouldn't come find you without proof.

890
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:30,880
More importantly, Mr. Shen is right here.

891
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,490
I wouldn't dare to make a wrong arrest.

892
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:33,670
After we got the beggar's statement,

893
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:34,270
we examined

894
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:37,200
the fingerprints on the wallet and the pocket watch.

895
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:39,130
We found a perfect match to those

896
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,490
you left on the letter of confession.

897
00:38:41,490 --> 00:38:42,840
You don't have to take the witness's word.

898
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,040
But the fingerprints

899
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:46,560
are no doubt qualified to be legal evidence.

900
00:38:50,290 --> 00:38:52,550
Fingerprints can be forged, can't they?

901
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,370
Mr. Shen,

902
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,200
we've sent people

903
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:57,080
to search Wei Ruolai's home.

904
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:57,910
Care to guess

905
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,880
what we found?

906
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:00,490
What did you find?

907
00:39:00,490 --> 00:39:00,980
A gun.

908
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:01,950
It's Zhang Mingquan's gun.

909
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:02,770
Are his fingerprints on the gun?

910
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:03,310
Yes.

911
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,900
Say it. Give him an explanation.

912
00:39:12,290 --> 00:39:12,970
It's true.

913
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:14,790
I did rob Zhang Mingquan of his gun,

914
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,390
but I didn't kill Li Shengda.

915
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,160
After I gave Li the seal and key,

916
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:19,620
I've never seen him again.

917
00:39:19,670 --> 00:39:20,670
An interrogation

918
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:22,000
will help us find out the truth.

919
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:22,710
Well, Mr. Shen...

920
00:39:22,710 --> 00:39:23,490
What gives you the right to arrest him?

921
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,190
Shut up.

922
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:27,440
Mr. Shen, can I

923
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,220
arrest him or not?

924
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:33,530
You can.

925
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,030
Please.

926
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,350
Sorry for the intrusion, Mr. Shen.

927
00:39:45,350 --> 00:39:45,900
Your coat.

928
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:47,230
Happy Chinese New Year.

929
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,450
Tunan,

930
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,760
Wei Ruolai doesn't seem to be a killer.

931
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,960
Then why did he rob Zhang of his gun?

932
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,770
If he's cornered,

933
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,430
will he do some crazy stuff?

934
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:08,160
He sure will.

935
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:10,600
Political influence aside,

936
00:40:10,630 --> 00:40:13,630
assassination is the most cost-effective solution.

937
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,840
Then I'll apply for a gun.

938
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:15,450
No.

939
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,950
You are my assistant,

940
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:19,240
not my bodyguard.

941
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,530
You just do your job.

942
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:22,190
Yes.

943
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,720
Wei Ruolai is your assistant.

944
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,290
If he's incriminated,

945
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,410
I'm afraid

946
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,030
you'll become collateral damage.

947
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:37,150
I know.

948
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:38,900
I can make this gun robbery thing go away.

949
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,300
But if he did kill someone

950
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:44,180
who worked as an informant for the Investigation and Arrest Unit,

951
00:40:45,470 --> 00:40:46,530
no one can help him.

952
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,090
Tell me.

953
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,270
Why did you kill Li Shengda?

954
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,640
Where is the gold that was placed in the box?

955
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:17,790
Spill it!

956
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,820
Confess before it's too late!

957
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,240
Wenbiao.

958
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:35,640
Captain Lin.

959
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,120
Sir.

960
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:45,620
Torture him.

961
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,860
Does my order mean nothing to you?

962
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:52,850
Da Li!

963
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:53,830
Yes!

964
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:55,510
Go!

965
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:02,520
Which protocol?

966
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,510
The third one.

967
00:42:05,370 --> 00:42:07,200
Are you gonna say it or not?

968
00:42:07,710 --> 00:42:09,710
Tell the truth! Did you kill the man?

969
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:13,950
Are you gonna say it or not?

970
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:19,790
Sir,

971
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:21,740
you ordered to torture him right in the beginning.

972
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,540
It doesn't seem like your style.

973
00:42:24,620 --> 00:42:26,000
He works for Shen Tunan.

974
00:42:27,070 --> 00:42:28,530
Mr. Kang's breathing down my neck.

975
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:30,790
I need to show my stance by torturing him.

976
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,920
But if we go too rough on him

977
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,440
only to find out he's not the killer,

978
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:38,520
we can't give Shen Tunan

979
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,250
a reasonable explanation.

980
00:42:41,970 --> 00:42:43,070
How is he not the killer?

981
00:42:43,070 --> 00:42:44,440
He must've killed the man!

982
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,590
Whether he's the killer or not doesn't matter now.

983
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,190
Mr. Kang is using Wei Ruolai as a pawn

984
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:51,150
to fight against Shen Tunan.

985
00:42:51,350 --> 00:42:52,950
I might as well use Wei Ruolai

986
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,640
to find new clues about the communists.

987
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,650
No collision of interests.
