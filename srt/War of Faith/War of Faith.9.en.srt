Why did you get hit this time?

00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:04,280
Business.

6
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,740
Because of the Communist Party?

7
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,090
Why don't you quit?

8
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:16,650
You tire yourself out every day without getting any benefits.

9
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,400
Just quit.

10
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:18,460
I'll feed you.

11
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:21,310
You'll feed me?

12
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,860
I eat quite a lot.

13
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,829
It's just a matter of tricking some rich heirs.

14
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:29,090
It's not a big deal.

15
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:35,060
Are you taking me as a boy toy?

16
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:37,070
You've got guts.

17
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,640
I'm talking to you seriously.

If you don't work as an official,

there's still a possibility for us.

20
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,610
Resign.

21
00:02:57,530 --> 00:02:58,380
I'm serious.

22
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,290
I've saved some money these two years.

23
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,870
Even if we just run some small business,

24
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,270
we can still live nicely.

25
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:17,450
Don't be like this.

26
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,390
I told you

27
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,150
I can die anytime.

28
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,040
I also told you

29
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,750
I'm not doing this job

30

I don't come to you to be a rich official's wife either.

those financial bigwigs before.

79
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:34,780
I'm more familiar with their situation,

that starting today, the Treasury Department and the Central Bank

96

both appoint Special Advisor Shen Tunan

97
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:21,740
as the plenipotentiary

98
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,680
to lead the matter in taking back tariff autonomy

99
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:30,040
and decide whether it will be approved by a democratic vote.

100
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:33,710

Just read it.

110
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,860
Does Shen Tunan want to die?

111

How dare he provoke a tiger?

112
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,980
He's using Mr. Song's name.

113
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,750
This is an overt strategy.

114
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,440
It's obvious that they want to cut off our flow of wealth.

115
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,680
Exactly.

116
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,280
Back when Yuan Shikai

117
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,230
borrowed money from HSBC,

118
00:07:14,230 --> 00:07:15,710
Banque de l'Indochine and Yokohama Specie Bank,

119
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:17,230
he used the tariff management right

120
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,190
as a mortgage.

121
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:20,390
It's a huge deposit

122
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,780
with financial stability.

123
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,780
It's also the trump card

124
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,390
to control the government's finance.

125
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:26,770
Without this weapon,

126
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,750
the interests of all foreign traders

127
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,790
will be severely damaged.

128
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,430
He's just messing around.

129
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,530
Calm down.

130
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,240
Mr. Yu,

131
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,909
how can I calm down?

132
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,990
Shen Tunan already snatched the Imperial Bank.

133
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,470
It's thanks to you

134
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,270
that I'm working at HSBC now.

135
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:45,630
What I'm responsible for now

136
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:47,070
is borrowing money from the industries under your name

137
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:48,630
and other private banks.

138
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,750
I use the money from the tariffs.

139
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:52,390
If we don't have this,

140
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,590
we won't be able to survive.

141

Next,

What do you think about the tariff reform?

173

I support all of your decisions.

174

I didn't know before,

but after reading the report,

176
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:27,790
I realized that our country is so poor.

177
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,080
It's not just poor.

178
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,030
It's long been unable to make ends meet.

179
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,670
A war requires guns and ammunition.

180
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,580
Construction

181
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:36,830
requires oil, coal, steel, and cement.

182
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,910
We can't do anything without money.

183
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:41,030
This time,

184
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:42,680
we must have the control

185
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,630
of the tariffs in our own hands.

186
00:10:44,990 --> 00:10:45,830
For this,

187
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,490
even offending those with vested interests

188
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,950
or even infuriating the foreign powers

189
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:49,830
is worth it.

190
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,390
But true reform

191
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,130
requires bloodshed.

192

Are you afraid?

193
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:54,960
No.

194
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:56,280
My father said before

195
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,230
that even if the sky falls down,

196
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,270
the tall ones will hold it up.

197
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,230
Let me ask you.

198
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,960
If someone wanted to kill me

199
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,020
and shot a bullet suddenly

200
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,170
or put a bomb under the car,

201
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:06,930
would you be afraid of being implicated?

202
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:09,010
No.

203
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:11,870
If that really happened,

204
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,810
I hope you could give me some

205
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:13,590
compensation fee

206
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,860
and mail it to my father.

207
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,660
My life is not worth much anyway.

208
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,310
I'll give it all to you.

209
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,170
Where is he?

210
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:28,630
Where is he?

211
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,180
Tell Shen Tunan to come out.

212
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,270
Shen Tunan!

213
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:32,750
Come out!

214
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,550
Come out now!

215
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:34,430
Mr. Zhang,

216
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,430
sirs,

217
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,820
sorry to keep you waiting.

218
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,870
Here, enjoy your drink.

219
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:41,070
Cut it out.

220
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,570
Where's Shen Tunan?

221
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,270
Is he seeing us or not?

222
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:46,190
Tell him to come out.

223
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:47,030
Tell him to come out.

224
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,630
Didn't I tell you?

225
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,430
Mr. Shen

226
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,670
went out to meet a guest.

227
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:51,350
I don't know

228
00:11:51,350 --> 00:11:52,670
where he is now either.

229
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:53,840
Okay.

230
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,990
We'll wait.

231
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:58,910
We'll come here and wait every day.

232
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:02,150
I'd like to see if he'll return to the Central Bank or not.

233
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,600
Mr. Zhang,

234
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:04,870
sirs,

235
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:05,670
how do I put it?

236
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,290
You're all big figures.

237
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:10,360
There's no need to make a scene with us small figures.

238
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,290
What did you say?

239
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,570
Who's making a scene?

240
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:15,870
Who's making a scene?

241
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:18,510
The blade is against our neck.

242
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:20,070
Can't we call for help?

243
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,950
Shen Tunan

244
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:23,210
is blatantly targeting us.

245
00:12:23,270 --> 00:12:25,750
Don't we have the right to air our grievances?

246
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:26,670
Where's Shen Tunan?

247
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:28,110
We must see him today.

248
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:28,870
Tell him to come out.

249
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:29,610
Guards!

250
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:35,910
Please help Mr. Zhang move.

251
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:36,500
Yes

252
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,230
Don't move. Let's see who dares to move.

253
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:39,080
Who dares?

254
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:39,820
Let go!

255
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,670
What are you doing?

256
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,070
I'm telling you,

257
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:43,950
I must see Shen Tunan today!

258
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,530
You know what this is, right?

259
00:12:47,270 --> 00:12:49,070
Kill me if you dare

260
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,480
and I'll die in the Central Bank today.

261
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:52,560
I—

262
00:12:59,120 --> 00:12:59,880
Mr. Zhang,

263
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,580
this is the Central Bank,

264
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,990
not HSBC

265
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,020
and definitely not the Imperial Bank.

266
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,670
By the way, I'd like to tell everyone

267
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,350
that if you follow the rules,

268
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:10,110
the Central Bank welcomes you anytime.

269
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,550
But if you make trouble,

270
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,950
don't blame me for changing my attitude.

271
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:17,310
Take him away.

272
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:21,070
What are you doing? Don't touch me!

273
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:21,980
Go.

274
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,400
Huang,

275
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,420
who do you think you are?

276
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,540
Wait.

277
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,920
Mr. Zhang.

278
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,810
Take the gun.

279
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:33,220
Take care.

280
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:34,260
Give it to him when he's out.

281
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:34,720
Yes.

282
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,270
Go.

283
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:37,510
Let go of me!

284
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:39,070
Let go of me!

285
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:41,190
Let go of me!

286
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:44,510
Secretary Huang.

287
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,190
Why are you so brave?

288
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,310
You're so amazing.

289
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,910
You dared to shoot the gun.

290
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:51,700
Go back to work.

291
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:52,510
Go back to work.

292
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,620
Awesome.

293
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,060
Give me a hand.

294
00:14:20,630 --> 00:14:21,480
Tunan,

295
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:25,270
you're still so impatient.

296
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,990
It's a mess outside now.

297
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:30,900
I had no choice.

298
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,100
If we don't do this,

299
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:34,040
the country will be destroyed.

300
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,470
It's not at that point.

301
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:36,670
Yes, it is, Mr. Jiang.

302
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,430
Do you remember

303
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:41,410
how the Ming Dynasty was overthrown?

304
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,730
Li Zicheng?

305
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:44,590
That was just the trigger.

306
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:47,390
The main reason was financial bankruptcy.

307
00:14:48,190 --> 00:14:49,870
If a country can't collect money

308
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,820
or taxes,

309
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,830
it can't raise the army.

310
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,430
If there is a natural disaster

311
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:56,750
and the government's finances are in a tight situation,

312
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:58,790
they'll have no money to help the refugees,

313
00:14:58,790 --> 00:15:00,270
leading to riots everywhere.

314
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,110
To be honest,

315
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:03,230
the state's financial situation now

316
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:06,030
is almost the same as it was in the late Ming period.

317
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,480
Do you remember

318
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:09,860
how the Qing Dynasty was overthrown?

319
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,440
The Railway Protection Movement.

320
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:16,420
Thank you.

321
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,940
A greedy court

322
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,660
that disregards its reputation,

323
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,880
destroys contracts,

324
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,000
and embezzles the people's money

325
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,560
will surely cause public resentment.

326
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:28,920
Moreover,

327
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,230
tax reform touches the interests

328
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,850
of the Western powers.

329
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:34,750
If you push them too hard,

330
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:36,180
you might have

331
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:39,720
another disaster with the Eight-Nation Allied Forces.

332
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:41,530
I don't think so.

333
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:45,360
What did you say?

334
00:15:47,210 --> 00:15:47,970
Sorry.

335
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:50,010
I'm used to interrupting in class.

336
00:15:50,010 --> 00:15:50,820
Sorry.

337
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:51,640
I was talking nonsense.

338
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:52,720
It's okay.

339
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:55,150
Just say whatever you're thinking.

340
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,680
We're not having a meeting.

341
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
We're just chatting.

342
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,950
Don't be hesitant. Just speak.

343
00:16:05,150 --> 00:16:07,030
I may have a different opinion

344
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:10,510
on the Eight-Nation Allied Forces you mentioned.

345
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,670
I'd like to hear it.

346
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:15,750
The Qing Dynasty emphasized agriculture over commerce.

347
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,350
The government was hostile to overseas trade,

348
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,350
so they couldn't communicate normally

349
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:22,030
with the Western powers.

350
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:23,430
But it's different now.

351
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:24,510
The government values trade

352
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:25,990
and follows the game's rules.

353
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:27,180
It has a business perspective.

354
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:28,230
So, I don't think

355
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,670
there'll be a large-scale armed conflict.

356
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,930
Do you think they will just sit and watch

357
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,910
if their personal interests are affected?

358
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,290
If there are enough benefits,

359
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,090
I think we should take the risk.

360
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,470
Mr. Jiang,

361
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,630
this kid is a fresh graduate.

362
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:47,510
He doesn't hold back when talking.

363
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,640
Please forgive him.

364
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,400
This is the best.

365
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,330
We're all pushed to the top.

366
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:54,580
It's hard to hear the truth.

367
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Go on.

368
00:16:57,070 --> 00:16:58,590
Let's see what benefits

369
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,390
are worth us to take risks for.

370
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,960
I have a landlord called Ms. Zhou.

371
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,450
She runs a laundry shop.

372
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,270
She works from day to night,

373
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:07,390
but she still complains that she doesn't make money.

374
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:08,750
It's because she borrowed money

375
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:09,410
from a bank

376
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:10,839
with shockingly high interest.

377
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:11,970
But the bank's money

378
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:13,589
was borrowed from those

379
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:14,510
foreign investment banks.

380
00:17:14,510 --> 00:17:16,470
This means that Ms. Zhou made one loan

381
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:18,030
but pays interest to two parties.

382
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:19,030
If we can

383
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,680
get the tariff autonomy back,

384
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,829
then the Central Bank can lend money

385
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,920
with relatively low interest to the people who need it.

386
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,230
Once the people have good lives,

387
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:27,420
they'll start loving the country

388
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,280
and the country will be stronger.

389
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:32,130
How will

390
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,170
us industrialists

391
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,810
benefit from a successful tariff reform?

392
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,440
Mr. Jiang is asking you. Why are you looking at me?

393
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,680
Answer him.

394
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,110
Mr. Jiang, with all due respect,

395
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:54,750
the Yongcheng Bank under your name

396
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,240
has always been supporting

397
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,810
the manufacturing of fabric, flour, ships, and other industries.

398
00:17:58,810 --> 00:17:59,590
But in recent years,

399
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:00,590
our country's industries

400
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:02,580
have been under the pressure of foreign capital.

401
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,980
The loans you released

402
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,830
have many bad debts already.

403
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:08,140
If we don't change this situation,

404
00:18:08,790 --> 00:18:11,450
how much longer do you think you can hold out for?

405
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:15,300
He has the style of the School of Diplomacy.

406
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,230
He uses fear tactics immediately.

407
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,510
So if we take back the tariff autonomy,

408
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:23,470
the Central Bank will have more tariff balance

409
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,270
to support the industries.

410
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,000
This is a great benefit for you.

411
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,960
That's a nice promise.

412
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:31,600
Did you teach him?

413
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,280
No.

414
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:33,590
I didn't teach him, Mr. Jiang.

415
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:34,990
My actions represent the country.

416
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,260
I state things as they are.

417
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:38,260
There's no need to bluff, Mr. Jiang.

418
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:42,010
I can take my old friends

419
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,440
to vote for you

420
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,030
and support you in the tariff reform.

421
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:46,720
Really?

422
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,080
But I have a condition.

423
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,800
Go ahead, Mr. Jiang.

424
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,030
I need a guarantee from Mr. Song.

425
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,430
What guarantee?

426
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,650
Promise to never apportion

427
00:18:58,680 --> 00:18:59,560
war debt to us again.

428
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:00,170
Mr. Jiang,

429
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,510
you make it sound like

430
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:02,630
the Kuomintang government

431
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:03,590
are robbers.

432
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:05,550
Since the Beiyang government,

433
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:06,910
the government's bank

434
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,520
has always been a tool to raise money for war.

435
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:12,990
The old warlords never planned on

436
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,530
repaying the war debts they apportioned.

437
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:20,390
We don't want Chiang Kai-shek to be a another warlord.

438
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,900
We also don't want

439
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,270
the Central Bank to become the next war tool.

440
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:26,000
Don't worry.

441
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:27,720
The Central Bank is definitely not the old type of bank.

442
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:29,060
As long as I'm here,

443
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,810
I won't let this happen.

444
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:31,940
Good.

445
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,430
I hope you keep your promise.

446
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,980
Have some tea.

447
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,430
Young man, have some tea.

448
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,210
No, thanks.

449
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,750
Drink it.

450
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:57,950
You spoke well earlier.

451
00:19:58,860 --> 00:19:59,910
Thank you, sir.

452
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,390
Mr. Jiang

453
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,420
is a leader among national bankers.

454
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:05,410
Since he expressed his attitude,

455
00:20:05,410 --> 00:20:06,860
we're halfway to success.

456
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,460
Then,

457
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:10,820
is the other half Yu Shiqing?

458
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:13,270
Yu Shiqing.

459
00:20:14,110 --> 00:20:16,700
He's the actual controller of the Commercial Association of Suzhou and Shanghai.

460
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,030
He started from trading with foreigners.

461
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,110
To put it bluntly, he is a big comprador.

462
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:22,870
Foreign banks like HSBC

463
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,830
are on his side.

464
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,950
Someone so powerful like him

465
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,850
won't be easy to deal with, right?

466
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,000
Of course.

467
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:32,240
We can't do it just by chatting.

468
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,910
In fact, Yu Shiqing should be

469
00:20:34,360 --> 00:20:36,490
the biggest obstacle for this reform.

470
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,310
If we push him too hard,

471
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,930
will he cause trouble?

472
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:41,910
Of course.

473
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,150
Without considering political influences,

474
00:20:44,150 --> 00:20:46,880
assassination is the most economical solution.

475
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,590
Sir, how about I apply for a gun?

476
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,070
No.

477
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,630
You are my assistant,

478
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:52,850
not my bodyguard.

479
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,200
Just do your job.

480
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:55,920
Yes.

481
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,730
Mr. Yu, what a shame!

482
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:05,670
Even Shen Tunan's dog is so arrogant.

483
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,100
If he gets the upper hand,

484
00:21:07,310 --> 00:21:09,110
we won't be able to survive anymore.

485
00:21:09,110 --> 00:21:10,270
You can't survive

486
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:12,590
by yelling.

487
00:21:12,990 --> 00:21:14,320
You must use your brain.

488
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:15,790
The director of HSBC

489
00:21:15,830 --> 00:21:17,410
is already pressuring me.

490
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:19,410
If I can't keep the tariff management rights,

491
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:20,750
I have to resign.

492
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,050
At worst, we'll just die together.

493
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:25,820
It's not at that point.

494
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,280
Politics is an art of compromise.

495
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,700
Violence is not the way.

496
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,150
We are not bandits.

497
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:33,350
If we don’t act now,

498
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,630
I really won't be able to survive, Mr. Yu.

499
00:21:35,910 --> 00:21:37,150
What’s the hurry?

500
00:21:38,470 --> 00:21:40,800
He must want to meet me recently.

501
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:43,020
Let's hear his thoughts first.

502
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:45,020
If you have time,

503
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:46,640
you can make preparations.

504
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,030
Some blood

505
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,970
is okay when necessary.

506
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:53,420
Are you okay?

507
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,730
Why do you need a gun?

508
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:56,230
Mr. Qian,

509
00:21:56,670 --> 00:21:58,340
it's not safe lately.

510
00:21:58,590 --> 00:22:00,180
I just want a gun to protect myself

511
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,710
and the people around me.

512
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:03,550
It doesn't have to be a great gun.

513
00:22:03,550 --> 00:22:04,910
It's fine as long as it's repeating.

514
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,840
I don't have any.

515
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,620
We're an axe gang.

516
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:14,430
We never use guns.

517
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,570
Then, Mr. Qian,

518
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,480
can you ask someone for one for me?

519
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:19,770
It's quite urgent.

520
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,730
Little friend, tell me the truth.

521
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:24,230
Are you in trouble?

522
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,430
If someone bullies you,

523
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,910
tell me and I'll stand up for you.

524
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:31,020
No, Mr. Qian. Really.

525
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,570
I'll give you an axe.

526
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:38,890
It's manganese steel.

527
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:42,180
You don't have to use strength to chop off someone's legs.

528
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:44,990
No need, Mr. Qian.

529
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:47,390
This doesn't really suit me.

530
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:29,060
[New Show Club]

531
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,840
I'll shoot you.

532
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:47,840
Thank you, sir.

533
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,470
Hope you have fun.

534
00:24:41,030 --> 00:24:42,630
It's late. Are you going out?

535
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,030
I have a family banquet.

536
00:24:44,030 --> 00:24:45,110
You have to go too.

537
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,590
Me too?

538
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,210
Yu Shiqing's wife,

539
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,890
the boss of Menghua Pictures,

540
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,830
said she just got a script.

541
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,470
The female lead suits me well.

542
00:24:59,010 --> 00:25:00,770
The female lead suits you well?

543
00:25:00,910 --> 00:25:03,170
They have an ulterior motive.

544
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:05,560
Since they're expressing kindness,

545
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:07,310
we have to respond.

546
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,020
You want to act in a movie, right?

547
00:25:10,150 --> 00:25:10,770
Guess.

548
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:12,340
You do.

549
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:13,490
No.

550
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,150
But I thought

551
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:18,180
that if I rejected them,

552
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:21,170
you'd have no more room for maneuvering.

553
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,990
So, I thought to just deal with them

554
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:24,990
and play it by ear.

555
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,970
With a wife like you, what more can I ask for?

556
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,690
Good that you know.

557
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,650
Which one is prettier?

558
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:40,920
This one.

559
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,080
Nothing is going smoothly lately.

560
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,910
Mr. Zhang, that's enough.

561
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:13,460
Don't be mad.

562
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,780
What are you looking at?

563
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:15,890
Look again.

564
00:26:21,470 --> 00:26:22,270
Stop singing.

565
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,490
Drink with me.

566
00:26:24,490 --> 00:26:25,170
Mr. Zhang.

567
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:26,800
Mr. Zhang.

568
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,350
She's with Lin Qiaosong.

569
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:29,230
Captain Lin.

570
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:30,210
Lin what?

571
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,790
Lin Qiaosong.

572
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:36,040
He's the captain of the Shanghai Garrison Command's Investigation and Arrest Unit.

573
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:37,890
You should know him.

574
00:26:38,230 --> 00:26:40,830
Why would I know a servant?

575
00:26:41,470 --> 00:26:43,670
I don't even respect Mr. Kang.

576
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:45,830
Mr. Zhang.

577
00:26:45,830 --> 00:26:47,230
What are you waiting for?

578
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,800
Come and drink with me.

579
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:52,910
Let's go.

580
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:54,680
It has to be...

581
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,930
Get out of the way!

582
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:56,720
Stop her!

583
00:26:56,970 --> 00:26:58,020
No, Mr. Zhang.

584
00:26:58,290 --> 00:26:59,950
Meijuan, accompany him well.

585
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,990
It hurts.

586
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:07,960
Who told you to stop?

587
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,750
Keep singing and dancing.

588
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,690
Drink.

589
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,990
It's a waste of this good wine

590
00:27:22,230 --> 00:27:23,350
if I drink it alone.

591
00:27:25,590 --> 00:27:27,960
Okay, I can accompany you.

592
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,600
Do you know how to play dice?

593
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,850
Yes, but I'm not good at it.

594
00:27:32,290 --> 00:27:33,170
I always lose.

595
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:34,680
It's okay.

596
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,390
I can teach you.

597
00:27:37,310 --> 00:27:38,810
Drink if you lose.

598
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,340
You'll get better after losing more.

599
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,840
But my alcohol tolerance is low too.

600
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:47,390
You get alcohol tolerance with practice.

601
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,660
Come on.

602
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,590
Open.

603
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:21,310
You're just pretending to be bad.

604
00:28:21,830 --> 00:28:23,110
Impressive.

605
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,480
You can't cheat with the alcohol.

606
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,530
Mr. Zhang,

607
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:37,480
are you alright?

608
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,490
I'm fine.

609
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:44,530
I need to use the bathroom.

610
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:46,840
Go away.

611
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:29,140
Get me some water.

612
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,240
Mr. Qian.

613
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:15,380
You haven't gone home yet?

614
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:17,840
Mr. Qian, I helped my friend do something.

615
00:31:18,110 --> 00:31:21,040
It's almost New Year's Eve. Robbers are everywhere.

616
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:23,270
Don't wander around at night.

617
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:24,110
Yes.

618
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,590
Mr. Qian, you go on ahead.

619
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:26,390
I'll go home now.

620
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,230
I'll take you to the tram station.

621
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:28,820
No need, Mr. Qian.

622
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:29,390
Get in.

623
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:31,640
Yes.

624
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,120
I've always wanted to work with you.

625
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:51,440
I never had a chance.

626
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:52,960
All these years,

627
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:54,780
you haven't changed at all.

628
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:56,090
This time,

629
00:31:56,210 --> 00:31:57,830
we can finally work together.

630
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:59,180
It's so lively

631
00:31:59,230 --> 00:31:59,870
when women are together.

632
00:31:59,870 --> 00:32:01,070
Thank you for your exaltation.

633
00:32:01,070 --> 00:32:01,740
They can

634
00:32:01,950 --> 00:32:04,360
talk about movies, beauty, and fashion

635
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,310
for days without stop.

636
00:32:07,950 --> 00:32:09,430
Cishu is just too happy

637
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,670
after seeing Mrs. Yu.

638
00:32:13,510 --> 00:32:13,980
Come.

639
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:15,750
Here.

640
00:32:18,390 --> 00:32:18,870
Have one.

641
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:19,510
No thanks, Mr. Yu.

642
00:32:19,510 --> 00:32:20,230
I quit.

643
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,950
It's good to quit.

644
00:32:22,390 --> 00:32:23,190
It's good for your health.

645
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:23,670
Yes.

646
00:32:25,870 --> 00:32:26,930
I just can't quit.

647
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,550
Listen, people who can quit smoking

648
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,260
all have wills of steel.

649
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:34,830
It seems

650
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,360
that I have no strengths other than my will.

651
00:32:38,870 --> 00:32:40,880
You're too modest.

652
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:44,870
I'll get straight to the point, since there are no outsiders here.

653
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:45,950
You've made

654
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,850
quite a ruckus recently.

655
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:49,850
I've been worried for you.

656
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:51,690
Worried about what?

657
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:53,670
I should say

658
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,850
that you have good intentions.

659
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:57,270
As a Chinese,

660
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,480
I agree with you deep down.

661
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:01,670
But have you thought about it?

662
00:33:01,670 --> 00:33:04,270
The government in Nanjing gave you your power.

663
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:07,830
Can you guarantee that everyone in Nanjing is united?

664
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:13,970
Mr. Yu,

665
00:33:14,110 --> 00:33:15,440
what advice do you have?

666
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:19,130
It's not advice.

667
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,160
I

668
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:22,990
just want to help you with a business deal.

669
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,490
The Commercial Association of Suzhou and Shanghai

670
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,370
needs a capable director.

671
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:30,830
I've thought about it for a long time.

672
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:32,810
I trust you the most.

673
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,540
If you don't mind,

674
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:38,830
I'm willing to transfer all my shares in Xinya Department Store

675
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:39,880
to you.

676
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:44,790
I can't accept undeserved rewards.

677
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,230
What? Is it not enough?

678
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:47,510
If so,

679
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,970
I can give the shares of Zhabei Cotton Mill—

680
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:51,950
You can give me all your assets,

681
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:53,280
but I can't accept them.

682
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:54,270
No.

683
00:33:55,390 --> 00:33:56,310
It's that

684
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,030
I don't dare to accept them.

685
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,690
I know.

686
00:34:05,070 --> 00:34:06,200
You're just worried

687
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:07,890
that Mr. Song will find out.

688
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:10,980
You know

689
00:34:11,010 --> 00:34:12,070
Mr. Song's temper.

690
00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:13,350
If he finds out

691
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:15,070
that I accepted your benefits,

692
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,870
he will view this as my betrayal.

693
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,360
With his power,

694
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,050
I'm afraid it won't just be me.

695
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:22,389
It'll also be disadvantageous

696
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,650
towards you

697
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:26,800
and the Commercial Association of Suzhou and Shanghai.

698
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,199
Don't worry about Mr. Song.

699
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,389
I'll take care of him.

700
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:33,880
It's still up to you if you come or not.

701
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,040
This is how big the reward is.

702
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,770
I've put it on the table now.

703
00:34:40,770 --> 00:34:41,770
If you don't come,

704
00:34:42,550 --> 00:34:44,409
someone else will come to take it.

705
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,460
Mr. Yu, how about this?

706
00:35:00,310 --> 00:35:01,510
Let me think about it.

707
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:04,850
No hurry.

708
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,580
I’ll wait for your good news.

709
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:08,740
Mr. Yu.

710
00:35:09,830 --> 00:35:10,830
Okay.

711
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,450
Why are you here?

712
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:41,310
Madam Liang called me,

713
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:42,710
saying you were bullied.

714
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,950
Fortunately, the headquarters is close enough.

715
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,640
Do I look like someone who gets bullied?

716
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,080
If I can't even handle this kind of person,

717
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,210
I might as well quit and be a housewife.

718
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:56,270
But Zhang Mingquan

719
00:35:56,830 --> 00:35:58,090
is not easy to deal with.

720
00:35:58,090 --> 00:35:58,830
He's rich

721
00:35:59,270 --> 00:36:00,310
and smart.

722
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,840
Is he generous to women?

723
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,200
What's wrong?

724
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:05,750
Are you jealous?

725
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,820
I wasn't going to do anything.

726
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,510
If you offend others, I can deal with them,

727
00:36:14,510 --> 00:36:17,020
but Zhang Mingquan has Mr. Yu behind him.

728
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,700
You can't offend him.

729
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
Can't I play with him?

730
00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:25,680
You'd best not.

731
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,250
Where is he?

732
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,980
What are you doing?

733
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:31,830
Showing him who you belong to.

734
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:33,380
If you have a conflict with him later,

735
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,950
I can explain it to the higher-ups

736
00:36:34,950 --> 00:36:36,350
that I warned him before.

737
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,510
Why can't this door open?

738
00:36:38,510 --> 00:36:39,850
Open the door!

739
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:41,850
What are you doing?

740
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,340
What do you mean?

741
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:44,760
What are you doing in the ladies' room?

742
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,730
The Investigation and Arrest Unit is investigating on a case.

743
00:36:45,730 --> 00:36:47,020
What kind of case

744
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:48,720
needs you in the ladies' room?

745
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,350
What are you two doing?

746
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,360
I'll arrest you if you keep talking.

747
00:36:53,030 --> 00:36:54,220
Who do you think you are?

748
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:55,420
Arrest me!

749
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,780
There's no one in Shanghai that I'm scared of.

750
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,420
Meijuan,

751
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,350
how many times have I told you?

752
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,960
Stay away from this man.

753
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:01,950
He doesn't have money.

754
00:37:01,950 --> 00:37:03,750
He doesn't have money, you know?

755
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,580
What are you doing?

756
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,160
Someone is inside.

757
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:24,920
The door is locked. There must be someone inside.

758
00:38:04,850 --> 00:38:05,770
What is this?

759
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:07,770
My service fee?

760
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,930
Stop drinking your cheap liquor.

761
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:12,830
It's going to mess up your brain.

762
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:16,880
Where did you get the money to buy wine?

763
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:18,560
Do you want it or not?

764
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:31,380
He can't even say something nice.

765
00:38:35,030 --> 00:38:36,580
How was your talk with Yu Shiqing?

766
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
It's the same old trick.

767
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,670
He'll use money to open the path first.

768
00:38:39,670 --> 00:38:42,600
I guess he'll find someone to do the dirty work later.

769
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,700
These people are really something.

770
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,290
They've been here for so long.

771
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,150
Can't they change their tactics?

772
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,310
Tactics don't have to be new

773
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,440
as long as they work.

774
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:56,020
How about you?

775
00:38:56,180 --> 00:38:58,240
I saw Mrs. Yu was around you all night.

776
00:38:58,330 --> 00:38:59,260
What did she say?

777
00:39:02,190 --> 00:39:03,850
The audition is next Tuesday.

778
00:39:04,390 --> 00:39:08,240
She said I'm the best candidate for the female lead

779
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,210
and she'll support me.

780
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:13,190
The female lead?

781
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,820
If you get famous

782
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:17,180
and become a superstar,

783
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,230
I'll be on the financial page

784
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,390
and you'll be on the entertainment page all day.

785
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,940
People will see us whenever they read the newspaper.

786
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,150
It'll be so lively.

787
00:39:24,210 --> 00:39:24,790
Is it lively?

788
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:25,550
Yes.

789
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,310
Cishu.

790
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,420
I'm sorry.

791
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,780
Why are you sorry?

792
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,950
I acted on my own

793
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,390
and caused a lot of trouble for our family,

794
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,520
especially for you.

795
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,960
You're always worried

796
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:50,280
and you don't dare to go out alone.

797
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:51,760
I'm sorry.

798
00:39:59,390 --> 00:40:00,270
Do you think

799
00:40:01,210 --> 00:40:03,090
I married you

800
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:04,480
because you are rich

801
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,070
or because you're handsome?

802
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,520
I'm quite rich

803
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:12,230
and kind of handsome too.

804
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,610
The main thing is that I treat you well.

805
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,650
I'm perfect.

806
00:40:16,070 --> 00:40:17,310
Perfect.

807
00:40:17,310 --> 00:40:18,750
Perfect.

808
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,040
Cishu,

809
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:24,850
let's grit our teeth

810
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:26,740
and get through this period.

811
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:28,030
I believe

812
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,660
China

813
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,600
will rise up.

814
00:40:36,910 --> 00:40:38,640
If you believe it, I believe it.

815
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:43,320
But no matter how busy you are, take care of yourself.

816
00:40:43,990 --> 00:40:44,830
If...

817
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:47,270
If I get old too soon, you won't want me anymore.

818
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:48,110
I know.
