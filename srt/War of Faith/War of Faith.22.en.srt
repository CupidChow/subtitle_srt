[Episode 22]

4
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:34,470
So much?

5
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,800
I didn't do much today.

6
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,070
I'm embarrassed to take it.

7
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,310
You find it too little?

8
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:40,070
No, I want it.

9
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:42,690
I have to save the money.

10
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,340
I'll buy myself a foreign car in the future.

11
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,140
You're a little crook, aren't you?

12
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,870
From now on,

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,180
just follow me.

14
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:51,710
In Shanghai,

15
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:54,710
there are a lot of rich people,

16
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,509
and they're also generous.

17
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,640
Wen, listen to this.

18
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,090
You know what?

19
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,010
Sometimes, I can't make this much

20
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,610
even when my legs are broken,

21
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:07,080
and with my voice gone hoarse in the countryside.

22
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:07,800
But today,

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,169
this is our first time busking.

24
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,500
Our first time busking!

25
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:12,520
Look.

26
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,190
Look how much I've earned.

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:15,590
Chunmiao.

28
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:16,970
Chunmiao.

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:17,810
Chunmiao

30
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,270
Qibao Street

31
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,130
is still considered poor.

32
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,040
I'll take you to

33
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,500
where the rich people are.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:28,260
I promise

35
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:30,090
you'll make more than ten times of what you're making today.

36
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,750
You have to keep your promise.

37
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,220
You're a good brother.

38
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,630
That's what I'm talking about.

39
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,160
Let's make money together.

40
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,480
Here.

41
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,750
I must propose a toast to you.

42
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,740
That's enough.

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,370
Cheers!

44
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,180
Come on!

45
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,280
Let's get rich together!

46
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,680
Let's get rich together!

47
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,810
Take your time.

48
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,640
Eat more.

49
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:28,850
You go...

50
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:30,930
Hello.

51
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:33,770
Is Wei Ruolai here?

52
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:34,920
No.

53
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:36,240
You are...

54
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:37,829
I'm his friend.

55
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:40,890
-I’m here to pass him something.
-I’m his fiancée.

56
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:44,840
Hello.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:46,680
Wei,

58
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,079
what is your relationship

59
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:50,140
with Niu Chunmiao?

60
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:51,940
We're from the same hometown.

61
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,070
We're just friends.

62
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,310
Ms. Zhou said

63
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,900
you brought a girl to your house the other day.

64
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,480
What's your relationship that girl?

65
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:02,610
We're just friends.

66
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,960
She came to your house at night and even stayed for dinner.

67
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,960
Are you sure you are just friends?

68
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,220
What are you guessing?

69
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,530
We're not even on the same page.

70
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:14,130
Why do you think you're not good enough for her?

71
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,160
This is more complicated than you think.

72
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,190
We should stay away from

73
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,440
women like her.

74
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,750
Go to bed.

75
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:25,250
I don't want to take the rickshaw tomorrow.

76
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,040
Keep our distance?

77
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:43,690
Thank you.

78
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,200
What's your name?

79
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:48,830
My surname is Shen.

80
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:49,920
What about you?

81
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,640
Niu Chunmiao.

82
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,700
Wei Ruolai and I

83
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,720
have been engaged since childhood.

84
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:56,680
Did he tell you?

85
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,760
No.

86
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,630
Our families have been friends for generations.

87
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:02,750
Our fathers were good brothers.

88
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,090
They were very close.

89
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,120
Before I came to Shanghai,

90
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,560
our families had already discussed

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,670
our marriage.

92
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,790
Well then, congratulations.

93
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:11,480
No need.

94
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,080
I didn't come to Shanghai

95
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,370
to get married.

96
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
If you want him,

97
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,330
I can let him go.

98
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,690
Wei Ruolai is not Xue Pinggui,

99
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,340
and I'm not Wang Baochuan.

100
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,090
So as long as you pay,

101
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,670
I can pass him on to you.

102
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,130
-Miss Niu, I think you are mistaken.
-Of course.

103
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:36,790
You can also choose not to pay.

104
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,840
But...

105
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:40,500
As long as you two are together,

106
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,880
-I’ll make a scene at the doors of Central Bank every day.
-We...

107
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,540
-He who abandons the muck
-It’s not what you think.

108
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,470
as he clings onto wealth and honor.

109
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:48,720
Would such a reputation

110
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,420
do the both of you any good?

111
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,050
No, right?

112
00:05:56,170 --> 00:05:57,230
Well then Miss Niu,

113
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,570
how much do you think I should pay?

114
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,330
50 silver dollars.

115
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,480
I'll leave as soon as I get the money,

116
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,850
and you can do whatever you want.

117
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,180
I will never interfere.

118
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,690
Is Wei Ruolai only worth

119
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:21,710
50 silver dollars in your heart?

120
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:25,480
If... if you are willing to give me more,

121
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,680
I'll welcome you too.

122
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:27,730
Don't worry.

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,680
If anyone from our families objects,

124
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll be the first to stand out.

125
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,159
I'll say that it was my decision

126
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,200
to cancel the engagement.

127
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,200
It has nothing to do with Wei Ruolai.

128
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:36,620
This way, our neighbors

129
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:38,590
won't say that he's heartless either.

130
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,110
Right?

131
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,590
Do you know how much he earns now?

132
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:43,870
He...

133
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:45,680
He keeps what he earns.

134
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,830
I'm not that greedy.

135
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,310
Why don't you want to marry him?

136
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:55,170
This... this has nothing to do with you.

137
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:55,920
Here's the thing.

138
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,950
Let's discuss about

139
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,110
the transfer fee first.

140
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,680
We'll talk about the rest later, okay?

141
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,970
You're so eager to get rid of him.

142
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,250
I don't suppose there's anything wrong with him, is there?

143
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,200
No.

144
00:07:08,050 --> 00:07:10,040
Wei Ruolai is very filial.

145
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,850
He's kind and smart.

146
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:13,040
If you marry him,

147
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,570
you will be very blessed.

148
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,990
Since he is so good,

149
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,270
why don't you marry him yourself?

150
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:20,770
I...

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,580
If you don't make it clear,

152
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:25,930
how can we talk?

153
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:30,130
40.

154
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:31,740
It can't be any lower.

155
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,810
You are not telling me the truth.

156
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:34,850
There must be something wrong with him.

157
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,200
No, there isn't.

158
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,340
I'm just short of money recently.

159
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,650
I'm very short of money.

160
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:44,300
Otherwise, I won't give him away even if you gave me a 100.

161
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,220
Miss Niu.

162
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,080
Cut the crap.

163
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,420
30 silver dollars.

164
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,000
Deal?

165
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,659
Wei Ruolai will belong to you.

166
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,320
I'll leave tomorrow morning.

167
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:54,070
Since you don't want to tell me the truth,

168
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,000
then forget it.

169
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:56,710
I thought he was a decent guy.

170
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:58,900
Now that you mentioned it, I'm not so sure anymore.

171
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,770
I'd better go.

172
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:00,710
No, don't.

173
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,550
Don't go.

174
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:02,620
Don't go, Sister.

175
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:05,060
Wei Ruolai is very smart.

176
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,850
He works very hard too.

177
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,850
Just buy him back.

178
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:11,320
It's worth the price even if you

179
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,590
buy him back to be your house servant.

180
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,970
-Then you tell me...
-20.

181
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:15,780
My best price.

182
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,880
Then let me finish.

183
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:21,090
Why don't you want to marry him?

184
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:23,140
If what you are going to say makes sense,

185
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,460
let alone 50,

186
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,560
I can even afford 100 silver dollars.

187
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:42,150
Morning, Mr. Shen.

188
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:42,679
Morning.

189
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:45,120
You're early, Mr. Shen.

190
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,650
Morning.

191
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,910
You're early, Ruolai.

192
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:05,360
Sir.

193
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:06,080
So early?

194
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:06,750
Let me get you some water.

195
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:07,260
No need.

196
00:09:10,190 --> 00:09:12,470
[Report on the study of Workers and Farmers Banks of Communist-controlled regions by Wei Ruolai]

197
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
Report on the study of Workers and Farmers Banks of Communist-controlled regions.

198
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,300
Are you done?

199
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:13,890
Yes.

200
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,020
But there's some data that needs to be double-checked.

201
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,200
Come over for dinner tonight.

202
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,330
I want to give you a book.

203
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,040
It'll help you finish the report as soon as possible.

204
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:24,600
Okay.

205
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:28,220
I'll try to come earlier than you tomorrow.

206
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,080
Get busy.

207
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,130
Dad.

208
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,760
Mom.

209
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:54,450
Did you two fight?

210
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:56,900
No.

211
00:09:57,230 --> 00:09:58,960
Daddy and Mommy are good. Look.

212
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,240
Then...

213
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:03,400
Aunt,

214
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:05,520
are you two on bad terms?

215
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:11,440
You didn't talk to each other all night.

216
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:14,000
You didn't even look at each other.

217
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,240
Kids shouldn't talk while they're eating.

218
00:10:19,450 --> 00:10:20,490
It's bad for your stomach.

219
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:21,820
You're a lady, you know?

220
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,630
Have you finished reading the book I gave you last time?

221
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:42,510
Yes, Sir.

222
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,160
I'll get you another book.

223
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,890
Fisher's masterpiece,

224
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:53,890
"The Theory of Interest".

225
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:54,600
Write me a book review

226
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,890
when you're done.

227
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,160
Got it, Sir.

228
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,520
Also...

229
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:02,200
Have you spoken to Jinzhen?

230
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,010
Yes.

231
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,240
I've said everything I need to say.

232
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,300
But the outcome...

233
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:08,930
doesn't seem very ideal.

234
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,980
That is expected.

235
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,880
She's...

236
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,740
a very stubborn person.

237
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,000
Try harder.

238
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:20,070
Be patient and try again.

239
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,210
Miss Shen.

240
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,730
Done talking to my brother?

241
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:44,840
Yes.

242
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,580
Is there a problem?

243
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,520
I was too harsh last time.

244
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:57,690
I apologize.

245
00:11:58,730 --> 00:11:59,490
When?

246
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,770
When I said...

247
00:12:02,210 --> 00:12:04,540
When I said you were holding back Mr. Shen.

248
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:06,200
It's okay.

249
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:08,620
I think what you said makes sense.

250
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,880
I'll be more careful in the future.

251
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,640
Anything else?

252
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:18,510
No. That's all.

253
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,720
I'll go back now.

254
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,230
You should...

255
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,730
be nice to Niu Chunmiao from now on.

256
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,760
No, you...

257
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:32,100
How do you know about Niu Chunmiao?

258
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,920
I went to your house the other day,

259
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,120
but you weren't there and I ran into her.

260
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,530
We had a good chat.

261
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:39,290
She's a nice girl.

262
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,570
What did she tell you?

263
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:44,400
Nothing.

264
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:49,510
Why... do you look a little guilty?

265
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:50,950
No.

266
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,120
I am not.

267
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,360
What exactly did she say to you?

268
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:58,850
She said you were still wetting your bed when you were seven.

269
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,290
What?

270
00:12:59,410 --> 00:13:01,120
You've always been a coward.

271
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,730
You were always following behind your brother.

272
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,690
A small brush against you and you would fall.

273
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,020
A little bump and you would cry.

274
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:07,290
One time, you almost got tricked by the human traffickers

275
00:13:07,290 --> 00:13:08,980
with a skewer of candied haws.

276
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:20,570
Niu Chunmiao.

277
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,140
Niu Chunmiao.

278
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,250
Coming.

279
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:37,960
-Let me ask you.
-What are you doing?

280
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,020
Why did you tell Miss Shen all of that?

281
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,480
What?

282
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,240
Stop pretending.

283
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:42,840
She told me everything.

284
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,240
Why did you tell her that?

285
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,730
It's the truth.

286
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,490
Which of these did I lie about?

287
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:47,890
You...

288
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:48,720
What?

289
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,930
Miss Shen is a decent person.

290
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,400
You two are not suitable.

291
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:53,930
It's not up to you to decide

292
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:54,820
whether we are suitable for each other.

293
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,150
Who do you think you are?

294
00:13:57,520 --> 00:13:58,320
Doggie!

295
00:13:58,530 --> 00:14:00,130
Enough of your nonsense!

296
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:02,330
Fine.

297
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,950
Just take it as I am being meddlesome.

298
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:07,990
I shouldn't have taken you in.

299
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Don't worry.

300
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,250
I've made a lot of money.

301
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,250
I'll find a place within these two days

302
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,770
and move out.

303
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,080
How did you make the money?

304
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:19,500
Have you forgotten who I am?

305
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:20,930
While you were sniffing

306
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:22,620
and collecting elm seeds from the mountains to eat,

307
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,990
I was already

308
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:25,920
busking with my father.

309
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,110
These are fake.

310
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,920
How can someone in Shanghai still dare to counterfeit money?

311
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,730
I've learned how to judge the authenticity of these silver coins.

312
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:41,590
These are fake.

313
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,750
Bastard!

314
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,560
I was wondering why all of them

315
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:53,490
were so generous with their money.

316
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,320
Turns out, they are all fake.

317
00:14:58,890 --> 00:14:59,570
Mr. Song.

318
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,460
Recently, we received a lot of reports,

319
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,170
claiming that there's a large number of counterfeit silver coins

320
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:05,180
in the market.

321
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:06,320
According to our estimates,

322
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,140
only a small portion of it has been released.

323
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,640
The actual amount should be much more significant.

324
00:15:10,640 --> 00:15:11,400
So I suggest

325
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:13,530
to set up a special Commission of Inquiry and

326
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:14,160
start investigating immediately.

327
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
Mr. Kong has given us a heads-up.

328
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,170
He said that the counterfeit coins

329
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,810
is a matter of great importance.

330
00:15:18,810 --> 00:15:20,280
If Central Bank investigates this independently,

331
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:22,160
I'm afraid we can't convince everyone.

332
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:22,810
So,

333
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,700
the headquarters have requested that the Police,

334
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,640
the intelligence service,

335
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:28,000
also known as the Investigation and Arrest Unit of the Garrison Command,

336
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,860
to cooperate and jointly solve the case as three parties.

337
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,330
Mr. Song, three parties

338
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,250
might be a bit too many.

339
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,800
I'm afraid a lot of important information

340
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,730
might be leaked.

341
00:15:35,850 --> 00:15:36,600
So,

342
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,760
you've got to be on top of it.

343
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,640
The counterfeit coins are causing panic.

344
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,030
We must find out what happened

345
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:42,970
and solve the case as soon as possible.

346
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:43,580
Yes, Sir.

347
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,170
Captain Lin.

348
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,450
Mr. Kang.

349
00:16:05,690 --> 00:16:06,420
You're here.

350
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:07,280
Sit.

351
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,370
Sit down before we talk.

352
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,280
I've been thinking about

353
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,990
something important,

354
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,920
and I think it's best if you go.

355
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,670
Shen Tunan, leading Central Bank,

356
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:30,250
together with us, the Garrison Command, and Shanghai Police Department,

357
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,150
have jointly established an investigation team,

358
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,750
to investigate the case of counterfeit coins.

359
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:36,590
I don't know what he's thinking.

360
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,150
He asked me for one person

361
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:40,330
to assist in his investigations.

362
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:42,480
Me?

363
00:16:44,690 --> 00:16:45,880
I didn't expect that

364
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,030
you seem to get along well with Miss Shen.

365
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,620
Mr. Kang.

366
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,290
After the case was closed, I had no more contact with Shen Jinzhen.

367
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:53,690
You know my personality.

368
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,320
Given Shen Jinzhen's identity,

369
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,720
I truly cannot deal with someone like that.

370
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,840
Don't think too much.

371
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,880
Shen Tunan is someone

372
00:17:04,910 --> 00:17:06,240
who cherishes talents.

373
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,950
He values what you've got.

374
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,369
After you go over,

375
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,960
do your job well.

376
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:13,760
Remember,

377
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,280
don't let them take advantage of us.

378
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,700
Don't you worry, Mr. Kang.

379
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:24,810
Welcome Deputy Director Yu Zhiying of Shanghai Police Department,

380
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,319
Military Law Department of the Shanghai Garrison Command's Investigation and Arrest Unit,

381
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,580
Captain Lin Qiaosong.

382
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,970
We welcome you

383
00:17:30,970 --> 00:17:33,330
to officially join our Commission of Inquiry.

384
00:17:33,330 --> 00:17:33,850
Ruolai.

385
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,960
Let's start with a brief introduction.

386
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:36,370
Yes.

387
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,800
What you see in front of you

388
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,240
is a sample of the counterfeit coins.

389
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,110
The engravings are clear and the edges are neat.

390
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:44,430
All of them are made by the stamping method.

391
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,170
In other words,

392
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,080
they are using the same technology as the official mint,

393
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,420
and are not made in some small workshop.

394
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:50,500
And now in Shanghai,

395
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,890
there has been a massive distribution,

396
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,890
with an estimated distribution of over a million.

397
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:56,820
The daily production should be around 3,000 pieces.

398
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,600
There's no need for me to say anything more

399
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,480
regarding the financial risks of counterfeit money.

400
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,280
Mr. Song

401
00:18:01,430 --> 00:18:03,090
is very concerned about this.

402
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:04,880
He ordered us to solve the case in ten days.

403
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,680
The pressure is pretty intense.

404
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,190
But there's one tough problem.

405
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:10,490
We currently don't know if the counterfeit factory

406
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,690
is in Shanghai or not.

407
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:12,800
In my opinion,

408
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,080
Shanghai is definitely hardest hit

409
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,080
by these counterfeit coins.

410
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,190
But I think

411
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,630
it's impossible for the counterfeit factory

412
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:24,240
to be in Shanghai.

413
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,000
Think about it.

414
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,730
A rabbit doesn't eat the grass by its own burrow.

415
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:29,690
If I am the one making counterfeit coins,

416
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:31,040
I'll definitely spread them out of town,

417
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,890
after the counterfeit coins are made.

418
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:34,240
It's more safe and secure.

419
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,800
So I am suggesting,

420
00:18:36,210 --> 00:18:38,880
how about we go take a look at

421
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,480
the cities around Shanghai?

422
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,680
Let's go check it out.

423
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,780
That makes sense.

424
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:46,280
This batch of counterfeit coins is mainly based on

425
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,720
the Yuan Datou's silver dollar, made in the third year of Republic of China.

426
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,490
It was manufactured by a coin manufacturer in Nanjing.

427
00:18:51,490 --> 00:18:53,380
We have received their reply.

428
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,650
They said the coin-making molds

429
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:57,490
were destroyed back in the day.

430
00:18:57,490 --> 00:18:58,810
But we don't know

431
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,730
if they were indeed destroyed.

432
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:03,240
Advisor Shen,

433
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,340
could this be the work of the Communist Party?

434
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:06,720
They could have intentionally released counterfeit coins

435
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,320
as an attempt to disrupt our financial market.

436
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:11,360
That's what I thought at first too.

437
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,560
But it's obvious that

438
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:13,850
the Communist Party

439
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:15,370
don't have such sophisticated technologies

440
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:17,430
to make such good counterfeit coins.

441
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:19,360
So,

442
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,630
there are now various possibilities.

443
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,410
Captain Lin,

444
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,050
I'll have to trouble you

445
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:26,050
with the investigation in Shanghai.

446
00:19:26,050 --> 00:19:27,400
Don't worry, Advisor Shen.

447
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,190
Please leave the investigation in Shanghai

448
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,000
with me.

449
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,040
Deputy Director Yu,

450
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,390
as for the case files,

451
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,410
can you deliver them to us?

452
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,320
We can try to see

453
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,850
if we can find any new clues.

454
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:38,980
Don't worry.

455
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,530
Our police department is supposed to be cooperating with you.

456
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:43,130
I'll deliver it as soon as possible.

457
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,690
Thank you to the both of you.

458
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,030
Captain Lin.

459
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,100
Have a cigarette.

460
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,260
No need, thank you.

461
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,320
I've long heard that you, Captain Lin,

462
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,520
is smart and capable.

463
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,280
When I saw you earlier today,

464
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,210
you really live up to your name.

465
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:16,370
Thank you, Deputy Director Yu.

466
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,970
I've long admired you too, Deputy Director Yu.

467
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:21,760
Mr. Kang.

468
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,070
He asked me to say hello to you.

469
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:25,500
Right.

470
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,780
Please help me tell Mr. Kang that

471
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:32,060
I'll make sure everything is done right.

472
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:33,500
But...

473
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,040
intelligence is critical to solve the case.

474
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:37,260
If we know ourselves and the enemy,

475
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,260
we'll be invincible. You know that.

476
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:40,660
Of course.

477
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:44,520
That's what we do as the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

478
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,520
We're family.

479
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,960
Such a pleasure indeed.

480
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:01,850
Yu Zhiying suspects that the counterfeit factory is out of town.

481
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,040
What do you think?

482
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,980
We can't rule out the possibility of them wanting to shirk their responsibility.

483
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,200
This case is so serious.

484
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,800
If it really is in Shanghai,

485
00:21:09,920 --> 00:21:11,920
the Shanghai Police Department would be considered negligent.

486
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:13,980
He must push the responsibility out.

487
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:16,690
But maybe he knows what's up.

488
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,810
He's trying to cover up for others.

489
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,200
That's a presumption of guilt.

490
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,040
You can think so,

491
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,300
but you can't say that.

492
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:24,900
When the door is closed,

493
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,560
you can say whatever you want.

494
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,250
If it were up to you two

495
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:30,890
to do this,

496
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,750
where would you set up the factory?

497
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,350
Shanghai.

498
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,680
Why?

499
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:35,570
It's safe.

500
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,820
Shanghai's advanced industrial and commercial development

501
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,070
makes it ideal for large-scale distribution.

502
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:41,190
But if it is produced in another city,

503
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,060
and then shipped back to Shanghai,

504
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:43,800
they run the risk of

505
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,940
being discovered at every checkpoint.

506
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,200
It's extremely risky.

507
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:48,620
The checkpoints can be bought off.

508
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:50,540
But that will increase the cost.

509
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,190
And the more people who know, the greater the risk.

510
00:21:53,190 --> 00:21:55,250
They are just greedy, but not stupid.

511
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:59,110
I also think they are in Shanghai.

512
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:00,770
Destroying the coin's molds

513
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,040
is a matter of great importance for the party and the country.

514
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:02,900
In this matter,

515
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:06,050
I don't think the mint in Nanjing would dare to mess it up.

516
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:07,530
Then why did you still

517
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:10,060
lead them to investigate the case in Nanjing?

518
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:11,740
Anyone who can pull off a case of this magnitude

519
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,580
must have a lot of tricks up his sleeves.

520
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,570
He must have many spies.

521
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:15,280
I think

522
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,570
they must have

523
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:17,920
infiltrated the police department by now.

524
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,250
That's why I have to get the word out first.

525
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,160
We'll watch their next move.

526
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,640
You're pretending to be doing one thing,

527
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:25,080
while secretly doing something else?

528
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:25,630
Yes.

529
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,480
You two

530
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:29,650
have a lot of work ahead of you.

531
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,840
Congyun.

532
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:32,650
When the case files are here,

533
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:34,360
immediately arrange for people to start analyzing.

534
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,960
Let's see what new evidence we can find.

535
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,640
Yes, Sir.

536
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,490
Ruolai.

537
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,700
Next,

538
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,280
bring the sample of the counterfeit coins,

539
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:41,030
and look for Jinzhen.

540
00:22:41,030 --> 00:22:42,260
Be sure to avoid the police station,

541
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,040
as you go to the metallurgy department for a technical analysis.

542
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:45,170
Yes, I'll get going.

543
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:26,150
Ruolai.

544
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,530
This is Chief Liu from the metallurgy department of our factory.

545
00:23:31,530 --> 00:23:33,090
This is Wei Ruolai from Central Bank.

546
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,690
Hello, Chief.

547
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:34,320
Hello.

548
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:35,610
Here's the lab report.

549
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,360
Thank you.

550
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:39,700
After testing,

551
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:41,560
the silver content of this batch of silver coins

552
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,190
is only about 30 percent.

553
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:45,140
It's primarily manganese and lead,

554
00:23:45,140 --> 00:23:46,370
but mainly made of lead.

555
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:48,770
The rest of the specifics are in the report.

556
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:51,080
Any other discoveries?

557
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:52,940
We've analyzed the surface marks of the counterfeit coins,

558
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:54,140
such as burrs

559
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,970
and engravings,

560
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:57,490
to determine the degree of wear and tear.

561
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,640
The latest batch

562
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,900
were made just last week.

563
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:00,580
Last week?

564
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,870
Okay, I got it.

565
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,540
Thank you.

566
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,820
I must hurry and give it to Mr. Shen.

567
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:07,880
Wait.

568
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:09,190
Let me see you off.

569
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,400
This time, from production to distribution, the numbers are not small.

570
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,200
I don't think it's just anybody.

571
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,720
You must stay safe.

572
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,740
Be careful.

573
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:18,360
Okay.

574
00:24:23,270 --> 00:24:24,110
I'll be off.

575
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,610
Be careful.

576
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,660
Pick it up from inside.

577
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,730
Hurry up, hurry up.

578
00:24:57,850 --> 00:24:58,920
Pack it compact.

579
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,220
Otherwise, it will spill everywhere

580
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:01,450
once the car brakes.

581
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,320
Sir.

582
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:07,960
You are driving?

583
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,640
What's your name?

584
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:10,860
I'm Xu Zhongfeng.

585
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:11,980
What a good name.

586
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,810
Work hard and follow me in the future.

587
00:25:18,810 --> 00:25:20,110
You'll have a bright future.

588
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:20,970
Thank you, Sir.

589
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,750
Remember, this car is loaded with

590
00:25:24,770 --> 00:25:27,700
all the case files regarding the counterfeit coins.

591
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,340
You must be careful on the road.

592
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:30,650
Don't make any mistakes.

593
00:25:30,650 --> 00:25:31,850
Don't worry, Sir.

594
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,290
I promise I will deliver it well to Central Bank.

595
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:34,800
Good.

596
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:39,390
Take this packet of cigarette for the road.

597
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,860
Thank you, Sir.

598
00:25:43,430 --> 00:25:44,030
Get going.

599
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:48,930
Assistant Wei,

600
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,050
you even came to escort the car yourself?

601
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:51,910
This is a very important matter.

602
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:53,500
It's better to come in person.

603
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,650
Are all the case files in the car?

604
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,530
Don't worry.

605
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,600
I personally supervised it.

606
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,800
I dare say it's not even one page short.

607
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,640
Thank you.

608
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,120
We're supposed

609
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:03,940
to be cooperating with you.

610
00:26:04,330 --> 00:26:05,260
It's our duty.

611
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,610
Well then,

612
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:09,980
good luck with your journey, Brother.

613
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:11,640
Goodbye.

614
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:12,210
Goodbye.

615
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,600
Drive safely.

616
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,580
Be careful, okay?

617
00:26:16,730 --> 00:26:17,500
Okay.

618
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,960
See you.

619
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:32,300
You work for the Central Bank?

620
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:32,960
Yes.

621
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,240
I'm Advisor Shen's assistant.

622
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,420
That position is quite high, isn't it?

623
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,620
It's okay. I'm just a regular employee.

624
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,220
You get paid a lot, don't you?

625
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:43,880
It's okay.

626
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,960
I can make do and support my family. And yourself?

627
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,480
I'm a breadwinner too.

628
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,290
These two years have been pretty tough.

629
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:51,440
It was fine two years ago.

630
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:52,970
There are many drivers now.

631
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,280
I am planning to

632
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,970
go to Jiangxi for two years.

633
00:26:57,330 --> 00:26:58,800
They say you can make money driving military vehicles.

634
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,710
I'd like to drive a military vehicle.

635
00:27:00,710 --> 00:27:02,410
Isn't there a war going on in Jiangxi?

636
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,520
War is good.

637
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,890
It's easy to earn a lot of money during a war.

638
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,330
I have two daughters.

639
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,680
Their dowries are enough to keep me busy.

640
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,300
How old are your daughters?

641
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,810
My younger daughter is eight years old, and the older one is fifteen years old.

642
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,740
They're all pretty good-looking.

643
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,360
They are also diligent. They can do anything around the house.

644
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
Wake up, Brother.

645
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:11,930
Brother!

646
00:28:17,650 --> 00:28:18,450
Help!

647
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:19,970
Help!

648
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,170
Let me help you.

649
00:28:24,590 --> 00:28:24,880
Here.

650
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,250
Here.

651
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:37,630
Brother.

652
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:38,270
Brother!

653
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:38,830
Brother!

654
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:41,440
Brother, wake up.

655
00:28:42,650 --> 00:28:43,410
Are you okay?

656
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:49,810
Is anyone there?

657
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:34,610
[Shanghai Jiren Hospital]

658
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:51,090
Ruolai.

659
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:53,480
Sir.

660
00:29:54,030 --> 00:29:55,490
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

661
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,350
I'm fine.

662
00:29:57,450 --> 00:30:00,510
All the case files were burnt. This is the only box left.

663
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,680
Are you sure you are okay?

664
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,380
Yes.

665
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:09,130
Pull yourself together.

666
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:10,420
Don't be confused.

667
00:30:10,610 --> 00:30:11,740
Get it down clearly.

668
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:13,360
Hey!

669
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:14,820
Yu Zhiying.

670
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,190
What are you doing?

671
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:17,650
What are you doing?

672
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,850
Don't move!

673
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,590
Don't move!

674
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:23,090
Put your guns down!

675
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:24,210
Put it down!

676
00:30:32,110 --> 00:30:32,910
Mr. Shen.

677
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,410
What do you mean?

678
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,140
Yu Zhiying.

679
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,580
You are determined

680
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,150
to stand on the dark side, aren't you?

681
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,790
What do you mean?

682
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:43,110
Are you out of your mind?

683
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,410
Do you think I caused

684
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:46,320
this unlucky car accident?

685
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,900
You know who did it.

686
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,910
Let me tell you.

687
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,690
This case is through the roof.

688
00:30:50,690 --> 00:30:52,560
I'll get to the bottom of this.

689
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,760
By then, it won't just be a punch to your face.

690
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,360
Someone's going to get shot.

691
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:08,330
We don't know who will take the bullet.

692
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,960
They've really got a lot of nerve.

693
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,260
In order to destroy the case files,

694
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,030
they intentionally caused a car accident.

695
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,450
When I'm through with this case,

696
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:16,250
I'll have them

697
00:31:16,490 --> 00:31:17,190
all shot to death,

698
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:18,760
one by one.

699
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:20,960
I'm not worried about the case.

700
00:31:21,030 --> 00:31:21,870
But it's you

701
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,620
who must be careful these days.

702
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,620
They're anxious and desperate now.

703
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:26,590
I'm afraid

704
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:27,960
they'll try to kill you.

705
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,920
I know. Please don't worry, Sir.

706
00:31:30,330 --> 00:31:31,930
No matter who is behind them,

707
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,560
I'll get to the bottom of it.

708
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:34,200
Okay.

709
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,340
Come in.

710
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,120

712
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,090
Renovation?

713
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,200
What renovation?

714
00:31:52,430 --> 00:31:53,960
It started half a month ago.

715
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:56,070
Shanghai's Banking and Financial Services Union

716
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:57,530
donated a sum of money to us

717
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,180
specially for this renovation.

718
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,450
All the other offices are done.

719
00:32:00,450 --> 00:32:01,780
You're all that's left.

720
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:02,970
Now?

721
00:32:03,470 --> 00:32:04,690
They're all waiting outside.

722
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:05,540
Alright.

723
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,160
Anyway, be sure to do a check later.

724
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,120
Take the important things to the back room.

725
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,580
Remember to lock the door.

00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,310
Yes, Sir.

727
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:12,130
Tell them to hurry up.

728
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:12,520
Okay.

729
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,900
All right, go on in.

730
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,000
Hurry up while you are at it.

731
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,530
Don't go to the room inside,

732
00:32:32,570 --> 00:32:33,980
and don't move anything on the table.

733
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,110
Don't worry. We'll be as fast as we can.

735
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,500
Hello.

736
00:32:55,530 --> 00:32:57,400
May I know which ward Wei Ruolai is in?

737
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,610
Wei Ruolai? Let me check.

738
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:02,870
He is in 318.

Thank you.

Why are you here?

742
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,950
Why are you up?

00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,070
Are you okay?

00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:43,400
I'm fine.

Sir asked me to finish the checkup.

746
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,130
It's okay. Let me do it.

747
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:49,680
I can only be discharged after the checkup.

748
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,660

that something is wrong here.

940
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,760
So I took my men

941
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,010
to try and track and control them.

942
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,520
But I didn't expect that

943
00:41:51,830 --> 00:41:52,770
when they realised something is wrong,

944
00:41:52,770 --> 00:41:54,550
they confronted us at gunpoint.

945
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,090
Fortunately, there are two survivors.

946
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:57,020
Sir, look.

947
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:58,820
You killed so many of my brothers.

948
00:41:58,820 --> 00:41:59,990
I won't let you off!

949
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,680
Behave!

950
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,030
Sir.

951
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:15,540
This is the batch that is circulated on the market.

952
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,740
So, this is their lair.

953
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,540
Have you all gotten anything out of them?

954
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,450
Kill me.

955
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,250
I won't say a word.

956
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:24,940
We won't say a word.

957
00:42:24,970 --> 00:42:26,210
This way, Sir.

958
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:27,850
Mr. Shen.

959
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:29,900
Mr. Shen.

960
00:42:30,950 --> 00:42:31,950
This way, please.

961
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:37,210
As you can see,

962
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,180
they're a bunch of fugitives.

963
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,290
Since they dare to take the risk,

964
00:42:40,290 --> 00:42:41,690
it won't be easy to get them to confess.

965
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:42,630
How about I take them back

966
00:42:42,630 --> 00:42:43,630
and do something?

967
00:42:43,710 --> 00:42:44,830
Don't worry. I'll let you know

968
00:42:44,830 --> 00:42:46,360
as soon as I get any updates.

969
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,230
Okay, Captain Lin.

970
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,220
Congyun.

971
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:50,530
Inform our Bank

972
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,020
to send staff here to gather evidence.

973
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,490
Yes.
