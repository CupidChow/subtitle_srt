Also,

00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:19,040
in the counterfeit coin case,

71
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,270
just as all the evidence pointed to Zhabei,

00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,670
Lin Qiaosong put up a show

73
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,150
of cracking the case right there in Zhabei.

74
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,070
The timing was too convenient.

75
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,510
But you personally sent the transaction orders

76
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,710
by phone.

77
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:35,710
Even if Mr. Liu had wanted to leak them,

78
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,520
he wouldn't have had the time.

79
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,460
Besides, when you made the calls,

80
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,360
the door to your room was locked.

81
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,280
No one could know what you said.

82
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:46,460

83
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,100
They listened in on me. I can't believe it!

84
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:36,340
They must have tampered with the phone

85
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,940
during the last renovation.

86
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
To set me up,

87
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,690
they went to such lengths.

88
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:42,870
Instead of listening in on the Communist Party,

89
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:44,930
they listened in on their own co-worker?

90
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,930
Are they crazy?

91
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,040
At this point,

92
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,430
Mr. Shen,

93
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:52,270
we can only go to Nanjing to report it to Mr. Chiang.

94
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,070
It's useless.

95
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,330
Why?

96
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:56,230
They went too far this time!

97
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:57,950
Nanjing won't let them get away with it!

98
00:07:57,950 --> 00:07:58,950
Think about it.

99
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,830
It's such a big deal.

100
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,750
Is it possible that the higher-ups are completely in the dark?

101
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,230
Apparently, they've made the Central Bank

102
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,430
the scapegoat this time.

103
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:06,870
They reaped the benefits from the shadows

104
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,920
and made bank,

105
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,300
while the Central Bank

106
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:10,590
took the fall for them.

107
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,390
Mr. Shen.

108
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,540
It's such a thankless job.

109
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,500
Do you still want to do it?

110
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,050
No.

111
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:31,330
Not at all.

112
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,320
I'm not cleaning up the mess.

113
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,640
I'll resign tomorrow.

114
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:36,500
Okay.

115
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:38,240

Shut up.

118
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,140
This is none of your business!

119
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,280
Shut up! Shut up!

120

Something's happened.

123
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,390
What happened?

124
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,290
A bunch of robbers came.

125
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,200
Robbers? What do they want?

126
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,670
How dare they rob me?

127
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,590
I'll call the police to have you arrested.

128
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,790
Move! Who are they?

129
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,120
Perfect timing.

130
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,040
Hand over the house now.

131
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,860
And the laundry room.

Mr. Zhao.

133
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:26,750

143
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:43,590
This is the contract she signed with me.

144
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,930
She mortgaged her house on Qibao Street to me,

145
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,720

Put your thumb here, and we're even.

159
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,280
You shouldn't have bought treasury bills.

160

Don't hurt her!

What happened, Ms. Zhou?

167
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:47,080
Help me.

168
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:50,520
They… They want to rob me of my house.

169
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,880
Rob?

170
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,530
Tenants, you all saw it just now, didn't you?

171
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:56,500
The contract we signed is real.

172
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:58,110
The money I lent her is real too.

173
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,020
How can she welsh on her debt?

174
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,390
But you can't beat her!

175
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:01,240
What happened, Ms. Zhou?

176
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Why do you owe them so much money?

177
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,670
The house is mine now.

178
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:07,470
You all need to sign a new lease.

179
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,320
Otherwise, all of you have to move out in one day.

180
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,590
Mr. Zhao.

181
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,710
What happened, Ms. Zhou?

182
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,740
My house.

183
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,580
Where am I going to leave?

184
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,190
Wei.

185
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,220
My house!

186
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:35,790
Careful.

187
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,030
If she dies,

188
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,650
who's going to pay the money?

189
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,370
I heard that you work at the Central Bank,

190
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,630
and you told them

191
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,300
to buy treasury bills.

192
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:49,170
Mr. Zhao. Mr. Zhao.

00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:51,470
Mr. Zhao, it was…

194
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:52,310
It was he…

195
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,610
It was he who told us to buy treasury bills.

196
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:57,420
He works at the Central Bank.

197
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,710
We bought the Central Bank's treasury bills.

198
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:04,040
Now that we've taken a loss, should the Central Bank take the responsibility?

199
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Wei.

200
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,950
Answer me honestly.

201
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,710
Haven't I been nice to you?

202
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:14,910
My house!

203
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,730
My house!

204
00:12:23,550 --> 00:12:25,110
Don't be a sore loser.

205
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:27,310
Investment is risky.

206
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:29,430
The stock market is risky.

207
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,280
Ruolai warned you

208
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:36,610
not to overplay your hand or borrow money.

209
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,520
You were too greedy!

210
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:41,060
That's nonsense.

211
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,030
Nonsense.

212
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:46,510
Don't you know I don't have a husband or a son?

213
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,870
I didn't buy treasury bills because I wanted to be rich when I was old.

214
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,930
I just wanted to support the country.

215
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:05,520
Enough. Enough.

216
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,170
I'll give you one day.

217
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,310
Let's go.

218
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,390
Has the treasury bill incident had an impact on you?

219
00:13:57,390 --> 00:13:58,390
Yeah.

220
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:00,910
I came to the Central Bank

221
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:02,360
to make a contribution to the country.

222
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,480
Now it seems that

223
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,110
the country doesn't need it.

224
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,630
Therefore,

225
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,000
I'm going to resign tomorrow.

226
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:13,030
Really?

227
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:16,070
Dad, you can play with me every day after you resign.

228
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,760
Yeah.

229
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:19,120
I'll play with you every day in the future.

230
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,950
Just eat. Stay quiet.

231
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,560
Here.

232
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:26,430
What?

233
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:30,200
Have you completely lost faith in Nanjing this time?

234
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,340
Not exactly,

235
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:35,580
because I never put too much faith in it.

236
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:37,710
It's just that

237
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:40,410
I didn't expect them to go so far.

238
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,410
Just when things were looking up, it all came crashing down again.

239
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,340
They're absurd.

240
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,680
Have you ever thought about

241
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,860
why things ended up like this?

242
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,630
When power is unchecked,

243
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,880
laws are flawed,

244
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:00,750
and family interests override national ones,

245
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,610
the system loses its capacity to correct mistakes.

246
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,350
What a pity.

247
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,060
Will things take a turn for the better?

248
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:09,470
I don't think so.

249
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,850
Alright. Let's not talk about this. Eat up.

250
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,400
Eat up.

251
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,470
[The Treasury Department issued construction treasury bills.]

252
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,470
[Relieve war victims, rebuild post-war Shanghai, and enrich ourselves.]

253
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:33,470
[Everyone should buy treasury bills.]

254
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:00,990
Eat something.

255
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:03,550
Have a rest.

256
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,640
I'll put it here.

257
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,990
Drink it later.

258
00:16:32,690 --> 00:16:34,690
We'll burn joss paper for Wen later.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,800
Don't think too much.

260
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,970
It's not entirely your fault.

261
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:52,390
They were too greedy.

262
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:55,650
They shouldn't have borrowed money to buy treasury bills.

263
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,430
If I hadn't given the nod,

264
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,560
they wouldn't have done it.

265
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:04,619
If you asked them to die,

266
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,119
would they die as you said?

267
00:17:07,310 --> 00:17:08,550
Who should we blame?

268
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,660
We should blame those who manipulated the price behind the scenes.

269
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,140
They took a loss

270
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:15,069
but didn't have the guts to confront the big shots,

271
00:17:15,069 --> 00:17:15,990
so they kept berating you,

272
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:17,710
who only did the grunt work.

273
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:21,710
They're ridiculous.

274
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,680
Wen.

275
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,990
Come and take the money.

276
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,750
A few years ago,

277
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,750
I went bankrupt

278
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,250
and came to hide here.

279
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:29,050
I never imagined

280
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,470
it would happen again.

281
00:18:32,510 --> 00:18:33,540
This time,

282
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,550
things are even worse than they were last time.

283
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,890
The people in Shanghai

284
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:45,950
have all been milked dry.

285
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:50,230
It'll take about a decade

286
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,150
for them to recover from it.

287
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,350
Sorry.

288
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,070
I didn't lose money.

289
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:04,470
Why did you apologize to me?

290
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,720
Ms. Zhou lost her house.

291
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:09,870
You'll have to move away.

292
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:12,670
I've been planning to leave anyway.

293
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,340
My son found a job in Hong Kong.

294
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:19,670
He wrote to me and asked me to live with him.

295
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,810
I didn't want to leave these neighbors,

296
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,310
so I dawdled for a few months.

297
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,110
The ship ticket has expired.

298
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:29,340
Hong Kong is great.

299
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:33,010
I heard that it's even more prosperous than Shanghai.

300
00:19:33,010 --> 00:19:35,140
And there's no Kuomintang scum there!

301
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:37,550
Ruolai.

302
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:40,140
You're smart

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:42,890
and kind.

304
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,950
You're not cut out for this.

305
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,150
When you work in finance in Shanghai,

306
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,840
you have to be cold-hearted,

307
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:55,650
or you can't survive.

308
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:56,970
This time,

309
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:00,050
Shen will be the scapegoat.

310
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:02,220
Even if you're capable

311
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,170
and have aspirations,

312
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,910
it's useless.

313
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,940
He's not from those families.

314
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,320
This was doomed to happen from the very beginning.

315
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,660
It's Luwan District.

316
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:41,870
The house is in Luwan District.

317
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,380
Son.

318
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,070
You're back.

319
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:54,270
Why did you go to Luwan?

320
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,390
Did you eat the soup I made for you?

321
00:21:00,210 --> 00:21:00,940
Honey.

322
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,550
Honey.

323
00:21:05,630 --> 00:21:07,030
I've thought it through.

324
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,020
The apartment is better.

325
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,930
I'm not used to living in a villa.

326
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Is it a villa?

327
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,400
How about we go to check out the house in Luwan tomorrow?

328
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,860
Houses in Luwan are great.

329
00:21:26,620 --> 00:21:30,470
They have gas and bathrooms.

330
00:21:31,010 --> 00:21:31,760
Ms. Zhou.

331
00:21:32,950 --> 00:21:34,200
Are you okay?

332
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,870
You're my son's girlfriend.

333
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,880
Where are you from?

334
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,910
Jiangxi.

335
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,200
Where are your parents?

336
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:53,100
They're from Jiangxi too.

337
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:55,740
My son is getting married.

338
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:57,430
Do you have money?

339
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:00,620
My son works at the Central Bank.

340
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,110
If you don't have money,

341
00:22:02,110 --> 00:22:03,240
his colleagues

342
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,000
will laugh at him.

343
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:13,480
Do you want to check out the house?

344
00:22:14,070 --> 00:22:14,830
Do you?

345
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,880
Yes.

346
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:17,940
Ms. Zhou.

347
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,080
Houses in Luwan are great.

348
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:24,330
They were built by French people.

349
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:26,930
It's just that they're a bit expensive.

350
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:29,910
But the whole family can live there.

351
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,160
My son is getting married.

352
00:22:40,210 --> 00:22:41,870
He'll have children.

353
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,960
I'll send them to school.

354
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,500
I need to do grocery shopping too.

355
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:49,150
I'll send them to school.

356
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:51,010
I need to do grocery shopping too.

357
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,620
The city is covered in blood and tears.

358
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:00,540
The sins are too hideous

359
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:06,170
and numerous to tell.

360
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,900
Ming Da.

361
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,390
Tunan.

362
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,280
Please come in.

363
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,690
I won't go in.

364
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,550
After relaying the message,

365
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,210
I need to go back to Mr. Chiang.

366
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,910
Does Mr. Chiang have any instructions?

367
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,110
He said

368
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,100
a unified financial front

369
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:09,670
is of utmost importance to the military unification of the country.

370
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,990
The financial sector of Shanghai must stay stable.

371
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:14,260
The overall situation of financial regulation

372
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,460
must not be tarnished in the slightest.

373
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,240
Mr. Song wants you

374
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,570
to clean up the mess caused by construction treasury bills.

375
00:24:22,070 --> 00:24:23,110
This task

376
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,530
is very challenging.

377
00:24:33,350 --> 00:24:34,410
Zhongzheng Sword.

378
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,630
You should know

379
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,790

00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,630
Anyway,

569
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:38,270
the culprits must be punished.

570
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:40,650
Have you found anything?

571
00:34:40,650 --> 00:34:41,409
No.

572
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,810
I'll check over there.

573
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,400
This matter has caused a sensation,

574
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,160
yet Mr. Chiang doesn't know about it.

575
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,490
Do you think he was deceived by his family?

576
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,730
As far as we can tell,

577
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:17,280
Mr. Chiang is still in the dark.

578
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,480
I found one.

579
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,250
See if it's a transaction list.

580
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,180
Yes.

581
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:32,810
Yes.

582
00:35:33,140 --> 00:35:35,000
These are all transaction lists.

583
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:56,850
Boys.

584
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,200
Chop, chop.

585
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:58,940
Go up.

586
00:36:12,210 --> 00:36:13,060
Remember,

587
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,870
if anyone asks,

588
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,150
tell them

589
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,350
that those gamblers

590
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:19,710
are sore losers

591
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:22,080
and set this place ablaze out of spite.

592
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,470
After the fire starts,

593
00:36:23,510 --> 00:36:25,710
we'll put it out at the risk of our lives.

594
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,270
We'll definitely be rewarded afterward.

595
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,450
You're so smart, Director.

596
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,390
Light it.

597
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,390
A high-ranking official of the Shanghai Police Department

598
00:36:39,390 --> 00:36:40,830
led his subordinates to set a fire

599
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:42,230
to destroy the evidence.

600
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:43,550
Do you think

601
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,950
this is solid evidence?

602
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,880
Let's go.

603
00:36:53,550 --> 00:36:53,990
Let's go.

604
00:36:53,990 --> 00:36:54,390
Hurry.

605
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,580
Look.

606
00:37:25,250 --> 00:37:27,330
This number is a bit off, isn't it?

607
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,770
Look.

608
00:37:53,730 --> 00:37:55,460
These are all the same company.

609
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,660
I found it.

610
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,160
I've figured it out.

611
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,110
The evidence is solid.

612
00:38:58,110 --> 00:39:00,170
They can't get away with it this time.

613
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:00,750
Really?

614
00:39:00,750 --> 00:39:01,390
Yeah.

615
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:07,440
Great.

616
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,030
Ruolai.

617
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,190
Give this settlement list to me.

618
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,750
We'll make it public

619
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:13,790
in our own way.

620
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:18,040
I want to give Mr. Shen another chance.

621
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,760
You can choose to give it to him.

622
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,560
But I wish you could think twice.

623
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,510
He was going to resign,

624
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,310
but the top brass

625
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:29,390
sent him a Zhongzheng Sword

626
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:32,040
and made it impossible for him to back out.

627
00:39:33,670 --> 00:39:35,070
He's my master after all.

628
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:39,000
I want to give him a chance to make up for his mistake.

629
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,130
I need this chance as well.

630
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,990
Okay.

631
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,780
I respect your decision.

632
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,240
I share your grief

633
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:10,160
over the treasury bill incident.

634
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:14,640
I know there are all kinds of rumors out there.

635
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:15,510
So,

636
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,640
I want to tell you for sure again

637
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:21,210
that the top brass of our government

638
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:24,630
had no part in it.

639
00:40:25,510 --> 00:40:26,830
The so-called conspiracy

640
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:28,350
is total nonsense.

641
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:30,150
Fortunately, we acted promptly

642
00:40:30,150 --> 00:40:31,230
and have obtained

643
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,390
a large number of transaction lists from the exchange.

644
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:34,390
After analysis,

645
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,520
the culprit behind this incident

646
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,990
is a Japanese speculator

647
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,150
called Shinichi Fukuda.

648
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:42,990
Later,

649
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:45,110
major newspapers will publish articles to denounce it.

650
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:47,270
We must speak with one voice,

651
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:50,050
diverting public attention outward.

652
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,160
We cannot let this incident

653
00:40:52,310 --> 00:40:53,630
adversely affect

654
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:55,430
the stable financial situation

655
00:40:55,710 --> 00:40:57,390
we have established.

656
00:40:58,060 --> 00:40:59,940
As for the losses caused by subscriptions

657
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:01,240
at the fundraising event,

658
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,640
the Central Bank will compensate for them.

659
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,000
Do you have any questions?

660
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:14,190
Advisor Shen.

661
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,070
You handled it very appropriately.

662
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:17,070
I fully agree.

663
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:19,230
What does everyone else think?

664
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,760
Since there's nothing else,

665
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,810
the meeting is dismissed.

666
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,470
Thank you for understanding.

667
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,430
I'll take care of it.

668
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,740
Thank you, Chief Deng.

669
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,930
Congyun.

670
00:42:01,650 --> 00:42:02,410
It's fine.

671
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,830
Why did you come?

672
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:10,310
Mr. Shen.

673
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:13,030
I don't know

674
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,870
when you got the transaction lists.

675
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:15,910
Because last night,

676
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:17,190
the file room where the lists were stored

677
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:18,590
was burned to ashes by Yu Zhiying.

678
00:42:18,590 --> 00:42:19,850
I got the list in my hand

679
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:21,720
before he set the fire.

680
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:29,880
The culprit is not

681
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,340
some Japanese speculator

682
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,070
but the wife of a senior official in the Treasury Department.

683
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,870
She's the biggest market maker.

684
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:48,820
Yu Shiqing,

685
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:49,630
Kang Shaojie,

686
00:42:49,630 --> 00:42:50,560
Zhang Mingquan,

687
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:51,870
and Huang Daowu were also involved.

688
00:42:51,870 --> 00:42:53,050
They played the market together

689
00:42:53,050 --> 00:42:55,020
as the counterparty to the Central Bank

690
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:57,070
and unjustly profited to the tune of 15 million silver coins.
