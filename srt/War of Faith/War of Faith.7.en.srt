[Episode 7]

4
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:45,600
Come in.

5
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:49,600
Sir.

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,280
This is the gradebook.

7
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,440
Wei Ruolai's score ranks at the bottom for the daily assessment?

8
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,810
Is this score objective?

9
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,890
The assessment determines

10
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,330
their final work position.

11
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:06,650
I dare not be selfish.

12
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,330
Tell me the truth, do you wish for him to stay

13
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:09,520
or do you wish for him to leave?

14
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,449
Once there is a wish,

15
00:02:10,449 --> 00:02:12,050
it won't be a neutral attitude anymore,

16
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,370
but I didn't expect for Wei Ruolai's score

17
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,640
to be average.

18
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,600
Sir,

19
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,920
I think with Wei Ruolai's grades,

20
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,180
he doesn't deserve to be your assistant.

21
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:23,640
How about we choose another one

22
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,840
from the top scorers?

23
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:27,579
Gather all the new trainees

24
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,750
for me.

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,240
Chief Deng and the assistant manager for training

26
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,290
must be present too.

27
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,620
I want to see the results

28
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,260
of this period's training.

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,310
Yes, sir.

30
00:02:35,329 --> 00:02:36,530
I'll inform them now.

31
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:51,370
The results of the written exam is out.

32
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,850
As a written exam, it's heavy on theory and light on practice.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,730
Thus, I think this year

34
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,400
needs some reforms.

35
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,690
How do you plan to reform it?

36
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,040
I think every trainee

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,240
has a department and position

38
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,970
that they want to be in.

39
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,730
Everyone has their own strengths too.

40
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,880
We can hold a skill competition.

41
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:12,720
The winner will get priority for choosing their post.

42
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,650
The loser will be assigned a post.

43
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,240
Everyone,

44
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:18,790
since I started working for Mr. Shen,

45
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,490
I've had a hand in the business

46
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,640
of all departments.

47
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,670
I believe I haven't lost the basic skills.

48
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,310
This time, I will act as

49
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:27,570
everyone's practical examiner.

50
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:31,420
Anyone who can defeat him will be among the top students.

51
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,690
What does this mean?

52
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:35,780
He's going against all of us by himself.

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,820
That's wild.

00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,540
begin.

59
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,400
He's truly fast.

00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:22,180
Amazing.

-Assistant Manager Liu,

79
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
I have something to say.

80
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,540
Okay, go ahead.

81
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,930
We all witnessed

82
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,100
the skills competitions just now.

83
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,659
There were so many rounds,

84
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,740
but only Wang Shanbin

85
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,850
tied with Secretary Huang in one round.

86
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:51,240
In the rest of the rounds,

87
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,170
all of you lost.

88
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:56,800
However, don't hang your heads or feel discouraged.

89
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,440
Losing means there's still room for improvement.

90
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,200
As long as you keep working hard,

91
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,200
your skills will improve.

92
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,730
Do you have the confidence?

93
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:05,740
Yes.

94
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,260
Wei Ruolai.

95
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,240
Sir.

96
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,930
Everyone competed just now.

97
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,610
Do you not have the thought or impulsion

98
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,960
to have a match with Secretary Huang too?

99
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,040
Secretary Huang said before

100
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,250
that I'm your personal assistant.

101
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,250
I need to be on standby 24 hours a day,

102
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:26,290
so

103
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:29,690
I didn't take some of the classes.

104
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,480
So,

105
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,230
I'll pass.

106
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:33,600
Assistant Manager Liu,

107
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,930
is what Wei Ruolai said true?

108
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:38,700
He indeed missed many classes.

109
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,159
I thought he was skipping class.

110
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,070
I didn't expect

111
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,560
that you had other plans.

112
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,860
What did I say to you when you joined the company?

113
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,780
I must strive for the best

114
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:52,640
for the daily and regular assessments.

115
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,040
Have you tried your best?

116
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,960
Good luck.

117
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,850
Good luck.

118
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,220
Accounting

119
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,130
is the hub of all subjects.

120
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,930
Next, we'll compete in settlements.

121
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,520
Settlements?

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
The daily settlements

123
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,650
are all managed by capable managers or assistant managers.

124
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,970
The data volume is huge.

125
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,320
It's easy to make mistakes.

126
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,320
Are you really going to have them compete?

127
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,980
Wei Ruolai,

128
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,040
do you want to compete?

129
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,840
Whatever you say, sir.

130
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,450
I'll compete in whatever you say.

131
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:29,250
You can start when you're ready.

132
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,830
Alright.

133
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:41,600
Ready.

134
00:08:43,299 --> 00:08:43,900
Start.

135
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,180
Oh no.

136
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,650
We've lost again.

137
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:13,640
Not necessarily.

138
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,730
This isn't just a test of speed.

139
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,060
It also tests accuracy.

140
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:28,990
The result is out. Why is he still calculating?

141
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,570
The settlement results...

142
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,010
Huang Congyun, completely correct.

143
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:52,160
He lost.

144
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,800
He lost.

145
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:00,080
He really did lose.

146
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,370
Wei Ruolai's result

147
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:08,770
is also correct,

148
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,120
but...

149
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,260
But what?

150
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,500
Why don't you look at it yourself?

151
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,850
What's wrong?

152
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:23,780
Did I read it right?

153
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,140
What?

154
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:28,100
No way.

155
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:35,050
You did a week's worth of settlements?

156
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,640
Only one day is enough.

157
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
He really did a week?

158
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
The ledger is for a week.

159
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,810
How is that possible?

160
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,110
Did you calculate it beforehand?

161
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,010
No.

162
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,350
You cheated.

163
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,160
How could he cheat?

164
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,480
Alright.

165
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,450
Please be quiet.

166
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:01,170
Congyun,

167
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,280
you're too tired from all the competition rounds today.

168
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,200
Your results are good enough,

169
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,080
but in this round,

170
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:11,300
it's indeed Wei Ruolai who won.

171
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:22,270
Ruolai.

172
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:23,950
-Sir.
-As agreed,

173
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,160
you can choose your job first.

174
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,170
You can stay by my side

175
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:28,990
or choose a new position.

176
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,500
What's your choice?

177
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,890
Sir,

178
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,940
I still want to be your assistant.

179
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,120
Say something.

180
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:43,450
Say something.

181
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:46,570
Say something.

182
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:49,760
First, I want to thank Secretary Huang

183
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,000
for showing me mercy.

184
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,780
I also want to thank Mr. Shen—

185
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,640
No need to be polite.

186
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,440
I just want to say the same thing.

187
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
Do your best and don't embarrass me.

188
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:00,400
Yes.

189
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,610
I will work hard.

190
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:04,600
Great.

191
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,330
Wait.

192
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:44,340
Sir.

193
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,720
Congyun,

194
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,480
do you not like Ruolai?

195
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:55,380
No, sir.

196
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,170
No?

197
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,490
Sorry, sir.

198
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:02,100
I can't hide anything from you.

199
00:14:02,890 --> 00:14:04,130
I just think Wei Ruolai

200
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:05,260
is a little strange,

201
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,920
especially his political background.

202
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,370
I called him out today

203
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:11,640
because I wanted to see

204
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:13,680
whether he has been focusing on his work recently.

205
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,950
His grades are good,

206
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,330
but to be honest,

207
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,650
I'm worried about his mindset too.

208
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:48,400
I told you to investigate his background.

209
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,360
Any results?

210
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:50,850
We're still investigating.

211
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:51,730
I want to

212
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,730
visit as many of his teachers and classmates as possible

213
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,600
and screen all his details.

214
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,720
After all, as your personal assistant,

215
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,800
I will never allow him to have any mistakes.

216
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,910
It's right to be careful.

217
00:15:01,910 --> 00:15:04,110
Give me the results as soon as possible.

218
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:07,010
After all, no one is willing to trust and accept

219
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,170
an opaque person.

220
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:09,910
Yes, sir.

221
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,560
Boss.

222
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:26,360
Check please.

223
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:31,960
Okay.

224
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,400
We're leaving.

225
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,560
Boss!

226
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:45,170
Stop!

227
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:21,390
Are you okay?

228
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,200
Friend,

229
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,270
help me.

230
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,790
Thank you for today.

231
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:50,320
Without you,

232
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,690
I would have been arrested.

233
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,470
I'm so useless.

234
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,560
Not only did I not find your brother,

235
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,590
but I even exposed myself.

236
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,390
Have you been looking for my brother?

237
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,609
What your brother brought

238
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,520
from Jiangxi this time is too important.

239
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:14,040
It can save lives.

240
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,140
Ruolai,

241
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:20,079
the safe has the money to save lives.

242
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,520
Besides,

243
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,450
he almost died

244
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,210
in order to come Shanghai.

245
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:28,520
Even if I have to risk my life,

246
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,610
I must find him

247
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,480
and get the item.

248
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,300
How did my brother

249
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,680
live all these years?

250
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:53,760
Your brother

251
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,690
these years...

252
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:58,450
Ruolai,

253
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,090
there are some things you shouldn't know.

254
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Our organization has disciplines.

255
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:07,300
I can't tell you these things.

256
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,680
Ruolai.

257
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,930
I'm just worried.

258
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:15,760
I'm afraid that you might

259
00:18:16,090 --> 00:18:17,520
say something that harms

260
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,350
the organization when facing bad guys in the future.

261
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,250
Is the organization

262
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,900
this important to you all?

263
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:27,170
Yes, very important.

264
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:32,770
For you,

265
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,930
you may think we are a bunch of crazy people,

266
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,770
but our comrades all fiercely believe

267
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,860
that only the Communist Party

268
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,150
can save China.

269
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,540
Aren't you afraid of dying?

270
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,000
Come.

271
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,730
Help me.

272
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,050
If it benefits the country,

273
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,210
I can risk my life.

274
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:26,390
How can I only avoid misfortunes

275
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:28,690
and go toward fortunes?

276
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,980
Where are you going?

277
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:41,130
Ruolai,

278
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:42,910
they'll

279
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,490
still be able to find me here.

280
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:47,210
I can't implicate you.

281
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,850
If they ask you,

282
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:50,140
just insist

283
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:52,140
that you've never seen me.

284
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:54,440
Take care.

285
00:19:58,490 --> 00:19:59,280
Wait.

286
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:08,320
Sorry, Shengda.

287
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,430
I lied to you.

288
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,360
My brother...

289
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:23,610
He's dead.

290
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:24,800
What?

291
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,960
Your brother is dead?

292
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,080
Comrade Ruochuan,

293
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,100
how could you leave like this?

294
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,010
Here.

295
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:03,090
You left

296
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:06,140
and now, I'm truly alone.

297
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:08,370
Didn't we agree

298
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,820
that after the revolution succeeds,

299
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,800
I...

300
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,640
We'll end

301
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,750
this life of hiding?

302
00:21:19,570 --> 00:21:21,630
We'll go to your hometown in Jiangxi.

303
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:23,920
We'll eat spicy fish together

304
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:25,800
and look at the woods.

305
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,370
Why did you break your promise?

306
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,420
Let me drink to you.

307
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,320
Ruolai.

308
00:21:54,250 --> 00:21:54,810
I'm fine.

309
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,780
Let me kowtow to you.

310
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,500
Ruolai,

311
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,130
your brother won't die in vain.

312
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,210
Our organization

313
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:21,700
will avenge him.

314
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,560
Think carefully.

315
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:30,490
Did your brother leave anything

316
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,380
before he died?

317
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,930
He did give me some things,

318
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:39,810
but

319
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,050
he asked me to give them to your group.

320
00:22:42,050 --> 00:22:43,040
Where are they?

321
00:22:45,050 --> 00:22:46,870
They're in a safe in the Central Bank.

322
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:48,150
I took a peek.

323
00:22:48,530 --> 00:22:49,960
It's 20 gold bars.

324
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:51,480
Great.

325
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,640
That is the most important thing

326
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,170
your brother brought from Jiangxi.

327
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:56,240
Give it to me now.

328
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:58,170
I'll quickly give it to the organization.

329
00:22:58,170 --> 00:22:58,690
No.

330
00:22:59,050 --> 00:22:59,910
My brother said

331
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:02,080
it must be given to one of you

332
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,540
who knows the secret code.

333
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,880
The exchange rate is weird today.

334
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,740
Do you want yellow or green goods?

335
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,850
Fewer yellow and more green goods.

336
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,980
You are the person my brother was looking for.

337
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,590
It's me.

338
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:12,690
Why didn't you go to the Central Bank on the scheduled day?

339
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,210
I was targeted by the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

340
00:23:14,210 --> 00:23:15,480
I couldn't get away.

341
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:16,790
Ruolai,

342
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:18,690
you must be careful in the future.

343
00:23:18,690 --> 00:23:20,010
Things are urgent now.

344
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,690
If they know about

345
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,500
your relationship with Ruochuan,

346
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,690
you will be in danger.

347
00:23:24,690 --> 00:23:26,360
Okay, I'll be careful.

348
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,150
Give it to me now.

349
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,530
It's not on me.

350
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,200
The key and the seal are in the bank.

351
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,280
I'll go to work tomorrow

352
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,420
and withdraw the gold.

353
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,840
Come to my house and get it.

354
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,480
No.

355
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:40,120
It's too obvious.

356
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,510
How about this?

357
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,270
Give me the key and the seal.

358
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:46,200
I'll find a chance to withdraw it myself.

359
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,280
Your brother is gone.

360
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:51,620
I must protect your safety.

361
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:56,150
Okay.

362
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,810
That Sichuan restaurant is really good.

363
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,700
Yes, the spicy pork is delicious.

364
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,740
Wei, are you coming to the dinner?

365
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,060
I'm not going. You all can go.

366
00:24:11,060 --> 00:24:12,210
Okay, we're leaving.

367
00:24:12,210 --> 00:24:13,360
Bye.

368
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,490
You've worked hard.

369
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,080
It's a few minutes away.

370
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:17,640
Hurry up.

371
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,610
I'm hungry.

372
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:54,890
Wei!

373
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,160
Wen, why are you here?

374
00:24:57,490 --> 00:24:59,170
I found out about the Rixin Bookstore

375
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,120
you mentioned last time.

376
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,050
It's in Jing'an.

377
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:06,610
[No. 107, Jing'an Temple Road]

378
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,460
Okay.

379
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:08,930
We can talk about these things at home in the future.

380
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:10,010
You don't have to come here.

381
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:10,770
It's okay.

382
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:12,230
I don't have much work recently.

383
00:25:12,230 --> 00:25:13,000
It's no problem.

384
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,530

This is too much.

You didn't get caught. Plus, you're not

00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,730
part of the Investigation and Arrest Unit. What are you so arrogant for?

467

00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,620
Where are the things?

00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,290
They're in a safe in the Central Bank.

00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:14,490

00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,640
on Wei Ruolai's background check.

479
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,700
Please have a look.

480
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:40,520
Report verbally.

481
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,850
From my understanding,

482
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,320
Wei Ruolai's interpersonal relationships in Shanghai

483
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,650
are relatively simple.

484
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,330
I secretly visited his teachers and classmates.

485
00:32:47,330 --> 00:32:48,350
So far,

486
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,610
no suspicion of him colluding with Communists has been found.

487
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:53,610
What about his book borrowing records?

488
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:55,810
I've recorded them all in the appendix.

489
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,280
Judging from the list,

490
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,200
he doesn't seem to have anything to do with the Communist Party.

491
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,560
Why do you think so, sir?

492
00:33:13,590 --> 00:33:15,650
These books are all about economics.

493
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:18,040
It has nothing to do with the Bolsheviks.

494
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,010
Is it possible that

495
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:21,240
he hasn't had the chance to engage with it?

496
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,600
Of course he's had chances.

497
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:23,730
Lin Qiaosong and his team

498
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:25,560
secretly cooperate with the schools

499
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,680
and deliberately put some banned books

500
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,800
in the libraries.

501
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,290
They'll have their eyes

502
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,920
on whoever borrows the books.

503
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,580
These people are everywhere.

504
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,210
Fortunately, I didn't do it.

505
00:33:34,210 --> 00:33:35,970
Could you enter the Central Bank if you did?

506
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,350
Alright, go back to work.

507
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,050
Yes, sir.

508
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:58,940
Sir, how much for a reading?

509
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,980
Fifty silver dollars for a palm reading.

510
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,210
Eighty for a face reading.

511
00:34:02,210 --> 00:34:04,060
Why don't you just go rob a bank?

512
00:34:04,090 --> 00:34:05,350
What's wrong with you?

513
00:34:06,110 --> 00:34:07,640
What kind of person are you?

514
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,409
Sir, I want a palm reading.

515
00:34:36,380 --> 00:34:37,380
How is it going?

516
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,500
Lonely Star has died.

517
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:51,170
He's Wei Ruolai's brother.

518
00:34:51,170 --> 00:34:52,830
His real name is Wei Ruochuan.

519
00:34:59,310 --> 00:35:00,170
I didn't expect

520
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,920
he was Wei Ruolai's brother.

521
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,290
I was there that day.

522
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:17,790
I was just one crossing away.

523
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:21,860
I failed to cover him.

524
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,330
It's all my fault.

525
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:39,850
Wei Ruolai was dragged into this.

526
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,900
The person who followed and approached him is called Li Shengda.

527
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,280
He's in charge of Rixin Bookstore,

528
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:48,430
Lonely Star's last stop in Shanghai.

529
00:36:07,620 --> 00:36:08,780
Did someone

530
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:10,690
betray us?

531
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:13,200
Yes.

532
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,430
Traitor.

533
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,090
I'll get rid of the traitor as soon as possible.

534
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:19,270
Put that off.

535
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,120
The most important thing now

536
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:22,850
is the gold bars.

537
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,170
Tonight,

538
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:27,550
Wei Ruolai will bring the key to the safe

539
00:36:28,810 --> 00:36:31,890
and Lonely Star's seal to Li Shengda,

540
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,620
so I have to go there.

541
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,010
Do you need my cooperation?

542
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:36,750
No.

543
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:38,730
The situation is tight now.

544
00:36:38,890 --> 00:36:40,530
Keep a low profile.

545
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,690
You must avoid Lin Qiaosong in particular.

546
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:48,540
Okay.

547
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:56,990
Thank you.

548
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,210
Captain Lin, you're here.

549
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:09,680
How did it go?

550
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:10,910
I asked.

551
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,280
Someone called the police

552
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,980
to report you for selling banned books

553
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,200
and colluding with Communists.

554
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,070
Colluding with Communist?

555
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:24,410
This is too strange.

556
00:37:26,810 --> 00:37:27,610
Captain Lin,

557
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,860
am I being targeted?

558
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Don't be nervous.

559
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,890
My men are keeping an eye on this place.

560
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:42,190
Any progress with Wei Ruolai?

561
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:42,870
Yes.

562
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,120
But Captain Lin,

563
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:47,610
your people

564
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:49,760
are really useless sometimes.

565
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:54,460
I went to Wei Ruolai's place yesterday.

566
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:56,260
I think there's new progress,

567
00:37:56,530 --> 00:37:57,410
but

568
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,820
he keeps his mouth shut

569
00:37:58,850 --> 00:38:00,620
whenever I ask critical questions,

570
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,900
so I decided to go there again tonight.

571
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,810
Okay, I’ll send a team to help you.

572
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:06,580
No need, Captain Lin.

573
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:07,410
It is

574
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:08,820
a critical moment now.

575
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,670
We must not alert them.

576
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:13,280
I don't think we should trouble our brothers.

577
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,310
He's just a kid.

578
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:16,290
He'll confess everything

579
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,930
with some alcohol.

580
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:23,200
Are you sure you're not hiding anything from me?

581
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,360
I'm sure.

582
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,110
I...

583
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,000
I really am not.

584
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,030
I don't dare, Captain Lin.

585
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,840
Now that I'm on your boat,

586
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:37,920
I don't want to get off.

587
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,350
In fact, I applied to Huangpu Military Academy before.

588
00:38:41,350 --> 00:38:43,810
I didn't get in because my math score was poor.

589
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,130
After that, I decided to try again.

590
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:46,210
I signed up for a cram school,

591
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,480
but they targeted me

592
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,880
and I became a Communist.

593
00:38:49,770 --> 00:38:50,480
Now,

594
00:38:52,860 --> 00:38:54,020
thanks to you,

595
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,350
I got another chance to serve the party and state.

596
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,990
Tell me.

597
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:02,650
Why would I abandon this for something distant?

598
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:03,640
Right?

599
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,860
With this,

600
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,090
we'll be like brothers.

601
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:20,320
[Serve the Party-State, Defend the Capital]

602
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:24,110
Thank you, Captain Lin.

603
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:25,530
Thank you, Captain Lin.

604
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,160
Work hard.

605
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:30,710
Don't embarrass me.

606
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:31,980
Yes.

607
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:47,940
Wen.

608
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:50,490
Wei?

609
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:52,970
What's wrong?

610
00:39:53,150 --> 00:39:54,120
Why are you here?

611
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:57,570
Can you take a walk with me?

612
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,190
Sure.

613
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:19,590
What's wrong, Wei?

614
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:21,910
Did something happen?

615
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,040
It's okay.

616
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:27,250
Tell me.

617
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,850
Let's find a way together.

618
00:40:29,530 --> 00:40:31,930
If I can't help you, you have the others too.

619
00:40:33,290 --> 00:40:34,100
Don't worry.

620
00:40:34,690 --> 00:40:35,950
No matter what you say,

621
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,080
I promise to keep it a secret.

622
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:38,950
I swear to God.

623
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,860
My brother was a Communist, you know?

624
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:56,910
He...

625
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,250
He died a few days ago.

626
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:02,630
He gave me some things before he died.

627
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:04,670
He asked me to pass them on.

628
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,580
Wh-what things?

629
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:14,120
Gold bars.

630
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,660
Twenty bars.

631
00:41:17,410 --> 00:41:18,380
Twenty?

632
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:24,560
Some time ago,

633
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,440
someone came to my house.

634
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,500
Do you remember the guy with glasses?

635
00:41:28,470 --> 00:41:29,900
He said he's my brother's friend.

636
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,160
He's also a Communist.

637
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:32,810
I trusted him

638
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,370
and told him a lot of things.

639
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,530
But later, I found out

640
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,490
he's an informant of the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

641
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:45,700
Oh no.

642
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,990
Oh no, Wei.

643
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:50,990
You're in big trouble.

644
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:54,960
Also,

645
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:57,190
I was watched today.

646
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,670
People keep following me.

647
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,440
I guess my brother came to Shanghai

648
00:42:07,670 --> 00:42:09,180
because of the gold bars.

649
00:42:10,350 --> 00:42:11,270
After the mission failed,

650
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:13,070
he had no choice but to ask me for help.

651
00:42:13,070 --> 00:42:15,640
Then why didn't the Investigation and Arrest Unit arrest you?

652
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,520
You're the brother of a Communist.

653
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,050
They probably want to use me

654
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,050
to catch the real handler.

655
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:23,210
And I told the informant

656
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,200
I could give him the gold bars.

657
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:25,600
He said he didn't need it.

658
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,280
He said

659
00:42:26,990 --> 00:42:29,190
he would find a chance to get it himself,

660
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,730
so I guess he wants to

661
00:42:31,870 --> 00:42:33,350
embezzle the gold bars.

662
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:35,850
But more importantly,

663
00:42:37,090 --> 00:42:39,820
he's coming to my house tonight to get the things.

664
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:53,750
What are you doing?

665
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,710
Don't worry about me.
