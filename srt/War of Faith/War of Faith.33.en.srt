1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:39,590
Go.

3
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:43,350
Thank you, sir.

4
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:43,920
Thank you, sir.

5
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,720
Which trading firm are you from?

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,610
Are you done searching?

7
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:53,920
If there's no problem,

8
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,509
let him pass.

9
00:01:54,509 --> 00:01:55,970
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

10
00:01:56,509 --> 00:01:57,509
Don't move!

11
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,680
We're the Suppression Army from Nanchang Field Headquarters.

12
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:01,790
Do as we say,

13
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,120
or you'll be killed.

14
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,430
Please cooperate.

15
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,750
Lin Qiaosong publicly disarmed them at Sanjiang Kou?

16
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,120
A bunch of losers.

17
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,070
Why didn't they fight back?

18
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:20,750
It's said that Lin had something on them

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,350
and caught them red-handed.

20
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,560
How dare he

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,760
cut in on my business?

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,520
I'll make them pay.

23
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:30,400
Let's go.

24
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:31,000
Fall in.

25
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,630
Tu Nanshen.

26
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,960
You killed my men and took my turf.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,840
How dare you do that?

28
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,630
We intercepted a boat of the Communist Party.

29
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,310
It was loaded with contraband,

30
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,000
yet the Guangdong Army let it pass.

31
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,120
We also found gold bars on the platoon leader.

32
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,360
How do you explain it, Brigade Commander Qian?

33
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,400
Nonsense!

34
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,290
There were no communists here.

35
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:10,190
They must have been your men in disguise.

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,720
Don't try to throw mud at me.

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:13,750
The Guangdong Army is not to be messed with.

38
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,520
Wenbiao.

39
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,450
Bring them here.

40
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:17,640
Get them here!

41
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,310
Move.

42
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,840
We shot these communists right on the spot.

43
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,710
Brigade Commander.

44
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,310
We didn't do anything wrong!

45
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,150
Useless.

46
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:28,710
This

47
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,070
was found on them as well.

48
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,079
Special Commissioner.

49
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,590
I know the banks in Jiangxi Soviet very well.

50
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:39,910
Their gold bars

51
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:41,070
all have a Soviet stamp on them.

52
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,310
Take a close look.

53
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:43,520
Rest assured, Special Commissioner.

54
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,430
We've taken photos of all the evidence

55
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,360
and telegraphed Nanchang Suppression Headquarters.

56
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,020
This is how you want to play it?

57
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:50,360
The wrongdoers are accusing others of wrongdoing first.

58
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:52,360
Everyone saw what happened today,

59
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,750
Brigade Commander Qian.

60
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,070
We now have every reason to suspect that

61
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:56,800
someone in the Guangdong Army

62
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,560
is doing business with the Communist Party.

63
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,030
As for whether you

64
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:01,160
know about it or not,

65
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,430
we're not sure yet.

66
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,280
Don't give me that!

67
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:09,080
I know what you're up to.

68
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,120
If you want to seize Sanjiang Kou,

69
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,680
it's useless to play tricks.

70
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,880
If you really want it,

71
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:15,920
you have to fight to get it!

72
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:16,829
Guards!

73
00:04:18,269 --> 00:04:20,390
Sanjiang Kou is my jurisdiction.

74
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,360
Any misbehavior will be punished by military law!

75
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,120
Don't move!

76
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,350
Brigade Commander Qian.

77
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,600
Finding out the truth about this matter

78
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,930
is good for both the Guangdong Army and us.

79
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,830
If you keep acting out like this,

80
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:38,120
I'll think you're covering up for your subordinates

81
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,040
and hindering our investigation.

82
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,720
We can take this to the Suppression Headquarters.

83
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,190
We have both witnesses and evidence.

84
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:43,390
I'd like to see

85
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,450
how you'll explain it to Director He.

86
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:53,950
Fine.

87
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:54,870
Tu Nanshen.

88
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,920
You're using the Suppression Headquarters to pressure me.

89
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,920
I'll let it slide today.

90
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,240
But mark my words,

91
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,160
you better be careful in the future.

92
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:06,070
Go.

93
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,680
Go.

94
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,070
Biao Zi.

95
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:14,420
Take them away.

96
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,160
Fortunately,

97
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,090
we didn't get into a gunfight.

98
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,830
Those louts may do anything

99
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:28,560
on impulse.

100
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,680
That was intense.

101
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,600
Keep up the inspection.

102
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,830
We can't let any communist ship get through.

103
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:34,720
Yes.

104
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,440
Brigade Commander.

105
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,300
Don't be angry. It's bad for your health.

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,560
Should we

107
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,560
report this to Mr. Yan

108
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:49,720
and ask the command center for help?

109
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:50,720
Idiot!

110
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,190
If Mr. Yan knows

111
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,510
we lost Sanjiang Kou,

112
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,370
I'll be removed from my position!

113
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,360
Hello?

114
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,040
Okay, okay.

115
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:18,310
I was wondering who he was.

116
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,120
Tu Nanshen.

117
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,720
Shen Tunan.

118
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,720
Interesting.

119
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,950
He used to be a senior advisor at the Central Bank,

120
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:30,430
working under Mr. Song.

121
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,430
After he was caught covering up for communists,

122
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,560
the higher-ups gave him a new identity to whitewash him.

123
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,150
He's well-connected.

124
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,040
He's just a criminal.

125
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,720
He started this,

126
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:48,590
so he can't blame me for getting back at him.

127
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,800
Even if I have to kill him,

128
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,840
I must take back Sanjiang Kou before those in Guangzhou find out.

129
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,270
The number of people coming for exchange has decreased recently.

130
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:02,750
But counterfeit money is still circulating on the market.

131
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,430
It feels like

132
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,000
taking a knife wound that can't kill you

133
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,270
but keeps you bleeding.

134
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:08,240
What should we do?

135
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,190
If only we could improve our banknote printing technology.

136
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:12,720
With watermarks, it'd be impossible for anyone to counterfeit money.

137
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,800
That's not gonna happen.

138
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,950
Even that old lithograph machine

139
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,680
was sneaked back from Kuomintang-controlled areas

140
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,390
by our president at the risk of his life.

141
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,190
You know what?

142
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,510
When Comrade Yaguang designed the banknotes,

143
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,070
he didn't even have a compass.

144
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:24,670
He drew all of them freehand.

145
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,340
That was really challenging.

146
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,680
Ruolai.

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,510
Wei Ruolai.

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,630
Ruolai.

149
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,430
Chief Lei.

150
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:35,960
The president found a new anti-counterfeit method last night.

151
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,190
What is it?

152
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,120
This is a newly printed banknote.

153
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,050
It has used the latest anti-counterfeit technique.

154
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,840
I can't tell the difference.

155
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,000
Hold it.

156
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,920
It stinks.

157
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,560
Do you get it now?

158
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,040
Yes.

159
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:05,310
When the new Soviet banknotes are heated,

160
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,510
they give off a burnt smell.

161
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:08,510
Is it because of the ink or the paper?

162
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,070
It's a secret.

163
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,240
Only one comrade

164
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,600
knows the core technology.

165
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,240
Except for him and the president,

166
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,600
no one has access to it.

167
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,510
Great.

168
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,190
This way, the counterfeit money will have no market,

169
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,050
and we can finally cut our losses.

170
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,320
Sir, is this the latest cloth?

171
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,030
Are you Ms. Lu Hui?

172
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:47,670
Who are you?

173
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,080
Your husband Cui Yunge was murdered.

174
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
Don't you want to avenge him?

175
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:56,400
Two sheep

176
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,270
are walking towards each other.

177
00:08:58,270 --> 00:08:59,960
They meet

178
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,840
in the middle of a bridge.

179
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,150
They can't get past each other.

180
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:06,270
Xiaoyun, these are Danish butter cookies my dad bought me.

181
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:07,150
Sir.

182
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,600
Su Nan keeps talking to me.

183
00:09:10,750 --> 00:09:11,910
Su Nan.

184
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,270
You need to pay attention in class.

185
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,030
Sir, I don't want to sit beside her.

186
00:09:17,030 --> 00:09:19,360
You should be nice to your classmates.

187
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,670
Aren't you two good friends?

188
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:22,320
She's not my friend!

189
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,870
I don't want to sit beside her.

190
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:24,790
Why?

191
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:25,840
Did you have a fight?

192
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,910
His dad killed my dad.

193
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,390
Who…

194
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,360
Who told you that?

195
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,490
Her dad is that special commissioner.

196
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
My dad was arrested by her dad too.

197
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,200
Who…

198
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,360
That's not true!

199
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,080
My dad is a good man who only catches bad guys.

200
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,270
Your dad is a murderer!

201
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,510
My mom cries every day.

202
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,320
It's all your dad's fault.

203
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Murderer!

204
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,720
Her dad is a murderer.

205
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,030
My dad is not a bad man!

206
00:09:51,030 --> 00:09:51,790
Quiet.

207
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,910
Sit back.

208
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:53,670
Quiet!

209
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,030
Quiet!

210
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:20,910
Thank you.

211
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,960
Yu was bullied at school today.

212
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,320
Well,

213
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:36,450
can you do something about it?

214
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,160
I'll see what I can do.

215
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,810
How could that happen?

216
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,600
How about

217
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,630
I take Yu back to my hometown?

218
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
What do you think?

219
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:51,270
This is a time of unrest.

220
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,670
That's not safe.

221
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,420
Is it safe here in Jiangxi?

222
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,050
I heard gunshots a few days ago.

223
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,360
But no matter what,

224
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,760
Ganzhou is still Kuomintang's territory.

225
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,970
It's relatively safe here.

226
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:09,550
How about this?

227
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:11,000
I'll pick Yu up after school tomorrow

228
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,460
and take her out for a ride.

229
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:13,390
Okay?

230
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,150
Don't worry.

231
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,030
Everything will be fine.

232
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,080
Congyun,

233
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:24,790
after we pick Yu up,

234
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:25,510
please do me a favor

235
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:27,360
and give us a ride around the city.

236
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,240
Yu must be elated

237
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,630
to hang out with you.

238
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,670
Yeah.

239
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:34,880
She was so happy that she barely slept last night.

240
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,790
It's my fault.

241
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,580
I didn't spend much time with her in the past.

242
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:55,960
Mrs. Cui.

243
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,080
Special Commissioner.

244
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,720
Can I have a word with you?

245
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,550
Get in the car.

246
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,750
Can I sit in the front?

247
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:10,360
Sure.

248
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,000
Mrs. Cui.

249
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,390
I don't know what you have to say.

250
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:35,270
But I'm sorry

251
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,010
about Cui Yunge.

252
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,710
Special Commissioner, don't say that.

253
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,750
People in power like you need to kill someone to establish authority.

254
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:45,910
Cui happened to be that someone.

255
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,240
He was just unlucky.

256
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,510
I'm here to ask you a favor.

257
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,840
You shouldn't be affected

258
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:52,910
by what Cui Yunge did.

259
00:12:52,910 --> 00:12:54,510
Tell me what you need.

260
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,730
Then, I'll cut to the chase.

261
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,270
Cui died,

262
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,220
leaving my daughter and me defenseless.

263
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,910
Can you transfer your daughter to another school?

264
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:07,750
How dare you!

265
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,960
You're the wife of a collaborator.

266
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,240
How dare you bargain with Mr. Shen?

267
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,270
Congyun.

268
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,080
Mrs. Cui.

269
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:20,510
I understand

270
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,650
why you asked me of that.

271
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,030
But my wife is in charge

272
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:25,510
of my daughter's schooling.

273
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:27,080
I'll discuss it with her after going home.

274
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:28,210
If there's any news,

275
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:30,410
I'll get back to you immediately.

276
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,480
Thank you for your understanding.

277
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,600
Please let me off.

278
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,440
What are you doing?

279
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,510
We agreed to only kill Shen Tunan.

280
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:15,270
As long as the explosion kills Shen,

281
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,730
I don't care who else dies.

282
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:20,910
Yu, Yu.

283
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:21,510
Dad!

284
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,670
Dad's here.

285
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:23,940
Did you miss me?

286
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:24,320
Yes.

287
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,250
I missed you too.

288
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,390
There's a bomb!

289
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:27,550
There…

290
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,630
Come back!

291
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,440
Go to hell!

292
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:18,080
Don't cry, Yu. Dad's here.

293
00:15:18,750 --> 00:15:19,670
Dad's here.

294
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,510
Don't cry, Yu.

295
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Stay back.

296
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:30,870
Murder.

297
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,440
Murder.

298
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:33,870
Stay back.

299
00:15:34,150 --> 00:15:35,200
Murder.

300
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:36,870
Stay back.

301
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,390
Murder.

302
00:15:38,390 --> 00:15:39,630
Mom's here, Yu.

303
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,320
Mom's here. Don't be afraid.

304
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,080
Cishu, Cishu.

305
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:51,840
Go back and have a rest.

306
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,870
You stayed up all night.

307
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:54,550
I'll stay here with her.

308
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:58,040
Yu, don't be afraid.

309
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,790
Mom's here.

310
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,750
Stay back.

311
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:04,870
I need to go back to Shanghai.

312
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,670
I'm going back to pack up.

313
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:06,550
You can't go back to Shanghai.

314
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:07,240
I'm going back to Shanghai.

315
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,120
Let me go back.

316
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:08,840
Calm down.

317
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:10,000
I can't calm down!

318
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,720
Look at Yu.

319
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,270
Listen, Shen Tunan.

320
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,150
Since I came here,

321
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:17,670
not a day has gone by that I haven't been worried.

322
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:19,200
I'm tired of living in fear!

323
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,510
I've had enough!

324
00:16:20,510 --> 00:16:21,870
Let me go.

325
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,720
I need to take her back to Shanghai for better treatment.

326
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,630
Cishu.

327
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:26,320
Enough, enough.

328
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,390
Let's not fight.

329
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:30,030
How about this?

330
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:32,750
I'll hire a doctor from Shanghai.

331
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,480
As long as I offer enough money,

332
00:16:34,550 --> 00:16:36,200
someone will be willing to come.

333
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,200
It's not about money.

334
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:52,960
Yu.

335
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:55,240
Mom's here.

336
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:56,870
Don't be afraid.

337
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:00,070
Mom will always be with you.

338
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,880
Stay back.

339
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,170
Mr. Shen.

340
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:22,240
I've looked into Lu Hui.

341
00:17:22,550 --> 00:17:24,030
Other than the fact

342
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:25,069
that her husband was involved in smuggling,

343
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,109
nothing else is suspicious.

344
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,030
She must have been used.

345
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,510
Except for Qian Fengshi,

346
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:41,430
I can't think of anyone else.

347
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,310
Mr. Shen.

348
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,000
Should we report this to the Suppression Headquarters?

349
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:46,720
No.

350
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:49,110
We don't have evidence. It's useless to report it.

351
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:50,790
Besides, I wasn't hurt.

352
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,170
Just put this matter aside for now.

353
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:58,950
I didn't mean to kill her.

354
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,680
I didn't mean it.

355
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:03,830
I know.

356
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:06,670
I didn't mean to kill her.

357
00:20:08,350 --> 00:20:09,790
Congyun told me that,

358
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,720
at that moment,

359
00:20:12,030 --> 00:20:14,070
it was to protect Yu

360
00:20:14,550 --> 00:20:16,150
that you pulled the trigger.

361
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,400
She wanted to kill me

362
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,110
to avenge her husband.

363
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:23,830
From her perspective,

364
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,980
she did nothing wrong.

365
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,330
She did nothing wrong.

366
00:20:37,030 --> 00:20:38,360
Then whose fault was it?

367
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,130
Whose fault was it?

368
00:20:46,070 --> 00:20:47,240
Whose fault was it?

369
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,550
This is a newly issued

370
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,380
anti-counterfeit banknote in Jiangxi Soviet.

371
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,310
Take a sniff.

372
00:21:14,590 --> 00:21:15,750
It has a burnt smell.

373
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:18,830
I asked Yang Liuzhi to try to replicate it.

374
00:21:18,830 --> 00:21:20,160
He hasn't made it yet.

375
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,550
He's not sure if the key is the ink

376
00:21:21,550 --> 00:21:22,920
or the paper.

377
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:25,030
Whatever the cost,

378
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:27,550
find out how the new banknotes are made as soon as possible.

379
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:28,510
Yes.

380
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,830
Get rice, soybeans, peanuts,

381
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:51,750
vegetables, fruits, and other agricultural products from other provinces

382
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,880
and sell them at rock-bottom prices

383
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
around Communist-controlled areas.

384
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,960
The government

385
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,510
will cover the loss.

386
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,550
Set up public sale stalls for salt and cooking oil

387
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,640
in towns and cities near Communist-controlled areas.

388
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,070
Sell salt on a per capita basis.

389
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,720
Each person is allowed to buy three qian of salt per day.

390
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:08,720
A family of five can buy one liang and five qian of salt.

391
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:11,720
Purchases can only be made with proof of identity.

392
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,440
Amend the Baojia laws.

393
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,830
Ten households form a jia.

394
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,030
Ten jia form a bao.

395
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:18,000
Those who collude with communists

396
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,350
or knowingly let them escape

397
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,000
will be severely punished according to criminal law.

398
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,240
The leaders of the jia and bao will also be punished.

399
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,310
Establish inspection points

400
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:28,110
at all checkpoints for tungsten ore, salt, and medicinal products.

401
00:22:28,590 --> 00:22:29,750
If merchants are found

402
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,200
with these things but without a valid certification,

403
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,030
they'll be executed by firing squad in public, regardless of their identity.

404
00:22:35,030 --> 00:22:36,960
All vessels passing through Sanjiang Kou

405
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,620
must get a code book from Ganzhou Customs first.

406
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:42,030
Only after the code is checked by the Ranger Squad

407
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:43,350
can they proceed.

408
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:44,920
I pass here every day, sir.

409
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,110
Please spare me, sir!

410
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:46,720
Sir!

411
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,960
The transit passes issued by the Guangdong Army

412
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,620
are very easy to counterfeit,

413
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:56,030
so from today onwards,

414
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:58,090
we'll start using new transit passes

415
00:22:58,270 --> 00:22:59,440
with passwords that change frequently.

416
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,550
This can effectively curb smuggling activities.

417
00:23:01,550 --> 00:23:03,880
What do you think, Brigade Commander Qian?

418
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,030
I get it.

419
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:09,240
In the future, you'll call the shots in Sanjiang Kou.

420
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:10,680
You can eat meat,

421
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,310
while the Guangdong Army doesn't even get any soup.

422
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,240
You wouldn't want poisonous soup.

423
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:15,960
What?

424
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,960
Are you going to pressure me with the Suppression Headquarters again?

425
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,360
Brigade Commander Qian.

426
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,640
We're all working for Kuomintang.

427
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,270
We don't need to fight against each other.

428
00:23:23,270 --> 00:23:24,240
Don't be angry.

429
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,310
As you know,

430
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:28,110
the reorganization of Sanjiang Kou

431
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,770
is the foundation of Operation Cord Severance.

432
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:31,640
So,

433
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,880
I believe that Brigade Commander Qian

434
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,830
will cooperate with us in the future.

435
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:35,350
Right?

436
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,880
Special Commissioner.

437
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,750
Your word carries a lot of weight.

438
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:43,790
I, Qian Fengshi, am just a nobody.

439
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,190
I don't dare disobey you.

440
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,440
Brigade Commander Qian.

441
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,160
Instead of being cynical here,

442
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,110
you should relay these messages to your soldiers now.

443
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,590
If your men misbehave again,

444
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,970
they'll be shot on the spot.

445
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:56,480
There aren't many of us,

446
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,510
but we have enough bullets.

447
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,510
Lin Qiaosong!

448
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,640
Don't push us too hard!

449
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:06,960
I'm impressed.

450
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,280
Let's hope nothing goes wrong.

451
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:12,400
Or we'll find out who has more bullets.

452
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:13,680
Let's go.

453
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:16,890
See you, Brigade Commander Qian.

454
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Keep an eye on him.

455
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:27,790
After we gather enough evidence,

456
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,110
we'll knock Chen Jitang down a peg too.

457
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,110
Yes.

458
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:35,310
I suggest we do it step by step.

459
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,240
First,

460
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,350
make posters about how to

461
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,440
distinguish fake money

462
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
and put them up everywhere

463
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,070
so that citizens can quickly recognize fake money.

464
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:43,590
Folks, come and have a look.

465
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:44,270
Folks.

466
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:46,400
Folks over there, come and have a look.

467
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,790
Folks.

468
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,000
Come and have a look.

469
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,660
Take a look.

470
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,480
What's written on it?

471
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,880
It's the method to identify counterfeit bills.

472
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,200
Folks, the new Soviet banknotes

473
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,400
give off a burnt smell when heated.

474
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,640
The fake ones don't.

475
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:03,550
Second,

476
00:25:03,550 --> 00:25:04,350
offer rewards.

477
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:06,070
Encourage the public to report those who use counterfeit money.

478
00:25:06,070 --> 00:25:07,310
Then we'll trace it back.

479
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,830
As long as the money is used often enough,

480
00:25:08,830 --> 00:25:11,960
we'll eventually find one banknote that leads us back to the source.

481
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,680
Comrade.

482
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,270
I sold grains and got this bill

483
00:25:14,270 --> 00:25:16,920
from Fang who runs a restaurant on Huashu Street.

484
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,550
Its texture doesn't feel right.

485
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,310
Look.

486
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:21,000
It's indeed counterfeit.

487
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,270
Please do something about it.

488
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,960
The two guests just now gave it to me

489
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:24,880
when they paid the check.

490
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:25,830
Where are they?

491
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:27,580
I saw them heading to that inn.

492
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,850
I-I got this bill

493
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,310
when I was doing business

494
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:32,640
in Gannan.

495
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,030
I really didn't know it was fake.

496
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,830
Or I wouldn't have used it.

497
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:37,090
What kind of business?

498
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,410
I sell kerosene.

499
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:40,360
Who gave you this fake bill?

500
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,510
I have many clients.

501
00:25:42,510 --> 00:25:44,070
I can't recall it now.

502
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:44,910
Take him away!

503
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:46,790
Wait. I remember.

504
00:25:46,790 --> 00:25:47,960
It was Xingtong Trading Firm.

505
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,590
When I left home this morning,

506
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:52,050
I exchanged silver dollars for it with them.

507
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:53,400
Xingtong Trading Firm

508
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,640
is the biggest kerosene importer in Jiangxi Soviet.

509
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:56,790
It's been implicated

510
00:25:56,790 --> 00:25:58,110
in three batches of counterfeit money.

511
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:59,790
Xingtong Trading Firm

512
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,790
is located where the territories of the two parties meet.

513
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:06,120
The situation there is very complicated.

514
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,110
Yeah.

515
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,440
Special Commissioner.

516
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:11,270
Can you tell which is real

517
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:12,440
and which is fake?

518
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:15,790
This one

519
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,590
is the new Soviet silver coin Yang Liuzhi made.

520
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:27,450
The cost of plating copper with silver is quite low.

521
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,740
He's very skilled.

522
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,920
It looks exactly like the real one,

523
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,750
and it'll take some time

524
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:37,960
for the silver plating to wear off and reveal the copper inside.

525
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,310
In less than half a year,

526
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:46,240
the credibility of the currency in Communist-controlled areas will completely collapse.

527
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,030
Has the cost of living in Jiangxi Soviet begun to rise?

528
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:49,830
Yes.

529
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:51,960
As per your plan, counterfeit money

530
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,440
is eating away at the gold and silver reserves of Jiangxi Soviet.

531
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,590
Everything has become more expensive,

532
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,310
especially kerosene,

533
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,200
which has become 30% more expensive.

534
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:58,920
Not enough.

535
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,120
It's far from enough.

536
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,190
Wei Ruolai is very vigilant.

537
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,750
We've caused them so much trouble.

538
00:27:03,750 --> 00:27:05,480
He won't just be a sitting duck.

539
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:07,200
Perhaps

540
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:08,960
you think too highly of him.

541
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:09,880
I don't.

542
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,000
You just don't know how competent

543
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,200
Wei Ruolai is.

544
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:14,830
Just wait and see.

545
00:27:14,830 --> 00:27:16,790
He'll find the source in a month

546
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:18,590
and trace it back to us.

547
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,570
What's wrong with Kuomintang recently?

548
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,770
They seem to have suddenly wisened up,

549
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,110
making all kinds of moves.

550
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,430
The limit on salt alone

551
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:28,430
has made things so difficult for us.

552
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,160
If our people have no salt to eat,

553
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,050
things will go haywire.

554
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:36,210
The Baojia laws are also a hassle.

555
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,570
In less than a month,

556
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:40,030
many of our comrades have been arrested.

557
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:42,290
The villagers who were willing to help us

558
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:43,830
don't dare come out now.

559
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,830
I asked Kong to visit them after it got dark,

560
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,640
only to find they had moved away in the night.

561
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,700
Those connections lasted for years.

562
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:52,240
I'm afraid it'll be hard to make new ones.

563
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:53,920
If this goes on,

564
00:27:54,270 --> 00:27:55,510
the trade route here

565
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,770
will be in big trouble.

566
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:57,920
Bad news!

567
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,960
Chief Lei.

568
00:27:59,110 --> 00:28:01,110
Counterfeit coins appeared again.

569
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,750
Counterfeit coins appeared again?

570
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:08,200
Counterfeit bills and coins keep appearing.

571
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,960
Vegetables and fruits are sold at low prices.

572
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,200
Salt is sold on a per capita basis.

573
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,240
Even Sanjiang Kou

574
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,170
has been blocked by new passwords.

575
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:16,880
I'm afraid some bigwig has come to Ganzhou.

576
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,510
The tree desires peace, but the wind does not cease.

577
00:28:19,510 --> 00:28:21,790
We must get rid of this counterfeit money factory as soon as possible.

578
00:28:21,790 --> 00:28:23,160
Neither its staff nor equipment can be spared,

579
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,350
or we'll face endless trouble.

580
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:26,000
Chief Lei, let me do it.

581
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,720
I once dealt with a counterfeit coin case in Shanghai.

582
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,380
I want to go there personally.

583
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:30,240
You

584
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,160
can't go.

585
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,850
It's too dangerous.

586
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:35,480
Kong.

587
00:28:35,750 --> 00:28:36,550
Draw up a plan.

588
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,960
Send your special unit to do it.

589
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:38,790
Yes.

590
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:39,480
Let's go.

591
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,000
Wait for our feedback here.

592
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,720
Chief Lei.

593
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:42,480
Please let me go.

594
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,720
I want to meet this big shot.

595
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,350
Otherwise, I'll feel uneasy.

596
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:46,240
And I have a plan

597
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,240
to take down

598
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,200
that counterfeit money factory once and for all.

599
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,030
It's just that

600
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,750
I need the help of someone.

601
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,200
Who?

602
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,380
I'm in charge of this mission.

603
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:02,640
You should do as I say.

604
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:04,830
Okay.

605
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,920
I'll do as you say.

606
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:07,790
You'll not only decide how to carry out the mission

607
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,960
but also make all the arrangements

608
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,000
during this trip.

609
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,750
Sir, miss,

610
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:41,210
sorry to keep you waiting.

611
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:43,750
I'm Manager Wang of Xingtong Trading Firm.

612
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:45,440
What can I do for you?

613
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:47,310
Do you have kerosene in stock?

614
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:48,480
Yes. How much do you want?

615
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,240
I want to buy all of it at the market price.

616
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,030
Where do you want it to be shipped?

617
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:52,920
Dayu.

618
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,750
It's a big order.

619
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,350
I need to discuss it with my boss.

620
00:29:57,350 --> 00:29:58,480
He has the final say.

621
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,240
Please wait for a minute.

622
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,720
Go have some tea upstairs.

623
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:03,310
I'll be back in a minute.

624
00:30:03,310 --> 00:30:03,680
Okay.

625
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,550
Okay. Please.

626
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,280
Sir, miss, please go upstairs.

627
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,790
Dayu?

628
00:30:18,070 --> 00:30:19,680
Were they tailed?

629
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,880
No.

630
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,070
Our men followed them as soon as we entered the city.

631
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,470
It's just the two of them.

632
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:28,720
Captain.

633
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:30,400
They've gone upstairs.

634
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,640
I'm afraid they may lose patience.

635
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,270
Should we take them down now?

636
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,640
No hurry.

637
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,030
Send Feng to talk to them first.

638
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,160
Maybe he can get something out of them.

639
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:40,750
Sorry.

640
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:41,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.

641
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:44,000
This is my boss, Feng Junzhang.

642
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:46,790
I'm Wei Donglin from Dayu-based Yuanshan Private Bank.

643
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:47,680
Nice to meet you.

644
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:48,610
Please sit down.

645
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,110
I heard you two want to purchase

646
00:30:54,110 --> 00:30:56,040
a large amount of kerosene from us.

647
00:30:56,550 --> 00:30:57,640
With due respect,

648
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,160
I have one question.

649
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,030
Who are you going to

650
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:02,230
sell the kerosene to?

651
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,160
Are you asking this to sell the kerosene to my buyers directly?

652
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:07,420
No, don't get me wrong.

653
00:31:07,750 --> 00:31:10,030
As you know, Dayu

654
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:11,960
is very close to Communist-controlled areas.

655
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,350
The newly-arrived special commissioner

656
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,720
is very stern.

657
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:17,200
We don't want trouble

658
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,030
and don't dare do business with communists.

659
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,230
Are you suspecting me

660
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,000
of working for the Communist Party?

661
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:22,920
No, no.

662
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:25,070
It doesn't matter what I think.

663
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,030
I'm just worried that you may catch the special commissioner's attention.

664
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,590
Well, I don't want to die young.

665
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,250
We can pay you 1,000 silver dollars as a deposit.

666
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,270
This is Ganzhou.

667
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,790
How dare you use the Red Army's Soviet banknotes?

668
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,000
Take a closer look.

669
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:51,730
Don't you find these Soviet banknotes familiar?

670
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,830
I don't know what you're talking about.

671
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,310
See them out.

672
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:08,590
Please.

673
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,480
Wait.

674
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,940
These banknotes are real?

675
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:33,160
The counterfeit bills you made look very real.

676
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,720
But once they're heated, people'll know they're fake.

677
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:38,400
The new Soviet banknotes give off a burnt smell

678
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,920
when they're heated.

679
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,640
If you don't change your production process,

680
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,570
you won't be able

681
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:46,680
to get a single counterfeit bill into circulation in the future.

682
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,830
We're all smart people.

683
00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:49,550
I'll just be frank with you.

684
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,400
I know the printing process of the new Soviet banknotes.

685
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,200
I want you to help me find a buyer.

686
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,480
If you aren't the one in charge,

687
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,790
please get the one in charge here.

688
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,750
We can wait.

689
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,030
The printing process of the new Soviet banknotes?

690
00:33:05,030 --> 00:33:07,830
Yes. It seems that they want to sell it.

691
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:09,440
They haven't settled on a price yet.

692
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:10,200
Biao Zi.

693
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,110
Tell our men to leave.

694
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:14,790
Why?

695
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:18,310
You can go.

696
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:19,000
Yes.

697
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,200
To find a buyer,

698
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:28,030
he has to prove that he really knows how to make real banknotes.

699
00:33:28,030 --> 00:33:29,240
We'll bring Wei Ruolai

700
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,350
to the printing factory to help improve the process first.

701
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,920
We can arrest him after we find out if he's lying or not,

702
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,680
right?

703
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,590
Go tell our men to retreat.

704
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,440
Who on earth are you two?

705
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,600
That doesn't matter.

706
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:53,510
We only want silver dollars.

707
00:33:53,510 --> 00:33:55,040
As long as you pay us enough,

708
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,480
we'll tell you the process.

709
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,550
In Jiangxi Soviet, one Soviet yuan equals one silver dollar.

710
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,640
After you know the process,

711
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,920
you can print as much money as you want.

712
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,840
This is a risky business.

713
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,630
You had the nerve to put this on the table.

714
00:34:07,630 --> 00:34:09,760
Aren't you afraid of me playing dirty?

715
00:34:10,110 --> 00:34:11,440
Will you play dirty?

716
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:17,110
You have a gun?

717
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:19,520
Do you know how to use it?

718
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,030
I'll bring you two back

719
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:21,710
for interrogation.

720
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:23,170
You'll spill eventually.

721
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,550
Calm down. We can talk.

722
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:29,670
The new Soviet banknotes have a burnt smell

723
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,630
because there is a special mineral

724
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,800
in their ink.

725
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,630
I have the composition and molecular formula

726
00:34:34,630 --> 00:34:35,800
of that mineral.

727
00:34:37,110 --> 00:34:38,710
If you don't need it…

728
00:34:42,510 --> 00:34:43,280
Sir, miss,

729
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:46,480
at this point,

730
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,230
I'll not beat around the bush anymore.

731
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:49,670
Let me tell you the truth.

732
00:34:50,550 --> 00:34:51,810
The counterfeit bills

733
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:54,110
indeed went into the market through my firm,

734
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:56,510
and I also know the person who printed them.

735
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:58,270
As for the printing process,

736
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,510
I think he'll be very interested.

737
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:05,070
Okay. Please help me ask him how much he'd offer.

738
00:35:05,070 --> 00:35:07,150
If we close the deal, I'll cut you in for 20%.

739
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:07,960
Okay.

740
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:09,480
No problem.

741
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,590
Please find an inn to have a rest.

742
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,800
I'll come to you once I get a reply.

743
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:14,670
Okay.

744
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:25,030
See you around. Have a nice day.

745
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,000
Sir, miss,

746
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,030
the buyer has replied to me.

747
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,280
He wants to talk with you face-to-face.

748
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,070
My men will escort you to him.

749
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,230
Now?

750
00:35:44,360 --> 00:35:46,440
Yes. We need the cover of night

751
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
to avoid being followed.

752
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:51,110
Fine.

753
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:53,590
A face-to-face is necessary for such a serious matter.

754
00:35:53,590 --> 00:35:54,590
This way, please.

755
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:58,440
Come.

756
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,280
This way.

757
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,440
Please.

758
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,920
Well,

759
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:10,880
please put the bags over your heads.

760
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,670
It's just about business. Do we have to do this?

761
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:14,930
Sorry for the trouble.

762
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:19,510
Okay. Hang on.

763
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,760
Get ready.

764
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,440
Sir, no one is following them.

765
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,840
Where are the people we're setting up an ambush for?

766
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:56,590
Be patient.

767
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,550
Maybe Wei Ruolai has other plans.

768
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,460
There are only two of them.

769
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:03,630
No plan can help them.

770
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,690
They're fish in a barrel after going into the mountain.

771
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:08,760
Let's wait for a little longer.

772
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,290
Tell the boys to stay alert.

773
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,230
Yes.

774
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,290
Special Commissioner.

775
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,150
Look.

776
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,750
These are the new bills that were just printed.

777
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,540
The color is right.

778
00:37:24,630 --> 00:37:26,030
The texture is right too.

779
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:28,920
But I heated them on fire just now

780
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,010
and didn't smell anything.

781
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,630
If we don't solve this problem,

782
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:34,510
all our previous efforts will be in vain.

783
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:36,280
You'll buy the new process tonight, won't you?

784
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,140
What does that have to do with you?

785
00:37:50,630 --> 00:37:51,880
Please come in.

786
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,760
Mr. Shen.

787
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,960
They're here.

788
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:28,880
Mr. Shen.

789
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,230
Brother.

790
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,780
You don't look surprised.

791
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,620
Judging from those measures,

792
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:38,110
I guessed it was you.

793
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,210
Long time no see.

794
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:42,610
You've lost weight.

795
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,090
Long time no see, Mr. Shen.

796
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,000
Long time no see.

797
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,590
Jinzhen.

798
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,960
M-Miss…

799
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,880
You lied to me.

800
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,800
You actually lied to me.

801
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,660
How could you lie to me about this?

802
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,710
I thought you really died.

803
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:13,370
I couldn't sleep every night.

804
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,800
You haunted me even in my dreams.

805
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:16,480
Sorry.

806
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:18,230
Sorry.

807
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,380
I didn't mean to lie to you.

808
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,000
I had no choice.

809
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,110
Congyun.

810
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:30,230
Mr. Shen.

811
00:39:31,070 --> 00:39:31,480
It's improper.

812
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,540
Nothing improper.

813
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,800
Have a seat.

814
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,320
The last time we sat together,

815
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,150
we were at home

816
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:16,110
after the counterfeit coin case.

817
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,910
Ruolai was furious at that time.

818
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:21,070
You hated counterfeit money back then.

819
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,320
But now it's the opposite.

820
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
The dragon slayer

821
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,140
has become the dragon.

822
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,560
How are my sister-in-law and Yu?

823
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:35,840
Where are they now?

824
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,440
Are they safe? Are they okay?

825
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:39,710
No.

826
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:41,960
Someone tried to kill me

827
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,550
and put a bomb in my car.

828
00:40:43,630 --> 00:40:44,690
The bomb exploded.

829
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,280
Yu was affected.

830
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,920
She's still in the hospital.

831
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,620
How could that happen?

832
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:51,710
Is she okay?

833
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:52,550
Don't worry.

834
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:54,110
I'll take care of her.

835
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,550
When we parted ways in Shanghai,

836
00:40:59,550 --> 00:41:00,360
I didn't expect

837
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:01,670
to see you two again.

838
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,890
During that period,

839
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,030
she thought you died

840
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:11,800
and was sad for a long time.

841
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm glad to know you care for me as much as I care for you, Jinzhen.

842
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,070
It's all thanks to you.

843
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,480
Mr. Shen, let's get down to business.

844
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,440
Those measures for the economic blockade

845
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,510
were all your doing, weren't they?

846
00:41:24,510 --> 00:41:26,030
Yes, they were.

847
00:41:31,710 --> 00:41:32,480
Ruolai,

848
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,000
I knew you could solve

849
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,260
the counterfeit money issue on your own,

850
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,930
but I never expected you to trace it back here.

851
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:42,120
Why did you come?

852
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,440
Jiangxi Soviet is running out of salt,

853
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,510
so you're here today to exchange the production process of the new Soviet banknotes

854
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:47,480
for salt?

855
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:50,670
The new production process is top-secret.

856
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:51,320
I don't know it.

857
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,590
Then are you here to get yourself killed?

858
00:41:52,590 --> 00:41:53,670
Will you kill me?

859
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:55,670
I'll do anything for Kuomintang.

860
00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:56,590
On this matter,

861
00:41:57,230 --> 00:41:59,590
you'd better not push your luck with me.

862
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,360
I'm capable of anything.

863
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:04,150
Do you have to throw your lot in with those crooks?

864
00:42:04,150 --> 00:42:05,630
I can't believe you've stooped so low

865
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,280
as to make counterfeit bills.

866
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,510
It hurts me so much that you've become like this.

867
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:12,000
Do you think I don't feel hurt, Shen Jinzhen?

868
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,110
You're my sister.

869
00:42:13,110 --> 00:42:14,550
I raised you,

870
00:42:14,590 --> 00:42:16,590
yet you joined the Communist Party.

871
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:20,040
Doesn't it hurt me that you've been lying to me all this time?

872
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,490
And you, Wei Ruolai.

873
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,770
You're the student I'm most proud of.

874
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,880
You learned so much financial knowledge from me,

875
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,360
yet you're working for the Communist Party now.

876
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,760
Doesn't that hurt me?

877
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,590
Mr. Shen,

878
00:42:31,670 --> 00:42:33,070
I think working for the Communist Party

879
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:34,320
is the right decision.

880
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:34,960
I regret

881
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,280
not returning to Jiangxi Soviet earlier.

882
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:37,320
What have they done to you

883
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,480
to make you like this?

884
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:40,710
The Communist Party cares for the people!

885
00:42:40,710 --> 00:42:41,920
But your party

886
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,880
has never treated the people as humans.

887
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:45,000
Let me ask you.

888
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,190
The treasury bill incident caused such a sensation,

889
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:49,120
yet no one was seriously punished.

890
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:52,030
Why haven't you come around after all that?

891
00:42:52,030 --> 00:42:54,030
The Nanjing government is selfish and brutal.

892
00:42:54,030 --> 00:42:55,550
They've never cared for the people!

893
00:42:55,550 --> 00:42:56,360
How dare you!
