The rich Rothschild family

5
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,130
used to be private lenders.

6
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,759
They didn't even have a shop.

besieging of the Communist Party

9
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:43,990
and its occupation zones this time.

10
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,650
This is a head-to-head battle.

11
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,180
For us,

12
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,610
the several newly established banks

13
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:52,180
are letters of declaration.

14
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,080
The Communist Party

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,229
has declared war on us

16
00:01:54,229 --> 00:01:55,850
on the financial front.

17
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,030
It's intolerable.

18
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,710
All of you need to pull yourselves together

19
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,060
and do your job.

20
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,260
Make sure to nip these new banks

21
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,800
in the bud.

22
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,190
Understand?

23
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,310
Yes.

Ruolai.

25
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:10,270
Yes, Sir.

26
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:12,220
You'll be in charge of this matter as well.

27
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:13,600
I need a detailed report.

28
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,160
Yes.

29
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:17,910
Don't worry. I've asked someone

30
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,540
to buy a ticket to Singapore tomorrow morning.

31
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,670
Let's pack up.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,600
We'll leave tomorrow morning.

33
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,480
Where is Singapore?

34
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:27,680
Does it matter?

35
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,410
Why don't we go to Hong Kong?

36
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,630
I heard that

37
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,320
it's easy to make money there.

38
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,710
They have a better future than Shanghai.

39
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:38,910
Sure.

40
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,670
Then go to Hong Kong by yourself.

41
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:42,000
I'm going to Singapore.

42
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:43,250
Don't you dare.

Don't worry.

47
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:11,800
Are you out of your mind?

48
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,960
You're going to Singapore?

49
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,820
It's such a small place.

50
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,510
Isn't Shanghai enough for you?

51
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:21,310
Shanghai is great.

52
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,010
But Shanghai is too big.

53
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,420
A nobody like me

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:27,030
can't survive here.

55
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,870
Survive?

56
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,390
I can help you with that.

57
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,190
In terms of money,

58
00:03:34,329 --> 00:03:36,390
you'll earn more than you did before.

59
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:38,630
You want me to sell opium.

60
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,100
Mr. Kang.

61
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,810
I won't do this kind of high-risk job.

62
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,950
I want to live a few more years.

63
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,530
Please find someone else.

64
00:03:47,530 --> 00:03:48,710
Do you think the Garrison Command

65
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,920
is a place you can come and go

66
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,520
as you wish?

67
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,160
You're the one who suspended me.

68
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,110
Cut the crap.

69
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:55,860
If you accept this,

70
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,700
I'll give you an apartment now.

72
00:03:58,829 --> 00:03:59,710

73
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:00,920
Sorry.

77

I'm sorry.

78
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,190
Listen to Mr. Kang and stay here.

79
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,070
Okay?

80
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,280
You said before that you would lead us

81
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:30,160
to success and riches.

82
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,659
Mr. Kang.

83
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,570
This is foul play.

84
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,600
I'm not part of the Communist Party.

85
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:41,190
But she is.

86
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:43,350
We'll make up a statement later

87
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:44,540
and get her fingerprints.

88
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,400
Then she'll be one no matter what.

89
00:04:46,470 --> 00:04:47,190

Mr. Kang.

91
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,620
Why me?

92
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,310
Because you're cruel enough.

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,850
And you have no choice.

94
00:05:03,230 --> 00:05:04,500
You can only follow my instructions

95
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,760
and let me control you.

96
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,790
Aren't you afraid that I'll betray you?

97
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:12,580
Do you know who's behind this deal?

98
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,960
You're no match for them.

99
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,480
Alright.

100
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:19,270
You don't have to be

101
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,500
so dramatic about it.

102
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,550
You're not a selfless hero,

103
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,210
neither am I a corrupt official after your head.

104
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:28,470
If I really wanted to teach you a lesson...

105
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:29,470
All these years,

106
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:33,659
among the cases you solved for political achievements,

107
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:35,720
I can surely dig out a few faulty ones.

108
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,370
If I really become your enemy,

109
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,630
can your friends in Nanjing protect you?

110
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,960
Back to the topic,

111
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:48,390
if you take this job,

112
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,020

If you do well

115
00:05:56,990 --> 00:05:58,650
and the higher-ups are happy,

116
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:01,060
you'll still have a bright future.

117
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:12,610
It seems Nanjing has been rotten from the root.

118
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,110
Of course.

119
00:06:17,910 --> 00:06:19,250
How else would

121
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:23,430
lose so spectacularly in Jiangxi?

122
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:25,990
In troubled times,

123
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:29,640
you should leave a way out for yourself and your family.

124
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,840
Do you know how much gold

125
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:36,680
is traded out of Nanjing's black market every day?

126
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,780
When doomsday comes,

127
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,820
the rich ones will be the first to run.

128
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:41,620
And you want us

129
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:43,090
to be the good guys?

130
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,110
Quit joking.

131
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:50,650
Sir...

132
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:09,220
I'll be in your care, Mr. Kang.

133
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,290
That's more like it.

I'm sorry about earlier.

00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:37,890
I'm sorry.

141
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,470
I'm sorry, Meijuan.

142

I'm sorry.

No.

You can't do this.

145
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,520
You can't do this.

146
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:56,840
Come in.

147
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Sir, you wanted to see me?

148
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,310
Have you met Jinzhen recently?

149
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,800
No. What's wrong, Sir?

150
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:09,730
I saw you take her away at the banquet that day.

151
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,190
You talked for a long time.

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,930
Are the two of you

153
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,280
hiding a secret?

154
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,190
No, no.

155
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,820
We were just chatting.

156
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,130
No need to be nervous.

157
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:21,310
You're around the same age as her.

158
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:22,250
I think the two of you can

159
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,010
communicate and meet more often.

160
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:25,280
You can also

161
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:26,590
help me

162
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,970
talk to her about certain things.

163
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:30,990
Such as, Sir?

164
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,840
I suspected that she was part of the Communist Party.

165
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,840
This matter

166
00:08:37,169 --> 00:08:39,210
has created a rift between us.

167
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:41,669
I'm in no position to talk to her now.

168
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,140
Your sister-in-law

169
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,370
knows nothing about this.

170
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,070
It's pointless to talk to her about it.

171
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:47,730
So talk to Jinzhen in my stead.

172
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:49,880
The war between the two parties is coming.

173
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,760
We must make her realize the reality

174
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,190
so she won't get herself

175
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,940
and her family in more trouble.

00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:55,750
Yes, Sir.

177
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:57,620
-But I…
-But what?

178
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,170
You're in finance.

179
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,320
Communication ability is very important.

180
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,110
Talk to her more.

181
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:03,310
Treat it as practice.

182
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:04,210
Yes.

Why are you here?

Are you free tonight?

187
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,790
Can I invite you to dinner?

Sure.

Can you cook?

I'm tired of the food outside.

00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,220
Do you want a taxi?

194
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,470
No, I want to take a walk.

195
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,740
Watch out for the puddles.

196
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,760
Isn't this Wei?

197
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,570
Miss, you're so pretty.

198
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:54,590
Wei, you're back.

199
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:55,880
This is my friend.

200
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,060
She's so pretty.

201
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,250
This woman won't do.

202
00:09:58,310 --> 00:09:59,100
Why not?

203
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,800
Wei can't afford her.

204
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:01,580
Why not?

205
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,080
Did you see her shoes?

206
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:06,020
Those shoes are worth your rent for six months.

207
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,020
Wei, you're back.

208
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,090
Wei, you're back.

209
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:12,520
Ms. Zhou.

210
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:13,790
Who is she?

211
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,340
My friend, Miss Shen.

212
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,010
My landlady, Ms. Zhou.

213
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,440
Hello, Ms. Zhou.

214
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:19,230
Sorry for the sudden visit.

215
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:19,950
Hello.

216
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,550
Hello.

217
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:22,590
Hello.

218
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:25,410
We'll go in now.

219
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,370
Wei, you're back.

220
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:30,990
Wei.

221
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:31,410
Hello.

222
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,440
You're so pretty.

223
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:35,930
Don't worry.

224
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,070
It won't work.

225
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,760
What? Why?

226
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:40,240
It's so lively here.

227
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:42,550
If Wei really liked this girl,

228
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:44,090
would he bring her here?

229
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,360
He would have brought her to a fancy place

230
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:48,480
for some coffee and Western food.

231
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,300
He brought her here instead.

232
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,370
Do you know what it means?

233
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,370
What does it mean?

234
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,060
He's indirectly telling her,

235
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,960
"Sorry, I have no money."

236
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,300
"I'm not a good match for you."

237
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,130
He's rejecting her this way.

238
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,040
He could have just said that.

239
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,880
That's right.

240
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,310
You can't say that directly.

241
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,060
"I'm sorry."

242
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,050
"We're not suitable for each other."

243
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,340
If he said that, he'd be doomed.

244
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:08,340
If this girl is rich,

245
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,870
she just needs to call the bank

246
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,400
and Wei will be unemployed.

247
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,300
Right.

248
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:12,760
Right?

249
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,600
Right.

250
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:16,060
That scary?

251
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:18,230
But this young man

252
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,720
is quite smart.

253
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,460
Well,

254
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,380
I'm not very good at cooking.

255
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:30,660
Please make do.

256
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:33,450
It's okay. Thank you.

257
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:34,990
You made so many dishes.

258
00:11:49,550 --> 00:11:52,080
You're really not suited for cooking.

259
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:53,830
Don't cook next time.

260
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:55,400
It's a waste of food.

261
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,040
I'm sorry.

262
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,160
From now on,

263
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,780
I won't cook again.

264
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:05,880
It's okay.

265
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,220
Tell me, what's the matter?

266
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,830
Did my brother ask you to come to me?

267
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:19,350
Yes.

268
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:22,110
Harmony brings prosperity.

269
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,050
Don't blame him.

270
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:23,910
After all,

271
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:29,180
you're really working for the Community part.

272
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,800
The matter between my brother and me

273
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
is not as simple as you think.

274
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,750
It's hard to explain.

275
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:44,410
You said I'm part of the Communist Party.

276
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,340
Do you know anything about the Communist Party?

277
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:48,220
Not at all.

278
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:50,970
Your brother never mentioned it to you?

279
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:52,340
No.

280
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,100
But I think

281
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,270
he didn't want to implicate me.

282
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,310
Have you ever wondered

283
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:01,470
why your brother joined the Communist Party?

284
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,260
I thought about it.

285
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:04,140
Why?

286
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,520
Forget it.

287
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,930
I'd better not say it.

288
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,660
I'm afraid you'll be angry.

289
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,600
Just tell me. I promise I won't be.

290
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,470
My brother

291
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,920
was a smuggler for a while.

292
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,700
I believe he was smuggling guns.

293
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,740
After that,

294
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,660
someone must have had something on him.

295
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,160
He joined the Communist Party to save his life.

296
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,970
Nonsense!

297
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,150
Didn't you say you wouldn't be angry?

298
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:43,000
You know what?

299
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,940
Your brother joined the party in Jiangxi.

300
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,740
At that time,

301
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,360
he was less than 17 years old.

302
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:50,910
He came to Shanghai

303
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:52,700
at the party's order.

304
00:13:53,730 --> 00:13:54,930
Comrade Wei Ruochuan

305
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,030
joined the Communist Party

306
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,720
because he genuinely believed that

307
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,800
only the Communist Party could save China.

308
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,320
What?

309
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:14,690
You don't believe me?

310
00:14:14,690 --> 00:14:15,520
Miss Shen,

311
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,900
I won't doubt your belief.

312
00:14:18,690 --> 00:14:20,290
But please respect my faith.

313
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:22,310
Your faith?

314
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,800
Three Principles of the People?

315
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,060
Although I haven't joined the party yet,

316
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,160
Sir told me that

317
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:29,520
as long as I do well,

318
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,790
he will arrange for me to join the party.

319
00:14:32,310 --> 00:14:33,660
Do you want to know

320
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:36,200
why I joined the Communist Party?

321
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,350
No.

322
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,300
-Not even a little?
-Miss Shen.

323
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,880
As long as you don't cause trouble for Mr. Shen,

324
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,140
I'll be very grateful.

325
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:43,960
Mr. Shen

326
00:14:43,990 --> 00:14:45,320
is doing something big.

327
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,540
Something big?

328
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,920
You mean the financial unification?

329
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:50,760
Do you think he can do it?

330
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,700
If there's a will, there's a way.

331
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,960
I really want to take you to Nanjing

332
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,750
and let you see

333
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,640
what those so-called big shots

334
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,190
are busy with right now.

335
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,100
Forget about Nanjing,

336
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,130
even in Shanghai, you can see

337
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,570
countless refugees

338
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,440
who have lost their homes

339
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,270
and are forced to wander around,

340
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,110
starving and shivering in the cold.

341
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:13,900
But what did the government do?

342
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,020
Miss Shen,

343
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,020
every dynasty has honest and corrupt officials.

344
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,670
But I believe,

345
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,130
as long as Mr. Shen is here,

346
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,250
there's still hope for this country.

347
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,390
I sincerely plead with you.

348
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,360
Even if you won't support him,

349
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:30,120
don't stab him in the back.

Ma'am,

352
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,030
you should be more careful

353
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,060
when you're outside.

354
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,380
It's not a big deal to lose your wallet.

00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:31,300
-I'm back.
-Are you busy?

574
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:32,470
Let's go. It's none of your business.

575
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:33,270
I understand.

576
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:34,310
Come on.

577
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,180
I’m Niu Chunmiao. I’m new here.

578
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:37,920
She's from my hometown.

579
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:39,330
Ruolai, you're back?

580
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:39,940
I'm back.

581
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:41,050
Who's this?

582
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,300
She's from my hometown.

583
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,170
From Jiangxi?

584
00:25:44,510 --> 00:25:47,150
Yes, I grew up with Doggie.

585
00:25:47,190 --> 00:25:48,960
May I know your name?

586
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,360
Just call me Mister.

587
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,680
-She's just a friend.
-Mister.

588
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,470
Just friends.

589
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,420
Don't listen to his nonsense.

590
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:54,220
He and I—

591
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,630
We're just friends.

592
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,590
Will you explode if you don't talk?

593
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,710
See you. See you.

594
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,270
Where do I turn?

595
00:26:04,270 --> 00:26:04,980
Turn left or right?

596
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,260
Turn right.

597
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,160
Old man.

598
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:08,640
This is horrible.

599
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:09,660
How could Wei do this?

600
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,740
He just brought a woman here yesterday.

601
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,150
Today, he brought another one.

602
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:13,670
He's not a womanizer.

603
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:15,180
He said that the girl

604
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,620
is from his hometown.

605
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,260
Third floor.

606
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,310
You really believe it?

607
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,370
Fellow villagers,

608
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:21,320
but they hug and pull each other.

609
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:22,380
I don't believe it.

610
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,430
She's a kid

611
00:26:23,910 --> 00:26:24,780
from his hometown.

612
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:25,670
I'm going to take a look.

613
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,370
Go look.

614
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,140
Go in.

615
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:32,450
You talk too much.

616
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,740
How much

617
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:47,530
is your rent every month?

618
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:49,190
None of your business.

619
00:26:52,190 --> 00:26:53,060
Three silver dollars.

620
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:53,680
What?

621
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:55,790
Really?

622
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,450
It's the size of a doghouse

623
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:58,910
and it costs three silver dollars?

624
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,150
This is Shanghai.

625
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,010
A small apartment near the Central Bank

626
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:03,320
is smaller than a pigeon cage

627
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:05,580
and it can cost 10 silver dollars a month.

628
00:27:07,530 --> 00:27:09,180
If I buy a few apartments

629
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,130
and rent them out,

630
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:11,690
I'll make a fortune!

631
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,320
How much capital do you have?

632
00:27:16,050 --> 00:27:17,580
I can earn it gradually.

633
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:22,640
Don't worry.

634
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:23,960
I'm able-bodied

635
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,420
and have tons of ways to make money.

636
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,940
I won't burden you.

637
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,310
Tell me.

638
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,600
Did you sneak out again this time?

639
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:32,920
How did you know?

640
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,000
I know you.

641
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:35,790
You've been reckless since you were a kid.

642
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:38,990
You'd run away to Guangzhou just because you got spanked.

643
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:41,870
What's the reason this time?

644
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:46,680
Fine.

645
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,070
You don't have to tell me.

646
00:27:48,070 --> 00:27:50,130
Since you're here, just take it easy.

647
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,350
Have a good rest.

648
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,290
Where are you going?

649
00:27:55,290 --> 00:27:56,640
To buy groceries and cook for you.

650
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,300
Come back!

651
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,660
You're not allowed to cook.

652
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,380
I'll cook.

653
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,080
Eating your food

654
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,750
takes 10 years off my life.

655
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,650
What

656
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:11,430
is this?

657
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:15,810
Be gentle.

658
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,190
This doesn't even work.

659
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:55,080
Eat slowly. No one will steal it from you.

660
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,430
Is her cooking good?

661
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:01,520
Who?

662
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:02,580
Your woman.

663
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:04,700
Are you crazy?

664
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,950
I don't have a woman.

665
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:08,030
There are tissues

666
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,880
used by a woman in the trash can.

667
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:11,130
There's lipstick on it.

668
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,050
Do you

669
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:13,510
wear lipstick now?

670
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,540
That's my friend.

671
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,830
She's my boss's sister.

672
00:29:21,270 --> 00:29:22,270
How does she look?

673
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,310
Does it have anything to do with you?

674
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,230
Just eat.

675
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,430
I'm just asking.

676
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,160
Why are you acting guilty?

677
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,410
Your house is so shabby.

678
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:41,350
Since you brought her here,

679
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:44,350
it means you two are quite close.

680
00:29:46,090 --> 00:29:47,350
She's not an outsider.

681
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,160
But she's a rich girl.

682
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,070
Will her family allow her

683
00:29:52,990 --> 00:29:54,590
to be with a poor guy like you?

684
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,270
What will you do

685
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,610
if they don't allow it?

686
00:30:04,410 --> 00:30:05,740
Will you elope with her?

687
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:06,620
To where?

688
00:30:08,230 --> 00:30:11,060
I heard that Hong Kong is very good now.

689
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:11,670
Really.

690
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,210
-I'm going to stay at Wen's place.
-There are banks everywhere.

691
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:14,810
Remember to wash the dishes.

692
00:30:16,530 --> 00:30:17,530
I cooked.

693
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,380
You should do the dishes.

694
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:21,890
You haven't paid for staying in my house.

695
00:30:21,890 --> 00:30:23,300
You bastard!

696
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,780
We haven't met in a few years and you're giving me attitude now?

697
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,980
Bet.

698
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:29,600
Finish betting.

699
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,030
All in.

700
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,280
Wen!

701
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:32,440
Here's the blanket.

702
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:34,490
Thank you.

703
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,110
You're welcome.

704
00:30:35,110 --> 00:30:35,770
No problem.

705
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,160
Let me do it.

706
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,790
Nine.

707
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:43,340
Wei,

708
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,780
who's the one sleeping in your room?

709
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,430
Is it the arranged marriage you mentioned before?

710
00:30:47,430 --> 00:30:48,270
Yes.

711
00:30:49,450 --> 00:30:50,310
Why is she here?

712
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:51,720
She wants to get married?

713
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,640
Who knows?

714
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:55,020
I got in trouble a while ago,

715
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,200
so I wrote a letter to my father

716
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,860
and asked him to cancel the engagement.

717
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,240
I guess my father didn't receive it either.

718
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:00,320
Jiangxi is at war.

719
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:02,060
It's normal for letters to get lost.

720
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:02,650
Yes.

721
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:04,080
Do you really want to break off the engagement?

722
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,010
Of course.

723
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,040
She is...

724
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,030
That's not good.

725
00:31:09,030 --> 00:31:10,230
You should break off.

726
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:11,320
Yes.

727
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:13,790
Alright, go to sleep.

728
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,010
You're not cold, right?

729
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:20,840
Wen, let's drink.

730
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:21,870
Come down.

731
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,180
Come down.

732
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,600
Keep your voice down.

733
00:31:24,630 --> 00:31:25,530
Wei has to go to work tomorrow.

734
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:26,860
Don't disturb his rest.

735
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:44,360
[No. 18, Qibao Street]

736
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,580
Don't underestimate me.

737
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:23,780
Morning.

738
00:33:26,750 --> 00:33:27,680
Are you new here?

739
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:28,640
Yes.

740
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:40,150
Morning.

741
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,070
What do you want?

742
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:52,790
Why are you hiding?

743
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,220
I'm not going to hurt you.

744
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,130
I'm not hiding.

745
00:33:55,550 --> 00:33:56,430
I need to go work.

746
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:57,400
Stop!

747
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,540
I haven't finished yet.

748
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,940
Who allowed you to leave?

749
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,240
What do you want?

750
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:05,380
My name is Niu Chunmiao.

751
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:07,190
I grew up with Doggie.

752
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,409
We're like siblings.

753
00:34:08,659 --> 00:34:09,620
Doggie?

754
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,320
It's Wei Ruolai.

755
00:34:14,230 --> 00:34:15,780
I came to Shanghai to seek refuge with him,

756
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,639
so I'm staying here temporarily.

757
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:20,070
Is your name

758
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,860
Wen?

759
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,460
Yes.

760
00:34:21,989 --> 00:34:22,389
Hello.

761
00:34:22,389 --> 00:34:23,270
I heard

762
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,570
Doggie say that you two are close.

763
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,449
Of course.

764
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,630
We're like brothers.

765
00:34:27,630 --> 00:34:28,750
That's great.

766
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:29,650
Then we are

767
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,540
family now.

768
00:34:32,889 --> 00:34:33,770
That's great.

769
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,840
Do you want to get rich?

770
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:42,020
You can get rich with me.

771
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:43,179
Are you interested?

772
00:34:51,570 --> 00:34:52,429
Why did you get in?

773
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:53,400
Come down.

774
00:34:53,889 --> 00:34:56,130
I know you don't trust me.

775
00:34:56,530 --> 00:34:57,250
It makes sense.

776
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:59,200
After all, we just met.

777
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,460
It's okay.

778
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,340
If you need it,

779
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:06,170
I can show you around to broaden your horizons now.

780
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,140
Alright.

781
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,140
Get down first.

782
00:35:11,290 --> 00:35:12,170
Come down.

783
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,600
Thank you.

784
00:35:13,870 --> 00:35:14,780
You...

785
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,950
I can give you a silver dollar per day

786
00:35:17,950 --> 00:35:18,730
on the spot.

787
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,340
Really?

788
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:22,020
You'll know if you try.

789
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:25,150
Think about it. Even if I go back on my word,

790
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,190
you'll only lose

791
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:28,390
a tiny bit of time.

792
00:35:28,580 --> 00:35:30,460
So, will you give it a try with me?

793
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:35,660
[Three-Card Monte, Magic Hands]

794
00:35:45,330 --> 00:35:47,040
Come, come.

795
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

796
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,480
I'm new here

797
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,870
and I just want to do some small business.

798
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:56,490
I hope all of you

799
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,210
can take care of me.

800
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,040
Kids, come.

801
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,410
Let's play a game.

802
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:03,770
Let's see if your eyes

803
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:05,160
or my hands are faster.

804
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:06,020
Look carefully.

805
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:08,420
This is a chopstick used for eating, right?

806
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,280
Two bowls.

807
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,380
Silver dollars.

808
00:36:13,430 --> 00:36:14,690
Three silver dollars.

809
00:36:16,390 --> 00:36:18,090
I put this bowl upside down

810
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:21,130
and put this silver dollar under this bowl.

811
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,400
I put this bowl over this silver dollar too.

812
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,730
Then I say, "The deity guides the way. Go."

813
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,630
There was a silver dollar on both sides, right?

814
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,710
Yes.

815
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:37,220
Don't worry, everyone.

816
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:38,430
Look over here.

817
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,670
It went over.

818
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:43,140
Is there a trick?

819
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,670
Do you think

820
00:36:44,690 --> 00:36:46,290
you can guess

821
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,710
how many coins are under my bowls?

822
00:36:47,710 --> 00:36:49,580
I'll give you however many there are if you're right.

823
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:52,190
But if you guess incorrectly,

824
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:53,060
don't worry.

825
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,820
I won't ask you for money.

826
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:55,810
However,

827
00:36:55,890 --> 00:36:57,400
please help out my business.

828
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,600
What business?

829
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,900
I have

830
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:05,440
a large bag of good ginger slices.

831
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:06,730
She's a ginger seller.

832
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:09,610
It's not some elixir,

833
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,270
but it can help with colds, indigestion, and relieve coughs and phlegm.

834
00:37:13,270 --> 00:37:14,830
When we get carsick or seasick...

835
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:17,060
Right, granny?

836
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,020
Ginger slices are very effective.

837
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,350
Go and ask around.

838
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,510
The pharmacies sell

839
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:24,800
a catty for half a silver dollar.

840
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:26,750
Today,

841
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:29,230
buy a catty, get a catty for free.

842
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,500
But I have no money.

843
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,560
Miss, have a taste first.

844
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:34,830
Have a taste.

845
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:35,740
No, thanks.

846
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,460
Who dares to eat this?

847
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:39,000
This is really authentic, alright?

848
00:37:40,890 --> 00:37:41,780
Come on.

849
00:37:42,150 --> 00:37:43,830
You all know me, right?

850
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,370
You're a poor guy.

851
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,730
What? I'm a rickshaw driver.

852
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,560
It's the same.

853
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,390
Let me introduce everyone.

854
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:53,400
She's my cousin, you know?

855
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,550
He's my cousin.

856
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,100
We're relatives.

857
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,990
Let me tell you.

858
00:37:57,990 --> 00:37:59,590
These are authentic ginger slices

859
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:00,740
from our home.

860
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,110
I just brought it from our hometown.

861
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:02,500
It's edible.

862
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,550
It's delicious.

863
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:04,640
Take a big bite.

864
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:05,630
He can really eat it.

865
00:38:05,630 --> 00:38:06,350
Look.

866
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:07,630
It's delicious.

867
00:38:07,650 --> 00:38:09,450
It doesn't hurt to try it, right?

868
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:11,380
Have a taste. It's okay.

869
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:12,260
Here.

870
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,150
Ginger slices.

871
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:15,140
Miss, have a taste. What do you think?

872
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:15,950
Not bad.

873
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:24,460
Wen.

874
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,300
Ms. Zhou.

875
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,100
You're selling things instead of pulling your rickshaw?

876
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,020
Ginger slices.

877
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:29,930
Ginger slices?

878
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:30,780
Try it.

879
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,190
Can I eat it?

880
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,180
Yes.

881
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:35,250
It's delicious.

882
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:36,250
It's quite sweet.

883
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,830
It's very authentic.

884
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,730
Ms. Zhou, guess the silver dollar.

885
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:41,270
You win silver dollars if you guess correctly.

886
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,200
If you're wrong,

887
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:44,680
you have to buy half a catty of ginger slices.

888
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,650
I know this kind of trick.

889
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:48,570
Young lady,

890
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:50,570
you'll lose horribly

891
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,570
if you do this on Qibao Street.

892
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,500
This is Shanghai.

893
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:56,780
Do you know what kind of place this is?

894
00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:57,690
It's Shanghai.

895
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,590
Come on. I'll guess.

896
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:00,330
You'll do it?

897
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:00,680
Come on.

898
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,350
Let's do a round?

899
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:01,690
Come on.

900
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:02,140
Okay.

901
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:03,450
Look carefully.

902
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,890
I flip this bowl over

903
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:06,600
and put this silver coin under it.

904
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,190
I flip this bowl over this silver coin.

905
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,700
The deity guides the way. Go.

906
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,290
You saw it just now.

907
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,740
How many coins do you think is in this bowl?

908
00:39:16,870 --> 00:39:17,980
What's there to say?

909
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:18,830
There's one.

910
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,270
Open it yourself.

911
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,300
I open it?

912
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:21,850
Go ahead.

913
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,250
Fine.

914
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:27,500
One.

915
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,480
One.

916
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:29,950
Why is it gone?

917
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,430
You lost.

918
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:37,090
It's okay.

919
00:39:37,130 --> 00:39:38,520
I'll give you another chance.

920
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,480
Guess how many are on this side.

921
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:42,060
I'll give you them if you're right.

922
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:43,090
What's there to guess?

923
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:43,860
Two.

924
00:39:45,550 --> 00:39:46,430
Are you sure?

925
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:46,900
Yes.

926
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:47,600
Final answer?

927
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,120
Yes.

928
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,420
I'll open it now.

929
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:57,690
Open it.

930
00:39:58,770 --> 00:40:00,080
Three.

931
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,570
Forget it.

932
00:40:04,870 --> 00:40:07,330
This game is just to trick country bumpkins.

933
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,210
Let's go.

934
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,450
Ms. Zhou.

935
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:11,840
Ms. Zhou.

936
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:13,690
Ms. Zhou, don't go.

937
00:40:14,810 --> 00:40:15,450
Wen,

938
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:17,350
you stinky cart-puller!

939
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,840
Ms. Zhou.

940
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,920
You lied to me with her.

941
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:19,860
Listen to me.

942
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,350
She's here for Ruolai.

943
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,600
You know her.

944
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:23,840
She's staying at his place.

945
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:24,750
Do you get it?

946
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:27,760
You can't say that.

947
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:30,530
Excuse me.

948
00:40:31,610 --> 00:40:32,410
Come.

949
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:32,990
Alright.

950
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,150
Consider it my bad luck today.

951
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,320
How much is one catty?

952
00:40:36,320 --> 00:40:37,600
Half a silver dollar per catty.

953
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,540
If you buy a catty, I'll give you a catty for free.

954
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,140
Give me 1.5 catties for free.

955
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,460
Alright, I'll take whatever help is at hand.

956
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:45,470
Whatever.

957
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,810
Cousin, weigh it.

958
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:47,750
Alright.

959
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:48,800
Okay.

960
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,430
Weigh it.

961
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,960
I'm in a good mood today.

962
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:54,050
I'll sell at a loss to get the word out.

963
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,190
I just want to build good relationships

964
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:57,250
with my neighbors,

965
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,830
so I'll give 1.5 catties for free

966
00:40:58,830 --> 00:41:00,100
to everyone who buys one catty.

967
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,290
Great!

968
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,490
Coming.

969
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,690
One by one.

970
00:41:08,990 --> 00:41:09,800
Here you go.

971
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,270
The noodles are here.

972
00:41:12,380 --> 00:41:13,780
Sir, your noodles.

973
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:16,970
The noodles are here.

974
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,530
Your noodles. Enjoy.

975
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:25,700
Here, Wen.

976
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,580
I can't drink anymore.

977
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,830
You can do it.

978
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,750
I have more than you.

979
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,400
Here.

980
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:39,990
You drank it all again?

981
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,340
Eat.

982
00:41:50,350 --> 00:41:52,750
Chunmiao, you're really good at drinking.

983
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,470
I'm actually not a good drinker,

984
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:56,610
but the alcohol here

985
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:57,990
is like water.

986
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,300
I don't feel anything.

987
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:00,550
Take it easy.

988
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,220
This huangjiu has a strong after-effect.

989
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:03,680
Last time Ruolai drank it,

990
00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,030
he puked his guts out

991
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,940
and slept on the street all night.

992
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,160
Him?

993
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:10,040
He's no good.

994
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:11,120
Listen.

995
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:11,870
I

996
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,990
can easily

997
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,830
drink 10 times more than him.

998
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:16,540
Really?

999
00:42:16,570 --> 00:42:17,170
Yes.

1000
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,120
Let's try it another day.

1001
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:18,830
Come on.

1002
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:21,150
Drink more if you can.

1003
00:42:21,190 --> 00:42:22,920
You must enjoy yourself today.

1004
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:29,430
Let's split it 30-70.

1005
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:31,840
This much?

1006
00:42:32,450 --> 00:42:34,010
I didn't do much today.

1007
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:35,420
I don't think I should take this.

1008
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,710
You think it's not enough?

1009
00:42:36,710 --> 00:42:37,440
No, I want it.

1010
00:42:38,710 --> 00:42:40,130
I'm going to save the money

1011
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:41,860
so I can buy a foreign car later.

1012
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:44,330
You've got a plan!

1013
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,140
From now on,

1014
00:42:46,290 --> 00:42:47,490
just work with me.

1015
00:42:48,150 --> 00:42:49,080
There are so many

1016
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,550
rich people

1017
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:51,920
in Shanghai.

1018
00:42:52,130 --> 00:42:53,510
They're willing to pay money too.

1019
00:42:53,510 --> 00:42:54,640
Wen, listen to this noise.
