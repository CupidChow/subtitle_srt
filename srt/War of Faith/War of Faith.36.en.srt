1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,789
Come on, guys.

3
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,280
When we get to Yunmen Ridge,

4
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,840
let's get a good rest.

5
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
Okay.

6
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:38,950
Be careful.

7
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:40,550
What are they transporting?

8
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,509
I don't know.

9
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,680
Be on guard.

10
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,310
Biao, come with me.

11
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:46,920
Yes.

12
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,590
Yunmen Ridge.

13
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:05,690
It's really top-class tungsten ore.

14
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:08,960
Where's the map?

15
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,560
I have it.

16
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,560
Yanmen Ridge is the South Gate of the accomplice

17
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,960
It's also an important path for transportation.

18
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:30,620
Jiangxi...

19
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:33,280
For transporting between Jiangxi and Guangdong.

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,540
The Guangdong Army...

21
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,630
The fifth "siege" has begun.

22
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:40,560
The commissioner personally assembled one million soldiers.

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,430
Among them,

24
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,090
directly used to attack Su District is 500,000.

25
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,750
Tunan, you need to increase your strength

26
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:49,560
and focus on the operation of the Communist Party.

27
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,310
I understand.

28
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:52,070
We'll have a new move in Jiangxi Soviet.

29
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,730
Nanjing, please wait and see.

30
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:02,030
Sir,

31
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,960
Lin Qiaosong and others have gone to Jiangxi Soviet.

32
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,840
Got it.

33
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,960
Is something bothering you?

34
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,190
I'm just worried that Lin Qiaosong would act individually

35
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,320
just like last time.

36
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,190
Let's split up

37
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,630
and check the branches.

38
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:26,560
Remember.

39
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,520
This is Su District.

40
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,310
Be careful.

41
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:28,960
Got it.

42
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,400
What got it?

43
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,710
I'm talking about you.

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,120
Don't be impulsive.

45
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:36,520
Don't worry.

46
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,120
Don't worry, Brother.

47
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,750
Let's go.

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,360
Go.

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:54,430
Comrade.

50
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,000
Don't close the door, Comrade.

51
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,710
Don't close the door.

52
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,680
It’s too late. We’ve paid the bill.

53
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,280
Sir,

54
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,910
the elderly in my family are sick.

55
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:04,120
They need money to see a doctor.

56
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
Please help.

57
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:05,360
I'd like to withdraw some money.

58
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,710
But we've already paid the bill.

59
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,560
Come early tomorrow.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
I'll help you tomorrow morning.

61
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,000
Sir,

62
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,750
I'm on my knees.

63
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,120
Please help me.

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:10,920
Get up.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,510
Help me.

66
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:12,040
Help me.

67
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,560
All right.

68
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,120
Follow me.

69
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,270
Thank you. Thank you, Comrade.

70
00:04:15,270 --> 00:04:15,830
This way.

71
00:04:15,830 --> 00:04:16,959
Thank you, Comrade.

72
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:15,870
The Red Army is defeated like a mountain falling.

73
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:18,430
Good things are about to happen.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,650
What are you two talking about?

75
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:22,070
Nonsense!

76
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,190
Go!

77
00:05:25,870 --> 00:05:26,800
What's wrong?

78
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
Have you heard?

79
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,920
The bank caught on fire and someone died.

80
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,650
The robbers emptied the vault.

81
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,000
My money is still in there.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
What should we do?

83
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,430
The vault is nothing.

84
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:39,750
Have you heard?

85
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,720
The Red Army loses every day.

86
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:43,510
Well...

87
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,510
We have to escape sooner or later.

88
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,680
When the bank closes,

89
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,600
our money will be gone.

90
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,510
What should we do?

91
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,640
We can only go get it.

92
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,070
Just take as much as we can.

93
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,870
If it's late, nothing will be left.

94
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:55,670
Get the money.

95
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:56,830
Let's go.

96
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,270
Go.

97
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,510
Let's go.

98
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,600
Go.

99
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:11,160
Line up and come one by one.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:11,830
Line up.

101
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,600
Hurry up. We must withdraw the money today.

102
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,430
If we don't take it, it's over.

103
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,190
That won't happen.

104
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:16,830
You can get it anytime. Don't worry.

105
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,830
Just line up.

106
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,120
Your bank is closing soon.

107
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,120
How can we get the money?

108
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,680
Cut the crap and withdraw the money.

109
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,390
Who said our bank is closing?

110
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:25,310
The Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank has credibility.

111
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:26,240
We do what we say.

112
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,800
We all know

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,430
the situation.

114
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,720
In one night,

115
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:34,240
three branches were attacked.

116
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:36,110
Seven bank workers were killed.

117
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
Our superiors asked us

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,920
to protect the stability

119
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,310
of the bank at all costs.

120
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,070
We can't let the people panic.

121
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,270
Catch the murderer as soon as possible.

122
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,000
How about

123
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,770
I go investigate this case?

124
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,310
What do I need to do in this operation?

125
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:18,310
The code of this operation is

126
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,110
Weigh Anchor.

127
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,560
Your mission is

128
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,510
to find out

129
00:07:22,510 --> 00:07:24,120
the gold vault of the Communist bank's headquarters.

130
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,450
This is Jiangxi Soviet.

131
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:26,390
How many people do you have?

132
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,320
You don't have to worry about that.

133
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:30,930
Our brother said

134
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:32,830
after completing this mission,

135
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:35,560
he will take you to meet the person you want to see.

136
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,600
Understand?

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
This operation is

138
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,250
code name Weigh Anchor.

139
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,630
My mission is

140
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,630
to find the location of the bank's gold vault.

141
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,360
Ruolai,

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
what do you think?

143
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:48,680
Gold is the anchor of currency.

144
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,530
The price of the coin is related to the amount of gold.

145
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
It looks like their target is the gold vault,

146
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,630
but it's very likely it's Soviet currency.

147
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,000
Shen Tunan wants to

148
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,730
destroy the financial system in Jiangxi Soviet.

149
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:03,600
They are spreading rumours

150
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,600
saying that the fifth "siege" of the army is coming menacingly.

151
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,730
and that the Red Army

152
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:08,680
is being defeated.

153
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,240
The Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank is about to go bankrupt.

154
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,160
Now we have nothing to say.

155
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,830
Rumors that are half real and half fake like this

156
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,190
are the most difficult to dispel.

157
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,950
Once the bank is unable to cash out,

158
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:19,630
the rumor will be doubled.

159
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,000
It's a fatal blow

160
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:22,830
to our financial system.

161
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,630
If there's no other way.

162
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,500
We can only open the gold vault

163
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,030
and cash it.

164
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:33,789
Chief Lei,

165
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,970
this is exactly what they want.

166
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,720
They attacked the bank and spread rumors

167
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,320
to create an uproar

168
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,789
to force us to use the gold vault.

169
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:42,000
If we don't open it up,

170
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:44,150
the bank won't last long.

171
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:49,600
I have an idea.

172
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,000
What is it?

173
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,000
Go ahead.

174
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,840
To hold a gold and silver exhibition.

175
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,030
Let the people see the family how much the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank has.

176
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,440
Then the rumor

177
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,700
will dispel by itself.

178
00:09:00,030 --> 00:09:01,290
To hold an exhibition?

179
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,030
But this is the only way.

180
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,000
Okay.

181
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,810
If you want to do it,

182
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:16,630
let's make it big.

183
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:17,870
Let the people know

184
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,910
we're not pushovers.

185
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,910
Team 1 and Team 2, be on your mark

186
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:26,670
according to the plan.

187
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,150
Remember,

188
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,150
make sure the people are safe.

189
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:29,210
Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

190
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,670
Ruolai!

191
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:45,720
Ruolai!

192
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,570
It's almost ready.

193
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,030
I'll get started.

194
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:52,440
Okay.

195
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,790
Okay.

196
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:56,910
Folks,

197
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
I'm a staff of Suwire State Bank.

198
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,720
I'm Wei Ruolai.

199
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,000
Good!

200
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,000
Today,

201
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,030
I welcome everyone here

202
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:09,360
on behalf of the bank.

203
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,070
Next,

204
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:11,670
let's welcome the first set,

205
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,200
"Snow of Lushan".

206
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,750
Welcome!

207
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,840
Hello, everyone.

208
00:10:23,390 --> 00:10:24,510
I'm

209
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,270
Chiang Kai-shek.

210
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:28,200
This is my wife.

211
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:31,440
I would like to play the piano for you.

212
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,080
All right!

213
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,030
Darling,

214
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,240
The Red Army is about to reach Lushan.

215
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,510
Why are you still in the mood to play the piano?

216
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,670
I have a million soldiers

217
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,000
and the helmet given by America.

218
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,390
I'm not afraid.

219
00:10:45,390 --> 00:10:47,510
What am I afraid of?

220
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,670
A gunshot!

221
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:50,270
Are they really coming to attack us?

222
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,270
What should we do?

223
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,960
Why would they attack at this time?

224
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,120
My helmet!

225
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,670
My helmet!

226
00:10:58,270 --> 00:10:59,030
My helmet!

227
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:00,120
Honey.

228
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,720
Your helmet.

229
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:05,600
Can it protect my safety?

230
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes, look.

231
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,200
It's as tough as a helmet.

232
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,870
What I want is a helmet.

233
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,840
How can you pin the phlegm bucket on my head?

234
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,630
It's the same.

235
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,320
Why are you following me?

236
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,980
Lin Qiaosong asked me to help.

237
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:37,600
How far is the mission going?

238
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,550
I don't need you.

239
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,080
By the way,

240
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,150
let me remind you,

241
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,880
stay away from the stage later.

242
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,670
Stop.

243
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,270
Farewell

244
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:51,000
It's written by Master Hong Yi

245
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,670
John Otwit composed a song during the war between the South and the North.

246
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:55,750
Today,

247
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:58,840
we want to use this song to announce

248
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,440
that Chinese Soviet will not die.

249
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,750
The war will end eventually.

250
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,720
When that day comes,

251
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,150
the flag of the Red Army

252
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:08,120
will fly with the wind on China's land.

253
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,320
The Communist Party

254
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,000
will definitely win!

255
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,630
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

256
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:15,270
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

257
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:16,840
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

258
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,670
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

259
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,600
Long live China Soviet!

260
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,440
Long live China Soviet!

261
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,270
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

262
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:26,150
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

263
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,120
Long live China Soviet!

264
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,550
Long live China Soviet!

265
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:31,080
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

266
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,870
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!

267
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:34,390
Long live the Chinese Red Army!

268
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,150
Speak.

269
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:37,130
Where did you put the bomb?

270
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:39,390
Speak!

271
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,000
You betrayed me! You betrayed me!

272
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,320
Song Shoutian.

273
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,510
What are you doing?

274
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,270
What are you doing?

275
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,200
Song Shoutian.

276
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:56,510
Lin Qiaosong.

277
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,440
Are you crazy?

278
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,240
You're dealing with the communist,

279
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,630
not ordinary people.

280
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,030
Tell me where the bomb is.

281
00:13:03,630 --> 00:13:05,150
Or I'll shoot.

282
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:06,550
When the communist come,

283
00:13:07,150 --> 00:13:08,720
none of us can escape.

284
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,030
Then you'll never see your sister again.

285
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,390
Meijuan misses you every day.

286
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,550
All she dreams about is you.

287
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:18,360
A few times,

288
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
she dreamed of you dying.

289
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,790
She woke up in tears.

290
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,080
She told me

291
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,440
you are her only family.

292
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,250
She said you are very important to her.

293
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,790
What do you want now?

294
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,510
You don't want her anymore?

295
00:13:34,510 --> 00:13:36,440
Are you out of your mind?

296
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,510
Put the gun down.

297
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,910
I'll spare your life.

298
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,670
Put it down!

299
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,550
Put the gun down!

300
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:57,630
Wenbiao, what are you doing?

301
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:05,910
Brother.

302
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:08,360
This is not the time to be merciful.

303
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,150
He must die. He knows our plan.

304
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:13,750
Brother-in-law.

305
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:15,840
Take care.

306
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,200
Brother.

307
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,200
They're going to open the box soon.

308
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,150
Let's go.

309
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,750
Chief Lei.

310
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:54,360
we found some suspicious people in the back alley.

311
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:55,150
They are in the back alley.

312
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,030
Okay, I'll go take a look.

313
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:57,270
Come with me.

314
00:15:57,270 --> 00:15:58,200
Stop!

315
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,320
Stop!

316
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:00,390
Gun! Gun!

317
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:06,910
Get down!

318
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,600
Good!

319
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,670
Don't fall.

320
00:16:17,670 --> 00:16:18,550
Get down!

321
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,240
Get down!

322
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,120
Don't push.

323
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,320
It can make your eyes pop up.

324
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,550
You have the gun.

325
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,630
Don't be nervous.

326
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,360
Bomb!

327
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,910
Watch out for the bomb!

328
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:49,790
Bomb!

329
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,150
Bomb!

330
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,510
Watch out for the bomb!

331
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,440
Watch out for the bomb!

332
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,880
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

333
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,000
Don't be afraid.

334
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,830
Save the child!

335
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:16,790
Hurry!

336
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:04,200
Oh no.

337
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,310
The house is collapsing!

338
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,680
Save the child!

339
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,790
Mom!

340
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,310
Mom!

341
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,160
Help! Help! Help!

342
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,510
Hurry!

343
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,960
Hurry up.

344
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,720
Hurry!

345
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:01,160
Hurry.

346
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,880
Instructor Shen.

347
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,440
Instructor Shen.

348
00:20:29,110 --> 00:20:30,110
Comrade Jinzhen.

349
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
Comrade Jinzhen.

350
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:33,310
Comrade close.

351
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:35,720
Jinzhen.

352
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,860
The car hasn't been repaired yet.

353
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:13,910
It'll be ready soon, Sir.

354
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,480
Please take a rest in the car.

355
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,510
Sir, what's wrong?

356
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,420
It's the same problem.

357
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,200
No.

358
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,310
My heart is not feeling well.

359
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:28,830
Get in the car and take a rest.

360
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:30,440
I'll take you to the hospital after I'm done.

361
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,700
Let's have a check-up.

362
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,480
I'll be fine after sitting down.

363
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:37,550
Slowly.

364
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:02,880
Captain, go!

365
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,640
Brother!

366
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:05,880
Brother!

367
00:22:09,030 --> 00:22:10,030
Take cover!

368
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,510
Brother!

369
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:17,590
Go!

370
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:33,310
Biao!

371
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,310
Biao!

372
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:35,400
Biao!

373
00:22:36,510 --> 00:22:37,240
Biao!

374
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,510
Stop right there!

375
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:47,400
Biao.

376
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:53,230
When did you get hurt?

377
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,340
How are you?

378
00:22:57,070 --> 00:22:57,830
I'm fine.

379
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,840
I ate a peanut from the Communist Party.

380
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,510
How manly.

381
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,570
I'll carry you back.

382
00:23:09,790 --> 00:23:11,050
Burn me more joss paper

383
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:12,710
and send some money to my mom.

384
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,200
What are you doing, Biao?

385
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,830
Come on! Come on!

386
00:23:17,550 --> 00:23:18,550
Come on!

387
00:23:19,590 --> 00:23:20,550
Come on! Come on!

388
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:21,790
Come on.

389
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,550
Salute.

390
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:46,550
At ease.

391
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,830
Turn around.

392
00:25:04,550 --> 00:25:06,310
March.

393
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:35,590
Jinzhen is a good person.

394
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,510
She's much better

395
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,590
than all the women

396
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,000
I've known.

397
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,510
Do you know why I like chocolate?

398
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,270
Because of you have anemia?

399
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:49,350
Aside from anemia,

400
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,310
I hope to remind myself

401
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,170
though the path of pursuing faith

402
00:26:54,790 --> 00:26:56,110
may be bitter,

403
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,550
the result will be sweet.

404
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,790
Is it bitter now?

405
00:27:02,310 --> 00:27:03,030
No.

406
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,790
Because I'm not alone.

407
00:28:51,070 --> 00:28:52,130
What are you doing?

408
00:28:54,510 --> 00:28:55,830
Jinzhen died.

409
00:28:57,070 --> 00:28:59,200
I don't want anything to happen to you.

410
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:22,270
I'll be back soon.

411
00:29:23,510 --> 00:29:25,200
For you and Yu, I'll be fine.

412
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:28,200
I won't be reckless.

413
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:29,590
Don't worry.

414
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:50,920
Lin Qiaosong!

415
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,640
You are a bastard!

416
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:57,240
I told you not to act on your own and you didn't listen.

417
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,350
You killed Jinzhen!

418
00:29:58,350 --> 00:29:59,830
You killed my sister!

419
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,160
You bastard!

420
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:05,790
Before everything else, Shen Jinzhen is a communist!

421
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:06,830
Then your sister!

422
00:30:06,830 --> 00:30:07,920
That's what you said!

423
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,240
You're crazy!

424
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:11,000
Crazy?

425
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,000
I'm crazy!

426
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,640
You lost your sister!

427
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:14,640
So many of my brothers

428
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,200
died in the hands of the Communist Party.

429
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,930
Isn't my brother's life a life?

430
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:20,700
Wenbiao has been with me for seven years.

431
00:30:21,110 --> 00:30:22,640
If you want to take revenge,

432
00:30:23,110 --> 00:30:24,840
take it on the Communist Party.

433
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,720
Haven't you seen a fight before?

434
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,310
Don't you have things to do?

435
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,770
You can take it out on me.

436
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:49,410
But don't forget you're a member of the Kuomintang.

437
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,810
Shen Jinzhen is part of the Communist Party.

438
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:04,280
My condolences.

439
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,310
Ruolai.

440
00:32:06,790 --> 00:32:07,640
Look.

441
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,270
A Chinese Soviet tungsten ore mine company

442
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:12,670
has mined hundreds of tons of tungsten ore.

443
00:32:13,030 --> 00:32:14,200
They are all here.

444
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,200
When I went to Shanghai last time,

445
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:21,680
The German Hans recommended Chen Jitang to me.

446
00:32:22,350 --> 00:32:23,400
I received news that

447
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:24,720
Chen Jitang's chief butler,

448
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
Yan Youmin has arrived in Ganzhou.

449
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,200
Get ready.

450
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,350
In a few days,

451
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:31,400
let's meet this chief butler.

452
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,200
Okay.

453
00:32:44,750 --> 00:32:45,350
Let's go.

454
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:46,030
Notify Chief Lei.

455
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:46,590
Okay.

456
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,240
I'm Lei Ming.

457
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,250
I've been waiting for you.

458
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:02,750
I’m Yan Youmin.

459
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:04,590
Deputy Chief Yan.

460
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,830
52 silver coins per tungsten ore

461
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:10,590
is the greatest sincerity we can show.

462
00:33:13,830 --> 00:33:17,510
We are people who are always in life and death situations.

463
00:33:17,510 --> 00:33:19,510
Let's be straightforward

464
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,240
when it comes to striking a deal.

465
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,550
The unit is in 50 kg.

466
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:27,200
50 silver coins per unit.

467
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,030
Round it down

468
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,300
so it's easy to do the accounting.

469
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,550
52.

470
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,290
This is our bottom line.

471
00:33:36,310 --> 00:33:37,830
You should know,

472
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:39,790
our offer

473
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,440
is enough to prove

474
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,510
our sincerity.

475
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:47,550
Lei Ming,

476
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,960
you're forcing the negotiation

477
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:52,160
to fall through.

478
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,220
We have made the biggest compromise.

479
00:33:55,350 --> 00:33:56,550
Of course,

480
00:33:56,550 --> 00:33:58,960
it's fine if this deal doesn't go through.

481
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,200
We have a Plan B.

482
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,070
At this point of time,

483
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:10,400
who else is still purchasing tungsten ore

484
00:34:11,670 --> 00:34:13,150
other than us?

485
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,920
The Guangdong Army is your only buyer.

486
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,030
Ruolai.

487
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,190
He's the deputy chief of the General Affairs Unit.

488
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:25,760
Tell Deputy Chief Yan

489
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,400
our current situation.

490
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,150
Sure.

491
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,630
We've conquered new technology this month

492
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:32,630
and started a factory

493
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,670
to make tungsten ore into tungsten wire

494
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:37,030
for the composition of a incandescent light bulb.

495
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,110
For commercial use?

496
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,030
Yes.

497
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:41,030
There's still a huge demand for tungsten wire in China.

498
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:43,320
In fact, there are also orders from overseas.

499
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
Most importantly,

500
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:47,360
by producing commercial products with the tungsten ore,

501
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,150
it can be exported to various countries

502
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:50,610
and Nanjing can't stop it.

503
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,170
How much can a mere factory

504
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:54,920
produce?

505
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,510
It's not very ideal for now.

506
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:04,400
But as long as we have money,

507
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,190
we can open more factories.

508
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:09,030
The only thing that Jiangxi Soviet is not short of is labor.

509
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:11,560
But the whole world is short of tungsten wire.

510
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:17,880
Lei Ming.

511
00:35:19,630 --> 00:35:20,550
Fine.

512
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:23,590
Let's do 52 per unit then.

513
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,000
Deal.

514
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,510
Why are you crying?

515
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:48,410
You've always wanted to go to England.

516
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:49,710
Don't worry.

517
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:50,910
I'll go find you soon.

518
00:35:51,230 --> 00:35:52,920
You told me before

519
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,510
that you would come back after a few days of business trip.

520
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:58,320
But you almost died in Ruijin.

521
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,400
I learned my lesson.

522
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,590
For you two,

523
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,760
I won't take any more risks.

524
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,000
If there's no danger,

525
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,360
why are you sending me and Yu away?

526
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:12,960
Why?

527
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,520
You have the country in your heart.

528
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:25,640
I believe that more than anyone.

529
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:27,920
But now Nanjing is but. night city

530
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,320
yet you are risking your life

531
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,580
and getting all bloody for this country.

532
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,670
Is it really worth it?

533
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:38,190
Yes.

534
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,000
Trust me, Cishu.

535
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,170
This chaos won't last for long.

536
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:44,710
I'm working so hard now

537
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,600
so that it can be a prosperous world

538
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,510
when Yu grows up.

539
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:52,070
I just hope

540
00:36:52,590 --> 00:36:54,070
when she grows up,

541
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,760
her father is still around.

542
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:01,740
Don't be silly.

543
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:03,420
Her father will be around.

544
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,540
Take care of yourself.

545
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,070
Take care of Yu.

546
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,930
Come, Yu.

547
00:37:13,710 --> 00:37:14,630
Let me hug you.

548
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:18,510
Come.

549
00:37:18,510 --> 00:37:19,170
Look at you.

550
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:23,360
When I'm not around,

551
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,230
listen to your mother

552
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:27,760
and be good, okay?

553
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:31,090
Pinky swear.

554
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:32,590
Be good.

555
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,030
Kiss daddy.

556
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,340
I shall give you a kiss too.

557
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:40,920
Give me a hug.

558
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,190
Let's go.

559
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,610
Let's go, Yu.

560
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,150
Dad!

561
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,070
Dad!

562
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,110
Dad!

563
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,760
Dad!

564
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,550
Dad!

565
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,660
The ship is departing!

566
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,510
Be careful. The ship is leaving.

567
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:03,510
I swear!

568
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,150
I swear!

569
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,880
To join the Chinese Communist Party voluntarily!

570
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:10,150
To join the Chinese Communist Party voluntarily!

571
00:39:10,150 --> 00:39:11,280
To sacrifice myself

572
00:39:11,510 --> 00:39:12,640
for the revolution!

573
00:39:12,670 --> 00:39:13,800
To sacrifice myself

574
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,010
for the revolution!

575
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:17,280
We obey the organization,

576
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,630
keep our tasks strictly confidential,

577
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,760
and will never rebel.

578
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,760
We obey the organization,

579
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,030
keep our tasks strictly confidential,

580
00:39:23,030 --> 00:39:24,230
and will never rebel.

581
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,230
Pledged by Wei Ruolai.

582
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:27,360
Niu Chunmiao.

583
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:30,760
Welcome.

584
00:39:31,190 --> 00:39:32,250
Comrade Chunmiao.

585
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,040
Comrade Ruolai.

586
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:36,440
From now on,

587
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,710
you are officially

588
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,320
Chinese Communist Party members.

589
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,400
I will do my best

590
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:43,510
and devote everything to the party,

591
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,320
even my life.

592
00:39:44,710 --> 00:39:45,760
This is my dream,

593
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,400
and my lifelong faith.

594
00:40:02,710 --> 00:40:03,400
Tunan,

595
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,730
I just found out about your sister.

596
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,030
My condolences.

597
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,230
It's my personal matter.

598
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,230
It's okay.

599
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:10,710
Let's talk business.

600
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,030
The economy encirclement

601
00:40:12,030 --> 00:40:13,800
has reached the critical stage.

602
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:15,320
The Communist Party has earned millions of silver coins

603
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:17,320
through trading tungsten.

604
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,490
We just received a tip-off.

605
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,590
The Communist Party has contacted Yan Youmin

606
00:40:21,590 --> 00:40:24,000
to trade for a large number of strategic supplies with tungsten ore.

607
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,280
Go to Guangdong as soon as possible

608
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,630
You have to stop this trade

609
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,360
between the Communist Party and the Guangdong Army at all cost.

610
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:31,110
Okay, I'll get ready and leave right away.

611
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:32,030
One more thing.

612
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:32,920
In this operation,

613
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,320
Lin Qiaosong will go with you.

614
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,280
I know it's hard for you.

615
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:38,030
But the chairman specifically said

616
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,550
nothing can go wrong in this operation.

617
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:42,450
With the enemy in mind,

618
00:40:42,670 --> 00:40:44,630
I hope you can put the big picture first.

619
00:40:44,630 --> 00:40:46,760
You two need to work together

620
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:49,510
and cut off the communists' last lifeline.

621
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:50,920
Yes, Sir.

622
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,710
Hello?

623
00:41:00,710 --> 00:41:01,590
Qiaosong.

624
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:02,190
Director He.

625
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:03,760
I know the situation.

626
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,960
When Shen Tunan goes to Guangzhou,

627
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:11,030
you must go with him and keep an eye on him.

628
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:11,880
Yes.

629
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,130
Director He,

630
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,070
if I find out Shen Tunan is up to something,

631
00:41:15,070 --> 00:41:16,960
can I execute him directly?

632
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:18,480
Where's the evidence?

633
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,110
The evidence is important.

634
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,150
Got it.

635
00:41:29,550 --> 00:41:30,680
Where are you going?

636
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,290
I'm going to Guangzhou.

637
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:33,630
I'll go too.

638
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,050
You can't go.

639
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:39,150
I'm going to Guangzhou for a mission.

640
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,680
I might not come back alive.

641
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:43,600
You said the same thing before you came to Jiangxi.

642
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:46,660
Don't you understand?

643
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:48,930
Even if you only have one day left,

644
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,280
I want to be with you.

645
00:41:55,630 --> 00:41:57,090
We received a tip-off that

646
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,840
Nanjing will send someone to Guangzhou

647
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:02,030
to stop our tungsten ore trade.

648
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:05,310
What does Yan Youming think?

649
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:07,960
If this batch of tungsten ore

650
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:09,630
can be shipped out successfully,

651
00:42:09,630 --> 00:42:10,360
it will be fine.

652
00:42:10,360 --> 00:42:12,960
If the tungsten ore fall into Nanjing's hands,

653
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,890
Yan Youmin will definitely cut his tail to survive.

654
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,630
Comrades,

655
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,460
the fifth anti-encirclement

656
00:42:18,630 --> 00:42:20,280
has reached the new heights.

657
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,030
Warriors on the front line need medicine and weapons.

658
00:42:24,030 --> 00:42:25,670
Revolution requires money.

659
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:28,220
So this tungsten ore deal with Yan Youmin

660
00:42:28,670 --> 00:42:31,200
is the top priority to support the front line.

661
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,800
The organization has decided

662
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:34,280
to assign you a new task.

663
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:34,940
Wei Ruolai.

664
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,590
The organization has decided

665
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,590
to have you escort this batch of tungsten ore to Guangzhou personally.

666
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,070
Because when you were in Shanghai,

667
00:42:41,070 --> 00:42:42,870
you have dealt with Hans before.

668
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,800
Make sure

669
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,860
you hand over the tungsten ore to him.

670
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,810
You take charge of the work.

671
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:48,400
Kong Lingzheng.

672
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:48,800
Here.

673
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,510
Niu Chunmiao.

674
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,000
Here.

675
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,530
Yuanbao.

676
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,000
Here.

677
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,200
You three go with him.

678
00:42:52,590 --> 00:42:54,390
Make sure the deal is completed.

679
00:42:54,670 --> 00:42:55,510
Yes.

680
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:57,070
I'll make sure to complete the mission.
