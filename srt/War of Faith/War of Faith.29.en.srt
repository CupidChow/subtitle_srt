[Episode 29]

4
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:40,350
Mr. Yu.

5
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,360
It's true.

6
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,350
Wei Ruolai pled guilty on the spot

7
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:45,870
and was dragged to the execution ground.

8
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:46,750
What?

9
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:49,110
Listen.

10
00:01:49,870 --> 00:01:51,229
Inform them now

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,440
to not execute him.

12
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,180
You hear me?

13
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:54,470
Thanks, Mr. Yu.

14
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,190
It might be too late.

15
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,130
I'll

16
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,430
send someone over.

17
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,110
But...

18
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:25,560
Any last words?

19
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:29,910
Wei Ruolai.

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,350
If you identify the mastermind,

21
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:33,930
your sentence

22
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,530
will be reduced.

23
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,870
Targeting Mr. Shen again?

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,800
Didn't he ask you to do it this time?

25
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,390
Don't bother.

26
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,490
Just shoot me.

27
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,510
Wei Ruolai.

28
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:49,820
So many are envious of

29
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,380
how far you've come

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,420
without money or a good background.

31
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,300
Why did you risk your bright future

32
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,610
in Central Bank?

33
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,390
You were well fed and safe

34
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,430
in prison.

35
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,230
Why did you join the Dare-to-Die Corps?

36
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:05,730
For the country.

37
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,430
Me too.

38
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:07,030
Nonsense!

39
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,620
You're just disrupting the social order

40
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:11,030
and ruining the government's reputation!

41
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:13,290
Did I ruin the government's reputation?

42
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,360
How can you say that as a police?

43
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,160
The people's money is used

44
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,390
to wipe out communists.

45
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:20,310
The people benefit in the end!

46
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,950
Do you really believe that?

47
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:24,180
Stupid!

48
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,490
Execute him!

49
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,020
Hide!

50
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,910
Drive forward.

51
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,030
Go there, Congyun!

52
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,430
Sir, there are gunshots!

53
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,870
Ruolai's in danger!

54
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,510
Only your survival

55
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,240
matters to me!

56
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:58,180
Congyun!

57
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,880
Punish Wei Ruolai on the spot.

58
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:17,800
Boss!

59
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,190
Watch out!

60
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,230
Sir.

61
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:34,320
Sir.

62
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:35,480
Sir.

63
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,220
It's dangerous!

64
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:36,690
Sir.

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,290
Sir.

66
00:05:23,030 --> 00:05:23,650
Let's go.

67
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,300
They're all dead.

68
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:35,760
Ruolai isn't there.

69
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,710
Come in.

70
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:54,790
Thank you.

71
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,280
You're welcome.

72
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:58,590
Wait.

73
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,030
You should thank me first.

74
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,480
I asked Miss Shen for help.

75
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,910
If it weren't for me, you'd have been killed by that car.

76
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,390
Okay.

77
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,000
Got it.

78
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,020
Get what?

79
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:09,150
Where are your manners?

80
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,350
Thank you!

81
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:11,550
Stop arguing.

82
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,110
The priority is

83
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,710
for you two to leave Shanghai now.

84
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,430
No.

85
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:17,830
I can't leave.

86
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:19,830
Those criminals are still at large.

87
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:20,950
That's a long

88
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,790
and arduous task.

89
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:23,830
You can't do it

90
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:25,070
on your own.

91
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:27,550
Lin Qiaosong failed the mission today.

92
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,230
Next,

93
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,590
he'll do anything

94
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:30,710
to catch you two.

95
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,780
At least

96
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,400
think about Chunmiao.

97
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:37,210
How about this?

98
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,640
You go back first

99
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,630
and tell my father...

100
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,820
Wei Ruolai!

101
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,330
Ouch!

102
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,120
Wen's dead

103
00:07:44,390 --> 00:07:45,120
and Ms. Zhou

104
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:45,790
lost her mind,

105
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:46,510
so

106
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:46,990
you've

107
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,990
given up on life.

108
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,630
I understand that.

109
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,430
But please follow some rules!

110
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,909
Take your own advice!

111
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,820
At least I'm not so dumb to get caught

112
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,080
and need others' help.

113
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:59,040
Wei Ruolai.

114
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:00,800
If you stay in Shanghai,

115
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,520
you won't live past a month.

116
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:03,860
I risked it

117
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:05,430
to save you this time.

118
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:07,340
I might not be so lucky next time.

119
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,310
Those people are still at large.

120
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:10,310
Even if you die,

121
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,390
it'd be in vain.

122
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,610
You should know

123
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:16,030
Jiangxi Soviet

124
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:18,100
has its own bank now.

125
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:18,950
What we lack

126
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,880
is financial talents like you.

127
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,170
They even provide

128
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:23,790
food and uniforms.

129
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,980
Stop hesitating.

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,880
Miss Shen saved your life,

131
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:37,450
so your life belongs to the Communist Party.

132
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:45,860
Okay.

133
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:48,350
Tomorrow at 9 a.m.,

134
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,580
I'll come with info of the route and handler,

135
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,720
so you can evacuate.

136
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,300
Thank you.

137
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,160
Aren't you coming with us?

138
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,740
I'm not exposed yet.

139
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,250
I can stay here longer.

140
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,130
Ruolai.

141
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,030
Don't worry.

142
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,380
You can't keep a good man down.

143
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,440
At Jiangxi Soviet,

144
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,510
you'll

145
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:10,040
kick off your career again.

146
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,850
You acted on your own again.

147
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:17,340
You...

148
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:18,860
Without my help,

149
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:21,030
Ruolai would've been killed.

150
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:22,510
Saving him

151
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:25,120
benefits Jiangxi Soviet.

152
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,430
What?

153
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,490
He's willing to go to Jiangxi Soviet?

154
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:31,030
Good.

155
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,030
Good.

156
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:37,220
This is the route map.

157
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:39,390
Tell him to leave Shanghai tomorrow.

158
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,390
Actually, there's one more person

159
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,500
this time,

160
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,800
Niu Chunmiao.

161
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:52,180
You...

162
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,870
Don't be angry.

163
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:56,670
She's really great.

164
00:09:56,670 --> 00:09:57,820
I really like her.

165
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,590
She's still a stranger.

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,250
Wait.

167
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,630
Where's your discipline?

168
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:04,020
Listen to me.

169
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:04,810
Didn't you

170
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,560
ask me to work on Ruolai?

171
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,700
I bumped into her

172
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:10,080
at Ruolai's house once when he wasn't in.

173
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:10,960
She even

174
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:12,680
wanted to spend 50 silver dollars

175
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,020
to sell Ruolai to me.

176
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:17,490
So you came to Shanghai

177
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,150
to get your marriage with Ruolai annulled?

178
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:23,640
What's your type then?

179
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:28,120
I like someone like Liao Si.

180
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,620
-Liao...
-He's a truly

181
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,830
upright hero.

182
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:35,560
Who is Liao Si?

183
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,150
He used to pick herbs.

184
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:40,930
He was my neighbor.

185
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:42,030
But now,

186
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,140
he's in the Red Army.

187
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,310
Red Army?

188
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:54,120
Neat and frail scholars like Wei Ruolai

189
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:55,220
might be

190
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,050
popular with women in your city.

191
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,600
But not in

192
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,190
my hometown.

193
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:02,260
My mom likes him a lot.

194
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,670
But I didn't agree.

195
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,470
I came to Shanghai

196
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:06,670
to make money

197
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:07,840
for my dowry.

198
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:10,590
Then I'll go to the mountains to find Liao Si.

199
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,560
What if Liao Si doesn't like you?

200
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,080
I'll join the Red Army

201
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,490
and marry another member.

202
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,830
She wants to be a Red Army member

203
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,620
and marry a member.

204
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:29,850
How can I refuse her?

205
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,150
All right, go.

206
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,530
No longer angry?

207
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,520
Thank you, Mr. Xu.

208
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:42,910
The qin!

209
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:44,070
Okay.

210
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,920
Take it.

211
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:47,850
Bye.

212
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:02,910
When we

213
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:04,540
return to our hometown,

214
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,560
can we both join the party?

215
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:13,190
You don't know this.

216
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,900
Since we've done so much work,

217
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:19,030
they must accept us.

218
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:26,230
You don't like

219
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,280
the Communist Party?

220
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:30,510
No.

221
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:32,240
I just...

222
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:34,340
don't know much about it yet.

223
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:36,830
But I do!

224
00:12:37,230 --> 00:12:38,550
Ask me anything.

225
00:12:38,590 --> 00:12:40,440
I know many Red Army members.

226
00:12:40,590 --> 00:12:42,110
They're all heroes.

227
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,100
Don't worry, Doggie.

228
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,230
You'll find out

229
00:12:48,230 --> 00:12:50,430
why our village's youths

230
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,260
are so eager to join the Red Army.

231
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,250
Sleep early.

232
00:12:57,790 --> 00:12:59,190
We're leaving tomorrow.

233
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,110
Jinzhen.

234
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:46,230
Brother.

235
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,150
Still up?

236
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,580
I was waiting for you.

237
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,380
For me?

238
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:53,070
Sit.

239
00:13:53,070 --> 00:13:53,870
Drink with me.

240
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,240
Why are you drinking?

241
00:14:10,870 --> 00:14:13,590
Why are you drinking in the middle of the night?

242
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,960
Are you in a bad mood?

243
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,440
Where did you go during the day?

244
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,310
Just the arsenal

245
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:27,890
for work.

246
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:28,470
Why?

247
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
I found this shell

248
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:49,210
by the sniping spot near the execution ground.

249
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:50,630
If I'm right,

250
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,280
the gun is in the qin case.

251
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:01,900
I saw the person's back

252
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:03,790
but I wasn't sure it was you.

253
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,820
But I remember the qin box.

254
00:15:08,430 --> 00:15:09,230
It looks

255
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,670
just like this one.

256
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,140
What are you talking about?

257
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,040
You saved Ruolai's life.

258
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,260
Thank you.

259
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,860
It has nothing to do with me.

260
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,010
He was lucky.

261
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:39,810
Anything else?

262
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,080
If not,

263
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:41,910
I'm tired.

264
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,830
Rest early.

265
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,670
Be careful in the future.

266
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:46,720
These shells are all evidence.

267
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,180
It's easy to investigate.

268
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:49,310
After Ruolai leaves,

269
00:15:49,310 --> 00:15:50,870
they'll search our house.

270
00:15:50,870 --> 00:15:52,930
If they find the gun, you're done for.

271
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:54,610
What are you on about?

272
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,490
Don't leave the gun at home

273
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,190
and implicate the family.

274
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,310
You have to at least

275
00:16:00,150 --> 00:16:00,950
consider

276
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:03,010
your sister-in-law and Yu's safety.

277
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,680
Reassured now?

278
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:18,060
Good night.

279
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,160
You mean Shen Tunan was there too?

280
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,920
He drove there.

281
00:16:40,150 --> 00:16:41,430
He didn't get injured

282
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,870
from the shootout.

283
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:45,010
So I suspect the sniper's related to him.

284
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:46,180
We've confirmed

285
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,660
his sister's a communist.

286
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:49,100
Shen Tunan...

287
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:49,930
Mr. Kang.

288
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,590
Whether he is or not,

289
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:53,090
he hurt so many of us.

290
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,500
He must pay the price.

291
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:58,550
Learn to prioritize things.

292
00:16:58,870 --> 00:17:00,680
Public opinion can't be suppressed now.

293
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,050
The higher-ups are furious.

294
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,980
The only way to appease them

295
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,290
is to arrest communists.

296
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,750
The more, the better.

297
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,119
My only clue is Shen Jinzhen.

298
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:12,790
Before,

299
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,270
I couldn't arrest her.

300
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:15,200
So I sent some men

301
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,589
to watch her for a while,

302
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,319
but we lost her later.

303
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:21,150
Then change the plan.

304
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,390
Investigate

305
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,550
the people who often interacts with her

306
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:26,869
and places

307
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:27,829
she frequents.

308
00:17:28,270 --> 00:17:29,230
Also,

309
00:17:29,230 --> 00:17:31,630
send more men to watch her.

310
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:32,870
If you need more men,

311
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,710
go to the mob.

312
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:37,300
The Garrison Command will pay for it.

313
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:37,900
Yes!

314
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,520
It's an order from our superior.

315
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,450
Please let us in.

316
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,530
The military area is forbidden.

317
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,230
Guns down!

318
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,250
Captain Lin!

319
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,720
Why the fuss

320
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,580
early in the morning?

321
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:08,820
We're here by orders

322
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,060
to search Shen Jinzhen's office.

323
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:12,860
Please cooperate.

324
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:14,890
Her office is

325
00:18:15,790 --> 00:18:17,790
full of top-secret military intel.

326
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,350
You'll need

327
00:18:20,630 --> 00:18:22,350
Nanjing's permission.

328
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,790
Then we'll go in

329
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,590
after you clear her office

330
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:28,100
of the intel.

331
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,780
As I said,

332
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:32,700
you don't have the right.

333
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:37,130
Yesterday at 3 p.m.,

334
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,660
someone shot several officers

335
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,480
with a sniper gun.

336
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,520
We strongly suspect

337
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,690
Shen Jinzhen's associated with it.

338
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,680
I believe she wasn't in the arsenal then.

339
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,580
Don't worry, Mr. Weng.

340
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,460
We won't arrest her without evidence.

341
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:02,910
Please cooperate.

342
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:06,910
Mr. Wang, let's go.

343
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,480
Miss Shen.

344
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:09,620
Where to today?

345
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:10,330
To the arsenal.

346
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:11,010
Okay.

347
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,460
Please hurry.

348
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,970
This is top-secret.

349
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,910
This too.

350
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:04,930
That too.

351
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:05,760
Relax.

352
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:08,580
I'm just checking for anything hidden behind.

353
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,300
That room is

354
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,240
for authorized personnel only.

355
00:20:16,930 --> 00:20:17,970
Be gentle.

356
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,250
Don't make a big mess. Who'll clean it up?

357
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:25,940
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

358
00:20:26,470 --> 00:20:27,270
Boss.

359
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:30,470
I asked her colleagues.

360
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,040
She frequents

361
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,320
a foreign bookstore,

362
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,780
a French Concession cafe,

363
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:35,950
a dessert shop in Shandong Road,

364
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,630
Yong'an Department Store, Jockey Club, and Great World.

365
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,130
Search these places one by one.

366
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,700
And this.

367
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,550
Hong Fang Clothing Shop?

368
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,390
Stop here. Thank you.

369
00:21:00,430 --> 00:21:01,060
Thank you.

370
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:13,820
Zhongshan Road, please.

371
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,700
Please hurry.

372
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,160
It's already 10 a.m.

373
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,720
Could something

374
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,790
have happened to Miss Shen?

375
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,020
Let's go by ourselves.

376
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,440
How?

377
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,510
The station and dock

378
00:21:51,510 --> 00:21:53,370
must be filled with officers now.

379
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,110
I have a gun.

380
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:57,140
Cut it out.

381
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,610
How about this?

382
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:10,630
I'll ask Xu about it.

383
00:22:10,690 --> 00:22:11,570
I'll go too.

384
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,600
I'll protect you.

385
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,110
Just stay put.

386
00:22:14,110 --> 00:22:15,150
I can go by myself.

387
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,430
If I'm here alone,

388
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,350

Is the guest who used to live here not in?

I don't know. Maybe he checked out.

I believe our parents would support me.

557

Because I believe

only the Communist Party can save China.

566
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:14,650
Of course.

567
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,860
The powerful are afraid of Marxism.

568
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:19,170
Because they know

569
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,400
the Communist Party is for the people.

00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,280
and treasury bills issues,

582
00:33:46,430 --> 00:33:47,870
what did you do?

583
00:33:48,730 --> 00:33:51,290
You watched the people being cheated.

584
00:33:51,310 --> 00:33:53,570
You were helpless and did nothing.

585
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:56,230
You even cleaned up the perpetrators' mess.

586
00:33:56,230 --> 00:33:57,750
Are the current states

587
00:33:57,770 --> 00:34:00,190
of Kuomintang and the Three Principles of the People

588
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:02,630
still what you love and believe in?

589
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,300
Yes.

590
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:05,900
Everything is temporary.

591
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:07,490
If we get through this

592
00:34:07,490 --> 00:34:09,330
and wipe out all the communists,

593
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:10,940
everything will be fine.

594
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,830
It will be!

595
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:17,190
You can't wipe us out.

596
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,540
A single spark can start a prairie fire.

597
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:21,440
The Communist Party

598
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:23,659
was born to create a new world.

599
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,840
The unreasonable things in the world

600
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,800
should be reformed

601
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,230
and rebuilt!

602
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:29,969
For that,

603
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,550
every communist

604
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,179
can sacrifice their life!

605
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,650
Brother.

606
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:47,940
I have to go.

607
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:51,650
If you want to arrest me,

608
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,030
now's the time.

609
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,010
Otherwise,

610
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,730
we can only meet again

611
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:02,450
after the revolution.

612
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:37,230
Shen Jinzhen!

613
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,900
-Come out!
-What are you doing?

614
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,420
What are you doing?

615
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:42,110
Shut up!

616
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:43,390
You bandits!

617
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,590
-Search!
-Yes!

618
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,390
What are you doing?

619
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:46,850
Mr. Shen won't let you off!

620
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,140
Shut up!

621
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,900
Don't cry.

622
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,700
Don't cry

623
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,720
Biao, she's not here.

624
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,270
Biao, she's not here.

625
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,280
Biao, no one's here.

626
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,250
Boss.

627
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:12,110
Only

628
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,840
the housekeeper is at home.

629
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,170
That means she ran away.

630
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:16,890
Inform Mr. Kang now!

631
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,350
Yes.

632
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:18,490
Station more men

633
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:19,750
with Shen Jinzhen's photo

634
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,680
at the station and the dock!

635
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,390
Yes!

636
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,780
Even if you die,

637
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,790
don't let Shen Jinzhen leave Shanghai!

638
00:36:26,790 --> 00:36:27,520
Yes!

639
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:32,450
You'll die a horrible death!

640
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,670
Mr. Shen won't spare you!

641
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,040
Jinzhen!

642
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:06,940
Get in.

643
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:21,480
Where are you going?

644
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,000
Ruolai's waiting for me.

645
00:37:25,130 --> 00:37:26,510
I have to send them out.

646
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:33,110
The officers are everywhere.

647
00:37:33,110 --> 00:37:35,040
You can't hide from them like this.

648
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:39,620
I'll give you a ride.

649
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:29,700
Go!

650
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:30,150
Yes.

651
00:38:31,950 --> 00:38:32,610
Don't move.

652
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,860
What are you doing?

653
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:39,540
Don't move. Get up the stairs.

654
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Who are you?

655
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:43,570
Turn left.

656
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,340
Be gentle!

657
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,520
Don't move.

658
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:51,660
Mr. Qian?

659
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,070
Mr. Qian.

660
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,620
Long time no see.

661
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,480
Y-You want to see me?

662
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,140
Compatriot.

663
00:38:58,810 --> 00:38:59,930
Long time no see.

664
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,210
Then why did you arrest us?

665
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,040
Shut up.

666
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:04,730
Mr. Qian.

667
00:39:04,750 --> 00:39:05,200
Mr. Qian.

668
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,560
Why are you doing this?

669
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,150
Mr. Qian.

670
00:39:12,070 --> 00:39:13,300
You're a communist.

671
00:39:15,310 --> 00:39:16,790
Not yet.

672
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:17,920
But soon.

673
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:18,820
Soon...

674
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,130
Maybe.

675
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:22,230
Just arrest me.

676
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,550
Let her go.

677
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:25,670
If I hand you to the authorities,

678
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,640
I'd get

679
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,140
500 silver dollars.

680
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:29,280
I'll give you 1,000!

681
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,280
Let us go!

682
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,560
You're that rich?

683
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,590
I don't have it now.

684
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,770
I'll pay you back slowly later.

685
00:39:38,290 --> 00:39:40,650
500 silver dollars is nothing.

686
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:44,610
I arrested you

687
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,890
to ask you for a favor.

688
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,150
What is it?

689
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,440
Kuomintang has been playing with fire lately.

690
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:04,260
I need to leave a way out for myself.

691
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:06,820
I'm making friends

692
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,020
with a communist.

693
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,080
Changsheng.

694
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,240
My family is in Shanghai.

695
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,730
In my hometown,

696
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,870
I have neighbors and relatives.

697
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,910
If you become powerful,

698
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,020
please look out for me and my people.

699
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:34,840
Okay.

700
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:51,760
I've known Xu

701
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,120
for more than three years.

702
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,680
Although he looked serious

703
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,110
and stern,

704
00:41:01,870 --> 00:41:02,700
he actually

705
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,220
had a soft heart.

706
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,010
He never

707
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:11,960
got married

708
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:14,320
or had children.

709
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:19,640
He treated me like a daughter.

710
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:23,490
He often cooked good food for me.

711
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,310
He nagged sometimes.

712
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,220
He had no hobbies,

713
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:34,850
except listening to Peking opera and drinking wine

714
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,140
every so often.

715
00:41:44,270 --> 00:41:45,590
His biggest wish

716
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,700
was to see the Red Army enter Shanghai

717
00:41:53,470 --> 00:41:55,190
and witness the victory.

718
00:42:13,190 --> 00:42:14,070
I'm sorry,

719
00:42:14,420 --> 00:42:14,950
Brother.

720
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:35,960
Stop!

721
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,350
We're officers! Open the door!

722
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,990
It's a temporary check.

723
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,060
Please cooperate.

724
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:50,910
You...

725
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:54,920
Where are you going?

726
00:42:55,630 --> 00:42:56,130
Show your ticket!
