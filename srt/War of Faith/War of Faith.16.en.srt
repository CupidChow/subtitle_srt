00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:31,920
[Episode 16]

4
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:33,430
Maybe one day,

5
00:01:33,979 --> 00:01:35,560
the government can really spend a lot of effort

6
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,289
to carry out financial reform.

7
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,270
By then,

8
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,789
we will have a healthy stock market

9
00:01:40,789 --> 00:01:43,320
as a real investment paradise for our people.

10
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,640
Bro,

11
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,020
we don't understand what you're saying.

12
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:50,979
But don't worry.

13
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:52,500
We'll listen to you.

14
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:53,390
Yes.

15
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:54,800
When we get out,

16
00:01:54,830 --> 00:01:56,270
we'll do whatever you say.

17
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,070
If you say no,

18
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:57,850
we'll wait.

19
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,729
Yes, we'll wait.

20
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:07,430
Bro.

21
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,020
What's wrong?

22
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,870
I probably can't get out.

23
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:18,090
Did you really kill someone?

24
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,270
He didn't.

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,840
You've been cleared

26
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:50,710
of murder charges.

27
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:55,930
Let's talk.

28
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,829
Aren't you curious

29
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:26,430
who helped you get rid of the murder charge?

30
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:28,829
If I can get out,

31
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:30,030
I'll naturally know.

32
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,540
Although you didn’t kill Li Shengda,

33
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,040
you did commit robbery.

34
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,120
You robbed a famous banker in Shanghai.

35
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,660
This matter won't pass so easily.

36
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:42,920
It will pass.

37
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,670
Otherwise, you wouldn't treat me to dinner.

38
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:01,560
I'm doing it impartially.

39
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,670
We have no personal grudges.

40
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,960
Indeed.

41
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,320
You're lucky.

42
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,550
Mr. Shen thinks highly of you.

43
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:19,680
He will protect you.

44
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:31,580
Don't worry.

45
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:34,090
I won't badmouth you when I get out.

46
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,420
Not a word.

47
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,730
That's what I've been waiting for.

48
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:48,940
But I will never forget

49
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,220
the gift Captain Lin gave me.

50
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:56,400
I was arrested for my bad behavior.

51
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,130
I won't blame it on anyone else.

52
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,720
But you'd better not play tricks on Mr. Shen.

53
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,600
Otherwise, even if I have to risk my life,

54
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,940
I will die with you.

55
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:16,230
Okay.

56
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:19,200
I hope you'll never

57
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,430
be abandoned

58
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,130
or sacrificed by the person you serve.

59
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,590
Big Sister called just now.

60
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,659
She's very angry.

61
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,400
Mr. Kang.

62
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:51,890
What's going on?

63
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:54,310
How did this happen?

64
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,590
Mr. Yu, calm down.

65
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,290
Mingda is handling this case.

66
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,120
No one dares to do anything stupid.

67
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,030
In the past,

68
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,590
fabricating a witness and evidence

69
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:04,840
was an easy task.

70
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,030
But I really didn't dare to do it this time.

71
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,910
Previously, just to be certain,

72
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,670
I sent someone

73
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,070
to deal with that German.

74
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,110
But who knew

75
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:15,970
I didn't even get to see him.

76
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:18,310
Shen Tunan is a small matter.

77
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:20,790
The problem is the reform he created.

78
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,470
If his reform plan is completed,

79
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,430
how can we do business in the future?

80
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:28,240
I don't mind making less money.

81
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,830
But the higher-ups

82
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,790
are all waiting for their profits.

83
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:33,030
What should I do?

84
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,830
I'm sorry.

85
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,520
Step aside.

86
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,700
Mr. Shen has graciously arrived.

87
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,030
Don't you dare stop him.

88
00:07:00,690 --> 00:07:01,460
Mr. Kang.

89
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,310
Are you receiving guests?

90
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,180
You have many friends.

91
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,780
Did I disturb you?

92
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,680
Not at all.

93
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:08,700
Welcome, Mr. Shen.

94
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,580
Have a seat.

95
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:10,410
No need.

96
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,030
I'll leave after a few words.

97
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:13,310
Let me introduce him.

98
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,550
This is a famous lawyer from Shanghai,

99
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:15,550
Mr. Yao Gengming.

100
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,870
Mr. Yao is the legal advisor of the Central Bank.

101
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,760
He's also the director and professor of Shanghai Law School.

102
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,290
It's a pleasure to meet you.

103
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:23,260
These are the materials

104
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,650
related to Wei Ruolai's arrest case.

105
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,320
Please take a look, Mr. Kang.

106
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:30,800
I will represent Mr. Wei Ruolai

107
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:33,150
on bail and related rights and interests.

108
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,450
I have full confidence

109
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,340
in the success of this case.

110
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,430
Shen Tunan.

111
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:40,190
So,

112
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,770
you're going to fight against the Garrison Command Department?

113
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:45,100
I never provoke anyone.

114
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:47,470
but I'm not afraid of anyone.

115
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,750
Tunan.

116
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:50,840
How about this?

117
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,680
Let's all take a step back.

118
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,820
You

119
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,190
can stop watching our every move too.

120
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:58,550
We are all friends.

121
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,540
If this gets out

122
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,300
and reaches the higher-ups,

123
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,060
it won't do us any good.

124
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,750
Mr. Yu.

125
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,770
It's not that I don't want to release him,

126
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,150
but the special investigation team hasn't decided yet.

127
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,570
Mr. Mingda called me.

128
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:14,270
He read the report from the special investigation team.

129
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,300
Not only must he be acquitted,

130
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,620
but you also have to clarify this matter in the papers.

131
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,020
You...

132
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,430
Fine.

133
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:23,710
Tunan.

134
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,740
If you don't let him go,

135
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,480
I will hold a press conference.

136
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:27,430
Isn't this about reputation?

137
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:28,550
I won't need that

138
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,820
if we plan to fight to the end.

139
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,840
Shen Tunan!

140
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:00,120
Sir.

141
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,190
Miss Shen.

142
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:05,870
It's been hard on you.

143
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:10,720
No, Sir.

144
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:13,220
Thank you for saving me.

145
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,640
Need you thank me?

146
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,660
Don't mention it.

147
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,980
Let's go to the doctor

148
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,500
for a check-up first.

149
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:23,870
Are you

150
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,340
okay?

151
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:26,860
Yes.

152
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:27,870
Not bad.

153
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:29,340
What do you want to eat?

154
00:09:29,340 --> 00:09:30,370
Chinese food or Western food?

155
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,030
How about the one I treated you to last time?

156
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:33,630
We'll go after the check-up.

157
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:36,630
No need.

158
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,720
I ate inside.

159
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,690
Lin Qiaosong treated me to it.

160
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,060
Why did he treat you?

161
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,050
Maybe he was afraid that I would hold a grudge

162
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:48,850
and badmouth him to you.

163
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,960
Who has the time to care about him?

164
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,630
I won't let them get away with this.

165
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:54,630
I'll get even with them one by one.

166
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:57,460
Get in.

167
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,720
Those bastards.

168
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,680
I'm fine, Sir.

169
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,480
I'm much better now.

170
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,950
How could you say that?

171
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,950
I can't even imagine how you endured it.

172
00:11:03,110 --> 00:11:04,260
I thought

173
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:06,910
even if they kill me,

174
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,510
I can't hold you back.

175
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:13,270
You're meant for great things.

176
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,220
You've already held me back.

177
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:16,110
You caused me so much trouble.

178
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:17,990
In the future,

179
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:20,340
remember one thing before making any major decision.

180
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,200
You must discuss it with me first.

181
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,470
If you do it again,

182
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:25,670
you can quit.

183
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:27,890
Yes.

184
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:45,510
Come on.

185
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,320
Ruolai.

186
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,780
This meal is partly to celebrate your return.

187
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,570
Secondly, we didn't finish our New Year's Eve dinner.

188
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:52,130
Today, we'll make up for it.

189
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,980
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

190
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:55,430
Uncle,

191
00:11:55,790 --> 00:11:57,190
after you were arrested,

192
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,470
my aunt cried at home every day.

193
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,230
You're really good at making up stories.

194
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:02,670
Watch fewer movies.

195
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,900
What are you talking about?

196
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,630
She was even rolling in the snow

197
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,190
and pulling at her hair.

198
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:08,430
You're right.

199
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,410
I even tried to hang myself.

200
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,830
You saved me.

201
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,520
Okay?

202
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,440
Yu.

203
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,940
When adults are talking,

204
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:16,510
children should listen more and talk less,

205
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:17,090
okay?

206
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,820
Don't pull your hair anymore, Jinzhen.

207
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:22,020
You two are really father and daughter.

208
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,310
Ruolai.

209
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,260
Here.

210
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:26,390
This event

211
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:28,020
was a catastrophe in your life.

212
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,440
You need to learn from it.

213
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:30,810
Be careful with your words and actions from now on.

214
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:32,230
Don't repeat the same mistake.

215
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:34,780
Let's toast to your safe return.

216
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:35,860
Come on.

217
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:36,960
Cheers.

218
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:37,810
Cheers!

219
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:38,580
Cheers.

220
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,990
Don't leave me out.

221
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,040
Together.

222
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:41,560
Come on.

223
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,750
Cheers.

224
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,390
Cheers.

225
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,910
Cheers!

226
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:54,950
Don't drink too much.

227
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,110
Don't be like a drunkard.

228
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,230
You'll flip the table when you're drunk.

229
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:00,340
Jinzhen is a good drinker.

230
00:13:00,390 --> 00:13:01,630
She won't get that drunk.

231
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:03,720
At most, she'll become talkative.

232
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:06,040
Yes, she talks a lot.

233
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:08,790
She flipped the table before, didn't she?

234
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:09,700
I don't think so.

235
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,230
She did it a few times back in Germany.

236
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,400
Brother, have some food.

237
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,800
Eat more.

238
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,410
Stuff your mouth and talk less.

239
00:13:16,410 --> 00:13:17,290
It won't work.

240
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,780
Eat more.

241
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,780
It still won't work.

242
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,630
Eat more.

243
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,390
Thank you.

244
00:14:08,630 --> 00:14:10,030
Is that an alcohol flush?

245
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:10,730
Is it?

246
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,080
Maybe I drank a little too much.

247
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,200
It's okay.

248
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,530
I heard people who get alcohol flushes

249
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,470
are honest.

250
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:22,670
I can't drink

251
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,650
as much as you.

252
00:14:26,790 --> 00:14:27,810
Don't listen to my brother.

253
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:29,410
You can't believe his words.

254
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,280
Don't drink too much if you can't.

255
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:36,990
This time,

256
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,660
what feeling struck you the most?

257
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:44,660
Well,

258
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:47,710
I felt like it was a pity.

259
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,030
A pity?

260
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:52,540
Sir bought me such expensive clothes

261
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,360
and leather shoes.

262
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,420
I ruined all of them. It's such a pity.

263
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:57,340
It's okay.

264
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,500
I'll ask Master Xu to make more clothes for you.

265
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,170
I'll pay.

266
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:01,550
Why?

267
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:04,910
You endured the torture

268
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,930
and didn't implicate my brother.

269
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,120
It's expected of me.

270
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,200
Sir went through so much to save me,

271
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,550
I already feel very bad.

272
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:15,390
You're feeling bad already?

273
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,540
I did a lot to save you too.

274
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,000
I even surveyed the crime scene and became an interpreter.

275
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,400
They didn't even feed me.

276
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,100
Well,

277
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:26,430
let me treat you to Western food.

278
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,860
Just kidding.

279
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:30,210
Forget about the meal.

280
00:15:30,390 --> 00:15:31,390
However,

281
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,870
you owe me a big favor this time.

282
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,030
Think about how to repay it.

283
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,540
You can't even handle such a simple case!

284
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,180
Who asked you to hand over the bullet?

285
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:53,190
Tell me.

286
00:15:53,510 --> 00:15:54,310
Mr. Kang.

287
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,330
If I didn't hand it over,

288
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,780
they would have asked about the body

289
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,890
and the forensic report.

290
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,040
You couldn't even figure out this trick?

291
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:06,720
What did Huangpu Military Academy teach you?

292
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:10,180
Huangpu Military Academy taught me loyalty and patriotism.

293
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,580
It taught me that deceiving an official

294
00:16:13,670 --> 00:16:15,310
serving Chairman Chiang

295
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,290
is an act of treason.

296
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,740
Do you know the story of Ji Gang?

297
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,780
He was the commander of the Ming Dynasty Imperial Guards.

298
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,300
He was unruly

299
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:26,530
and cunning.

300
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,090
He had leverage over the officials.

301
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:33,100
People sucked up to him.

302
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:38,240
So he became arrogant and power-hungry.

303
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,190
Do you know what happened to him in the end?

304
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,020
He plotted treason

305
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,920
and was tortured to death.

306
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,110
He plotted treason

307
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:56,470
and was tortured to death.

308
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,589
Sir, want to polish your shoes?

309
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,310
Sure.

310
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,190
Come to my place for dinner later.

311
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,060
Wonton!

312
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:14,810
Fried dough sticks!

313
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:25,720
Wei!

314
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,440
You're back!

315
00:17:28,470 --> 00:17:29,270
It hurts.

316
00:17:30,510 --> 00:17:30,990
Are you okay?

317
00:17:30,990 --> 00:17:31,550
I'm fine.

318
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,610
When were you released?

319
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:35,620
This morning.

320
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,550
You're completely fine now, right?

321
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,140
Yes.

322
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,090
That's good.

323
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,600
I kept telling them.

324
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,790
You're such a nice guy, you'd be fine.

325
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,350
Come and take a look.

326
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,830
It’s Wei. Talk to him.

327
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:48,660
Look.

328
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:50,680
Go away.

329
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:51,510
It's bad luck.

330
00:17:52,070 --> 00:17:53,070
What's wrong?

331
00:17:53,070 --> 00:17:54,270
It's Wei!

332
00:17:54,550 --> 00:17:55,320
Look at them.

333
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,770
Wen.

334
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,220
The newspaper said I killed someone and colluded with the Communist Party.

335
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,340
I can understand

336
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,310
if they want to steer clear of me.

337
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,670
Wei didn't kill anyone.

338
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,130
Wei didn't kill anyone.

339
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:09,570
He didn't collude with the Communist Party.

340
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,720
Wei is fine!

341
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,830
Otherwise, why would they

342
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,750
release him so early?

343
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,370
Right?

344
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,230
Wei.

345
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:17,730
Ignore them.

346
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,030
When it came to

347
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:20,850
asking you about the stock updates,

348
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,290
they were so enthusiastic.

349
00:18:22,290 --> 00:18:23,710
But the moment something happens,

350
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:25,570
they run faster than anyone else.

351
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:26,950
Wei.

352
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,280
Let's ignore them.

353
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:28,840
Let's go.

354
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:29,750
Come home with me.

355
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:31,140
Move. Don't come in.

356
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:37,400
Ms. Zhou, what's the meaning of this?

357
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:38,840
Why are you like this too?

358
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:40,870
If I knew you were like this, I...

359
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:43,950
Wei.

360
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:48,390
Walk over it.

361
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:49,880
Ms. Zhou...

362
00:18:50,510 --> 00:18:52,170
It's for dispelling bad luck.

363
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:53,160
Hurry up!

364
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,240
Wei, you're back.

365
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,190
You've suffered inside.

366
00:19:10,110 --> 00:19:10,950
Are you hungry?

367
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:11,630
What do you want to eat?

368
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,390
Tell me.

369
00:19:12,390 --> 00:19:13,390
I'll cook for you.

370
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,510
Why are you letting him in?

371
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:16,640
You can't let him in.

372
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:17,510
What if he gets upset one day

373
00:19:17,510 --> 00:19:18,230
and kills you?

374
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,390
Bullshit!

375
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,190
Everyone knows Wei.

376
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:21,960
Tell me.

377
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:25,830
Where else can we find such a good kid in Qibao Street?

378
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,580
He's good-hearted and polite.

379
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,060
I have no daughter.

380
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,140
If I had a daughter,

381
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,750
I would have made him my son-in-law.

382
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,030
Ms. Zhou.

383
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,680
He's in the Communist Party.

384
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,000
The newspaper said

385
00:19:37,370 --> 00:19:38,920
his brother was in the Communist Party.

386
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,450
What are you talking about?

387
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:42,260
That's a rumor, a slander!

388
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,590
I'll sue these unscrupulous media tomorrow

389
00:19:44,590 --> 00:19:45,470
and make them compensate us.

390
00:19:45,470 --> 00:19:45,990
Ms. Zhou.

391
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:47,430
It's from the Central Daily News.

392
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:48,130
My brother

393
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,440
was really from the Communist Party.

394
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:50,880
See?

395
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,790
He admitted it.

396
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,390
Get out!

397
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,340
Shut up!

398
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,420
But you're not!

399
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:59,180
It's good as long as you're not.

400
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:00,710
Besides,

401
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:03,340
what Wei does at the Central Bank

402
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,210
is all about state affairs.

403
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,800
Even foreigners were beaten down by him

404
00:20:07,950 --> 00:20:09,280
and forced to pay money.

405
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,050
What does that make him?

406
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:13,460
The national hero of Qibao Street,

407
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,310
just like Yue Fei,

408
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,110
or Qi Jiguang.

409
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,790
Ms. Zhou...

410
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:21,750
Listen carefully. All of you!

411
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:25,300
Wei is a good boy. I like him.

412
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,590
The people upstairs, listen up too!

413
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:28,460
You, and you.

414
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,740
Listen carefully.

415
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,460
If you are not convinced,

416
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:32,390
get out of here.

417
00:20:32,730 --> 00:20:33,930
Sleep on the streets.

418
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:37,410
You're all so worked up

419
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,420
over such a small matter.

420
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,430
Ridiculous.

421
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,440
Move.

422
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,550
Stop talking nonsense.

423
00:20:46,750 --> 00:20:47,330
Wei.

424
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,380
Ignore them.

425
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:53,080
My door is always open to you.

426
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:54,880
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

427
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:56,020
Aren't I nice to you?

428
00:20:56,550 --> 00:20:57,810
Aren't I considerate?

429
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,460
So it's not too much to raise your rent

430
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:04,740
by two silver dollars a year, right?

431
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:06,000
Two silver dollars.

432
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:07,400
Ms. Zhou...

433
00:22:02,650 --> 00:22:03,180
Brother.

434
00:22:03,710 --> 00:22:04,970
Are you still working?

435
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,380
Mr. Song is waiting for the audit report.

436
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,160
What is it?

437
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,780
Didn't you previously acquire Xingxia Bank?

438
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,010
They have some military industry customers.

439
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:19,750
Can you give me the client files?

440
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:20,430
No.

441
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,910
Client files of military industry customers?

442
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,990
I can't leak such important information.

443
00:22:25,990 --> 00:22:28,110
Brother, I work for the arsenal.

444
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:30,830
The factory asked for these materials.

445
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,430
Could you please do me a favor

446
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,480
and support your sister's work?

447
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:38,420
Why does your factory need this?

448
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:39,850
It's an enterprise.

449
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:40,940
For an enterprise,

450
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:43,000
competitors are the most important.

451
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,320
Nanjing buys weapons from foreigners.

452
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,650
They're very generous and never bargain.

453
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,250
I'm thinking

454
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,840
that if some things can be produced in our factory,

455
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,650
not only

456
00:22:53,650 --> 00:22:55,660
will the factory make more money,

457
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:56,440
but

458
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,000
it'll save a lot of money for the Kuomintang.

459
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,190
Let's not talk about others.

460
00:23:00,190 --> 00:23:01,310
How much

461
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,480
do the bullets

462
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,720
for killing the communists in Jiangxi cost every time?

463
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,600
Have you ever calculated it?

464
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,330
Am I right?

465
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,080
You have a point.

466
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,900
But giving you the customer information

467
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,840
will break the rules.

468
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,960
I won't make things difficult for you.

469
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,800
How about this?

470
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:19,520
Tomorrow,

471
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:22,250
I'll ask our factory director to report to the Central Bank

472
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,310
or apply directly to the Treasury Department.

473
00:23:24,310 --> 00:23:25,680
Let's keep it professional.

474
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:26,780
Wait. Wait.

475
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,800
Fine.

476
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,090
I can give you the customer information.

477
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:39,090
But the transaction list

478
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,830
and accounts can't be given.

479
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:43,110
Ask Secretary Huang for it tomorrow.

480
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Thank you, Brother.

481
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,620
Thank you for our factory.

482
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:49,600
But

483
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:51,650
why should I ask Secretary Huang for it?

484
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:52,980
Doesn't Ruolai have it?

485
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:57,790
After this incident,

486
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,880
Ruolai may be ostracized in the bank.

487
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,680
I hope he can bear it.

488
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,240
He can do it.

489
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:11,030
Newspapers!

490
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:22,410
[The Central Bank of China]

491
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:18,440
Newspapers! Newspapers!

492
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:27,540
Morning.

493
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:29,250
Morning.

494
00:25:29,530 --> 00:25:30,280
And

495
00:25:30,310 --> 00:25:32,220
treat every customer like a family member.

496
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,740
Greet them with a smile.

497
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,170
Give all your enthusiasm.

498
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,030
Morning, Assistant Manager Lin.

499
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,290
What are you looking at?

500
00:25:39,290 --> 00:25:40,010
The meeting is over.

501
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:41,210
Get back to work.

502
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,320
Secretary Huang.

503
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,540
You shouldn't have come back.

504
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,890
Why?

505
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:02,720
I can't sign the resignation letter.

506
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,800
Don't act impulsively.

507
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,210
I'm not acting impulsively.

508
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:06,170
You were present

509
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,320
in the entire investigation.

510
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,200
You know Wei Ruolai isn't a communist.

511
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,840
Why are you kicking him out now?

512
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,010
I got him off for you and the Central Bank.

513
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:13,890
I let him go this time.

514
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,210
It's also for you and the Central Bank.

515
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:16,340
I know you mean well.

516
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,920
But I'm sorry. I can't accept your kindness.

517
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:19,810
Tunan.

518
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:21,960
I know you care about him.

519
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:23,200
If it doesn't work, we can give him more money.

520
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,250
It's not about money,

521
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,040
Chief Deng.

522
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,510
Why are you so stubborn?

523
00:26:26,510 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm not being stubborn.

524
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,090
You didn't see

525
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,800
how much torture Wei Ruolai suffered in prison

526
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:31,330
and how badly he was beaten.

527
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:36,080
If Wei Ruolai had just nodded his head

528
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,010
and made some things

529
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:38,360
have something to do with me,

530
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,680
he would have been fine.

531
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:42,140
He didn't have to suffer so much, Chief Deng.

532
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:45,700
For such a subordinate,

533
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:47,990
can you let me leave him alone?

534
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:48,820
Calm down.

535
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:50,260
I don't need to calm down.

536
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:51,640
People

537
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:54,960
can seek advantages and avoid disadvantages,

538
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,010
but they can't forget to be moral for personal gain.

539
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:57,810
Tunan.

540
00:26:58,360 --> 00:26:59,110
Tunan!

541
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,360
You saved Mr. Shen's life before.

542
00:27:06,810 --> 00:27:07,940
I'm indebted to you.

543
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,520
Thank you.

544
00:27:13,710 --> 00:27:14,470
I know

545
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:16,810
Mr. Shen cherishes talents.

546
00:27:16,810 --> 00:27:18,140
He thinks highly of you.

547
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,920
And you saved him before.

548
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:20,750
So even though

549
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,850
you caused so much trouble this time,

550
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,080
Mr. Shen won't give up on you.

551
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,890
But you should be self-aware.

552
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,200
If you continue to stay by Mr. Shen's side,

553
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,260
you'll only cause him more troubles.

554
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
It'll damage the reputation

555
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,530
of him and the Central Bank.

556
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,800
Does Mr. Shen know what you said?

557
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,130
He doesn't need to know.

558
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,470
If you still have dignity,

559
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,330
please leave here immediately.

560
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,360
Then go tell Mr. Shen.

561
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,480
If Mr. Shen agrees,

562
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:48,920
I'll leave immediately.

563
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,890
I won't stay here for even a second.

564
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:52,720
Wei Ruolai!

565
00:27:58,560 --> 00:27:59,240
Sir.

566
00:28:41,110 --> 00:28:41,820
Sir.

567
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,230
Ruolai.

568
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,050
Do you want me to be your mentor?

569
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,350
Sir.

570
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:02,850
This has always been my wish.

571
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:07,170
The people who gave birth to me are my parents.

572
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,170
The person who teach me is my mentor.

573
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,200
Mentor Shen,

574
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:12,470
please let me bow to you three times.

575
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,030
Hand me a cup of tea.

576
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:32,570
There's one.

577
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:33,460
Right away.

578
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,560
Excuse me.

579
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:42,420
Here, Wei.

580
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,080
Mentor.

581
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,320
This pen has been with me.

582
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:12,090
I'm giving it to you now.

583
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:23,860
Thank you, Mentor.

584
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,870
I'd like to invite all of you here

585
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:30,250
to be our witnesses.

586
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,330
From now on,

587
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,150
Wei Ruolai

588
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,590
is my last disciple.

589
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,850
I'm both his teacher

590
00:30:37,850 --> 00:30:39,520
and his political guarantor.

591
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,050
From now on,

592
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:42,960
no one is allowed

593
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,960
to ask him to leave the Central Bank.

594
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:47,920
Ruolai.

595
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:49,500
From now on,

596
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,200
we're mentor and mentee.

597
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,480
I have the obligation

598
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:54,390
to educate and supervise you.

599
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,620
In your daily life,

600
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:57,730
you must be honest and diligent.

601
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,000
Don't be lazy.

602
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,240
Don't indulge yourself.

603
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,810
Don't be tainted with other thoughts

604
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,870
and prefer other principles.

605
00:31:02,870 --> 00:31:03,650
Otherwise,

606
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,650
you'll be severely punished.

607
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:06,580
I won't forget.

608
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,550
I'll try my best

609
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,390
and not let you down.

610
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:11,610
Good.

611
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,890
Good.

[Military Industry Customer Information]

613
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:42,650
This is the Xingxia Bank's military industry customer information.

614
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:44,540
There are names and contact information on it.

615
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,610
But my brother said the transaction list

616
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:46,750
is their trade secret.

617
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:47,960
He didn't give it to me.

618
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,470
This is enough.

619
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:54,760
Those who can have bank accounts in the Xingxia Bank are international companies.

620
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,810
Check according to this list later.

621
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,330
As long as their business is related to tungsten ore,

623
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,700
Don't care about whether we can succeed.

624
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,080
By the way,

625
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,560
I took a look at the place of my brother's secretary.

626
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,890
Something's wrong with a German company.

627
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:14,010
Its transaction volume of tungsten ore mine is extremely huge.

628
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:15,810
What's the name of that company?

629
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,370
Rhine Metal.

630
00:32:17,450 --> 00:32:19,270
They have a bank account in the Xingxia Bank.

631
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,390
They used to transfer their payment to Xingxia first

632
00:32:21,390 --> 00:32:22,720
before transferring it to Nanjing.

633
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:23,940
The person in charge is Hans.

634
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,250
He's an old friend of my brother.

635
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,850
They always drink together.

636
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,840
Hans?

637
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:44,960
Sir.

638
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,410
Your tea is ready.

639
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,880
Do you feel

640
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:53,180
that we've been led by the nose recently?

641
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,370
Since this German guy got involved,

642
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,940
everything has gone off the rails.

643
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,760
The shooting test at the shooting range at first.

644
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,930
Then, the crime scene.

645
00:33:05,930 --> 00:33:08,200
The comparison between the bullet calibers at last.

646
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,720
It seems

647
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:12,810
that everything was arranged by someone long ago.

648
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,540
Step by step,

649
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,320
we were pushed to a dead end.

650
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,580
In the end, we could only release Wei Ruolai.

651
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:21,720
Sir.

652
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,560
The German guy has been tried.

653
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:24,170
He couldn't be handled.

654
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,120
He's richer than Mr. Kang.

655
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:25,720
No, no, no.

656
00:33:26,810 --> 00:33:28,170
The German guy has no stake

657
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,380
in this case.

658
00:33:29,570 --> 00:33:30,570
I suspect

659
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,200
Shen Jinzhen.

660
00:33:35,970 --> 00:33:37,000
Do you remember?

661
00:33:37,450 --> 00:33:39,600
When Lonely Star was in Rosemary Coffee,

662
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,080
she and Wilhem were there.

663
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,600
Now it seems that...

664
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,660
Not only that time.

665
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,560
Do you remember the meeting in the Central Bank?

666
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,760
She was there too.

667
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,560
Shen Jinzhen.

668
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,080
When Li Shengda wakes up,

669

all the demons

670
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:59,560
will show themselves.

00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:14,840
Don't be nervous.

674
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,310
I'm here to cheer for you.

675
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:18,460
Don't go.

00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:23,780
No need.

When will the surgery start?

682
00:34:45,889 --> 00:34:46,530
Soon.

683
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:47,690
I've made an appointment

684
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,409
with Doctor Raymond from Shengxin Hospital.

685
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:50,270
He's American.

686

He's currently the best brain surgeon in the country.

687
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,400
We'll operate together.

688
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:56,780
How sure are you?

Great.

If we succeed in negotiating this time,

He's very smart.

00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,840

has long been approved.

The tariff accounts of your HSBC

Your policy risks will also increase.

The institutions which are doing business with you

749
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,630
will also re-evaluate your bank.

00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:21,960
So what?

751
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,470
Do you think I scare easily?

You don't care.

753
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,840
But if it affects your bank's business,

754
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:30,240
there will be some concern outside, right?

755
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:31,240
Or

00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,370
can you also

00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,360
Wei Ruolai, don't go too far.

760
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:42,220
Mr. Zhang.

761
00:37:42,850 --> 00:37:44,610
It's just a friendly reminder.

762
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,810
After all, it's not easy to find a job in Shanghai now,

763
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,280
especially in the financial industry.

764
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,110
Am I right?

765
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,560
Why are you so serious?

766
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,030
I just poured it.

767
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:03,960
Have a drink.

768
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,180
Take it easy.

769
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,850
Mr. Song.

770
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,180
On the surface,

771
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,980
the incident seems to be over.

772
00:38:21,150 --> 00:38:22,600
I'll be more careful in the future.

773
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,660
Domestic affairs

774
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,740
are easy to handle.

775
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,640
The most troublesome thing now is the international affairs.

776
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,240
Hans, the representative of the German Rhine Metal Company

777
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,080
came here.

778
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:31,410
He came here to blame us.

779
00:38:31,590 --> 00:38:34,130
He questioned us on our failure to deliver tungsten ore in time.

780
00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:36,780
This should be a chain reaction of the tariff reform.

781
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,710
In the large-scale loan that year,

782
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:41,670
Britain and France loaned 7,000,000 pounds in total,

783
00:38:41,670 --> 00:38:43,530
while Germany loaned 6,000,000.

784
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,720
Now the custody of the taxes

785
00:38:45,770 --> 00:38:47,920
has been transferred from the Bank Union to our Central Bank.

786
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,520
I think Germans aren't convinced.

787
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:50,980
It's not his real purpose.

788
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:54,160
I received important information from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

789
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:55,370
Hans came here

790
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,840
to do tungsten ore business with the Communist Party.

791
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,640
They want to buy it in Jiangxi.

792
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,750
Ridiculous!

793
00:39:00,770 --> 00:39:02,800
How can Germans be so short-sighted?

794
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,370
The Communist Party can't have a firm footing in Jiangxi.

795
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,500
Can't they see that?

796
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,840
The failure in Jiangxi last time

797
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:10,020
made Germans lose confidence in us.

798
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,400
Don't worry, Mr. Song.

799
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,010
Hans and I were classmates.

800
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,640
As long as I'm here,

801
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,930
I won't let them

802
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,190
make any deals with the Communist Party.

803
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:19,250
Tungsten ore can only be bought from us.

804
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:20,450
It's such a big business.

805
00:39:20,450 --> 00:39:21,900
Relying on friendship alone

806
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,980
isn't safe.

807
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,210
I've already informed the Garrison Command.

808
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:28,210
Kang Shaojie will be responsible for arresting the communists who come to negotiate.

809
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:30,280
Are there any problems between you two?

810
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,160
No.

811
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,160
I can tell

812
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,370
which thing is more important.

813
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:33,890
Okay.

814
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,860
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

815
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,530
Stop.

816
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,430
ID.

817
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:56,290
-Let them go.
-Yes.

818
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,160
We're here again.

819
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,400
Are you scared?

820
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,310
No, Sir.

821
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,250
You're good?

822
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:23,940
I'm good.

823
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,110
Let's go.

824
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,970
It's a very confidential operation.

825
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:32,170
You brought someone who is suspect of being a communist.

826
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:33,370
It's inappropriate.

827
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,370
Hasn't he exonerated?

828
00:40:35,370 --> 00:40:36,840
Otherwise, you wouldn't have released him.

829
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:40,360
Mr. Shen, we should be cautious in matters concerning the Kuomintang.

830
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:42,400
You found someone at random and said he's a communist.

831
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,440
Is this the "cautious" you said?

832
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:46,130
If he leaks the operation,

833
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,370
will you take responsibility?

834
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,170
I'll be the man

835
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,760
leading the tungsten ore negotiation.

836
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,210
You'll just assist me.

837
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:54,910
Don't step on my toes.

838
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:57,900
Fine.

839
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,930
Since you insist, let's stop arguing.

840
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,090
Qiaosong, get down to business.

841
00:41:08,050 --> 00:41:10,050
According to the current information,

842
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,010
Hans arrived in Shanghai two days ago.

843
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,940
He checked in at Astor House Hotel.

844
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,370
That area belongs to Germans.

845
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,860
So we're somewhat passive.

846
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,560
We can only surveil them outside.

847
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:20,050
Even if we get a room in the hotel,

848
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,510
we can only watch them on the same floor.

849
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:22,630
We can't shoot.

850
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,200
Otherwise, people from the concession will come to blame us.

851
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,470
What's going on with the Communist Party?

852
00:41:26,470 --> 00:41:27,750
According to the information from Germany,

853
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,170
the handler's name is Lei Ming.

854
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:30,030
He's in his early 40s.

855
00:41:30,030 --> 00:41:32,280
He's now a financial official in the Communist Party's Jiangxi Soviet.

856
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,920
When he was studying in Shanghai early in life,

857
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:34,960
he caused a riot.

858
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:36,470
We have a picture of him.

859
00:41:43,090 --> 00:41:44,160
Have you issued warrants?

860
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,310
We've already issued them at the station and the dock.

861
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,310
But he may disguise himself.

862
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,530
We definitely don't have enough people

863
00:41:49,530 --> 00:41:50,530
to conduct a thorough inspection.

864
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,360
So we want

865
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,370
to focus on Astor House Hotel.

866
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,160
I don't think arresting people is the point.

867
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,620
The point is negotiation.

868
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,800
You have no right to speak here.

869
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,630
What Wei Ruolai says

870
00:42:00,670 --> 00:42:02,580
represents my position and attitude.

871
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,460
Advisor Shen.

872
00:42:03,710 --> 00:42:04,730
You've gone too far.

873
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:06,370
Let me ask you.

874
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,250
If Hans goes out to see communists,

875
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,210
what will you do?

876
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:10,480
Follow him and arrest people secretly.

877
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,160
What if he stops you?

878
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,120
Then I'll arrest them together.

879
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,980
Arrest a German in the concession?

880
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:15,310
Are you out of your mind?

881
00:42:15,610 --> 00:42:17,840
You're afraid of causing international incidents.

882
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,730
I'm not afraid.

883
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:20,160
At worst, I'll be punished.

884
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,110
You don't know

885
00:42:21,130 --> 00:42:21,890
how much profit

886
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,850
the tungsten ore trade can bring to the government every year.

887
00:42:23,850 --> 00:42:24,610
Listen.

888
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,120
If you delay the negotiation, let alone you,

889
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:26,840
Mr. Kang,

890
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,130
even your head

891
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:31,450
may not be kept.

892
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,350
Welcome.

893
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:40,140
Look around.

894
00:42:43,030 --> 00:42:44,030
Waist.

895
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,900
Two feet one.

896
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:47,880
Take it in three days.

897
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:51,130
Sir, what would you like?

898
00:42:51,580 --> 00:42:52,270
Mr. Xu.

899
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:54,590
Long time no see.
