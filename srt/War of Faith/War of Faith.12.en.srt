00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,930
[Episode 12]

4
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,960
I don't think this is suicide.

5
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,710
This is murder.

6
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,170
Drive him out!

7
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,050
Mr. Kang!

8
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,039
This is so obvious.

9
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:38,870
Why—

10
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,340
Mr. Kang,

11
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,580
I understand what you mean.

12
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,780
Can you give me another chance?

13
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:01,310
What if I don't?

14
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,890
Shen's assassination case

15
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,150
is scrutinized by all.

16
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:07,870
You don't want to see me

17
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,039
make a fuss

18
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:10,710
for nothing, right?

19
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:12,720
My position is low,

20
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:14,290
but as you just said

21
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,630
I have some old friends in Nanjing.

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,620
Mr. Kang,

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,270
I'll let go of this case.

24
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:31,500
You can close the case however you want.

25
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,900
I just want to work at ease

26
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,770
in the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

27
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:42,640
Mr. Kang, please have mercy

28
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:43,970
and spare me.

29
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:54,670
Alright, get up.

30
00:02:57,579 --> 00:02:58,840
I know you are capable.

31
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:00,670
However,

32
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,030
I hope you're clear about

33
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,850
whose side you're on.

34
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:09,200
Yes.

35
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:11,250
From now on,

36
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,220
I will act only under your orders.

37
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,790
Mr. Kang, you've very resourceful.

38
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:27,390
Not only did the man disappear,

39
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,740
but even the testimony and files

40
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:29,820
have disappeared.

41
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,980
Mr. Kang,

42
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,280
impressive.

43
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:34,700
Mingquan, you can sleep well tonight.

44
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,010
Thanks to you.

45
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,090
The first batch of opium

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,610
has finally arrived in Shanghai.

47
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:42,120
With your addition,

48
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,010
this will be

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,060
a great boost

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:46,670
to the business.

51
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,090
You flatter me.

52
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,960
Yes.

53
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:49,750
I suggest,

54
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,610
let's drink to our better cooperation

55
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:53,510
in the future

56
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,860
and for countless money.

57
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,150
Cheers!

58
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,900
Cheers.

59
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:58,310
Cheers.

60
00:03:58,310 --> 00:03:59,960
That's "money" in English.

61
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,870
Money.

62
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,130
Money.

63
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,390
Cheers.

64
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,990
It must be Yu Shiqing.

65
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,770
He killed the man and destroyed the evidence.

66
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:15,710
These people

67
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,910
are more and more lawless.

68
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,459
Sir,

69
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,079
they dared to attack you.

70
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,440
They must pay the price.

71
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,390
I have plenty of ways

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:25,630
to deal with them.

73
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,070
Tell the doctor I need to be discharged.

74
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,230
Sir, the doctor said—

75
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:29,920
Discharge.

76
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:32,690
Yes.

77
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:40,180
Sir, you're back.

78
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:40,860
Mrs. Wang.

79
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,320
Why are you...

80
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,780
You haven't recovered yet.

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,500
Why did you leave the hospital?

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,300
I have many matters to deal with.

83
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,590
Don't worry. I'm fine.

84
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,690
I've made arrangements

85
00:04:53,690 --> 00:04:56,290
for the doctor to check on me regularly at the bank.

86
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:56,730
Then...

87
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,500
Don't.

88
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,150
I'm hungry.

89
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:01,060
Mrs. Wang,

90
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,540
cook some wontons for him.

91
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,440
Okay.

92
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:05,860
Does the bank have this much work to do?

93
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:07,770
The bank has many matters every day, you know.

94
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:08,770
I don't know.

95
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,230
Your alcohol.

96
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:22,720
Let me.

97
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,470
Let me do it.

98
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,030
How much money

99
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,600
do you think Kang Shaojie accepted this time?

100
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:34,300
How dare he

101
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,740
play around with a case at this level?

102
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,270
It's none of your business.

103
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:39,780
Anyway, it's over.

104
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,570
From now on, we'd better behave.

105
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,630
Don't provoke him.

106
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,460
We're under a low roof.

107
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:45,630
That's right.

108
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,960
When we're under a roof,

109
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,760
lowering our head

110
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:48,930
is nothing bad.

111
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,580
We have food and drinks.

112
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,680
We're just making a living.

113
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:54,470
Sir,

114
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,820
living well is more important than anything.

115
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,240
In Nanjing,

116
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,350
the people I hated the most

117
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:04,350
were those who wore Chinese tunics.

118
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,110
Each of them

119
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,660
were well-dressed and looked proper.

120
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,860
They said the prettiest things,

121
00:06:10,870 --> 00:06:12,070
but when they worked,

122
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,910
they did everything to get money into their own pockets.

123
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:17,930
Shen Tunan

124
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,250
is pretentious

125
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:20,940
and arrogant,

126
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,260
but he really does work for the Party.

127
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,660
He risks his life.

128
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:32,090
Kang Shaojie doesn't deserve to hold a chamber pot for him.

129
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,850
You can't say that.

130
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,900
Watch out for eavesdropping.

131
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,230
I'm not afraid of dying.

132
00:06:38,630 --> 00:06:41,159
The first day after I graduated from Huangpu,

133
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,050
I was almost shot to death by the sergeant.

134
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:46,860
From that day on,

135
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,540
I no longer cared

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,159
about my life or my position.

137
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,680
I know you all don't like me.

138
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,740
Bring it on.

139
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:58,920
Bring it on!

140
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:02,240
Let's see who falls down first.

141
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:06,790
Delicious.

142
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:10,790
One more bite.

143
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,070
Tunan.

144
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:14,830
Mrs. Wang said you suddenly came back.

145
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,210
You haven't fully recovered.

146
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,940
Why did you come back suddenly?

147
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:20,340
The Central Bank has important things.

148
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,900
Is work that important?

149
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,360
You two talk first.

150
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,100
I'll send the food back first.

151
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,000
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

152
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:33,860
What is so important

153
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,860
that you're so anxious to get discharged for?

154
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:36,920
Listen.

155
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,659
Take care of yourself first.

156
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,720
Otherwise, you can't go back to work.

157
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,650
Your brother

158
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,140
is like fighting a war now.

159
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,380
If I miss this opportunity,

160
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,659
the other side will be prepared

161
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,980
and the battle will be difficult.

162
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:49,500
You're still fighting in this state?

163
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,960
Who are you fighting with?

164
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,820
Yu Shiqing?

165
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,580
Yes.

166
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,140
The assassin who tried to kill me

167
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,310
has just been killed.

168
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,370
I'm guessing that they will

169
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:06,020
cause a lot of trouble for the Central Bank

170
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,900
in the financial market next.

171
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,150
Xingxia Bank

172
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,100
has been in international trade for many years

173
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,540
and has worked with arms dealers

174
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,860
from various countries.

175
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:16,810
The tungsten ore mine in Jiangxi Soviet

176
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:17,740
can't make sales

177
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:20,000
because of Xingxia's interference.

178
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,950
It's our tungsten ore trade's biggest obstacle.

179
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,500
Our superiors have asked us

180
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,160
to get rid of Xingxia long ago,

181
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,870
but we couldn't find a way.

182
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:30,580
This is a good chance.

183
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,059
Why don't you just acquire

184
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,100
Xingxia Bank

185
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,280
so they won't be in the way?

186
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,280
You can't acquire it just like that.

187
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,070
That's Yu Shiqing.

188
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:41,460
He has been in Shanghai for so many years.

189
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:42,990
He has a strong background.

190
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,310
If I act impulsively

191
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,740
without finding his weakness,

192
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:47,340
all my efforts will be in vain

193
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,550

Thank you.

00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:24,920
Chief Deng,

204
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:26,340
you came personally to pick me up

205
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,740
and made such a big scene.

206
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:29,150
I'm very flattered.

207
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,190
It's my pleasure.

00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,510
It's not just my idea.

This was also Mr. Song's idea.

Congratulations, Tunan.

to be a director.

231
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,580
There is a first time in everything.

232
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:12,330
From now on,

233
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:13,710
we have to work harder.

234
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,680
We can't let Chairman Chiang down.

235
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,290
Of course.

236
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,070
Sir, I request to snipe Xingxia

237
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,060
and teach Yu

238
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,610
that the Central Bank shouldn't be offended.

239
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:34,400
No, this is too rushed.

Sir,

246
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,660
I've been studying Xingxia lately.

247
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:46,580
Didn't you say

248
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,150
battles must be fought in one breath?

249
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:49,460
It's the same with the financial battles.

250
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:50,400
Besides, haven't you already

251
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,530
studied Xingxia?

252
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,380
Ruolai,

253
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,180
knowing is easy, doing is hard.

254
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,820
The stock market is far more dangerous than you think.

255
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,630
Sir, I guarantee

256
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,340
I'll take down Xingxia within two weeks

257
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:02,600
or you can have my head.

258
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,470
Wei Ruolai, you're presumptuous.

259
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,020

Yes.

The biggest taboo

264
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,460
in chess is to be impatient.

265
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,990
-Sir, I'm not.
-You are.

266
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,780
I got shot,

267
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,110
so you want to avenge me.

268
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,500
I understand that,

269
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:41,330
but

270
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,550
if it's just for revenge,

271
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:44,640
it's unnecessary.

272
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,990
In the grand scheme,

273
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,700
personal grievances are not that important.

274
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:49,520
Sir, then you would've been shot in vain.

275
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,480
I told you it's the timing.

276
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,320
Now is not the right time.

277
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,700
Yu Shiqing has been in Shanghai for many years.

278
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:56,900
He has complicated connections.

279
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,900
You can't do something

280
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,780
to him just because you want to.

281
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,660
Sir, he's just a sick tiger now.

282
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,120
I know his weakness.

283
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,950
Trust me, I won't fail this time.

284
00:14:05,030 --> 00:14:05,830
What if you do?

285
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,310
You can have my head.

286
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,180
Why would I want your head?

287
00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:11,710
But actually,

288
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:13,880
your head is the most valuable.

289
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:17,630
How about this?

290
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:18,920
If you fail,

291
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,580

No problem.

294

Then,

295
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,850
I'll get going, sir.

296
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,100

You can scold me after I finish this,

302
00:14:43,010 --> 00:14:43,510
okay?

303

324
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,450
He has something else to do today.

325
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:08,350
I'll act on his behalf.

No, I don't mean that.

331
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:16,740
I meant that Mr. Shen didn't let me know.

332
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,020
I can't make the decision myself.

333
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:18,990
Why don't you ask Mr. Shen

334
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:19,900
to call me?

335
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,710
No need.

Secretary Huang,

337
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,460
Since Mr. Shen agreed to let you trade,

338
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,860
he won't change his mind.

First, sell 5,000 shares

344
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,590
Go.

345
00:16:43,330 --> 00:16:44,570
Yes, Assistant Wei.

346
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,770
How do you feel?

347
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:54,980
Not bad.

348
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:56,520
Go a bit slower.

349
00:16:56,870 --> 00:16:57,730
How about this?

350
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:00,090
A little sore.

351
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,910
Your condition

352
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,600
has basically recovered.

353
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:04,869
Continue to take the medicine

354
00:17:04,869 --> 00:17:06,069

In a few days,

356
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,150
I'll be back for the last check-up.

357
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,280
Okay, thank you.

358
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,069
Please say hello to Director Li for me.

359
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:12,800
Okay.

360
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,660
Remember to take your medicine.

361
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,079
The market is open.

362
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,140
Tunan,

363
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,150
Wei Ruolai is still a child.

364
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,460
How dare you use him to trade?

365
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,750
At his age,

366
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,150
I was already a part-time stock broker

367
00:17:34,150 --> 00:17:35,950
at LSE (London Stock Exchange).

368
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:37,990
You two are different.

369
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,980
When you were 19, you were already writing

370
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,600
economics papers in German.

371
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,710
Right now,

372
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:44,500
I doubt

373
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,060
he's memorized all 26 letters

374
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,460
of the English alphabet.

375
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,010
So, do you think Wei Ruolai

376
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:50,140
is not smart enough?

377
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
I didn't say that.

378
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,500
He is indeed smart.

379
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:56,100
But he's young and inexperienced, after all.

380
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,140
If you let him control the big market now,

381
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,140
I feel that he's missing something.

382
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,940
One is not young if not reckless.

383
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:04,120
We must make every mistake that we should.

384
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,120
Isn't this how we all got through it?

385
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:09,770
You need a limit to your affection.

386
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,940
Then, do you think

387
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:14,560
I'm someone who likes taking risks?

388
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:16,520
You don't look like one,

389
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,060
but you must be.

390
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,660
Assistant Wei.

391
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:30,710
Assistant Wei.

392
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,650
Xingxia's stock price has dropped rapidly.

393
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,710
It's already at 10.6 silver dollars.

394
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,660
Yu is just so-so.

395
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,780
Looks like we have to end the battle early today.

396
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,580
Wei Ruolai,

397
00:19:39,970 --> 00:19:41,340
don't underestimate your enemy.

398
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,460
Yu Shiqing and Zhang Mingquan

399
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,780
are sitting next door.

400
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,160
They haven't fought back yet.

401
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,040
You think they haven't set a trap?

402
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,790
The retraction of tariff management rights

403
00:19:49,790 --> 00:19:51,740
gave a serious blow to the compradors' capital.

404
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:53,600
The foreign merchants and capital have all retreated.

405
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,040
Xingxia will soon have

406
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:56,930
a concentrated risk of defaults.

407
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:59,370
It's not that Yu doesn't want to fight back,

408
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,910
but that he doesn't have the capabilities.

409
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:02,880
Even a starved camel is larger than a horse.

410
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,150
They are not camels

411
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:06,110
and the Central Bank isn't a horse.

412
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:08,020
Today, I'll show him

413
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,620
how he lost Xingxia.

414
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,710
Get the price below 10

415
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,000
and start buying it in.

416
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:13,930
Yes.

417
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,910
Mr. Liu.

418
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,780
Our previous plan was

419
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,580
to reach the target price within a week

420
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,380
to fully consume Yu Shiqing's chips

421
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,700
and buy in at a low price.

422
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,500
Aren't you

423
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,710
being too reckless?

424
00:20:24,710 --> 00:20:25,600
Secretary Huang,

425
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,350
Mr. Shen has entrusted me with full authority.

426
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:28,430
Please trust me.

427
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:30,760
No.

428
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,350
This is such an important decision.

429
00:20:33,350 --> 00:20:34,140
I think we should—

430
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,020
Opportunities vanish in the blink of an eye.

431
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:36,900
You are here to help me.

432
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,580
If anything happens,

433
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,110
I'll take responsibility.

434
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,510
Mr. Liu.

435
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:41,100
Yes.

436
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,020
Continue to make orders.

437
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,580
Yes.

438
00:20:53,970 --> 00:20:55,290
Continue to order.

439
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,410
Throw out all the shares

440
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,420
of you and your friend.

441
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,250
Yes, all of them.

442
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,210
Attack Xingxia.

443
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:01,370
Just listen to me.

444
00:21:21,430 --> 00:21:22,220
Mr. Wei,

445
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,660
Xingxia is now at 9.4,

446
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,590
Start to buy in.

447
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:25,140
Okay.

448
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:27,030
Three hundred shares of Xingxia.

449
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:39,700
Mr. Yu,

450
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,830
Xingxia's stock price is stable.

451
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,700
It's rising.

452
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,040
The little bastard has started to buy?

453
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,010
Are the funds ready?

454
00:21:47,030 --> 00:21:48,960
We're just waiting for your order.

455
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,940
That bastard Wei Ruolai

456
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,520
spent a lot of money

457
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:53,950
to lower the stock price.

458
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,110
We must buy it all in

459
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,470
faster than he can.

460
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,100
Mr. Wei,

461
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,660
shall we continue to buy?

462
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,300
Yes.

463
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,540
Okay, buy 300 shares.

464
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,270
Mr. Wei.

465
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:27,950
shall we continue to buy?

466
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:28,670
Yes. Go on.

467
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,020
Buy 500 shares of Xingxia.

468
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,200
Mr. Wei.

469
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:42,760
How is it?

470
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:43,990
Xingxia's stock price is rebounding.

471
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,330
We didn't buy in that much.

472
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:47,060
Someone must be buying in bulk.

473
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:53,980
Look, it's still rising.

474
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,420
We lowered the stock price,

475
00:22:56,420 --> 00:22:57,540
but they are buying them.

476
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:59,100
They're benefiting off our efforts.

477
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,980
We have to stop.

478
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:01,080
You're in big trouble this time.

479
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,910
I must call Mr. Shen.

480
00:23:01,910 --> 00:23:02,480
Wait!

481
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:05,890
Mr. Liu.

482
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,950
Short-sell everything.

483
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:08,570
Force Xingxia's price down and then buy them up quickly.

484
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:10,030
Wei Ruolai, are you crazy?

485
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:10,780
Go!

486
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:17,200
We'll buy up everything

487
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,540
he sells.

488
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:20,190
After this is done,

489
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:23,010
I'll send Shen Tunan a gift basket

490
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,360
to thank Central Bank for the help.

491
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:28,620
You, 3000.

492
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,270
You, 5000. Force Xingxia's price down.

493
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:30,800
Hurry up.

494
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,480
Hello, is this Mr. Wang?

495
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,320
This is Mr. Liu.

496
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,520
Please transfer 200,000 to my account.

497
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:10,730
Mr. Liu!

498
00:24:14,070 --> 00:24:14,980
Why is the stock price not moving?

499
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,740
I asked you to short-sell everything!

500
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,540
We've been selling them,

501
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,690
but someone keeps buying it.

502
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,910
We can't get it to 9.8.

503
00:24:18,910 --> 00:24:20,380
Whatever is sold is bought up immediately.

504
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,770
Then short-sell everything.

505
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,880
Force the price down.

506
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:23,380
Down!

507
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,020
If we sell any more,

508
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,900
we'll lose more chips.

509
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,180
You'll be the last one out.

510
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:28,700
9.8 is their key point.

511
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:29,350
Trust me.

512
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,180
If we force the price down,

513
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:31,230
we will win.

514
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:31,880
Go.

515
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:32,610
Mr. Wei.

516
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:34,650
We've lost a lot so far.

517
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:36,830
Are you sure you want to continue?

518
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:37,540
In a close fight,

519
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,760
it depends on who perseveres till the end.

520
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,990
I represent Mr. Shen now.

521
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:41,230
Go do it!

522
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:42,360
Take a break.

523
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,230
Mr. Shen.

524
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,420
I'll take over from now on.

525
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:50,310
Sir.

526
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,640
As long as we can get to this point,

527
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,950
we can take down Xingxia.

528
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,880
Wake up, Ruolai.

529
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,670
They're just waiting for you

530
00:24:55,670 --> 00:24:57,270
to walk into the trap they've set.

531
00:24:57,270 --> 00:24:58,520
Don't be spiteful.

532
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,200
Obsession is taboo in the stock market.

533
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:08,650
Let's go meet Yu Shiqing.

534
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:09,780
Yes.

535
00:25:19,170 --> 00:25:20,900
Just wait and see.

536
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,380
Advisor Shen, you're here.

537
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,080
Mr. Yu.

538
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,370
Advisor Shen,

539
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:38,710
you look so pale today.

540
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:41,180
I have a premium ginseng root in my room.

541
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:43,100
You can have it to nourish your energy.

542
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,700
I appreciate your kindness.

543
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,480
Don’t mention it.

544
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:49,660
I'll get it sent to your residence tomorrow morning.

545
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
Come, have a seat.

546
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:52,570
Mr. Shen is in his prime.

547
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:53,960
But Mr. Yu,

548
00:25:54,550 --> 00:25:55,510
at your age,

549
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,440
ginseng is necessary.

550
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,060
Congyun.

551
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,350
How dare you!

552
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:01,840
Advisor Shen.

553
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:04,530
I don't mean to nag,

554
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,740
but it seems you haven't been

555
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:08,350
managing your men well.

556
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:09,780
A secretary and an assistant,

557
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,660
both

558
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,110
so sarcastic.

559
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,510
They're a disgrace to you.

560
00:26:13,510 --> 00:26:15,020
How will you work in the future?

561
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:16,310
Mr. Yu, don't mind them.

562
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:17,950
They know I was wronged.

563
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,220
They just want to stand up for me.

564
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:20,420
Please forgive them.

565
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:22,710
What about you?

566
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,150
What do you think?

567
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,720
I don't like to waste time talking.

568
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:29,340
It's pointless to bicker.

569
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,400
It's better to give a slap in the face.

570
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:32,390
What do you mean?

571
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,250
Haven't you received the call?

572
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:35,050
What call?

573
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:45,700
Hello.

574
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,630
Mr. Yu.

575
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:47,900
Bad news!

576
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:49,870
The Central Bank's Treasury Department raided Xingxia

577
00:26:49,870 --> 00:26:51,180
and confiscated all the official seals.

578
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,310
Our document vaults

579
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,790
have been taken over by force.

580
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:54,330
What?

581
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:03,960
Advisor Shen.

582
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:06,730
Are you trying to make things difficult for me?

583
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,790
It’s not that.

584
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:08,410
Mr. Yu,

585
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:10,530
don't you know what you've done?

586
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:12,980
Xingxia Bank is suspected of financial fraud,

587
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,860
tax evasion,

588
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,580
and smuggling and trafficking goods.

589
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,900
What's worse is

590
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,790
funding Western powers for

591
00:27:18,790 --> 00:27:20,120
espionage activities.

592
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:21,410
I can only

593
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:22,210
describe

594
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:24,190
what you did with this phrase:

595
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
"I'm convinced."

596
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:28,830
In a few days,

597
00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,380
Central Bank will send commissioners

598
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,580
to take over Xingxia.

599
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,180
Mr. Yu,

600
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:35,700
please cooperate with us then.

601
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,060
Shen Tunan, don't go too far.

602
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,250
I have no choice.

603
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,630
To solidify

604
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:43,890
Central Bank's foundation,

605
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,460
we need everyone's help.

606
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:47,140
Fine.

607
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,740
Shen Tunan.

608
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:50,850
You won this time.

609
00:27:51,610 --> 00:27:52,560
I'll make you

610
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,330
pay for it!

611
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,000
Sir.

612
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,060
So you

613
00:28:11,470 --> 00:28:12,790
have a backup plan.

614
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,020
That doesn't change

615
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:18,610
your performance just now.

616
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:22,890
Tell me.

617
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,200
How do you feel?

618
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:29,280
Sorry, Sir.

619
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:31,330
It's my fault today.

620
00:28:31,890 --> 00:28:32,860
I underestimated my opponent.

621
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:33,300
Wrong.

622
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,530
Rather,

623
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,230
you overestimated yourself.

624
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,110
You underestimated your enemy.

625
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:39,900
When you found you were trapped,

626
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,430
you became more aggressive and made it worse.

627
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,220
You're smart

628
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:46,220
and quick-witted.

629
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:47,080
But Wei Ruolai,

630
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,430
you're just a mortal.

631
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,970
You don't have superpowers.

632
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,300
You're not omnipotent.

633
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:54,140
Yes.

634
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,180
Remember,

635
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,880
all talented people

636
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,310
are defeated by pride.

637
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,820
To win, you have make peace with losing.

638
00:29:01,130 --> 00:29:02,520
Never forget,

639
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,630
always act

640
00:29:05,030 --> 00:29:06,290
with extreme caution.

641
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,510
Got it, Sir.

642
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:17,790
Sir.

643
00:29:19,510 --> 00:29:21,330
You must've been investigating Xingxia for a while,

644
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,790
since you've gathered so much information.

645
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,200
Thank Congyun.

646
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:27,900
One day at work,

647
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,870
I suddenly found an extra roll film in my bag.

648
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,890
I developed the photos

649
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:50,870
and they were of a ledger.

650
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,940
It's all evidence of Yu Shiqing's crimes.

651
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:55,090
So I wrote a report to Mr. Shen.

652
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:56,950
At first, we thought

653
00:29:56,950 --> 00:29:58,070
it was a trap.

654
00:29:58,110 --> 00:29:59,330
So it took some time

655
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:00,880
to investigate and verify.

656
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:03,070
After we confirmed it was authentic,

657
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,020
we took action.

658
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:06,960
Did you find out

659
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:08,930
who gave you the roll film?

660
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:10,800
It doesn't matter.

661
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,590
Yu Shiqing has been in Shanghai for many years.

662
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:14,650
I doubt I'm the only enemy he has.

663
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,680
Get in.

664
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:16,480
Okay.

665
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:39,250
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

666
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:36,960
We're here.

667
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:38,750
Thank you.

668
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,900
Is Mr. Xu in?

669
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:45,990
Miss Shen, you're here.

670
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,850
He's upstairs.

671
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:47,650
Thank you.

672
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:02,980
Mr. Xu.

673
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,710
Why are you here?

674
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:08,150
Lunar New Year is coming.

675
00:31:08,310 --> 00:31:09,990
I brought you some rice cakes.

676
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:14,980
You have good news.

677
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,590
Xingxia Bank has been taken down.

678
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,150
Well done.

679
00:31:20,510 --> 00:31:21,910
It's not just my credit,

680
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,660
but ours.

681
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,140
Next,

682
00:31:26,170 --> 00:31:27,750
get Xingxia's clientele information

683
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:28,830
as soon as possible

684
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,590
and sell all our tungsten ores.

685
00:31:30,590 --> 00:31:31,320
Don’t worry.

686
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,670
Excuse me.

687
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:36,860
Now that we've taken Xingxia down,

688
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,740
we have

689
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,730
finally become

690
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,240
the true Central Bank based on our merits.

691
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:43,900
In order to get this far,

692
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,440
Mr. Shen spent three years.

693
00:31:45,710 --> 00:31:47,630
Our batch just made it last minute

694
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,390
and are reaping what we didn't sow.

695
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:50,010
That's still our luck.

696
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:51,790
Lunar New Year is coming.

697
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:53,820
There are tax reforms this year.

698
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,980
We also demolished those imperial banks

699
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,780
like Xingxia

700
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,910
that don't follow orders.

701
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,910
Secretary Huang,

702
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,670
we'll get decent bonuses,

703
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:01,340
right?

704
00:32:01,370 --> 00:32:02,990
-Time flies.
-Sir.

705
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,070
Chief Deng.

706
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:05,750
Another busy year has passed.

707
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:06,680
Sit down.

708
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,340
Take a seat.

709
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,080
Come on.

710
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:09,590
Go to the middle.

711
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,810
Hurry up.

712
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:12,240
Get to your places.

713
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,000
The previous employees

714
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,760
now work for the Treasury Department.

715
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:17,690
They're Central Bank's backbone.

716
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
I think this batch

717
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,030
is promising too.

718
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:21,380
Trust me.

719
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:23,230
They seem decent.

720
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:29,900
Straighten your backs.

721
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,550
In the future,

722
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:33,350
you will be the pillars of our country's

723
00:32:33,350 --> 00:32:34,180
economy.

724
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:35,360
A pillar

725
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:37,190
should look the part.

726
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:38,420
Be vibrant

727
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,960
and high-spirited.

728
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,750
Got it.

729
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:41,310
Louder.

730
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,100
Got it!

731
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:43,640
Let's take photos.

732
00:32:45,550 --> 00:32:46,810
Spruce yourselves up.

733
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,190
Okay, let's take the photos.

734
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:54,210
Okay, look at me.

735
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,110
Look at me.

736
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:57,270
Smile on the count of three.

737
00:32:57,550 --> 00:32:59,430
One, two, three.

738
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,690
All right.

739
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,570
All right, get back to work.

740
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,260
Okay.

741
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,940
Chief Deng.

742
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:09,820
I have something to attend to.

743
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,340
Go in first.

744
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:10,900
Okay.

745
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:11,680
Ruolai.

746
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,830
Come with me.

747
00:33:15,270 --> 00:33:15,750
Okay.

748
00:33:15,970 --> 00:33:17,530
Don't you want to know where?

749
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:18,760
Didn't you say

750
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:20,260
I don't have spare time from now on?

751
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,140
Good.

752
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,060
Congyun.

753
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,780
Help Ruolai carry the chair upstairs.

754
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,290
Let's go.

755
00:33:28,490 --> 00:33:28,960
Get in.

756
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,320
Okay.

757
00:33:41,010 --> 00:33:41,850
Let me try it.

758
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,690
You have to say something auspicious first.

759
00:33:50,970 --> 00:33:52,230
Got it.

760
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,540
200,000 enemy soldiers invaded again,

761
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,660
smoke covering

762
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,160
half the sky.

763
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:02,270
Awaken millions of peasants

764
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,240
to work together.

765
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:05,600
Red flags fluttering under Mount Buzhou.

766
00:34:08,139 --> 00:34:09,290
Wait.

767
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,380
Do you have good news?

768
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,530
Why are you so happy?

769
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:13,389
Take a guess.

770
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:14,780
Guess?

771
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,139
Was the encirclement campaign in Jiangxi a success?

772
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,940
It was a great victory.

773
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,520
Great victory?

774
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,620
They captured Zhang Huizan, the commander-in-chief

775
00:34:22,620 --> 00:34:24,020
of the front line, alive.

776
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,960
This poem was written

777
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,340
to celebrate the victory of encirclement campaigns.

778
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:29,170
Great!

779
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:32,370
By the way, you can take credit

780
00:34:32,949 --> 00:34:33,980
for this win too.

781
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,850
Me?

782
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,179
I didn't do anything.

783
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,320
With the Central Bank budget you gave me,

784
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,900
through the flow of funds,

785
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,760
the number and firepower of the enemy could be estimated.

786
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,710
Careful arrangements were made in advance.

787
00:34:47,710 --> 00:34:49,170
In the battle of Longgang,

788
00:34:49,550 --> 00:34:50,870
over 9,000 people

789
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:52,699
from the 18th Division and two brigades

790
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:54,139
were captured,

791
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:56,020
and nearly 10,000 guns were seized.

792
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:56,980
More than

793
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,710
one million bullets were shot.

794
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:01,110
It's so satisfying.

795
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:03,470
This battle was really hard.

796
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:04,910
Did you receive

797
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:06,570
any follow-up instructions?

798
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:10,820
Have you got the latest information on the arsenal?

799
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:32,090
Welcome.

800
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:32,660
Please come in.

801
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,540
Is Mr. Xu in?

802
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:34,130
Yes.

803
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:35,150
Call him for me.

804
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:37,750
Boss.

805
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:39,880
Mr. Shen is here.

806
00:35:41,060 --> 00:35:41,760
I'll go.

807
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:48,760
Boss, Mr. Shen is downstairs.

808
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:57,390
Mr. Shen!

809
00:35:59,220 --> 00:35:59,860
Mr. Xu.

810
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,130
Welcome.

811
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:01,980
I'm here today

812
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:03,460
with a new customer.

813
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,080
I'm a regular.

814
00:36:05,110 --> 00:36:05,870
Yes.

815
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:07,300
Show me your

816
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:07,980
best skills.

817
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,600
Don't worry.

818
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,900
I'll make the clothes myself for customers you introduce.

819
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,500
Ruolai.

820
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:12,840
Come here.

821
00:36:14,830 --> 00:36:16,780
Look at his great figure.

822
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:17,600
Make him

823
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,500
a few decent suits.

824
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:20,780
What's your name?

825
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,640
I'm Wei Ruolai.

826
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,080
I'm Mr. Shen's assistant.

827
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,310
Okay, let me measure your back.

828
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:25,770
Raise your head and chest.

829
00:36:26,890 --> 00:36:28,260
Every suit is hand sewn

830
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:29,970
with countless stitches.

831
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:31,030
Shoulders' width.

832
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,070
14.

833
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,520
With swift movements.

834
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,060
Fully equipped with four skills.

835
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:36,920
Sleeve length.

836
00:36:37,550 --> 00:36:38,190
Boss.

837
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
Have I seen you before?

838
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:50,090
Many

839
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,600
pass by my store.

840
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,670
It's not unusual

841
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,060
to have seen me.

842
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:54,730
Come on.

843
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:56,820
Wait.

844
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,440
Don't move.

845
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:02,160
You sound very familiar.

846
00:37:18,550 --> 00:37:20,150
Did you also attend

847
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,310
Shen Residence's banquet?

848
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,470
You refused the wine offered by the waiter

849
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:24,740
and ordered a sour plum drink,

850
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:25,620
right?

851
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,730
Yes.

852
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,960
Brilliant memory.

853
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:30,910
That's why he's my assistant.

854
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,640
Great.

855
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:36,760
Here.

856
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:39,660
Different colors.

857
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:40,970
Different textures.

858
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:42,130
Take your pick.

859
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:49,090
This...

860
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,740
Why?

861
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,280
I have enough clothes.

862
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,790
I don't need it.

863
00:37:55,630 --> 00:37:56,230
Come here.

864
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,220
What do you see?

865
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:06,440
A mirror.

866
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:07,170
Wrong.

867
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,470
What I see

868
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:09,810
is a financial

869
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:10,730
rising star.

870
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,110
You may seem green now,

871
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:14,250
but soon,

872
00:38:14,690 --> 00:38:16,350
everyone in Shanghai banking

873
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,410
will be honored to know you.

874
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,760
Do you believe me?

875
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:21,700
Yes.

876
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,040
I believe everything you say.

877
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,560
Clothes make the man.

878
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:26,470
From now on,

879
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,930
from inside to outside,

880
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,250
you must be confident.

881
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:36,660
Mr. Xu

882
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,570
is not an ordinary tailor.

883
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:39,730
He's an artist.

884
00:38:39,970 --> 00:38:41,270
Be honored he's personally

885
00:38:41,270 --> 00:38:42,470
making your clothes.

886
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,540
Like Jinzhen,

887
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:45,050
who looks demure

888
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,850
when she wears his clothes.

889
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:47,810
You flatter me.

890
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:49,330
Miss Shen's

891
00:38:49,590 --> 00:38:52,750
looks, figure, and aura are unmatched.

892
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:55,400
No matter what she wears, she's the focus

893
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,410
in the crowd.

894
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:57,660
Jinzhen isn't here.

895
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,260
Do you really mean that, Mr. Xu?

896
00:38:59,260 --> 00:38:59,860
Look.

897
00:39:01,890 --> 00:39:02,880
I think Miss Shen

898
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,180
is quite pleasant-looking.

899
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,380
She speaks elegantly

900
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,380
and can play the piano.

901
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,370
See?

902
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,860
You just said

903
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,300
pleasant-looking, not beautiful.

904
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,780
That sold you out.

905
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:17,120
Later,

906
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,660
if there's a chance,

907
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:20,370
I'll take you to the arsenal.

908
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:21,330
Go and watch

909
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:23,260
Jinzhen shoot with the Maxim gun.

910
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:25,070
That's who she really is.

911
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,820
Both are good.

912
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:33,880
I want both.

913
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,660
Add one more.

914
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:36,880
Sure.

915
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:40,100
Mr. Xu.

916
00:39:40,620 --> 00:39:41,990
I forgot something.

917
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,960
Add a lining to his right elbow.

918
00:39:44,990 --> 00:39:46,750
He writes with a lot of force.

919
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:47,060
Okay.

920
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:48,980
He wore down the iridium pen tip.

921
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,210
No problem. Don't worry.

922
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:54,290
Come on.

923
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,830
Which shoes do you like?

924
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,720
This one.

925
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:04,790
Why?

926
00:40:05,310 --> 00:40:05,970
Because...

927
00:40:05,970 --> 00:40:07,130
Because it's cheap.

928
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,000
No.

929
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:17,310
These two pairs.

930
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:18,090
Mr. Xu.

931
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:19,940
I want these two.

932
00:40:20,070 --> 00:40:21,690
Use the top layer of cowhide.

933
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,980
You're so knowledgeable.

934
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:26,260
These are my best shoes.

935
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:28,140
Really.

936
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,310
Three pairs.

937
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,060
Mr. Shen.

938
00:40:32,360 --> 00:40:34,200
You're spending a fortune.

939
00:40:39,330 --> 00:40:40,040
Mr. Shen.

940
00:40:40,870 --> 00:40:41,930
I'll round it down.

941
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,170
60 silver dollars.

942
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,100
Put it on my tab.

943
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,020
I'll pay upon collection.

944
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,350
Sure, sure.

945
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:48,910
See you.

946
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:49,410
Okay.

947
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:01,550
Ruolai.

948
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:02,790
Sit here.

949
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:06,800
Come on.

950
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:31,980
Why didn't she eat it?

951
00:41:58,550 --> 00:42:00,380
Central Bank recently allocated

952
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:02,010
13 million to the arsenal.

953
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,850
Orders for guns and bullets produced by the Ordnance Department

954
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:05,690
have doubled.

955
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:07,560
I predict

956
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,500
the 2nd military siege

957
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,470
is not far.

958
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,130
And the military power might double.

959
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:16,020
Here's a list of various weapons.

960
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:34,880
Something bothering you?

961
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:37,340
No, Sir.

962
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,470
Don't worry about money.

963
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:43,070
Don't you get paid tomorrow?

964
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:44,960
Yes.

965
00:42:46,390 --> 00:42:49,390
I get paid 15 silver dollars a month.

966
00:42:51,490 --> 00:42:53,020
So I'm giving you a raise.

967
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:54,830
50 silver dollars per month.

968
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,570
50?
