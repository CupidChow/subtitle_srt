00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,880
[Episode 2]

4
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:43,650
What is this smell?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
Silence!

6
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:50,820
Everyone, be quiet!

7
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,479
Focus on your own exam papers!

8
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,770
What is this smell?

9
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:01,100
Can't you see the heavy smoke over there?

10
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,900
Where is this smoke coming from?

11
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:07,280
None of you can leave before you finish the exam!

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,410
Do not move!

13
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,979
Stay put and take the exam!

14
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:13,510
Fire!

15
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:15,030
Everybody run! It's on fire!

16
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,350
Run!

17
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:17,780
Finish the exam before you go!

18
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,280
Fire!

19
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:19,570
Finish the exam first!

20
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:22,100
You haven't finished your exam papers!

21
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,010
Come back here!

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,550
Come back and finish the exam before you go!

23
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:29,540
The building's on fire.

24
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:30,840
Just forget about the exam and leave!

25
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm working on the last question.

26
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,430
Hurry up! Hurry!

27
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,670
Please be quick!

28
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:52,360
Leave right now or it'll be too late.

29
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,030
Just give me a sec.

30
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:53,829
It's all done!

31
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:55,380
Hurry up!

32
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:08,970
What a bunch of simpletons!

33
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,230
Only one person passed such an easy test!

34
00:03:11,270 --> 00:03:12,150
Tunan,

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,840
many of the exam takers this time

36
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,760
are from influential families.

37
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,420
By making that comment,

38
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:22,220
aren't you afraid of antagonizing the privileged and the powerful?

39
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:23,670
What can they hate me for?

40
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,310
There were seven exits,

41
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:26,110
near each of which

42
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:27,510
I placed a key for the candidates,

43
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,570
along with all sorts of tools in plain sight.

44
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,030
Should they have an ounce of sense,

45
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:32,310
they wouldn't have reduced themselves

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:33,970
to such an awkward situation!

47
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:46,250
You're recruiting bankers,

48
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,829
not members for the marine corps!

49
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,850
Haven't you just mentioned a concept?

50
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,850
Rationality.

51
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:52,190
For those who'll work in finance,

52
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:52,750
it's true

53
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:55,410
that we want them to be poised and tough-minded,

54
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,290
but people with those qualities

55
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:59,220
still aren't good enough to work in the Central Bank.

56
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,860
This time, I created a desperate situation

57
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:01,770
where their lives were at stake.

58
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,690
I was testing

59
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:05,330
their intelligence, courage and willpower,

60
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,460
as well as their abilities to

61
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,660
analyze the environment and make judgments,

62
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,250
plus their reverse thinking skills.

63
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,710
Only one candidate passed it and went through the whole drill.

64
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,290
He performed quite well in

65
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,720
both the written and survival tests.

66
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
He didn't choose the best route,

67
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:06,420
but

68
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,890
at the last critical moment,

69
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:09,550
he managed to help the others.

70
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,260
I've found an exit!

71
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:12,690
Come on! Come with me!

72
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,080
Go!

73
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,260
Go! Hurry up!

74
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:14,730
Go!

75
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:16,130
There's an exit! Just go!

76
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,100
Hurry!

77
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,210
Besides, before the flames spread to the archive room,

78
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,730
he was even able to fight the fire.

79
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,170
Bad news! Bad news!

80
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,370
It's on fire!

81
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:05,130
There are documents in the room!

82
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,500
Can someone help me?

83
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,170
I think he displayed

84
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:31,140
a valuable quality.

85
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,270
Didn't you tell me

86
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,930
the archive room was empty?

87
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,420
But I didn't tell him that!

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,450
He didn't know the archive room was empty.

89
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,450
Plus, there's something interesting

90
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,450
I want to tell you.

91
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,890
The exam supervisor asked him

92
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:43,140
why he did that.

93
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,260
Guess what he said?

94
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:45,780
Didn't you say there were documents

95
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:46,620
inside?

96
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:48,010
If they got burned,

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,230
the Central Bank would suffer huge losses, right?

98
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:51,190
To be frank,

99
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:52,970
he's quite an honest young man.

100
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,530
He is.

101
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,770
Anyway, I've read the answers

102
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,409
on his written exam papers.

103
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:58,170
He has got full marks.

104
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,100
Plus, he finished the last question

105
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,230
when thick smoke was surrounding him.

106
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,360
I think he's very level-headed.

107
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,020
Where does this young man come from?

108
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:09,690
He comes from humble origins and hasn't been to college.

109
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,450
He has only received an 18-month education

110
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:12,770
in Lixin Accounting Institute on accounting and finance.

111
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:13,630
A night school?

112
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,450
How dare you employ such a man?

113
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:17,410
If word gets out to Nanjing, aren't you afraid

114
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,040
of being held to blame?

115
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,150
As I said, the Central Bank hires

116
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:23,280
based on the candidates' abilities instead of their social backgrounds.

117
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:24,530
Congyun.

118
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:25,530
Sir.

119
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,960
Make some arrangements.

120
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,210
About Candidate No. 47,

121
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:31,340
Chief Deng and I would like a private interview with him.

122
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,370
Come in!

123
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:45,050
Sir,

124
00:07:45,350 --> 00:07:46,680
Wei Ruolai has arrived.

125
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,480
Mr. Shen.

126
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,520
Hello.

127
00:07:57,670 --> 00:07:59,390
You don't seem very nervous.

128
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,980
Being nervous

129
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:03,070
isn't exactly helpful, is it?

130
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:09,120
Do you know the functions and duties that the Central Bank serves?

131
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,090
Is it like a mud loach?

132
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,650
What do you mean?

133
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,100
I grew up in the countryside.

134
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,980
Sometimes, to help with the family expenses,

135
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:19,860
I had to catch fish and sell them in the city.

136
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:20,690
During these time-consuming journeys,

137
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:22,140
the fish would die due to a lack of oxygen.

138
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,640
When there were wriggling mud loaches

139
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,890
in the midst,

140
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,310
the fish would be able to live longer.

141
00:08:29,570 --> 00:08:30,940
That's a vivid metaphor,

142
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,470
though not quite accurate.

143
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:34,330
Maybe

144
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,350
it's like a snakehead fish?

145
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,480
Care to explain yourself again?

146
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,570
As long as there is a snakehead fish,

147
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:44,830
it'd eat up all the other fish or shrimps in the same bucket.

148
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,310
Which would you say the Central Bank is,

149
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,380
a mud loach,

150
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:48,540
or a snakehead fish?

151
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,340
In prosperous times,

152
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,610
it should be a mud loach,

153
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:55,400
as it acts as the central macroeconomic regulator and controller,

154
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,380
designing the most reasonable financial policies

155
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,380
to safeguard the national economy.

156
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,260
What about in chaotic times?

157
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,250
In chaotic times, the Central Bank would be a snakehead fish.

158
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,490
It'd first secure its own survival and strength.

159
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:07,550
After all, the private sector wouldn't cover military spending.

160
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,970
The country can't make other plans unless it wins whatever war it is in.

161
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:12,300
Is now a prosperous time or a chaotic time?

162
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:19,900
Mr. Shen,

163
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,950
I'm interviewing for a job as a clerk,

164
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:23,150
not a bank president.

165
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:27,130
Okay.

166
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,610
Introduce yourself then.

167
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,440
My name is Wei Ruolai.

168
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,400
I'm 23 years old.

169
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,460
I graduated from the extension school of Lixin Accounting Institute.

170
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,340
What are you strengths?

171
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,510
I'd say I'm good at calculating.

172
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,680
I also have a good memory.

173
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,520
The fact that you could solve the last exam question

174
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,380
proves that you're great at math.

175
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,930
I'd like to test how good your memory is.

176
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,690
Turn to a random page and spend 5 minutes

177
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,450
reading it carefully.

178
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:50,970
Okay.

179
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:04,540
I'm finished.

180
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:06,360
I said you could have 5 minutes.

181
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,000
I've memorized the content.

182
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,100
You've memorized it?

183
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
Tell me the third line from the left.

184
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,360
"The study of the Chinese language consists of three parts.

185
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,000
First,

186
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:19,000
the structure of each character.

187
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,690
It's about how elements are arranged and combined to form different characters.

188
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:22,370
Second,

189
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:23,180
the meaning of each character.

190
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,700
It's about telling apart the characters' former and current meanings.

191
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,250
Third..."

192
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,190
Have you read this book before?

193
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,010
No, I haven't.

194
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:31,650
You can pick another book for me to memorize.

195
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:38,900
Read this.

196
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:01,730
I'm finished.

197
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:06,480
Tell me the total expenditure in the fourth quarter.

198
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,680
It's...

199
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,300
176,174.25.

200
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,960
Tell me the administrative expenses in July.

201
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,330
7,064.78.

202
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,310
Hold on.

203
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:24,190
The numbers don't really add up, do they?

204
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:25,030
How so?

205
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,590
The petrol prices from January to June were quite consistent,

206
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:29,310
showing little change.

207
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:31,830
Even in July, the prices didn't vary much.

208
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:32,950
I remember the petrol prices in July

209
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,220
seemed to have dropped once.

210
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,910
If the total distance that the cars traveled was the same,

211
00:11:35,910 --> 00:11:38,770
then it would contradict the petrol prices in July.

212
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:41,970
Couldn't the cars

213
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:42,990
have been through long journeys,

214
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,990
or given more rides to guests?

215
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,470
If the cars had been through long journeys,

216
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:49,030
there would've been a bigger expenditure on toll fees,

217
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,450
but the charts reflect no such thing.

218
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,750
If the cars had been driven more often for guests,

219
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,630
there would've been an increased cost resulted from entertaining guests,

220
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:55,190
but the charts reflect no such thing either.

221
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,870
Was the money the bank spent on petrol in July

222
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,190
embezzled by someone?

223
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:03,910
Did you really receive all your education in just a night school?

224
00:12:03,910 --> 00:12:04,260
Yes.

225
00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:08,570
What do you expect of your salary?

226
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:09,590
The more, the better.

227
00:12:09,590 --> 00:12:11,650
You need to give us a specific figure.

228
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,380
My dad's living in our hometown.

229
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,650
I'm alone in Shanghai.

230
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:16,510
All I need to do is provide for myself.

231
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:18,060
If I can make a high enough salary here,

232
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,660
I'll quit one of my part-time jobs.

233
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,950
If I can't,

234
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,670
I'll continue to be a typesetter,

235
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,230
or earn some money by writing articles and stuff.

236
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:25,360
Anyway, I'll get by.

237
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:27,400
The late league leader

238
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,310
once said to the freshmen of the Huangpu Military Academy,

239
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:32,150
"Those who seek wealth and fame

240
00:12:32,710 --> 00:12:35,080
or fear death should leave."

241
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,920
"This place is for revolutionists only."

242
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,470
To join the Central Bank,

243
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:42,800
it takes determination and courage.

244
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,870
Do you have those?

245
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:44,400
Yes, I do.

246
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,310
Our country has been weak and poor for decades.

247
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,150
Mr. Liang Qichao once said,

248
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,510
“Today's responsibility is resting on no one,

249
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:49,910
but our nation's youths.

250
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,950
The future of the nation depends on

251
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,590
young people's intelligence and strength."

252
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:54,100
Banks give life to all kinds of industries.

253
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:56,150
The Central Bank is the most important among all the banks.

254
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,470
It is the backbone of finance.

255
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:59,550
I'll make my contribution to the country with all I've learned.

256
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,390
Well said.

257
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,910
But it's a bit vague.

258
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,370
Say something practical.

259
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:08,300
I want to make more money,

260
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,110
and help my family settle down in Shanghai.

261
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,580
If that's really what you're thinking,

262
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,740
I'm afraid you'll also embezzle the petrol money.

263
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,870
That won't be necessary.

264
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,470
The Central Bank has advantages when it comes to policies.

265
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,820
I can make investments.

266
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:23,390
If employees aren't allowed to do so,

267
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:24,550
I can write comments about the stock market

268
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:25,340
to make some money.

269
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:25,890
No.

270
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:29,990
The Central Bank strictly prohibits its staff from using their jobs for personal gains.

271
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,750
Can I take on two clerks' workloads

272
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:32,710
to earn extra bonuses?

273
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:33,380
No.

274
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,550
There is no such precedent.

275
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,030
If benefits matter more to you,

276
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:39,100
I can write you a recommendation letter

277
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,550
to let you work in the Bank of Communications.

278
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,280
It offers better salaries than the Central Bank.

279
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:44,380
Forget it.

280
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,190
I won't trade a potential career here

281
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,390
for some modest profits there.

282
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:49,150
I assure you that if I'm hired,

283
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,480
I will do my very best to fulfill my duties.

284
00:13:54,190 --> 00:13:54,790
Come in!

285
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:56,790
Sir.

286
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,100
There's something wrong with Wei Ruolai's background.

287
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,880
Where are you originally from?

288
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,460
I'm from Ji'an, Jiangxi.

289
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,470
Ji'an?

290
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:25,350
That place is harboring many active communists.

291
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:28,380
The Communist Party is thriving there.

292
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,550
You have

293
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,150
an elder brother, right?

294
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,220
Yes.

295
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,190
He left home three years ago.

296
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,230
Three years ago?

297
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,030
That's right.

298
00:14:39,090 --> 00:14:41,510
It was the 16th year since the Republic of China was established.

299
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,150
That's when our party had a thorough purge.

300
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:43,780
Sir,

301
00:14:44,590 --> 00:14:46,710
I have nothing to do with the Communist Party.

302
00:14:46,710 --> 00:14:47,710
Consultant Shen,

303
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,350
never hiring someone we find suspicious

304
00:14:49,350 --> 00:14:51,900
has always been our principle when we recruit staff for the Central Bank.

305
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:56,500
The Department of Government Ethics takes responsibility for matters like this.

306
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,360
The Central Bank

307
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:11,510
is entrusted with the important task of reviving the national economy.

308
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,750
Any factors that might cause a leak of confidential information

309
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,010
must be eliminated as early as possible.

310
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:16,850
Wei Ruolai,

311
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:20,630
I'm sorry.

312
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,310
Congyun,

313
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,400
show him out.

314
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:25,710
Please.

315
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:34,360
Sorry

316
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,190
for taking your time.

317
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,680
We've finally met a genuine person

318
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,190
with competence and integrity.

319
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,480
What a shame that we can't hire him!

320
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,710
He still lacks one thing.

321
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,430
What is it?

322
00:16:04,990 --> 00:16:07,190
The indomitable will to pursue his goal.

323
00:16:07,190 --> 00:16:10,000
When I said I could write him a recommendation letter,

324
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,790
he was swayed.

325
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:12,070
His eyes gave it away.

326
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,780
Those who choose their own safety over a greater cause,

327
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,150
but meanwhile risk their lives for small gains

328
00:16:15,150 --> 00:16:16,150
can't be heroes.

329
00:16:21,030 --> 00:16:22,510
As a man raised in a poor family,

330
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:25,440
he prioritizes his own survival over anything else.

331
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:26,440
We

332
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,490
shouldn't be asking too much.

333
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,490
So, Chief Deng,

334
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:30,550
we've gotta work harder.

335
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:31,940
Let's hope there won't be

336
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:34,400
poor families anymore by the time we retire.

337
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,980
A bowl of wontons and two steamed buns!

338
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:11,940
Wei is back!

339
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:15,560
Wei!

340
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:16,900
Wei!

341
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:18,560
You're back!

342
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:20,120
You must be starving, aren't you?

343
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:20,850
Come on!

344
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,240
Sit down and eat something.

345
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,460
Get me one more bowl of wontons!

346
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,030
Okay!

347
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,150
Freshly cooked wontons.

348
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:31,950
They're still hot.

349
00:18:31,950 --> 00:18:32,680
There you go.

350
00:18:34,790 --> 00:18:36,050
You want a steamed bun?

351
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:42,610
How was the interview?

352
00:18:42,710 --> 00:18:43,570
Did you pass it?

353
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,380
It's fine.

354
00:18:53,030 --> 00:18:55,070
There's nothing good about that place.

355
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,870
The employees are stuck in that building all day long,

356
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,330
as if they're in an ant nest

357
00:18:58,950 --> 00:18:59,880
The Central Bank

358
00:19:00,070 --> 00:19:01,400
is the best of all banks.

359
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,030
There's no place better than that.

360
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:10,220
You awful old man!

361
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,920
Don't be a cheapskate!

362
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:13,460
You've agreed to pay the rent today.

363
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,690
Are you going back on your word again?

364
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:15,890
Stop messing with me.

365
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:17,630
Ruolai,

366
00:19:19,150 --> 00:19:20,910
did you pass that interview?

367
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:25,470
How did you fail it?

368
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:28,500
Did you ask them why they wouldn't hire you?

369
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,950
What reason could there be?

370
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:32,280
Others had strings to pull, but he didn't.

371
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,950
The Central Bank

372
00:19:34,190 --> 00:19:35,460

00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:03,790
Your invitation?

557
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,030
I'm Mr. Chen Zhe's assistant.

558
00:30:06,030 --> 00:30:07,100
Mr. Chen

559
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:07,900
has asthma,

560
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,750
but he's forgotten to take his medicine with him.

561
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,080
I need to bring it to him.

562
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:10,790
Sorry.

563
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,470
Without an invitation,

564
00:30:12,550 --> 00:30:13,610
you won't be let in.

565
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,590
Mr. Chen is a secretary in the Treasury Department.

566
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,660
If anything happens to him,

567
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:20,060
are you sure you can bear the consequences?

568
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:22,390
Bring me the guest list!

569
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,440
Just a second.

570
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,380
[Guest List]

571
00:30:33,830 --> 00:30:34,450
You may enter now.

572
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:36,710
Get your job done and come out right away.

573
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:13,460
Almost all the guests have arrived.

574
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,720
Then I'll go upstairs.

575
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,230
Keep yourself safe.

576
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:16,910
I got it.

577
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:19,990
Mr. Kang.

578
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,890
Do you think wearing a suit

579
00:31:21,910 --> 00:31:23,890
has turned you into a decent man now?

580
00:31:23,890 --> 00:31:25,470
How's the preparation work going?

581
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:26,470
It's all set.

582
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,420
Mr. Kang.

583
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:32,330
I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you later.

584
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:33,120
No worries.

585
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,370
Distinguished guests,

586
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:51,510
today is Christmas.

587
00:31:51,890 --> 00:31:52,660
Thank you

588
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,390
for taking your time to gather in my humble abode.

589
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,990
It's such an honor for me.

590
00:31:56,630 --> 00:31:58,760
But before the cocktail party starts,

591
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:00,710
I have an important piece of news

592
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:02,110
to tell you.

593
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:03,880
The Central Bank

594
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,010
has planned for a clean-up.

595
00:32:08,170 --> 00:32:11,100
To reach financial stability, there are two things to do.

596
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:11,790
First,

597
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:13,830
we need to stabilize domestic prices.

598
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:16,270
Second, we need to stabilize the exchange rate of our currency.

599
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,830
By establishing the Administration of Foreign Exchange,

600
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:20,670
the Central Bank aims to stabilize the exchange rate.

601
00:32:20,670 --> 00:32:23,510
However, our deputy director Mr. Gao Feng,

602
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,950
since he took his post in the administration 15 months ago,

603
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:29,750
has spread fake news four times,

604
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:32,390
and interfered with the Central Bank's policies on gold reserves.

605
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,990
He has also laid an ambush in the Shanghai Gold Exchange,

606
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,550
and used fictitious transactions to earn

607
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,520
as much as 280,000 silver dollars.

608
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,670
The fluctuation of exchange rates

609
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:45,260
has cost the government a loss of several million

610
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,790
in the balance of payments.

611
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:48,830
Shen Tunan,

612
00:32:49,150 --> 00:32:50,730
you're making false accusations!

613
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,260
Mr. Kang.

614
00:32:53,170 --> 00:32:54,230
What are you doing?

615
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,550
You're accusing me of severe crimes in front of so many people.

616
00:32:59,550 --> 00:33:00,750
Do you have any proof?

617
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:01,590
Proof?

618
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:03,800
I sure have some.

619
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,100
This is the record of your activities.

620
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,810
Here is your signature.

621
00:33:09,350 --> 00:33:11,940
Do you want me to read the content in front of everyone?

622
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,550
Read it!

623
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,630
Shut up.

624
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:15,520
Stop humiliating yourself here.

625
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,240
You can't just take me away!

626
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:19,860
I'm the deputy director of the Central Bank's Administration of Foreign Exchange!

627
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,550
I'm working for Mr. Kong!

628
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,410
Everyone, sorry for the interruption.

629
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:26,250
Now I officially announce

630
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:28,940
that the Christmas party has begun!

631
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:29,920
Great!

632
00:33:29,950 --> 00:33:30,750
Music!

633
00:33:30,990 --> 00:33:31,590
Thank you.

634
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,070
You see,

635
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:40,190
a big fish has just eaten a small fish.

636
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,550
They're laying down the groundwork

637
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:43,880
for the Central Bank's future expansion.

638
00:33:51,590 --> 00:33:52,460
Auntie,

639
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:55,390
why is your dress prettier than mine?

640
00:33:55,670 --> 00:33:57,700
Is it pretty? I'll let you wear it then.

641
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,180
Great! I wanna wear it now!

642
00:33:59,210 --> 00:34:00,330
I wanna wear it now!

643
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:01,750
Yu, stop horsing around.

644
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,390
Isn't this dress too flamboyant?

645
00:34:04,390 --> 00:34:06,390
It feels like I'm putting on a stage play.

646
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:07,470
It isn't flamboyant at all, is it?

647
00:34:07,470 --> 00:34:09,070
This dress is beautiful.

648
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,550
Plus, today this is a formal occasion.

649
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:13,270
Just do your older brother a favor,

650
00:34:13,270 --> 00:34:14,469
and be a lady for once.

651
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,530
Can I not attend the party?

652
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,500
Those people

653
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:20,260
are all foppish heavy drinkers.

654
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:22,070
I'm already annoyed when I think of them.

655
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,150
It won't take you too much time.

656
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,790
Just try to blend in and patronize them.

657
00:34:24,790 --> 00:34:27,080
Hurry up.

658
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,719
I wanna go too! I wanna go too!

659
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,030
Come here, you.

660
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:32,070
I'll buy you a gramophone, alright?

661
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:33,020
Come on.

662
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:33,750
Fine.

663
00:34:34,790 --> 00:34:35,320
Let's go.

664
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:50,300
Ladies and gentlemen,

665
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,380
a mysterious guest

666
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,190
will play

667
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:54,719
a lovely piano piece for us.

668
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:56,620
Let's welcome her to the stage!

669
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:19,270
I heard she had a personal concert in Berlin.

670
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:20,710
There was a full audience.

671
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,040
Look how dashing she is!

672
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,960
What are you looking at?

673
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,420
Mr. Kang.

674
00:36:19,750 --> 00:36:21,280
It's no use looking at that.

675
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:22,670
Where is Gao Feng?

676
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:23,460
Don't worry, Mr. Kang.

677
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,440
He's been taken away under escort.

678
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,000
Then why are you still here?

679
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,190
Shouldn't I stay here

680
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,950
in case you have an order for me?

681
00:36:29,590 --> 00:36:30,710
Is that so,

682
00:36:30,710 --> 00:36:34,110
or are you planning to make acquaintance with some big shots?

683
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:36,030
Stop humiliating yourself here.

684
00:36:36,030 --> 00:36:36,630
Get lost.

685
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:40,790
Yes.

686
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,620
Why did you come out?

687
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,550
What a bunch of snobs!

688
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:12,500
We've gotta work extra hard

689
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,270
to kill all the communists in Shanghai,

690
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,080
and return to Nanjing!

691
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:41,780
Merry Christmas!

692
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:43,060
Merry Christmas!

693
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,500
Have fun!

694
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:05,950
Mr. Xu, Merry Christmas.

695
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,340
Merry Christmas.

696
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:11,390
Does the dress fit?

697
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:13,600
The waist isn't exactly fitting.

698
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,640
Sorry for that.

699
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:16,400
I was on a tight schedule today.

700
00:38:16,470 --> 00:38:18,350
You should stop by my shop someday,

701
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,680
so I can alter it for you.

702
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,740
Okay. Thank you.

703
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,510
You're welcome. It's my pleasure.

704
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,390
Enjoy the party!

705
00:38:24,390 --> 00:38:25,500
Sure. You too!

706
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:27,550
Miss Shen!

707
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:28,310
Miss Shen.

708
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:29,950
Your piano performance was wonderful!

709
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,550
Thank you. Merry Christmas.

710
00:38:31,910 --> 00:38:33,510
Let's have dinner sometime!

711
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,900
It's me!

712
00:38:41,130 --> 00:38:42,190
Do you remember me?

713
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:43,470
We shared a rickshaw.

714
00:38:46,270 --> 00:38:47,030
It's you?

715
00:38:47,710 --> 00:38:48,270
Yes.

716
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,350
What a surprise

717
00:38:51,390 --> 00:38:52,990
that you're actually a musician!

718
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:54,520
You played so well just now.

719
00:38:54,910 --> 00:38:55,790
I heard them say

720
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,270
that you had held a concert in Berlin.

721
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,060
Is it true?

722
00:39:00,150 --> 00:39:01,750
You're quite well informed.

723
00:39:02,230 --> 00:39:03,830
I hear things through the grapevine.

724
00:39:03,830 --> 00:39:05,660
Are you charging for your performance today

725
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:07,480
by the number of songs or by hour?

726
00:39:08,830 --> 00:39:10,020
Let's not talk about me.

727
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,350
What are you doing here?

728
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm looking for someone.

729
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,550
Who is it?

730
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:15,920
Shen Tunan.

731
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:18,050
Are you familiar with him?

732
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,680
I've had dinner with him.

733
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,110
Why are you looking for him?

734
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,990
Didn't you say you owed me a favor last time?

735
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:24,390
You can repay it now.

736
00:39:24,390 --> 00:39:26,520
May I trouble you to give him a message?

737
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:28,910
In return, you must promise me

738
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,780
that you'll keep what happened last time

739
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,340
secret.

740
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:32,210
No problem.

741
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:35,070
Our focus should be on industry.

742
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:36,780
Tunan,

743
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,260
[A patriotic banker
Jiang Jinglan]

744
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,950
the government has designed policies

745
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:40,870
to support light industry.

746
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,060
Why are the banks' interest rates

747
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:46,150
are still so high?

748
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:49,630
The problem lies in the private banks.

749
00:39:49,990 --> 00:39:51,160
These private banks

750
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:53,350
are so proud of their wealth and social backgrounds

751
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:54,310
that sometimes they'd even

752
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,990
disrespect the government and the Central Bank.

753
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,460
It's time to change all that.

754
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,460
It is high time we shook them up a bit.

755
00:40:01,590 --> 00:40:02,130
Come in!

756
00:40:03,190 --> 00:40:03,670
Sir.

757
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,190
Uncle Jiang, Merry Christmas!

758
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,000
You look so beautiful today.

759
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:11,520
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

760
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:14,270
Can I steal my brother for a second?

761
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,510
Sure thing.

762
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,120
Thank you, Uncle Jiang.

763
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:18,630
I'm talking about real business with Mr. Jiang.

764
00:40:18,630 --> 00:40:20,430
I have Uncle Jiang's agreement.

765
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,830
Excuse us, Mr. Jiang.

766
00:40:22,590 --> 00:40:23,550
What are you doing?

767
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:24,750
Someone asked me to tell you

768
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,810
that he had solved a riddle about you.

769
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,830
What riddle?

770
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,150
Kunpeng Industries.

771
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,240
Where is he?

772
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:55,290
You'll have five minutes to state your opinion.

773
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,070
Mr. Shen,

774
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,660
you're planning to spend a month

775
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,080
using 15 transaction accounts

776
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,940
associated with Kunpeng Industries

777
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:04,380
to attack the Imperial Bank of China,

778
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:05,030
Huaxin Bank,

779
00:41:05,030 --> 00:41:05,830
Xingxia Bank,

780
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:07,750
and Dongsheng Bank,

781
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:11,310
until they fall into the clutches of the Central Bank.

782
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,360
The Imperial Bank of China

783
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,690
is just your first prey.

784
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:17,070
Go on.

785
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,550
The Central Bank was founded not long ago, with not much capital.

786
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:20,950
When Chairman Chiang had a meeting with you,

787
00:41:20,950 --> 00:41:22,590
he said he hoped that in three years,

788
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,830
the Central Bank could become as rich in funding as

789
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,950
the major traditional banks like the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China.

790
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,810
So, next, according to your plan,

791
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,390
you'll gradually take over those four private banks.

792
00:41:33,670 --> 00:41:34,270
When that comes true,

793
00:41:34,270 --> 00:41:35,830
the Central Bank will be strong enough in funding

794
00:41:35,830 --> 00:41:37,560
to support a financial reform.

795
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,280
Who told you that?

796
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:44,850
I deduced it myself.

797
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:56,630
The organization has decided to eliminate a crooked man named Gu Lun instantly.

798
00:41:56,630 --> 00:41:58,760
He’s in Room 503 of Astor House Hotel.

799
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:12,600
Quit lying to me!

800
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:14,460
Mr. Shen,

801
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:16,510
I did figure it out by myself.

802
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:17,910
As you know, as long as transactions happen,

803
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,230
there'll be traces left.

804
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:20,990
With the help of the information I got earlier,

805
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,270
it wouldn't be hard to make these deductions.

806
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:23,070
I still contend

807
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,380
what you said is impossible.

808
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,390
In the exchange, there are hundreds of listed companies,

809
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:28,070
and loads of information about transactions.

810
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:29,270
Everything may change at any time.

811
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,590
Individuals can hardly keep track of every activity.

812
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,590
When there are covert and simultaneous changes in numerous accounts,

813
00:42:32,590 --> 00:42:33,700
it would be impossible for anyone

814
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,700
to discover the secrets within.

815
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:35,470
How did you reach your findings?

816
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,150
Mr. Shen,

817
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,030
you've read my resume.

818
00:42:37,030 --> 00:42:38,990
Would you say the resources I have and my social background

819
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:41,390
could give me access to the Central Bank's classified information?

820
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,550
All my conclusions are based

821
00:42:42,550 --> 00:42:43,270
on my own analysis.

822
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:44,400
That's impossible!

823
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,910
You're suspected of stealing government secrets.

824
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,920
Are you gonna turn yourself in to the Investigation and Arrest Unit,

825
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,030
or do you want me to escort you out?
