[Episode 23]

4
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,120
Inform the bank

5
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,550
and send people to gather evidence.

6
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:35,140
Yes.

7
00:01:58,530 --> 00:01:59,229
Wenbiao.

8
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,740
Sir.

9
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,880
Have the men keep an eye on Wei Ruolai.

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,740
Report to me if anything happens.

11
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,310
Just do it.

12
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,530
One silver dollar,

13
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,960
26.7 grams.

14
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:05,810
Three thousand coins produced daily,

15
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,140
a quarter of leftover scraps is consumed.

16
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:14,270
the crucible is used 24 hours a day,

17
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:15,710
two stoves a day...

18
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:16,870
Time to eat.

19
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,270
It doesn't match up.

20
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,140
What do you mean?

21
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,390
What?

22
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:37,930
If not for the fact that you're working,

23
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,730
I'd slap you right now.

24
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:42,020
The crucible doesn't match up.

25
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,210
Where are you going?

26
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,620
It's so late.

27
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,000
Wear heavier clothing.

28
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,590
Okay.

29
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:53,910
What's he talking about?

30
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,510
Sir, it's me, Ruolai.

31
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:11,970
I made a discovery.

32
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,080
The crucibles we seized today

33
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,850
only have a capacity of 50 kilograms.

34
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,480
Even if they work nonstop all day,

35
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,269
they can't reach the production volume

36
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:18,529
of 3,000 coins per day.

37
00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:19,760
So what we seized today

38
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,240
may be a fake crime scene.

39
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:22,990
Okay, I got it.

40
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,950
From tomorrow onwards,

41
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,310
turn three shifts into one.

42
00:05:40,310 --> 00:05:42,020
Sleep in the day and work at night.

43
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:44,620
No one is allowed to go out without permission.

44
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:46,480
There must be guards 24 hours a day.

45
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,100
Captain Lin,

46
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,330
we can't guarantee production if there's only one shift.

47
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,750
If Mr. Kang blames us—

48
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:52,300
I'll take responsibility.

49
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,600
You're only responsible for production,

50
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,330
understand?

51
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:55,990
Yes.

52
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:57,330
What is this?

53
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,430
What's going on?

54
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:02,270
This guy hid money.

55
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:02,930
Kneel down.

56
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,010
Director, it was a mistake.

57
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:07,160
My daughter is sick.

58
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,740
Rules are rules.

59
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,340
From now on,

60
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,140
anyone else who pulls dirty tricks

61
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:18,770
will end up like him.

62
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:20,950
Get to work.

63
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,280
Sir.

64
00:06:29,860 --> 00:06:30,560
What's wrong?

65
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,090
The man watching Wei Ruolai

66
00:06:32,890 --> 00:06:35,290
said that he saw through our fake workshop.

67
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,320
How?

68
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,130
We set up the equipment according to the list

69
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,060
given by Mr. Zhu,

70
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,520
but due to the limited time,

71
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,830
the crucible quantity didn't match the production volume.

72
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,140
This was the only flaw.

73
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:47,830
My list was fine.

74
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,100
This was your own problem.

75
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,810
Shut up!

76
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:52,990
Yes.

77
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:55,960
Biao,

78
00:06:57,110 --> 00:06:58,570
go and watch him yourself.

79
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,850
No matter what, don't let him know

80
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,370
that this place exists.

81
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,770
Got it.

82
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:10,090
Are you stupid?

83
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,190
How could you mess this up?

84
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:17,310
Speak up!

85
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,670
Mr. Kang,

86
00:07:19,260 --> 00:07:21,110
you can punish me however you want

87
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,570
after this matter is over,

88
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,880
but can you ask the workers to retreat first?

89
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,960
Retreating now is like

90
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,020
running up against Shen Tunan's gun.

91
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,190
We can't retreat.

92
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,450
Defend it to the death.

93
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,300
I'm afraid they'll break in.

94
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm afraid they won't break in.

95
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,050
You want...

96
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,110
Anyone who gets within 100 yards of the factory

97
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:44,190
must be killed.

98
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,659
Then Shen Tunan...

99
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,159
Shen Tunan?

100
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,720
He's corrupted.

101
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,280
He's the one who made the counterfeit coins.

102
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,680
We're just doing our job.

103
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,990
Guns are blind.

104
00:07:54,230 --> 00:07:55,490
It's just an accident.

105
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,420
How can we explain to Mr. Song?

106
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,330
The situation can't be reversed.

107
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:02,060
So what if we explain or not?

108
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,900
Big Sister will take care of any issues.

109
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,060
It won't affect us.

110
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:27,670
Looks like the police and Garrison Command

111
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,980
are already in collusion with each other.

112
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,440
Then we'll do what you said

113
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,409
and do a blanket search in Zhabei.

114
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,620
We can definitely find it.

115
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,679
Theoretically, yes,

116
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,000
but it's too late.

117
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,880
They may destroy the evidence anytime.

118
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,390
We can only play along.

119
00:08:40,659 --> 00:08:41,590
What do you mean?

120
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,080
The last digits are 665.

121
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:46,670
The car's been following us since Dongfang Bookstore.

122
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,660
Should we get rid of them?

123
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:54,000
No, let them follow.

124
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,510
Stop.

125
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,360
Just keep an eye on Shen Tunan and Wei Ruolai.

126
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,820
Don't worry about others.

127
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,750
Rickshaw.

128
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,820
Where are you headed, sirs?

129
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:32,930
Qibao Street.

130
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,960
Follow him.

131
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,690
Drive faster.

132
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:19,820
Turn in.

133
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,070
The wolf has a winning game when the shepherds quarrel.

134
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:54,350
Now it's up to Congyun.

135
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:04,470
Didn't I give you a raise?

136
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:06,300
Why do you still live here?

137
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,950
It's such a shabby room.

138
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,860
No girl will like you.

139
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,770
I don't have time to think about that now.

140
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,510
It's easier to take care of myself alone.

141
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,830
Work is important, but family is also important.

142
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,190
As people say,

143
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,270
start a family and a career.

144
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,330
You should get married first

145
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:23,310
and then start your career after stabilizing your life.

146
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,690
Sufficient preparations make the work go faster,

147
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:25,490
understand?

148
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:26,020
Yes.

149
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,820
Sir, have a seat.

150
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,110
Let me get you some tea.

151
00:11:45,290 --> 00:11:46,090
Mr. Shen,

152
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
this is my friend.

153
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,060
She came from our hometown to seek refuge with me.

154
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:50,660
This is Mr. Shen, my teacher.

155
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:52,960
Hello, Mr. Shen.

156
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,560
Hello.

157
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:54,920
My name is Niu Chunmiao.

158
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,150
I know you.

159
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:58,500
You are Miss Shen's brother, right?

160
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,280
You know Jinzhen?

161
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:02,390
She came over a few days ago.

162
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,450
We talked until it was very late.

163
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:06,010
I've already heard of you.

164
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,730
You're an important figure

165
00:12:07,750 --> 00:12:09,560
in Shanghai.

166
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,730
Jinzhen was just bragging.

167
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,360
No need.

168
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,590
Sit down and talk.

169
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,550
Doggie, pour him water.

170
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,020
No,

171
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,070
I heard it from Doggie's father.

172
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,520
He said your living room

173
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,670
is bigger than the ancestral hall in our village.

174
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,940
Your kitchen stove catches fire as soon as it's turned on.

175
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,740
There's no need to add firewood.

176
00:12:26,870 --> 00:12:27,670
Come.

177
00:12:28,230 --> 00:12:29,080
Mr. Shen,

178
00:12:29,190 --> 00:12:30,100
these are

179
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,270
honey ginger slices from our hometown.

180
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:33,350
Have a taste.

181
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:39,240
Help yourself.

182
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:49,940
It's good.

183
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,590
You like it?

184
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,580
There's a bit missing.

185
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,620
Take them back

186
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,860
and give Miss Shen some too.

187
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,230
I'll make more later.

188
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:57,990
You must

189
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,510
discipline Doggie well.

190
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:02,390
Your name is Doggie?

191
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,710
Yes.

192
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,040
Is it Jiangxi slang?

193
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,940
Yes.

194
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,740
In our hometown,

195
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,700
all the boys are called "guzai."

196
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:11,410
Kids are easier to raise with a lowly name.

197
00:13:11,410 --> 00:13:12,290
Doggie,

198
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,020
Cow,

199
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:15,150
Urine, Skinny Dog, and many more.

200
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,950
Then, I should change

201
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,510
and call you Doggie too.

202
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,640
I hope you can live a long life

203
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:23,150
and be safe and happy.

204
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,780
Thank you, Mr. Shen.

205
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,180
You're welcome, Doggie.

206
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,880
Just call him that. Doggie.

207
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,020
Doggie.

208
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
Do you want to die?

209
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,650
If you want to sleep, I'll give you a bullet

210
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,110
and you can sleep forever.

211
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,030
Forget it.

212
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,760
There should be nothing to do today.

213
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:09,850
Let's go eat.

214
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,590
Thank you, Biao.

215
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,730
You're the best.

216
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:15,960
Retreat.

217
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:36,610
The noodles are ready. Eat up.

218

219

It looks good.

220

Thank you.

221
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,330
You've worked hard, Miss Niu.

222
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,990
I'm not a miss.

223
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:53,630

224
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,520
Okay, I'll call you Chunmiao.

225

226
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,550
his childhood stories.

227
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,180
Him?

228
00:15:02,230 --> 00:15:03,520
Why are you so nervous?

229
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,280
How many bad things did you do when you were young?

230
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:05,760
I didn't.

231
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,630
He didn't.

232
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,310
Doggie was just a little timid.

233
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,070
He didn't even dare to climb trees.

234
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,540
Every time he wanted to eat fruits,

235
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:13,880
he'd call me "big sister"

236
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,390
and ask me to pick it for him.

237
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:17,150
You were smart when you were young.

238
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,440
He was when he was a kid,

239
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:19,860
but not anymore.

240
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:21,270
He's too reckless.

241
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,270
Why do you say he's reckless now?

242
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,910
He even got into an accident with a car.

243
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,860
He almost died.

244
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,090
What a loss!

245
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:30,690
-Stop talking.
-How much do you make?

246
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,800
It was the Central Bank's business.

247
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,390
What?

248
00:15:32,910 --> 00:15:33,510
Chunmiao.

249
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,640
It was indeed my fault.

250
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:38,670
I was too careless

251
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,560
and failed to protect Doggie.

252
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,790
Sir, it's not your fault.

253
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,210
You're just an assistant.

254
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,970
You're not a cop nor a soldier.

255
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,790
Why take such a risk?

256
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:50,490
-Am I right, Mr. Shen?
-Niu Chunmiao, stop it.

257
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:55,020
She's right.

258
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:57,230
As someone working in finance,

259
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,650
we really don't have to

260
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,350
and shouldn't risk our lives.

261
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:02,340
But we have no choice.

262
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,210
Unfortunately,

263
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,290
we live in a very turbulent era.

264
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:07,430
In order to give our descendants

265
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:09,090
a peaceful and prosperous country,

266
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:10,970
we must be united

267
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,200
and work fearlessly.

268
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,920
So you're from the Red Army?

269
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:17,720
Niu Chunmiao.

270
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,180
Nice to meet you.

271
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,900
Niu Chunmiao, sit down.

272
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,320
Mr. Shen is from the Kuomintang.

273
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,160
Sorry, I misspoke.

274
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:36,980
It's okay.

275
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:44,250
Chunmiao,

276
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,340
why did you think I'm from the Red Army?

277
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,300
I've heard the Red Army

278
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,490
say the things you've said before.

279
00:16:55,050 --> 00:16:56,730
United and work together.

Something something heavy.

281
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,970
At that time, my mom

282
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:01,520
started crying when she heard them.

283
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,400
She really wanted me to join them.

284
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:05,869
Sorry, sir.

285
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:08,170
Niu Chunmiao is a kid. She...

286
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:09,869
Talks without a filter.

287
00:17:09,869 --> 00:17:10,920
It's okay.

288
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,670
Actually, I also want to know

289
00:17:14,069 --> 00:17:15,200
what she has to say.

290
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,160
I want to know

291

what the lower class in Jiangxi

292

think of the Red Army.

293
00:17:23,390 --> 00:17:24,150
They are

all bandits.

295
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,829
They kill, rob, burn, and do all kinds of evils.

They're my sworn enemy.

298
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:31,690
I want to hear your true thoughts,

299
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,390
so tell me the truth.

300
00:17:33,410 --> 00:17:35,870
It's okay if you say the wrong thing. I won't scold you.

301
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,880
Don't look at him.

302
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,310
Just talk to me. Go ahead.

303
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,450
I heard from my elders in my hometown

304
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,070
that the Kuomintang won't last much longer.

00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,260
-Are you crazy?
-Wei Ruolai.

306
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,460
He told me to tell him.

307
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:53,030
Sir.

My father also said

311
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:04,780
everyone in the Kuomintang

312
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,030
puts money in their own pockets.

313
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,260
They say nice things,

314
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:10,660
but their policies don't get implemented.

No matter what policy it is,

00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,300
they turn into policies

317

that harm the people down here.

able to survive?

00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:59,570
I followed that car the entire way

and went to Zhabei along Hutai Road.

The outside of the factory was full of secret guards.

They didn't seem like much on the surface,

331

No.

349
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,650

Why is she here?

381
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,280
Why didn't you stop her?

382
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,640
I couldn't.

383
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,690
Where is she?

384
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,770
She sneaked in through the back door.

385
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:25,740
Back up.

386
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:30,050
Put down your guns!

387
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,170
Put it down!

388
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,970
Or I'll shoot him to death.

389
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,760
Hao?

390
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:36,960
Put down your guns.

391
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:38,350
Put them down!

392
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,580
Brothers,

393
00:22:41,310 --> 00:22:43,110
I know you're all risking your lives

394
00:22:43,110 --> 00:22:44,170
to raise families.

395
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:45,510
For this case,

396
00:22:45,950 --> 00:22:47,820
I will only arrest the principal offender.

397
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,620
I won't punish the accomplices.

398
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,820
Hao, this...

399
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,180
Who allowed you to come?

400
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,030
If I didn't come,

401
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,760
you'd be a corpse now, alright?

402
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:26,450
This...

403
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,020
So much money!

404
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,120
It's all money.

405
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:47,910
How did you make this?

406
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
There's no money in the pots.

407
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,860
Heavens,

408
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,540
you can buy the entire Shanghai with this money.

409
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,260
There are gold bars here.

410
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,770
Confess.

411
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:18,300
Who is the mastermind?

412
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,080
Asking when you know the answer

413
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,360
is no fun, Mr. Shen.

414
00:24:20,790 --> 00:24:22,230
Are you determined to

415
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,660
work with those maggots?

416
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:24,790
Captain Lin,

417
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,560
you weren't like this before.

418
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:31,000
Back when I was devoted to the country,

419
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,230
you didn't help me out much either.

420
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,370
If you confess to me now,

421
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,560
I can plead for you.

422
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:38,170
Thank you, but no need.

423
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,950
Are you that confident?

424
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,710
Do you think they can save you this time?

425
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:43,510
How would I know without trying?

426
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:45,690
Mr. Shen,

427
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:47,770
I know you have a tough backer,

428
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,210
but this time, I'm not weak either.

429
00:24:50,210 --> 00:24:51,000
Sir.

430
00:24:51,530 --> 00:24:52,140
Sir.

431
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:57,000
There's another secret room in the back.

432
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,640
It's full of opium.

433
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:04,360
Good job.

434
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,830
The government explicitly banned opium.

435
00:25:21,830 --> 00:25:23,150
How dare you do this?

436
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,280
How dare you!

437
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:25,950
The higher the risk, the greater the profit.

438
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:26,950
They are crazy.

439
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,270
A bunch of scum who ruin the country and the people.

440
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,080
Take him out.

441
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,020
Yes.

442
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:33,070
Congyun, Ruolai,

443
00:25:33,190 --> 00:25:34,740
take these opium and counterfeit coins back

444
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,380
as evidence.

445
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,010
Yes.

446
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:37,130
Come on, brothers.

447
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:37,650
Move it out.

448
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,380
Okay, come.

449
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:47,580
Hurry up.

450
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:54,180
Sir, be careful.

451
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,350
Listen, everyone inside.

452
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:58,210
We're the police.

453
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,030
Yu Zhiying.

454
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,880
You're already surrounded.

455
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,550
-If you want to live,
-Ruolai!

456
00:26:02,550 --> 00:26:03,910
surrender now.

457
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,990
Deputy Director Yu,

458
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,590
we're from the Central Bank.

459
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,880
We've caught the criminal. Don't shoot!

460
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:10,610
Don't shoot!

461
00:26:10,750 --> 00:26:11,750
We've caught him.

462
00:26:12,050 --> 00:26:12,880
Deputy Director Yu.

463
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,070
We've caught him.

464
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,220
Go!

465
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:16,560
Fire!

466
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,510
Guys!

467
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,570
Don't worry about me. Hide!

468
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:23,120
Other than Captain Lin, who's on our side,

469
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,620
the rest are criminals who made counterfeit coins.

470
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,620
Kill them all.

471
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:28,960
They're trying to silence us, sir.

472
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:30,300
If we don't leave now, we'll all die.

473
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,850
What should we do? Where should we go?

474
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,640
There's a back door.

475
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:33,660
I just came in from the back door.

476
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,180
Let's go.

477
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,100
Sir!

478
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,050
Hide.

479
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:50,360
Hao,

480
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:51,370
you go first.

481
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:52,320
I'll cover you.

482
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,450
Erdan!

483
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:04,490
Hurry!

484
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,400
Save him!

485
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:13,210
Shoot them all.

486
00:27:13,250 --> 00:27:15,710
Today, we'll eliminate harm for the people.

487
00:27:20,060 --> 00:27:21,590
There's an ambush up there.

488
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,860
Let's go.

489
00:27:35,670 --> 00:27:36,870
Let's go.

490
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,600
Brother.

491
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,590
I'll kill you!

492
00:28:01,110 --> 00:28:02,270
Go! Go!

493
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,210
Chunmiao.

494
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,130
Thank you for today.

495
00:28:54,290 --> 00:28:55,240
Without you,

496
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:57,150
all of us would have died.

497
00:28:57,190 --> 00:28:59,870
Wei, Erdan died.

498
00:28:59,910 --> 00:29:01,740
Erdan died.

499
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:04,120
Huhao,

500
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:05,570
don't worry.

501
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:06,960
I will get justice

502
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,360
for the rickshaw drivers

503
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:11,020
who died wrongly today.

504
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:12,370
Trust me.

505
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:15,200
I thank you all

506
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,780
on behalf of the Central Bank.

507
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:21,530
Mr. Shen,

508
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:22,760
thank you.

509
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:24,910
Take care of yourselves.

510
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:25,620
Go ahead.

511
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:30,920
Ruolai, take care of Chunmiao.

512
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:39,020
Congyun,

513
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:41,690
develop the photos and safeguard them.

514
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,050
This is solid evidence.

515
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:44,880
Yes, sir.

516
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:51,980
Mr. Shen.

517
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:56,910
Secretary Lu, why are you here?

518
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,010
Mr. Song asked you to go to his residence immediately.

519
00:29:59,010 --> 00:29:59,650
Now?

520
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,200
Yes.

521
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:03,220
I'm so dusty.

522
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,160
Wait for me.

523
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:04,720
Okay.

524
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,710
Mr. Kang, Deputy Director Yu.

525
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,670
Feeling guilty?

526
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,440
Are you here to get caught?

527
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,280
Tunan,

528
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,460
don't be angry.

529
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,860
There might be some misunderstanding between us.

530
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:44,060
Whether it's a misunderstanding or not,

531
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:46,120
we'll know after we see the evidence.

532
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,840
You cleaned up the scene, right?

533
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,850
But let me tell you.

534
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,130
As long as I'm alive,

535
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,690
I'll fight to the end with you two

536
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:53,810
about this.

537
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,360
Let's see if Mr. Song and Chairman Chiang

538
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,880
will spare you two

539
00:30:56,910 --> 00:30:59,710
over making counterfeit coins and selling opium.

540
00:31:00,270 --> 00:31:01,010
Come in.

541
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:04,590
You can speak when you see Mr. Song.

542
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:05,350
Yes.

543
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,420
Welcome.

544
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:15,360
How are you?

545
00:31:15,610 --> 00:31:16,670
Do you feel better?

546
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,350
No, it still hurts.

547
00:31:20,070 --> 00:31:21,940
Injuries don't heal that quickly.

548
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,160
Stay at home

549
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:23,650
for the next few days.

550
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:25,050
Why are you arresting us?

551
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,160
We did the right thing.

552
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,820
Why are you arresting us?

553
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,220
Wei Ruolai,

554
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,160
how are you going to solve this?

555
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,110
Don't be impulsive!

556
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:37,590
We'll both be caught.

557
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:45,350
No, I need to find Mr. Shen.

558
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,100
Are you okay by yourself?

559
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,900
Sure, go ahead.

560
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:02,500
Miss Shen.

561
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,070
Ruolai?

562
00:32:05,550 --> 00:32:06,880
I'm here to see Mr. Shen.

563
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:08,270
Is he here?

564
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,770
He's not back yet.

565
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,110
I heard there was

566
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,230
a big incident at the counterfeit factory today,

567
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:16,910
but you didn't get hurt at all.

568
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,410
You're quite lucky.

569
00:32:20,830 --> 00:32:22,290
I should thank you, right?

570
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,780
Thank me?

571
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,140
For what?

572
00:32:25,470 --> 00:32:27,230
If you didn't shoot to save us,

573
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:28,950
we would have died there.

574
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,280
You think too much.

575
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,840
I'm just an engineer,

576
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:33,030
not a sniper.

577
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,250
You still carry the smell of gunpowder.

578
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,660
Yes,

579
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:39,520
it got on me when I tested firearms at the arsenal.

580
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:42,590
If you dare to spread rumors,

581
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:43,470
I'll sue you.

582
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,270
By the way,

583
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,090
go to the shooting range with me next week.

584
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:51,990
Why?

585
00:32:52,270 --> 00:32:54,470
Think about it. The situation was so dangerous today.

586
00:32:54,470 --> 00:32:55,280
I think

587
00:32:55,510 --> 00:32:57,710
you should practice shooting

588
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,420
to better protect yourself

589
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:01,660
and my brother.

590
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:02,830
Okay.

591
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:05,290
I'll go learn after I solve this problem.

592
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,010
You might be disappointed this time.

593
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:10,370
This time,

594
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:13,770
both the police and the Garrison Command are involved.

595
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,410
I'm afraid they'll use minimization.

596
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,210
Impossible.

597
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:17,280
As long as Mr. Shen is here,

598
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:18,800
no one can escape the law.

599
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:21,370
I hope so.

600
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:27,160
Sir.

601
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:29,170
Sir.

602
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:31,370
Jiang Huhao and the others were arrested, sir.

603
00:33:31,370 --> 00:33:31,930
Sir.

604
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:39,070
Sir.

605
00:34:40,659 --> 00:34:42,580
Does Mr. Song know the truth now?

606
00:34:43,110 --> 00:34:44,040
Did you tell him?

607
00:34:46,270 --> 00:34:47,070
Yes.

608
00:34:47,909 --> 00:34:49,239
What's their attitude?

609
00:34:54,120 --> 00:34:54,880
Sir,

610
00:34:55,389 --> 00:34:57,230
making counterfeit coins and selling opium

611
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,810
are all capital crimes.

612
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,300
How can this be tolerated?

613
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:03,710
Is Mr. Song in a difficult situation?

614
00:35:03,710 --> 00:35:05,170
Did someone threaten him?

615
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,900
-Is it Nanjing, sir?
-Politics

616
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:10,320
is the art of compromise.

617
00:35:11,590 --> 00:35:13,450
You'll understand in the future.

618
00:35:14,170 --> 00:35:15,900
Sir, why should we compromise?

619
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:16,910
No,

620
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,760
how can we just let this go,

621
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:19,320
sir?

622
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:22,610
Tomorrow

623
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,130
will be the press conference.

624
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,000
They'll announce that the case is closed and all counterfeit coins

625
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,060
will be destroyed.

626
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,190
Then they'll find some scapegoats to take the blame

627
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:31,930
and the matter will be over.

628
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:33,380
Sir, why look for scapegoats?

629
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,730
We have solid evidence.

630
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:35,810
The higher-ups...

631
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:38,100
The higher-ups asked us

632
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:39,150
to return all the evidence.

633
00:35:39,150 --> 00:35:40,140
What higher-ups?

634
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:40,650
Who has the right—

635
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:41,870
The higher-ups!

636
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,140
There's no reason.

637
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:55,750
Ruolai,

638
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,280
this case is too complicated and involves too many people.

639
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,720
Xieqiao Factory

640
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,710
is internally known as Factory 17.

641
00:36:03,710 --> 00:36:05,470
Besides helping them make money for themselves,

642
00:36:05,470 --> 00:36:06,960
it's also used to provide all activity funds

643
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,510
of the Garrison Command.

644
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:09,380
This

645
00:36:10,270 --> 00:36:12,230
has tacit approval from the higher-ups,

646
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,630
so we can only stop here.

647
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:15,240
The government authorized the Central Bank

648
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:16,380
to allocate funds to them.

649
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:18,560
They can apply for it if they don't have enough,

650
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,300
but selling counterfeit coins and opium

651
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,620
will bring disaster to the country and the people.

652
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:22,800
Are those people in Nanjing crazy?

653
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,730
Wei Ruolai!

654
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:28,600
Can't you be more realistic?

655
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,180
Me?

656
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:29,600
Yes.

657
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:30,490
How can we be realistic?

658
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,750
How can we be realistic about what they did?

659
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:33,380
Sir,

660
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,520
if Mr. Song doesn't care,

661
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:35,460
we need to bring it further up.

662
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,220
Chairman Chiang won't sit idle.

663
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:38,000
If this goes on,

664
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,280
this country will be doomed.

665
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,270
Enough. This matter

666
00:36:40,270 --> 00:36:41,390
is over now.

667
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:43,160
I said and tried everything I could.

668
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,500
That's why I gave up.

669
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,250
Then let's expose the evidence publicly

670
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,040
and let the people know

671
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,180
what they have done.

672
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,790
The pressure of public opinion will force them to submit.

673
00:36:54,790 --> 00:36:55,670
Sir!

674
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:02,300
No media will dare to publish it.

675
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:04,620
The real shareholders of Factory 17

676
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,490
are the Kong family and Big Sister.

677
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:08,950
Mr. Kang and Yu Zhiying

678
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,970
are just underlings.

679
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,960
The root has decayed already.

680
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:14,300
What's the point

681
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,140
of cutting off a few branches?

682
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:31,770
Ruolai,

683
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:34,070
I'm sorry.

684
00:37:36,890 --> 00:37:37,510
I'm sorry.

685
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:42,120
I let you down.

686
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,020
I'm disappointed in myself too.

687
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,460
Did Hao's brothers die in vain?

688
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:57,310
Did the people who were scammed by counterfeit coins deserve it?

689
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,610
Is the truth that they got with their lives

690
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,070
really going to be buried?

691
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,360
[Shanghai Counterfeit Coins Investigation Result Press Conference]

692
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,820
Dear journalists,

693
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,900
welcome.

694
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:00,760
The Shanghai counterfeit coins case

695
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,350
was led by the Central Bank

696
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,260
with cooperation from the Shanghai Police Department

697
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:06,510
and the Shanghai branch of the party's Investigation and Arrest Unit.

698
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,500
After ten days of deployment and investigation,

699
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:10,170
the case was solved yesterday.

700
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:12,120
We took down the counterfeit den of Xieqiao Factory

701
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:14,070
hidden in Shanghai's Zhabei District.

702
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,270
After verification,

703
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,950
the mastermind is...

704
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,840
Is Deputy Director Liu Zhixin

705
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:31,790
of Shanghai Public Security Department's Zhabei Branch

706
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:34,150
and Captain Lin Qiaosong of the Military Law Department

707
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:37,890
of the Shanghai Garrison Command's Investigation and Arrest Unit.

708
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,740
To show the legitimacy of the system and the law,

709
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,150
the two have been arrested

710
00:39:42,150 --> 00:39:43,550
and await their verdict.

711
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:56,380
Everyone,

712
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,570
Lin Qiaosong made a grave mistake.

713
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:01,980
He not only disgraced the Garrison Command,

714
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,510
but also tarnished the reputation of the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

715
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,570
Don't worry.

716
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:07,950
I will punish him severely,

717
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:10,220
whether it be using our rules or the country's laws.

718
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:10,890
Here,

719
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:13,000
I promise everyone

720
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:15,420
that the Investigation and Arrest Unit is clean.

721
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,860
If anyone dares to break the law,

722
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,500
they will not be forgiven.

723
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,470
I will also say some things

724
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:28,020
on behalf of the police station.

725
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:30,420
The police station works conscientiously

726
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,140
to protect the city's safety.

727
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,830
After we found

728
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:35,530
the den of the counterfeit coins,

729
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,590
I personally led the team to the scene

730
00:40:38,050 --> 00:40:40,330
and had a fierce battle with the criminals.

731
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,800
Although I was injured,

732
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,170
we killed a dozen criminals

733
00:40:44,190 --> 00:40:44,920
on the spot.

734
00:40:44,980 --> 00:40:47,060
These criminals were very cunning.

735
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,230
They usually used the identity of rickshaw drivers,

736
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,890
but what was their real purpose?

737
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:54,010
They distributed counterfeit coins everywhere.

738
00:40:54,010 --> 00:40:54,770
Nonsense!

739
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,820
Yu Zhiying.

740
00:40:56,180 --> 00:40:57,570
You're distorting the truth and spewing slander.

741
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:58,490
Aren't you afraid those spirits

742
00:40:58,490 --> 00:40:59,410
haunting you?

743
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:00,850
Everyone,

744
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,070
those rickshaw drivers

745
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:03,490
were the real heroes behind this.

746
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:05,390
If you don't believe this, go to Xieqiao Factory and Zhabei.

747
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,380
Not only are there counterfeit coins,

748
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,850
but also opium.

749
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:08,250
Wei Ruolai, shut up!

750
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:09,790
Sir!

751
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,320
Move!

752
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:12,960
Let go of me!

753
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,160
Let go!

754
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:15,160
Wait.

755
00:41:16,510 --> 00:41:17,220
Chief Kang,

756
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:19,000
Wei Ruolai is an employee of the Central Bank.

757
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,080
We should take him back and deal with him ourselves.

758
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:22,520
No problem. Release him.

759
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,270
Sir,

760
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,610
they can control the world

761
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:29,230
and turn wrongs into rights.

762
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,760
I listened to you and tolerated it,

763
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,320
but they can't slander good people, right?

764
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,610
You saw how those rickshaw drivers died

765
00:41:33,610 --> 00:41:34,990
with your own eyes, right?

766
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,610
Do they have to bear such a crime in death,

767
00:41:36,610 --> 00:41:36,970
sir?

768
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,750
Huang Congyun, what are you waiting for?

769
00:41:38,750 --> 00:41:40,170
I'm begging you, Ruolai. Come on.

770
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:41,690
Sir, have you forgotten the party manifesto?

771
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:43,100
What about the promise you made me remember?

772
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,810
Sir, have you forgotten the Three Principles of the People?

773
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:45,370
Sir!

774
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:48,770
What are you doing? Take him away.

775
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:49,860
Wei.

776
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:50,480
Ruolai.

777
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:51,280
Go.

778
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:52,990
Advisor Shen,

779
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,610
how should we handle this?

780
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,140
Dear journalists.

781
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,230
Please be quiet.

782
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,990
That young man just now

783
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,630
is indeed an employee of the Central Bank,

784
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:09,440
but he doesn't know a lot

785
00:42:09,470 --> 00:42:11,030
about the facts of this case,

786
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,230
so what he said

787
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:13,410
was one-sided.

788
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:16,060
I hope you won't note down

789
00:42:16,310 --> 00:42:17,310
what he just said

790
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:18,880
and please don't spread it.

791
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:20,380
Please.

792
00:42:20,650 --> 00:42:22,970
The press conference will continue.

793
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:24,660
You can ask questions now.

794
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:32,570
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

795
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:49,420
Did they give you a hard time?

796
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,180
I've arranged hefty compensations

797
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:56,160
to the families of the rickshaw drivers

798
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,090
who were killed.
