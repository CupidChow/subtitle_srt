00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,870
[Episode 25]

4
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:41,180
Sorry, everyone.

5
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,680
The Central Bank's internal meeting was delayed.

6
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:44,009
So I’m late.

7
00:01:44,030 --> 00:01:44,870
Please forgive me.

8
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,430
Advisor Shen.

9
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:46,470
Have a seat.

10
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:47,380
Mr. Yu.

11
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,090
The war happened suddenly.

12
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:53,600
The Central Bank is the pillar of finance.

13
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:55,240
It's understandable.

14
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,580
Please have a seat.

15
00:01:57,070 --> 00:01:58,870
Judging from your expression,

16
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:01,940
I'm afraid today's situation is not simple.

17
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:05,510
I do have two requests today.

18
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:06,580
Firstly,

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:09,169
I hope the banking associations in Shanghai

20
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:11,590
will respond to the summons of the head association

21
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:12,690
and shut down indefinitely

22
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,150
to protest against Japan.

23
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:15,310
Secondly,

24
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,910
we must raise funds for

25
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,640
the 19th Route Army's pay and provisions.

26
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,310
Both requests are difficult.

27
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,190
Although Japan has waged war,

28
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,710
they had a talk

29
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,190
with the British and American consulates

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,750
beforehand and promised

31
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,140
not to touch the concessions.

32
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:44,670
If you ask us banks

33
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,300
to join the strike,

34
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,860
you'll put the concession and business departments in a difficult position.

35
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,800
When the country is in trouble,

36
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,260
our priority is the interests of the people.

37
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:57,000
After all, we are all Chinese.

38
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:57,820
Of course,

39
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,840
we put our country

40
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,260
n the most important place,

41
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,440
our hearts.

42
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,330
But

43
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:06,600
we just received

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,040
an emergency call from Wuhan, Nanjing,

45
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,590
asking us to focus on the overall situation.

46
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,150
At a time like this,

47
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:16,310
if we suspend operations

48
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,070
and settlements,

49
00:03:18,790 --> 00:03:19,750
I'm afraid they won't agree.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,920
At a time like this,

51
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:23,190
we must be united.

52
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,760
The suspension of operations

53
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,440
is a declaration of our stance

54
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,070
and the stance of Germany, France, Britain, and America.

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,630
You're all handling foreign capital.

56
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,150
If you don't suspend operation,

57
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:33,390
Japan will believe that

58
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:35,760
the leaders of those countries are on their side.

59
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,320
Only when you suspend operations

60
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,910
will the international public think about

61
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:39,790
which side

62
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,810
justice should stand with.

63
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,880
Advisor Shen is right.

64
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:47,910
If Shanghai

65
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,200
were occupied by the Japanese,

66
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,570
even if we had support from Britain and America,

67
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,770
our future

68
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:55,810
would be bleak.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,880
But

70
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:02,120
suspending the markets indefinitely

71
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,840
is a little...

72
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,560
Like I've said,

73
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,050
it's about taking a stand.

74
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:07,270
If we can't do it indefinitely,

75
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:08,270
let's suspend operations for three days.

76
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:09,670
Three days, is that okay?

77
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:10,580
Come on.

78
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:12,310
Three days

79
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,600
to take our stand.

80
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,860
I think it's okay.

81
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:17,480
What about you?

82
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,269
Sure.

83
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,610
The second problem,

84
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:22,580
about the 19th Route Army's pay and provisions.

85
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,540
I can’t negotiate on this.

86
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:32,010
I'm sure you have all heard

87
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:33,350
the bombing outside.

88
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,130
The 19th Route Army is Shanghai's main anti-Japanese force.

89
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:38,040
They haven't been paid for two months.

90
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,680
The government only has

91
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,860
three million in its account.

92
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,820
The monthly expenses are 22 million.

93
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:43,700
But I think

94
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,700
no matter what,

95
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,310
we cannot skimp on military pay.

96
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,310
So, everyone,

97
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,190
please.

98
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:00,180
Fugen.

99
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:01,930
Eat something.

100
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,120
Your family is gone.

101
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,760
But you have to live on.

102
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:07,310
You have to live on!

103
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:07,870
Fugen!

104
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:09,600
Fugen.

105
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,930
I told you we should have gone home.

106
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,750
But you refused to listen to me.

107
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,700
Now's not the time for that.

108
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:14,550
Will you quit it?

109
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:15,370
It's a mess wherever you go.

110
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:16,770
Stay in Shanghai for now.

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:21,650
Wen!

112
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,460
Wen, how are you?

113
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:23,500
Wen.

114
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:24,620
Get up.

115
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:25,240
Get up.

116
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,070
Wen.

117
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,510
What's wrong?

118
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,350
Japanese! Japanese!

119
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:28,200
So many of them.

120
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,640
What's going on?

121
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,700
I couldn't do it. I tried my best, Wei.

122
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,670
The Japanese couldn't take down Zhabei Station all night,

123
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,870
so they bombed the residential area.

124
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,670
People are injured everywhere.

125
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:41,400
There are no beds in the hospital and no medicine.

126
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,470
Is it better in the concessions?

127
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,150
Slow down.

128
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,230
I think

129
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,600
they are all the same.

130
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,240
I heard

131
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:50,120
over 100,000 people rushed there last night.

132
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,980
All the police were chasing people away

133
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,240
with their big sticks.

134
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,470
There are so many.

135
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:56,620
Ms. Zhou.

136
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,400
How about this?

137
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,620
I have to go to work later.

138
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,470
I'll take everyone to the concession for shelter.

139
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:01,710
Every successful entry counts.

140
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:02,470
Wei,

141
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:03,870
you're just one person.

142
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:05,400
How many people can you bring in?

143
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,870
If you mess up, no one can get in.

144
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,310
Yes.

145
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,220
We're not leaving.

146
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,720
What will they do if we leave?

147
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:10,450
Get to work.

148
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,030
We're not going anywhere.

149
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:12,030
Let me help you, Ms. Zhou.

150
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,830
Hurry up.

151
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,230
I'll get a few rickshaws.

152
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:16,450
Are you cold?

153
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,520
I'll get the quilt.

154
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,700
Hurry.

155
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,270
Pass things down to everyone.

156
00:06:24,270 --> 00:06:26,070
These emergency supplies, too.

157
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,960
Here, have some steamed buns.

158
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,470
Here.

159
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:29,770
Thank you.

160
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,420
Why are you here, Miss Shen?

161
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,659
It's too chaotic here. Leave now.

162
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:34,159
Are you okay?

163
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:34,790
Are you hurt?

164
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:35,790
I'm fine. Just go.

165
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:36,990
It's too close to the war zone here.

166
00:06:36,990 --> 00:06:37,590
Go!

167
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:38,400
Hurry up.

168
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,159
Wei Ruolai!

169
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:40,450
I can't leave.

170
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:41,950
Look at the situation now.

171
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,330
I have to stay and help.

172
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,440
Take this.

173
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,450
For self-defense.

174
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,400
I hope you won't need it.

175
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:02,870
This is the 19th Route Army speaking.

176
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,190
This is the 19th Route Army speaking.

177
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:05,240
This is a report

178
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,310
to all countrymen,

179
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,410
Japan has occupied the three northeastern provinces.

180
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,950
We have lost territories

181
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:15,730
and our nation is dying.

182
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,220
Recently, they attacked civilians in Shanghai.

183
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,250
Their actions are violent and atrocious.

184
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,160
They point their cannons at us

185
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:27,080
and their troops are on our land.

186
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,500
On the 28th of the month, at midnight,

187
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:33,780
they invaded us from Zhabei, Shanghai

188
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,140
and provoked us.

189
00:07:35,710 --> 00:07:37,340
Those who belong to the army

190
00:07:38,050 --> 00:07:39,940
must execute proper defense measures.

191
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,500
Defending the country

192
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,090
is our duty.

193
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,930
We cannot give up

194
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,540
on our territory.

195
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,860
Fight against Japan to save our country and people.

196
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,130
Even though we may sacrifice ourselves,

197
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,909
we must never back down.

198
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:56,030
This will and determination

199
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,840
shall be witnessed by the world.

200
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:01,680
The spirits of our ancestors

201
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,310
shall testify it.

202
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,660
Japan's ambition is clear as day.

203
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:10,480
Guards!

204
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,550
If the Japanese charge in here,

205
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:13,910
we'll just be killed here.

206
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,810
Instead of dying in vain here,

207
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,390
I'd rather die honorably on the battlefield.

208
00:08:17,390 --> 00:08:18,640
We want to fight!

209
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:19,750
Fight against the Japanese!

210
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:20,790
We want to fight!

211
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,750
Fight against the Japanese!

212
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:22,630
Just tell them that

213
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:24,910
Lin Qiaosong is willing to fight to the death.

214
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,640
Captain Lin,

215
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:27,640
your sentence is not over.

216
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:28,140
I'm afraid...

217
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,400
What are you afraid of?

218
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:30,850
We will die

219
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,950
if we stay in this prison.

220
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:35,220
Instead of dying in prison,

221
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:37,990
we rather die on the battlefield.

222
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,540
I want to go home.

223
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:32,070
I'm hungry.

224
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:43,450
Zhabei took the hardest hit.

225
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,770
It's a relief that you're alive.

226
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,680
Seven of my neighbors died.

227
00:09:50,390 --> 00:09:51,720
Countless are injured.

228
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,320
Now do you know why the government didn't dare to declare war?

229
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,910
The chairman called Mr. Song

230
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:01,470
and pleaded for military expenses.

231
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:04,470
I could only borrow so much from people, too.

232
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:08,240
The military expenses raised from various banks

233
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,700
are not much,

234
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,320
but luckily, they come from foreign accounts.

235
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:15,390
The Banking Association purchased a batch of urgent supplies.

236
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:18,030
Medicine, bandages, and the like.

237
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,110
They are all stuck at the port.

238
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,790
It's an impossible task

239
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:22,560
delivering these goods

240
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,680
to the 19th Route Army

241
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,840
from the concession.

242
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,820
Let me try.

243
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,320
You?

244
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
What can you do?

245
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,070
Yes.

246
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,630
The Japanese dare not fight in the concession,

247
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:38,500
but there are

248
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,590
their vigilantes and spies everywhere.

249
00:10:40,590 --> 00:10:41,790
If they find out that we're transporting

250
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:44,440
the supplies from the concession to the Chinese border,

251
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,950
they will be waiting to intercept us at the border.

252
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,740
How do we know if we don't try?

253
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:51,720
I wasn't raised a coward.

254
00:10:58,470 --> 00:10:59,230
Ruolai.

255
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,680
Remember what I told you before.

256
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:03,490
Assess the situation.

257
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:04,510
In the face of danger,

258
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:06,910
your life is more important than supplies.

259
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,410
I understand, Sir.

260
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,290
[Eliminate the Japanese enemies and protect our country]

261
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,290
[19th Route Army]

262
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:59,290
[Make them pay]

263
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,210
[Boycott Japanese goods forever]

264
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:03,440
Sir.

265
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,520
Madam.

266
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,290
Brothers and sisters.

267
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,550
The 19th Route Army

268
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,550
is protecting our country,

269
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,300
our women, and our children.

270
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:16,180
We common folks should contribute

271
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,510
whatever money and strength we have.

272
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:19,940
If we work together, we can achieve victory.

273
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:20,700
Wei.

274
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,550
I delivered the message.

275
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:23,750
But Hao and others...

276
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:26,990
Hao.

277
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,730
I know it's very risky this time.

278
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:34,800
I'm not very confident either.

279
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,350
How about this?

280
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,700
Consider it a business.

281
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:38,070
I'll pay you good money.

282
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:41,500
How much?

283
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:46,570
How about

284
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,840
100 US dollars?

285
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,560
This is the transport fee for one trip.

286
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,160
I'll pay you after each trip.

287
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,380
Hao,

288
00:13:03,810 --> 00:13:05,960
this is the highest price I can offer.

289
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:09,020
Listen, Wei Ruolai.

290
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:10,710
We're willing to do it.

291
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:12,530
But we're not doing it for the Central Bank

292
00:13:12,530 --> 00:13:14,170
or for the officials.

293
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
It's for the 19th Route Army

294
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,840
who are fighting the enemies with their lives.

295
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,430
So we don't need the money.

296
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,470
Keep it for the army.

297
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,260
Okay.

298
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:32,600
Thank you, guys.

299
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:33,670
Please.

300
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,250
Keep up. Don't fall behind.

301
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,010
One, two, three.

302
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,330
Kill them!

303
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:24,690
Hao!

304
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:25,910
Wei!

305
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:35,960
Hide!

306
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:53,470
Assistant Wei.

307
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:54,420
Be alert.

308
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,750
Who are you?

309
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,170
What, you don't recognize me already?

310
00:18:00,170 --> 00:18:00,980
Captain Lin?

311
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,700
What are you doing?

312
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,190
We're delivering supplies to the 19th Route Army.

313
00:18:07,190 --> 00:18:09,190
Are you a Dare-to-Die Corps?

314
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,240
What else can we prisoners be?

315
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:14,300
Team, we've got work to do.

316
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,440
Armored vehicles are arriving at the next street.

317
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,970
Let's go.

318
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:16,760
Yes.

319
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:26,340
Stay alive.

320
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:29,260
I'll deal with you when the war is over.

321
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:37,620
Be careful.

322
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:38,530
Be safe!

323
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,210
Be careful!

324
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,100
Hurry up!

325
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:43,850
The rickshaws are here.

326
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:44,610
The rickshaws are here!

327
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:45,610
Get moving!

328
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,710
The rickshaws are here.

329
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,030
Doggie, hurry here.

330
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,820
Drink something warm.

331
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:50,620
This one.

332
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,170
I just poured it. Have some.

333
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:54,390
Wen!

334
00:18:56,790 --> 00:18:57,550
Sir.

335
00:18:58,400 --> 00:18:59,800
Sir, why are you here?

336
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:00,760
I'm here to help.

337
00:19:01,550 --> 00:19:02,390
Let me, Sir.

338
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:09,150
Come, give me a hand.

339
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:09,830
Come on.

340
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,150
Have some water.

341
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:22,910
Okay.

342
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:23,510
Thank you.

343
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:24,730
Fasten them well.

344
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,080
Mr. Shen,

345
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:27,870
you're a big shot.

346
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:28,910
We all want to know

347
00:19:28,930 --> 00:19:30,510
how long this war will last.

348
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:31,740
Take a break.

349
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,330
Everyone is united now.

350
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:35,190
The 19th Route Army is fighting fearlessly.

351
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,420
The industrial and commercial sects are suspended.

352
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,240
International public opinion is in full swing.

353
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,900
If this continues,

354
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,700
the Japanese won't last long.

355
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,430
Yes!

356
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,840
Send them back to their hometown!

357
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
Yes.

358
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:46,850
Send them back to their hometown!

359
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:48,970
Give us back our country!

360
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:50,490
Knock down the invaders!

361
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,670
Send them back to their hometown!

362
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,770
Send them back to their hometown!

363
00:19:53,790 --> 00:19:54,680
Let's go.

364
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,350
Let's go!

365
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:57,720
Mr. Shen, have some tea.

366
00:19:58,210 --> 00:19:58,820
Thank you.

367
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,500
Be careful.

368
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:01,870
Be careful.

369
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:03,370
Be careful.

370
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:05,690
Doggie, slow down.

371
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,640
Hao, slow down.

372
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,360
Sir,

373
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,220
you're having dinner here?

374
00:20:35,790 --> 00:20:36,660
You must be hungry.

375
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,290
Come on.

376
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,150
Eat it soon.

377
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,270
There's enough for everyone.

378
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:39,590
There's more.

379
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:41,110
Thank you, Hao.

380
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,190
Have the supplies been delivered?

381
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:42,990
Yes.

382
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,390
Here, have this.

383
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,550
Do you have pickles?

384
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:49,910
Do you like it?

385
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:50,430
Wei.

386
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,380
It's delicious.

387
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:53,250
This war

388
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,200
is almost done.

389
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:55,220
By next week,

390
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:57,610
there should be definite news.

391
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,610
That's great.

392
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,210
You think it's good?

393
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:04,540
I don't think so.

394
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:08,160
The real challenge

395
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,520
has just begun.

396
00:21:11,730 --> 00:21:13,890
Previously, the situation was just beginning to improve.

397
00:21:13,890 --> 00:21:15,250
Thanks to this war,

398
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,700
the treasury is empty again.

399
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,700
We can't do anything without money.

400
00:21:19,190 --> 00:21:20,580
Many construction plans

401
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,640
can only be postponed indefinitely.

402
00:21:23,330 --> 00:21:25,390
Mr. Song was lamenting it yesterday.

403
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:26,510
Why does so much

404
00:21:28,050 --> 00:21:30,410
disaster befall our nation and people?

405
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:31,560
I don't understand.

406
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,300
Sir,

407
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,800
can we issue war bonds

408
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:43,130
like the United States?

409
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,250
Then our country will become stronger

410
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,910
and we won't be afraid of wars.

411
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,510
Sure.

412
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:50,740
Can you tell the government

413
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,660
to invite some

414
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,570
influential figures to promote it for us?

415
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:55,280
But one thing is missing.

416
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:58,950
One thing is missing?

417
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:01,070
Do you know what it is?

418
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:03,330
You mean

419
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,290
credit?

420
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,220
That's right.

421
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:08,150
Without credit,

422
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,410
there is no finance.

423
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,830
Credit is the foundation of finance

424
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:13,500
and the lifeline of finance.

425
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:14,770
A nation's credit

426
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:17,000
can't be built overnight.

427
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,670
We are all financial enterprises.

428
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,360
We have a long way to go.

429
00:22:42,810 --> 00:22:44,640
We beat the Japanese.

430
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,730
They asked me to burn some newspapers

431
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,000
to show you.

432
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,990
The Japanese have retreated!

433
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:52,680
Rong Sheng,

434
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,830
what's the use

435
00:22:54,330 --> 00:22:55,970
of burning newspapers?

436
00:22:57,310 --> 00:22:58,510
Burn some gold ingots

437
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,690
and ask them to buy a house down there.

438
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,000
A family will eventually be united.

439
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,210
I'm afraid they'll reincarnate first and not wait for me.

440
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,070
If that happens, let it be.

441
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,920
Just find another family.

442
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,070
You're still young.

443
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:18,540
Qi's father was blown to death.

444
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,020
His mother is still alive.

445
00:23:20,740 --> 00:23:21,650
Ms. Zhou.

446
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:23,030
His mother is 60 years old.

447
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,420
What do you know?

448
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,020
Youthfulness doesn't matter

449
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:28,150
when it comes to living life together.

450
00:23:28,250 --> 00:23:29,060
Wen.

451
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:30,400
Go to Genbao's liquor store

452
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,950
and fetch the aged liquor I ordered.

453
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:33,990
I'll treat everyone to a drink and a meal tonight.

454
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:35,140
Ms. Zhou, you're so generous.

455
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,780
Of course.

456
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,280
I'll pay for the meat.

457
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,130
Get more meat.

458
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:41,730
Okay.

459
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,480
Don't worry.

460
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,240
Old man.

461
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:45,940
Where do you get the money

462
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,290
to pay for the meat?

463
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,450
You haven't paid me last month's rent.

464
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,560
All right, don't worry.

465
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,890
Take your time.

466
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:54,090
No hurry.

467
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,150
No hurry at all.

468
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:00,030
We won, we deserve meat and wine.

469
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:02,110
Young man, don't be too sad.

470
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:03,010
Come on, let's have a meal together.

471
00:24:03,010 --> 00:24:05,010
Come to my house for dinner tonight.

472
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:08,280
Take your time. Return my basket later.

473
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,930
[Long live victory!]

474
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:27,670
[Long live victory!]

475
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,100
[Long live the 19th Route Army]

476
00:24:35,050 --> 00:24:36,400
We're resuming operation!

477
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,460
Wishing us prosperity and good luck!

478
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,190
Get your newspaper here!

479
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:47,540
The war between China and Japan has ended.

480
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,860
The League of Nations

481
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,390
ruled in favor of China.

482
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:51,630
Get your newspaper here!

483
00:24:51,630 --> 00:24:52,950
The war between China and Japan has ended

484
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,420
The League of Nations

485
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:55,780
ruled in favor of China.

486
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,780
The League of Nations

487
00:24:57,810 --> 00:24:59,140
ruled in favor of China.

488
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,650
Shameless and ridiculous.

489
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,190
No Chinese garrison is allowed in Shanghai?

490
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:09,920
What kind of agreement is this?

491
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,340
We won the war. How did the negotiation turn out this way?

492
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,090
Ruolai.

493
00:25:19,370 --> 00:25:20,570
What's on your mind?

494
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,460
Sir,

495
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,160
China will not die.

496
00:25:25,870 --> 00:25:27,800
Although the truce agreement was humiliating,

497
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
the foreigners saw

498
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,000
our army's fighting spirit and courage,

499
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,400
and the people's determination to resist.

500
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,160
Yes.

501
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:36,580
After this battle,

502
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,370
Japan won't cause any trouble for a few years.

503
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,440
This has bought us

504
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,040
some time for steady growth.

505
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:45,170
The people traded their lives for these.

506
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:52,040
Ms. Zhou helped the army wash gauze day and night.

507
00:25:57,670 --> 00:25:59,270
Support the 19th Route Army!

508
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,000
Support the 19th Route Army!

509
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:03,200
Get the Japanese out of here!

510
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,230
Long live China!

511
00:26:06,790 --> 00:26:08,990
The dancers donated all their savings.

512
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,710
The carters risked their lives to deliver the goods.

513
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,880
The soldiers snuck under

514
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,930
armored vehicles with grenades.

515
00:26:19,930 --> 00:26:21,660
When the country is in trouble,

516
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:23,770
the people can be depended upon.

517
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:01,520
Mr. Yu.

518
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,140
Steward Liu.

519
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,360
What's the meaning of this?

520
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,720
Sorry, Shanghai hasn't been peaceful recently.

521
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,120
Please excuse us, Mr. Yu.

522
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,460
Surely, this doesn't apply to me.

523
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,080
I'm sorry.

524
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,840
Search them.

525
00:27:15,090 --> 00:27:15,910
What are you doing?

526
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,640
Mingquan.

527
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,270
Here.

528
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:27,480
Okay. Mr. Yu, this way.

529
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:28,200
Okay.

530
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,680
You can't go in.

531
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:34,130
Okay. You wait outside.

532
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,920
Mr. Yu, please come in.

533
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:37,490
Okay.

534
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,370
Mr. Yu.

535
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:42,310
What is Big Sister planning?

536
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:44,000
Why is she being so mysterious?

537
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,080
If I'm not mistaken,

538
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,940
it should be about the construction treasury bill.

539
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,550
Selling treasury bills right after the cease-fire?

540
00:27:51,550 --> 00:27:52,720
Will anyone buy it?

541
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,120
I'm not sure about that.

542
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:58,860
She only said this as a reply,

543
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,810
"The people can be depended upon."

544
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:06,390
Get your newspaper here!

545
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:09,320
The Treasury Department has issued treasury bills

546
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:11,550
for the construction of post-war Shanghai.

547
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,610
Everyone has a responsibility to buy the treasury bills.

548
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:16,570
Madam, would you like one?

549
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:18,640
Sir.

550
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:19,940
Would you like one?

551
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:22,720
Sir.

552
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:23,430
No. Go away.

553
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:30,120
Sir.

554
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,350
Would you like a treasury bill?

555
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:33,470
Why would I?

556
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:36,980
I went bankrupt because I bought bonds.

557
00:28:37,870 --> 00:28:38,680
Get lost!

558
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:41,830
The distribution of the construction treasury bill

559
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:43,110
is very important.

560
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,160
The Treasury Department

561
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,190
has assigned the main distribution mission to us.

562
00:28:47,190 --> 00:28:48,050
Eight million.

563
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,160
The deadline is one month.

564
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:51,680
Eight million?

565
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:52,910
Sir.

566
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:54,880
The economy hasn't recovered after the war.

567
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,080
Even 80,000 is a challenge.

568
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,080
Not necessarily.

569
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,630
The people united and fought for the victory.

570
00:28:58,630 --> 00:28:59,420
The common folks

571
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,310
have regained some confidence in the government.

572
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,800
That's only temporary.

It's not a money-robbing gimmick.

The Kuomintang is not a warlord.

582
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:17,790
The Central Bank must be trustworthy.

This time,

As we all know,

the tariff management right belongs to the Central Bank.

611
00:30:20,070 --> 00:30:21,910
Since we have tariffs as collateral

But the launch of the treasury bills

649
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:05,980

Mr. Song.

To distribute the treasury bills successfully,

652
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:10,950
I think two things are crucial.

00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,590
One is stability, and the other is credibility.

Moving on,

655
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:16,030
I plan to contact the major banks to control

656
00:32:16,030 --> 00:32:19,160
the issuance of treasury bills, led by the Central Bank.

00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,590
and stabilize the price of the treasury bills.

661
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:26,440
Only when the Central Bank is in charge

662
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,880
can the funds collected from the treasury bills

663
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,020

00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:48,040
Don't worry.

762
00:36:49,990 --> 00:36:51,160
Consider this another warning.

763
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:53,360
Stop bargaining with the Central Bank.

764
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:58,840
[Li Anrong]

765
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,760
I gathered everyone here today

766
00:37:11,870 --> 00:37:14,560
to unite together and control the

767
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,460
price of the construction treasury bills.

768
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:17,610
I must emphasize two things.

769
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,910
First, this must be strictly confidential.

770
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:22,280
Second, operation orders are like military orders.

771
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,410
If anyone disobeys,

772
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,000
I promise your bank will disappear from Shanghai.

773
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,470
Why must we do as he said?

774
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:32,940
How can we make money this way?

775
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,310
He even threatened to erase our banks from Shanghai.

776
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:35,400
Who does he think he is?

777
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:35,870
What a joke!

778
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,600
In Shanghai,

779
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,030
we are all influential individuals.

780
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,030
He doesn't know his place.

781
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,120
Does he take us for fools?

782
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,030
Who made him the boss?

783
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:44,290
Who cares what he said?

784
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,710
The Treasury Department mortgaged the treasury bills to us

785
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:49,230
at 50 per bill.

786
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:53,120
If we play the game right, we can earn a lot.

787
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,160
We can't afford to play this game.

788
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:56,790
No matter what they do,

789
00:37:56,990 --> 00:38:00,040
the price of the treasure bills cannot be maintained at 70.

790
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,880
Sooner or later, it will fall back.

791
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,410
Even if we sell at 60 yuan,

792
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:05,150
we can still get a 10 yuan profit per bill.

793
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,480
It's against the rules.

794
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:08,720
The Treasury Department clearly states that

795
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,840
treasury bills cannot be sold

796
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:12,040
directly in the trading firm.

797
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:15,200
Why are you afraid of buying back at 50?

798
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,110
Given the state of the government,

799
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:19,870
I would be grateful

800
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,600
if it's even worth 30 yuan in the end.

801
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,440
That's right.

802
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,330
Don't worry.

803
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,120
Don't worry.

804
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,590
I have an informant in the Treasury Department.

805
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:28,910
If there is any news,

806
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:31,530
I'll inform you immediately.

807
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:36,130
But this is an illegal move.

808
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:38,120
You're earning

809
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,170
risky money.

810
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,930
As the old saying goes,

811
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:50,940
if you won't take the opportunity,

812
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,400
you must take the blame.

813
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,050
Even the Treasury Department can do this.

814
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,070
Why can't we?

815
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,030
Don't be too greedy.

816
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,280
We'll sell it at 60

817
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,110
and buy back when it falls to 50.

818
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:07,440
The higher-ups get the lion's share,

819
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:09,200
but we get our small profits too.

820
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:09,880
Haven't we

821
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,230
been doing this for decades?

822
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:12,990
Yes.

823
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,090
That's right.

824
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,950
We're the financial sector,

825
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,440
not a charity place.

826
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:21,910
Understand?

827
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:28,550
Let's do it.

828
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,370
Mr. Yu!

829
00:39:46,770 --> 00:39:47,650
Mr. Yu.

830
00:39:48,230 --> 00:39:48,990
What’s wrong?

831
00:39:48,990 --> 00:39:49,920
Done.

832
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:50,600
Really?

833
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:51,710
Really.

834
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:53,760
These old players

835
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,590
can't resist the temptation of huge profits.

836
00:39:58,190 --> 00:40:00,910
It's called being too clever to be wise.

837
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:02,250
They said

838
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,820
they would take turns selling it starting tomorrow

839
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,150
to test the water first.

840
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:08,630
We'll buy as many as they sell.

841
00:40:08,650 --> 00:40:09,390
Okay.

842
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,390
We need to maintain the price of the treasury bills.

843
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:13,750
This is for the country.

844
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:14,280
Yes.

845
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,510
Maybe in the future,

846
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,330
the Treasury Department will give us a medal.

847
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,580
Really?

848
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,830
Mr. Yu, you are brilliant.

849
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,390
Ms. Zhou, you cooked too much.

850
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:29,870
It's enough, Ms. Zhou.

851
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:30,670
It's too much.

852
00:40:30,710 --> 00:40:31,840
Too much.

853
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:33,880
We can't finish them.

854
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:34,880
Ms. Zhou, this is such a luxurious spread.

855
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,600
Wei.

856
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,830
We were waiting for you.

857
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:39,760
Why are you here?

858
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:42,610
They are Wen's friends. I called them here.

859
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,410
Ms. Zhou.

860
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:44,860
What's the occasion?

861
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:48,070
Ms. Zhou is rich now.

862
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,770
I went to buy the treasury bills today.

863
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:52,710
I bought them from your bank.

864
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,830
I spent 100 yuan

865
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:55,330
and got 2 bills.

866
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,520
Guess how much I earned.

867
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:58,590
Thirty.

868
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:03,760
He's from the bank.

869
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:04,980
Of course he knows.

870
00:41:05,150 --> 00:41:06,580
Congratulations, Ms. Zhou.

871
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,540
Come on.

872
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,450
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

873
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,920
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

874
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:12,800
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

875
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:13,710
Eat up.

876
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,110
There's more at the back.

877
00:41:17,470 --> 00:41:18,320
Newspaper.

878
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,800
This is today's newspaper. Read it.

879
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:24,820
See if there's any news.

880
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,320
He's reading the newspaper.

881
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:29,320
The director of the Treasury Department's government bond sector

882
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:31,580
personally sent a telegram from Nanjing

883
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:34,560
to invest 500,000 in more construction treasury bill.

884
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,560
What does that mean?

885
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,270
It means the bills' value is expected to rise.

886
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,270
Expected to rise.

887
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,430
I hear the staff in the Central Bank

888
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:43,160
bought hundreds of thousands of treasury bills.

889
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:43,870
Is it true?

890
00:41:43,870 --> 00:41:44,440
Yes. Is it true?

891
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:47,030
We did hold a fundraising meeting yesterday.

892
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:48,090
I also bought some.

893
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:52,640
Wei, one of my socialite passengers

894
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,480
told me today

895
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,610
that the government is preparing

896
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,950
to issue a medal of honor to citizens

897
00:41:57,950 --> 00:41:59,150
who invested in the construction treasury bills.

898
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,850
-I heard about it too.
-Really?

899
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,370
I bought some bills. They should give me a medal.

900
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,880
Of course. You bought some.

901
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,080
Keep reading. What else is there?

902
00:42:08,110 --> 00:42:09,240
Hurry, keep reading.

903
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:12,210
Shanghai Banking Association raised 1.5 million yuan

904
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,720
to purchase the construction treasury bills.

905
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:15,620
Mr. Gong of the Treasury Department personally published an article,

906
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,280
calling on all sectors of society to actively participate

907
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,590
in the financial reinvestment of the nation's industries.

908
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:21,590
It's a good thing.

909
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,870
Do you think we should buy some bills too?

910
00:42:24,870 --> 00:42:25,430
Yeah.

911
00:42:25,430 --> 00:42:27,360
We all contributed to the country.

912
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,920
Calm down.

913
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,560
Calm down.

914
00:42:32,660 --> 00:42:33,490
Wei,

915
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,180
do you have any internal information?

916
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,540
Yeah, Wei, tell us.

917
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,360
Yes.

918
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,990
But I can't tell you the details.

919
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:44,520
Tell us.

920
00:42:44,590 --> 00:42:45,660
-What can’t you say?
-Wei.

921
00:42:45,660 --> 00:42:46,860
Don't talk.

922
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:50,430
Just nod or shake your head.

923
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:51,630
Come on. That's right.

924
00:42:51,630 --> 00:42:53,270
Should we buy more bills?

925
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:55,380
Yeah, that's right.
