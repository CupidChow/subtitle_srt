00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:31,770
[Episode 24]

4
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:41,300
Did they give you a hard time?

5
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,780
For the carters' families,

6
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,130
I've arranged for

7
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,090
a lot of pension.

8
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,880
It doesn't change things,

9
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:53,030
but it's better than nothing.

10
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,180
And those reporters

11
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,780
took bribes,

12
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,980
so no one will dare speak

13
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:05,230
for the truth.

14
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:09,750
Got it.

15
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,090
Let's get a drink

16
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,440
to relax.

17
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:22,270
Mr. Shen.

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,530
Mr. Shen.

19
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:35,870
You really surprised me today.

20
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,030
It's normal for someone like me to do dirty work.

21
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:40,370
It's my duty.

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,579
But you are

23
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:46,300
always well-dressed and righteous,

24
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:50,220
yet you also drop the ball at critical moments.

25
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,870
I really thought you'd speak for the people

26
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,050
at the press conference today.

27
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:59,170
How does it feel to clean up Mr. Kang's mess?

28
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:11,780
And you.

29
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,780
I used to be passionate

30
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,380
and upright

31
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:20,870
like you.

32
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,030
But after going through a lot,

33
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,790
I've matured.

34
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:28,829
Don't worry.

35
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:31,850
You'll become like me soon.

36
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:34,790
Take care.

37
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,550
Sir, I don't understand.

38
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Why aren't...

39
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:34,790
good people

40
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,580
rewarded?

41
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,400
As the old saying goes,

42
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,200
"Evildoers get gold belts;

43
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,800
good people can't even keep their corpses."

44
00:04:46,870 --> 00:04:48,670
It's always been like this.

45
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,600
But have they forgotten

46
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,030
Sun Yat-sen's last wish?

47
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,710
Or

48
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,990
do oaths

49
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:58,090
mean nothing?

50
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,190
Some join the party

51
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,160
to change China.

52
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:04,810
Others join

53
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,860
for prestige and fortune.

54
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,650
We can't demand others to change.

55
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:10,940
We can only stay true

56
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,700
to our beliefs.

57
00:05:14,700 --> 00:05:16,560
Did you stay true to your beliefs?

58
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:18,600
Is this the result you wanted?

59
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,440
No.

60
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,740
Of course not.

61
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,040
Mr. Song promised me

62
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,409
that this case

63
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,550
will be submitted to Chairman Chiang,

64
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,740
and he'd punish whomever deserves it,

65
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,450
even if it's his family.

66
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,610
Counterfeit coins

67
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,180
will never appear in Shanghai again

68
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,320
and the opium will be destroyed secretly.

69
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,150
I know it's not enough, but...

70
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,840
But what we did

71
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,700
was

72
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,540
not in vain.

73
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,800
Many think I'm in a high position,

74
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,740
so I'm omnipotent.

75
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,910
But actually...

76
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,410
I'm helpless with many things.

77
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,350
As Mr. Qichao said,

78
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:38,390
"The flames of passion can't be extinguished."

79
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:42,010
Let's take it step by step.

80
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,860
Even Sun Yat-sen had to compromise a lot

81
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,570
at the start of his revolution,

82
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:47,640
let alone us.

83
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,760
I can compromise and tolerate.

84
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:51,840
But I don't want

85
00:06:52,909 --> 00:06:54,260
to become like Lin Qiaosong

86
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,280
where it's a habit.

87
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:55,880
You won't.

88
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,250
You're different.

89
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,680
He was once passionate

90
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,830
with ambitions and ideals...

91
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:00,950
I said, you won't!

92
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:18,990
Trust me.

93
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:20,820
Let's move on

94
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,990
and look forward,

95
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:22,860
okay?

96
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:25,920
As long as we don't give up,

97
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,440
we can change everything.

98
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,040
We...

99
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:31,390
We have to carry this burden

100
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,750
so that the ones we love,

101
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,220
the next generation,

102
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,490
and the next

103
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,170
can truly have

104
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:40,300
better lives.

105
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:44,890
Look at me.

106
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:48,370
Trust me.

107
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,750
Don't forget your roots.

108
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,920
I won't.

109
00:07:54,659 --> 00:07:56,520
Now repeat your original belief.

110
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:57,280
Serve the country.

111
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,080
Again.

112
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,250
Serve the country!

113
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,360
Serve the country!

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,350
Embed this in your bones

115
00:08:02,510 --> 00:08:03,610
and your blood.

116
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:04,830
If you let me down,

117
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,480
I'll kick you out myself.

118
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,000
Yes.

119
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,600
Remember.

120
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,240
Yes.

121
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,310
From now on,

122
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:22,760
Wei Ruolai

123
00:08:23,570 --> 00:08:25,120
will be my last apprentice.

124
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,880
I'm his teacher

125
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,480
and political guarantor.

126
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,480
I'll remember it.

127
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,610
I'll try my best

128
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:33,250
and not let you down.

129
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:35,240
Okay.

130
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:12,720
Thank you.

Don't worry.

148

Biao.

149
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:05,410
Open it.

150
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:09,390
You may leave.

151
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:09,910
Okay.

152
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:18,730
Go in.

153
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,630
He's inside.

154
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:20,850
Sit.

155
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,250
Here.

156
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,060
Sorry it's shabby.

157
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:02,900
Don't cry.

158
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:06,360
I'm fine.

159
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,100
I can go out in a few years.

160
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:10,650
A few years?

161
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,270
How many years do you have to spare?

162
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,390
You risk your life for them.

163
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,510
But they make you

164
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,550
take the blame alone.

165
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,240
They're inhumane!

166
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,370
A bunch of beasts!

167
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,230
Don't be like this.

168
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:33,500
You don't understand.

169
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,810
Only when you take the blame

170
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,210
are you one of them.

171
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,460
When I get out, I'll be important to them.

172
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,720
Really.

173
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:45,190
Do you really

174
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,400
think that?

175
00:14:47,150 --> 00:14:48,080
Ridiculous!

176
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,270
Is this

177
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:59,110
for me?

178
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,030
Let me see.

179
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:13,910
Sit down.

180
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,990
Drink the soup while it's hot.

181
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,320
Don't just hold it.

182
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,650
Drink it while it's hot.

183
00:15:48,430 --> 00:15:49,240
Maybe...

184
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,670
Don't wait for me.

185
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,400
Marry a dependable man.

186
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,000
Don't go for those

187
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:05,720
who use guns.

188
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:09,150
Pointless.

189
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,840
Dumping me again?

190
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,910
Listen up.

191
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,320
Impossible.

192
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,620
You promised me

193
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,660
my name will be on your tombstone.

194
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:26,550
I...

195
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,150
I was joking.

196
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:29,890
I'm Lin Qiaosong's wife.

197
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:32,000
You promised me!

198
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:36,030
There are only two things in my life.

199
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,000
First,

200
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,940
to find my brother.

201
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:40,910
Second,

202
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
to marry you.

203
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,600
It's just a few years.

204
00:16:54,150 --> 00:16:54,910
I'll wait.

205
00:16:55,910 --> 00:16:58,120
We'll be good when you get out.

206
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:15,910
You're such a fool.

207
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:21,490
I don't deserve it.

208
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:24,900
I don't deserve it.

209
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,840
Hello, sir.

210
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,520
Okay, wait a moment.

211
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,630
Hello, I need to deposit this.

212
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,320
Okay.

213
00:18:14,610 --> 00:18:15,120
Hold on.

214
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,150
Please sign your name here and here.

215
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,620
[Cheng Changfeng]

216
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,390
Get off.

217
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,410
Get off!

218
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:04,880
Hurry!

219
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,670
I heard someone paid a lot to bail us out.

220
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,080
It's you?

221
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,360
Sorry, Hao.

222
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:31,060
Our brothers lost their lives

223
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,600
and status.

224
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,880
As long as we're alive, there's hope.

225
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:40,960
It's lucky that a few of us

226
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,130
are still alive.

227
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,040
It's not your fault.

228
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,300
Blame feudalism poisoning minds.

229
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:49,380
I finally understand why

230
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,910
people in your hometown

231
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,040
risked it all

232
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,780
to join the Red Army.

233
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:13,990
Here,

234
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,250
I promise

235
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,320
the Investigation and Arrest Unit is clean.

236
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,480
The police work hard

237
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,050
to protect the citizens.

238
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,760
Except for Captain Lin,

239
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,310
the rest are criminals who made counterfeit coins.

240
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,230
Kill them all!

241
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,990
As carters, they distributed counterfeit coins

242
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:31,710
everywhere.

243
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:47,350
Miss Shen?

244
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:49,570
You're back.

245
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:51,430
Why are you here?

246
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,440
When did you come?

247
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:53,670
Just now.

248
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,180
Have a bowl too.

249
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:57,710
Okay.

250
00:20:59,150 --> 00:20:59,800
Boss,

251
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,620
another bowl of wontons.

252
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,540
Why?

253
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:10,150
Do you still feel bad?

254
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:13,630
It's okay.

255
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,240
It'll only get worse.

256
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:16,450
Just get used to it.

257
00:21:24,230 --> 00:21:24,990
What is this?

258
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:26,940
A medical book.

259
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:28,230
A medical book?

260
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:29,880
I think

261
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,360
you're in urgent need of it.

262
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:41,790
[The Capital]

263
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:50,350
You're feeling pain and frustrated

264
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,900
because our country has gotten sick.

265
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:54,990
This book is the cure.

266
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,770
Whenever I meet a difficulty,

267
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,760
and feel a bit disappointed with what I'm dealing with,

268
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,220
I would open it and read it.

269
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,280
You can give it a try.

270
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,570
Ask me if you have any questions.

271
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,590
But don't tell my brother about it.

272
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,450
Why are you folding these?

273
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,930
So many people died in the mint that produced counterfeit coins.

274
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:40,130
We should at least do something, right?

275
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,990
Though we can't give them real money,

276
00:22:41,990 --> 00:22:43,990
we should make a gesture of good will

277
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,410
by offering joss paper.

278
00:23:06,290 --> 00:23:09,090
Any progress in your relationship with Miss Shen?

279
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,840
We're not in a relationship.

280
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,970
We're just friends.

281
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:13,670
Aren't you gonna marry her?

282
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:15,360
She's just a friend. Didn't I just tell you?

283
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,560
Why would I marry her?

284
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,050
In that case,

285
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,340
why don't you go home with me?

286
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:23,320
Are you leaving for home?

287
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,920
We're both leaving for home.

288
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:28,020
Your father misses you so much.

289
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,300
He always talks about you.

290
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,360
I've gotten an earful of his nagging.

291
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,160
You can go back if you want to.

292
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,280
I have something to do in Shanghai.

293
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,340
It's too dangerous here in Shanghai.

294
00:23:36,430 --> 00:23:38,120
I've only been here for a few days,

295
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,720
yet I've seen exploded cars,

296
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,680
and gunfights in a factory.

297
00:23:42,950 --> 00:23:45,150
You'll die if you stay here!

298
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,140
But I'd love to stay.

299
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:53,080
Doggie, you have a heart of gold,

300
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:55,360
but a life in a metropolitan isn't suited to you.

301
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,420
Is it suited to you?

302
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,280
Neither to me.

303
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,670
I used to think of Shanghai as a good place

304
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:03,510
for its wealth and lower population.

305
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:06,370
But the longer I stay here, the more frightened I am.

306
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,770
Frightened about what?

307
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,080
Think about it.

308
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,210
How did the rickshaw pullers die that day?

309
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,150
Why would they die?

310
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,420
It's written on newspapers

311
00:24:22,090 --> 00:24:23,560
that they were criminals.

312
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:27,810
You were a witness that day, right?

313
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,070
So many prominent figures were present,

314
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:31,840
but they all kept silent.

315
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,080
Doggie,

316
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,990
you see, this is a place

317
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:37,220
where people in every social class

318
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,770
brazenly tell obvious lies!

319
00:24:40,390 --> 00:24:41,840
It's really scary.

320
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:49,830
Though our hometown is poor,

321
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:51,760
the people are kind,

322
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:54,480
and we can lead a peaceful life.

323
00:24:55,650 --> 00:24:58,380
Actually, the idea that your life could be at risk

324
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:02,210
doesn't dread me as much as the thought that you might

325
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,490
gradually become one of those people.

326
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:09,600
I won't.

327
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:12,920
What's holding you back, your job?

328
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,910
It took me so much effort to get hired by the Central Bank.

329
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,640
I've just earned a place there.

330
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:19,360
If I go back to our hometown,

331
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,190
what am I gonna do?

332
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,480
There's a bank there too.

333
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,340
It belongs to the Communist Party.

334
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,780
What's wrong about that?

335
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:26,120
You have a problem with it or what?

336
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,800
Have they made counterfeit coins,

337
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,630
dealt opium,

338
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,000
or harmed the innocent?

339
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,850
Do you know how many people in our village

340
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,670
have joined the Red Army?

341
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,600
Stop it.

342
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,830
I'm not going back home.

343
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,530
You just don't want to part with Miss Shen.

344
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,990
Can't you stop this?

345
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,950
Don't interfere with my personal life anymore.

346
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:47,550
Just mind your own business.

347
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,600
Tell me if you've decided when to go home.

348
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,560
I'll buy you a train ticket.

349
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,220
I'm not leaving if you aren't!

350
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:58,730
[The Capital]

351
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:55,570
Capital has only one purpose,

352
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,430
and that is to add value to itself,

353
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,840
and to create surplus value.

354
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:02,540
By making use of its constant element,

355
00:27:03,070 --> 00:27:04,870
namely the means of production,

356
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,850
capital absorbs as much surplus labor as possible.

357
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:09,840
Capital is dead labor,

358
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,120
like a vampire.

359
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:15,550
Its life relies on the absorption of living labor.

360
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:18,310
The more living labor it takes in,

361
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,840
the more vigorous it becomes.

362
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:25,050
Mind your posture.

363
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,650
Stand tall with your feet comfortably shoulder-width apart.

364
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:34,190
Hold the gun with the space between your thumb and index finger facing forward and pressing tight to the grip panel.

365
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:38,520
Put the first knuckle of your index finger to the trigger. Align the rear sight and the forward sight with your target.

366
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:39,280
Aim.

367
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:41,320
Shoot!

368
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,340
That's a strong kick.

369
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:48,730
It's okay. You'll get used to it.

370
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:49,980
Come on.

371
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,640
Relax. Repeat what you just did.

372
00:27:56,250 --> 00:27:58,250
Shift your weight to the lower body.

373
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,650
Eyes forward.

374
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Keep your breathing steady.

375
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,170
Align the rear sight and the forward sight with your target.

376
00:28:05,170 --> 00:28:05,820
Aim.

377
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,450
Aim at your target.

00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,060
Okay.

00:28:13,950 --> 00:28:14,600
Shoot!

00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,460
I'm sorry.

381
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:17,370
I'm sorry.

382
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:18,170
No worries.

383
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:20,430
Think of it

384
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:22,880
as your enemy.

385
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,600
Get set.

386
00:28:30,550 --> 00:28:31,210
Shoot!

387
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:41,040
Very good!

388
00:29:11,930 --> 00:29:13,240
I've read the book

389
00:29:13,430 --> 00:29:14,540
you gave me.

390
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,470
What do you think?

391
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,640
Do you not understand what it says,

392
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:27,470
or

393
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:28,840
is there a problem?

394
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,920
I do understand what it says.

395
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,980
But I guess I'm still clinging to one last shred of hope.

396
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,070
Hope?

397
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,280
Mr. Sun Yat-sen cared about the country and the people.

398
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,410
He spared no effort to save the country

399
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:46,170
till his last breath.

400
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,400
A few days ago,

401
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,230
you were involved in an incident.

402
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:55,530
Can't it prove

403
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:57,470
the cause you and my brother persevere in

404
00:29:57,470 --> 00:29:58,470
to be ridiculous?

405
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:01,800
You expect to make a difference.

406
00:30:02,430 --> 00:30:03,520
But in the end,

407
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,520
nothing will be changed

408
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:07,370
except for your own lives.

409
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:10,290
Can you and your fellows do

410
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:11,820
what Kuomintang can't?

411
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:14,840
I believe

412
00:30:15,190 --> 00:30:16,190
we can.

413
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,260
I'll spend my lifetime, limited though it is, to prove that true.

414
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,910
Even at the cost of your own life?

415
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:21,640
Yes.

416
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,780
Just like your older brother.

417
00:30:28,430 --> 00:30:30,710
I became a communist in Germany.

418
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:34,880
When I came back to Shanghai, I joined the organization.

419
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,630
At first,

420
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:38,630
I didn't know what a revolution means.

421
00:30:38,630 --> 00:30:40,690
What I liked was taking action alone.

422
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,990
But one thing changed my mind.

423
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,710
A mission was assigned to me.

424
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:47,610
As usual,

425
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:51,010
I did it alone and everything was fine.

426
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,700
But when I was retreating,

427
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:55,470
the enemy's backup force suddenly appeared,

428
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,000
and attempted to ambush me.

429
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,760
A comrade provided me with timely support,

430
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,700
but he ended up dead there.

431
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:09,050
We were basically strangers.

432
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:12,580
I didn't even know his name.

433
00:31:13,730 --> 00:31:15,660
But when there's imminent danger,

434
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,930
he didn't hesitate to

435
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,690
protect me, a total stranger.

436
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,910
He forsook his life

437
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,280
in exchange for mine.

438
00:31:28,150 --> 00:31:30,480
This sad memory haunted me for a long time.

439
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
I didn't have the courage to face it.

440
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,610
I thought I owed him my life,

441
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,990
and was indebted to his family.

442
00:31:44,530 --> 00:31:45,480
Later on,

443
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:48,840
I gradually understood

444
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:52,760
that all of us

445
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,760
shared the same name.

446
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,080
That is, "comrade."

447
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,630
We share a home,

448
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,540
and that's the organization.

449
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,510
We have common aspirations.

450
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:09,040
To reach our goals,

451
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:11,160
we'd make joint efforts,

452
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,920
stand in solidarity,

453
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:16,120
and put absolute trust in each other.

454
00:32:20,990 --> 00:32:21,950
Since then,

455
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,860
every time I work on a mission,

456
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:28,510
I would always prepare myself for death.

457
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,850
I've near feared it,

458
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,080
because I know

459
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:35,430
though I might cease to be,

460
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:38,200
I wouldn't be a lonely soul,

461
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,080
as I'm backed

462
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,740
by tens of thousands of comrades.

463
00:32:44,670 --> 00:32:46,950
They'll walk steadfastly toward

464
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:49,440
towards our shared vision.

465
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:51,720
We firmly believe

466
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,990
that this country

467
00:32:54,670 --> 00:32:58,200
will rise to glory under the leadership of the Communist Party.

468
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,280
We firmly believe

469
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,800
that our next generation, and its following generations,

470
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,780
will live in a world of happiness, wealth,

471
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,160
and prosperity.

472
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,260
A world where every child receives education,

473
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:14,740
and where lower classes can escape the freezing cold.

474
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,820
A world where everyone is equal,

475
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,130
and everyone has food.

476
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:22,650
Farmers will no longer pay all kinds of exorbitant taxes,

477
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,110
and workers can produce

478
00:33:25,130 --> 00:33:27,590
products that could be marketed worldwide.

479
00:33:27,730 --> 00:33:30,570
We can hear Chinese in every corner of the world,

480
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:32,400
and the Westerners' will no longer look at us

481
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,860
with disdain and mockery,

482
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,080
but admiration and respect.

483
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:40,060
This has always been Mr. Shen's dream too.

484
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,290
Dreams

485
00:33:47,030 --> 00:33:49,090
have to be achieved through efforts,

486
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,520
and not just

487
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,250
plain talk.

488
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:13,909
[January 20, 1932]

489
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:16,650
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

490
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,699
[The Japanese authorities, in an attempt to divert the international community's opinion over their invasion of Northeastern China, launched the Mukden Incident.]

491
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,699
[At the same time, they were plotting to invade Shanghai, and instructed Japanese expatriates to stir up trouble, pushing the situation into the verge of war.]

492
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,719
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

493
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,030
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

494
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,840
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

495
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:25,199
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

496
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,449
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

497
00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:29,850
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

498
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:32,730
[Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately]

499
00:34:29,850 --> 00:34:31,510
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

500
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,159
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

501
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,420
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

502
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,800
Disband the anti-Japanese groups immediately!

503
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,469
Punish the anti-Japanese murderers!

504
00:34:40,469 --> 00:34:43,389
Boycott Japanese goods!

505
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,739
[Boycott Japanese goods]

506
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,490
Little Japanese runts!

507
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:26,760
Tunan.

508
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:27,760
Chief Deng.

509
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:29,720
You came from Nanjing overnight?

510
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:31,870
The situation is critical. We can't delay it any further.

511
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,710
What's Central Bank's attitude towards Japan's provocations?

512
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:36,510
-Let’s talk in my office.
-Okay.

513
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,160
A bunch of bureaucrats,

514
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:47,740
who were sure that the Japanese won't start fighting in Shanghai,

515
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,840
decided to accept their conditions in its entirety.

516
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,610
Isn't this humiliating to our country?

517
00:36:51,610 --> 00:36:53,280
Given the Mukden Incident previously,

518
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,520
the state's reaction is not surprising at all.

519
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,030
This time, Japan started the

520
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:58,640
January 28 incident in Shanghai,

521
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,190
with the purpose of causing friction in order to start a war.

522
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:01,230
Conditions?

523
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,820
These are just for show.

524
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:03,780
Look at Nanjing.

525
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:06,220
Instead of spending their time preparing for war,

526
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,880
they are arguing over how to avoid it.

527
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:09,210
Isn't that ridiculous?

528
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:11,050
Sir, you might have argued your case at the meeting.

529
00:37:11,050 --> 00:37:12,360
But those officials from the Ministry of National Defense

530
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,500
isn't listening at all.

531
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,820
They said Central Bank deals with finance,

532
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:16,520
and is an outsider when it comes to war.

533
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,190
They told us not to interfere with their decision.

534
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:19,710
If they were willing to listen,

535
00:37:19,710 --> 00:37:21,200
they wouldn't have lost Northeast China.

536
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,160
Even the officials of the Southern Song dynasty think about invading the North every day,

537
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,250
But look at them.

538
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,280
Chief Deng.

539
00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:28,290
Given the current situation,

540
00:37:28,570 --> 00:37:30,000
I suggest we

541
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,770
organize all of Central Bank's

542
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,210
files and documents immediately.

543
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,540
If the war really comes,

544
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:36,030
and we have to move to the French Concession,

545
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,550
we can at least maintain some basic operations.

546
00:37:37,550 --> 00:37:38,950
Okay, don't worry.

547
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,150
I’ll coordinate.

548
00:37:40,150 --> 00:37:41,210
-Thank you.
-Okay.

549
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,480
Sir, have some water.

550
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:54,590
Ruolai.

551
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:56,300
Your family is in Zhabei.

552
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:58,350
That's where the 19th Army is stationed.

553
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:00,030
It's also close to the Japanese Concession.

554
00:38:00,030 --> 00:38:00,880
If we start fighting,

555
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,680
Zhabei will be the first to suffer.

556
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,030
Rent a place in the concession as soon as possible.

557
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:04,740
It's safer.

558
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,650
Okay.

559
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:09,330
Get out of the way!

560
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,030
Hang in there!

561
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:22,610
Take him away!

562
00:38:24,110 --> 00:38:24,800
Be careful.

563
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:25,520
Be careful.

564
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:26,320
Go get the next one.

565
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,470
Wen, what happened?

566
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,920
We got into a fight with a bunch of Japanese on the street.

567
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,810
There were many of them.

568
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,450
The police were even helping them.

569
00:38:32,450 --> 00:38:33,470
A bunch of officers

570
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,270
have less guts than a car driver.

571
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,480
Ms. Zhou, give me that.

572
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,590
You do it slowly.

573
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:39,230
Gauze.

574
00:38:39,250 --> 00:38:39,890
Ms. Zhou.

575
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,920
He broke his arm. Your medicine won't work.

576
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,990
This medicine is very expensive.

577
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:43,840
It's very useful.

578
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:44,490
Ms. Zhou.

579
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:45,960
Slow down.

580
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,670
Ms. Zhou, this is for hemorrhoids.

581
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:49,880
I'm sorry.

582
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,070
It's a mistake.

583
00:38:51,090 --> 00:38:52,410
Wait. Wait.

584
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:55,760
Wei.

585
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:57,720
Hang in there.

586
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,080
You're surrounded by big shots.

587
00:39:00,110 --> 00:39:01,550
You're well-informed.

588
00:39:01,550 --> 00:39:02,650
tell me.

589
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,160
Will the short-lived Japanese still come?

590
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:06,700
Of course.

591
00:39:08,630 --> 00:39:09,780
Although the government had accepted

592
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,290
the Japanese's conditions in their entirety,

593
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,290
I am guessing that

594
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,880
the Japanese will still fight.

595
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,830
What should we do?

596
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,820
Damn it!

597
00:39:15,850 --> 00:39:16,920
If the Japanese are to attack,

598
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,600
what will happen to my house?

599
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:20,490
Everyone should hide for a while.

600
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:22,460
Don't go out if you can.

601
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:23,490
If you can,

602
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,530
you'd better hide out in the Concession.

603
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,350
Concession?

604
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:28,440
It's expensive in the Concession.

605
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:29,300
Exactly.

606
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,410
How can we afford it?

607
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:31,130
Right?

608
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,770
Are you kidding me?

609
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,180
So what can the people do?

610
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,580
The officials in Nanjing

611
00:39:35,650 --> 00:39:37,160
only know how to cheat the people's money

612
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,070
and brag.

613
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:40,600
But at the critical moment, they are completely useless.

614
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,110
Return us our money if you don't want to fight.

615
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,570
Give me back all the money!

616
00:39:44,190 --> 00:39:45,670
Another war is coming.

617
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:49,080
People will be dying again.

618
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:54,780
The country may be destroyed, but mountains stand tall and rivers continue to flow.

619
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:56,880
It's spring, but people are few.

620
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,450
A somber feeling...

621
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:00,100
A somber feeling...

622
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:02,950
My tears fall for our country as a somber feeling fills my heart.

623
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:05,280
The birds are chirping, but I feel scared.

624
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:07,080
Recite it again.

625
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:09,020
But I've memorized it.

626
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,620
I want you to recite it again.

627
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:14,060
Okay.

628
00:40:14,890 --> 00:40:17,100
The country may be destroyed, but mountains stand tall and rivers continue to flow.

629
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,270
Louder!

630
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,030
The country may be destroyed, but mountains stand tall and rivers continue to flow.

631
00:40:21,030 --> 00:40:23,250
It's spring, but people are few.

632
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:26,000
My tears fall for our country as a somber feeling fills my heart.

633
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,330
The birds are chirping, but I feel scared.

634
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,110
This battle

635
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:44,280
is inevitable.

636
00:40:46,070 --> 00:40:48,990
Today is the last day to respond to the Japanese's threats.

637
00:40:48,990 --> 00:40:51,880
The city government has agreed to all of the Japanese's demands.

638
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,910
But we don't know

639
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,610
how the Japanese will respond.

640
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,190
The Mayor is such a kind person.

641
00:40:58,670 --> 00:41:00,920
I didn't expect him to personally apologize to the Japanese,

642
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,240
ceased all rescue activities,

643
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:03,570
and did not boycott Japanese products.

644
00:41:03,570 --> 00:41:04,570
In that case,

645
00:41:04,590 --> 00:41:07,720
will the entire Shanghai be required to speak Japanese?

646
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,840
It’s from Zhabei.

647
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:22,540
Niu Chunmiao! Niu Chunmiao!

648
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:28,310
Fire!

649
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:28,940
Ms. Zhou!

650
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,510
Fire! Fire!

651
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:35,250
Fire! Fire!

652
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:41,670
Fire! Fire!

653
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:44,590
Let's go!

654
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,280
Get out.

655
00:41:57,430 --> 00:41:58,200
Ms. Zhou!

656
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,350
My baby's gone.

657
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,510
It's all burnt out.

658
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,190
Where is your husband?

659
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,850
It's all burnt out.

660
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:26,980
Put out the fire!

661
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:29,520
Fire! Put out the fire!
