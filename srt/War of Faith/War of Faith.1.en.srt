201
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,900

Let's go to my car.

This is the fourth time someone has tried to kill me.

210

That means

211
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,700
they're desperate now.

212
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,190

Why must we fight every day?

216
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,890
The business world is like a battlefield.

217
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:22,110
Government banks are advancing

218
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:23,490
and the private bank are retreating.

219
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,700

Sacrifices are inevitable.

228
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,460
It depends on

379
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:03,970
Ouch.

380
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:04,580
Hurry.

381

I'll treat you to something delicious, okay?

383
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:11,980
Sorry, I really have something urgent to do.

Sir, to the Great World.

387
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,010
What's so urgent?

388
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,380
Stop.

389
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:18,470

393

Doesn't matter. Get down!

394
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,860
Get down?

395
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,590
No, don't go.

396
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,770
I told you to come down, so you gotta come down.

Do you know who I am?

401
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,390
Who are you?

402
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,580
No matter who are you, you have to get down here.

403
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,510
What do you want?

404
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:37,480
What are you doing?

405
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,040
Don't come over.

406
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:39,740

407

425
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:30,900
What silver?

426
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,140
You don't want to leave?

427
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,700
Hurry up. The show is about to start.

428
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,700
We're going to be late.

429
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,140
Get on.

00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,780
You don't want to leave?

Okay.

We are from the same hometown.

437
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,140
Why did you help me?

438
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,260
Don't get me wrong.

439
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,420
I wasn't trying to help you.

440
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:04,780
I just wanted to save myself.

441
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,580
If they really wanted to catch you,

the people in your carriage

443
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,080
wouldn't be able to get away either.

444
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:10,580
If I got caught by that kind of person,

445
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:13,180
I'd suffer greatly even if they didn't kill me.

446
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,940
Right.

447
00:24:16,740 --> 00:24:17,210
Then,

448
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,240
why did they want to catch you?

449
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,730
If I said it's a misunderstanding,

450
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:22,930
would you believe me?

451
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,810
It doesn't matter whether I believe you or not.

452
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,530
We just met by chance.

453
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:29,320
We won't see each other again.

454
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:30,950
Take care.

455
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,400
Stop the carriage.

456
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:34,570
Okay.

457
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,040
Okay, thank you.

458

00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,660

-Hello?
-Mr. Liu.

462
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:51,890
Mr. Shen,

463
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:53,940
the Imperial Bank's price has come down.

464
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,940

467
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,910
I sent you to Shanghai this time

468
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,460
for the great cause of financial unification.

469
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:16,920
Shanghai's financial field is complicated

470
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,230
and varied.

471
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:20,660
Some banks take advantage of their foreign investments

472
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,730
and act greedily.

473
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:25,490
They only obey the government on the surface.

474
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,430
We must

475
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:28,080
give them a head-on blow.

476
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,150
Don't be soft-hearted.

477
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,490
In addition,

478
00:25:31,490 --> 00:25:33,600
the Central Bank can coexist and mutually benefit

479
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,270
with private banks that are willing to cooperate sincerely.

00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:51,020
Wei, you're up?

567
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:59,370
♫Hustling for a living is no big deal♫

568
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:51,699
You need to count the suit and pants separately.

569
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:52,580
Don't mess it up.

570
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:53,179
All of you,

571
00:34:53,179 --> 00:34:54,780
listen up.

572
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:56,420
If you can't pay the rent

573
00:34:56,739 --> 00:34:58,580
or can't keep the floor clean, I'll deduct your pay.

574
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,580
Do you hear me?

575
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:01,100
Dammit!

576
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:03,020
Where's Ling?

577
00:35:02,330 --> 00:35:04,110
♫Wei Ruolai♫

578
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,220
Ling!

579
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,250
Ling!

580
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:08,920
♫Life is but a dream♫

581
00:35:07,420 --> 00:35:09,180
Send Mr. Wang's suit over quickly.

582
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:10,210
I'll go there after I'm done drying these.

583
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:11,380
♫I, Wei Ruolai♫

584
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,300
Do it now.

585
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,500
Okay.

586
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:20,610
♫Life is but a dream♫

587
00:35:14,660 --> 00:35:15,490
Listen carefully.

588
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:16,340
The pants and suits

589
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,420
must be folded separately

590
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,100
and counted separately

591
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,060
or else you'll get it wrong.

592
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,740
Okay?

593
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,290
Ms. Zhou.

594
00:36:26,090 --> 00:36:26,930
Ms. Zhou,

595
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:29,090
I will pay you back the money you lost.

596
00:36:29,090 --> 00:36:30,090
Please give me a few more days.

597
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,220
I'm going to the Central Bank for an interview right now.

598
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,360
Let's not talk about

599
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,910
yesterday anymore.

600
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,890
I'm just not fated to get rich.

601
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:43,290
You just made a suggestion.

602
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,860
You didn't force me to buy anything,

603
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,490
right?

604
00:36:46,810 --> 00:36:47,420
Well,

605
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,540
when you get money later,

606
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:51,410
I'll definitely help you make a comeback.

607
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:52,020
I gotta go.

608
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:52,850
Wait.

609
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,010
Wait a minute.

610
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,330
Take off your bag.

611
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:57,700
Take it off.

612
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:02,500
Hurry.

613
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,780
Put on this coat.

614
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,460
You

615
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,420
don't need to make big promises for me.

616
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:09,620
There won't be a next time.

617
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:11,950
This time already scared me out of my wits.

618
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,420
Good.

619
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:22,420
Wei,

620
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,720
aren't you going to the Central Bank for an interview?

621
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,480
Shouldn't you dress up?

622
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,420
Don't let them laugh at you,

623
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,310
understand?

624
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:35,940
Go ahead.

625
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,570
I'm leaving.

626
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,810
Wei!

627
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:44,500
Wei,

628
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,500
if you really do become successful,

629
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,150
don't forget how well I treated you.

630
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:47,790
Ms. Zhou,

631
00:37:47,810 --> 00:37:49,530
if you want to treat Wei well, you have to do it now.

632
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:50,500
Otherwise, when Wei gets rich,

633
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,660
he'll be out of your league.

634
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,340
I dare you to keep talking.

635
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:54,470
I'm sorry, Ms. Zhou.

636
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,850
Wei.

637
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:57,110
Get in. I'll give you a ride.

638
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,290
No, you don't have to.

639
00:37:58,290 --> 00:37:59,180
I'll give you a ride.

640
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,780
Don't waste your time. You don't have to.

641
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:01,900
You can't be late.

642
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:03,260
Today is such an important day.

643
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
I run fast.

644
00:38:05,300 --> 00:38:06,060
Sit tight.

645
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,800
-Wei is going to work in the bank!
-Bye, Ms. Zhou.

646
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:13,480
Excuse me.

647
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,630
If you really do become successful,

648
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,190
don't forget us.

649
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,410
He's going to work in the Central Bank!

650
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:07,250
Good morning, sir.

651
00:39:09,270 --> 00:39:09,910
Sir,

652
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,160
the exam room has been arranged

653
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:12,690
according to your request.

654
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:16,530
Wait, Wei.

655
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:18,460
I passed by Jing'an Temple yesterday

656
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,700
and got you a peace talisman.

657
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,160
It'll bring you good luck.

658
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:22,020
Thank you, Wen.

659
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,580
Go back to work.

660
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,310
You go ahead.

661
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:33,160
[The Central Bank of China]

662
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,180
Mr. Wang.

663
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,920
Mr. Li.

664
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:17,860
Oh my god.

665
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:20,290
Look at the current situation of the domestic economy.

666
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,930
My dad forced me to come here.

667
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:24,620
Your family runs a bank.

668
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,920
What's the point of you coming here?

669
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:29,190
We can't put all the eggs in one basket.

670
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:30,700
The Central Bank has big plans recently.

671
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,700
Make way, please.

672
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:33,060
Make way, everyone.

673
00:40:33,060 --> 00:40:34,500
Excuse me.

674
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:36,990
Young Master.

675
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:43,740
Young Master,

676
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:45,540
why didn't you ask your parents to give them a statement?

677
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:46,090
Back then,

678
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:48,670
he was promoted the one who promoted the Central Bank's director.

679
00:40:48,670 --> 00:40:49,940
Why bother doing this?

680
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,400
It's just a formality.

681
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,520
Don't worry.

682
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:56,200
I can pass even if I hand in a blank piece of paper.

683
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,790
Candidates, listen to me.

684
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,470
Since there are more candidates today,

685
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:02,580
we decided

686
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,220
to change the exam venue now.

687
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:07,830
Please wear your number badge

688
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:10,860
and follow me to the new exam hall in an orderly manner.

689
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,060
Let's go.

690
00:41:17,340 --> 00:41:18,130
Tunan,

691
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:20,020
why didn't you

692
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,620
have the candidates take the exam

693
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:23,220
in our bank's training room?

694
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,100
They're not official employees of the Central Bank yet.

695
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:25,780
This

696
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,780
isn't a place where

697
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:28,220
just anyone can enter.

698
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,110
I'm curious.

699
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,500
Your exam this time

700
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,200
is different from before.

701
00:41:38,780 --> 00:41:39,620
Chief Deng,

702
00:41:40,060 --> 00:41:41,460
let me ask you a question.

703
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,190
Go ahead.

704
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,410
What kind of qualities

705
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,180
do you think

706
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,980
a competent banker should have?

707
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:52,580
Rationality.

708
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,620
Rationality?

709
00:41:54,970 --> 00:41:57,070
But rationality is hard to quantify.

710
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,340
So, I think

711
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,600
some qualities

712
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:02,830
can be quantified in action.

713
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:04,730
Then, how do we test

714
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:05,620
this action?

715
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:42,050
What's that smell?

716
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,540
Silence!

717
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,150
Everyone, be quiet.

718
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:50,680
Answer your own questions.

719
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,850
Fire!

720
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,460
Fire!

721
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,900
Run! Fire!
