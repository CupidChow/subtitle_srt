the archive where the list was stored

The culprit is not

00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:54,640
It's the wife of a high-ranking Treasury Department official.

that politics

00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:51,810

00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:40,470
Credit is the foundation of banks,

567
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,340
while the foundation of credit is people's support.

568
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:45,610
Although these banks are not big now,

569
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:47,260
as they keep growing,

570
00:27:47,530 --> 00:27:49,750
the financial war between the two parties

571
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:50,910
will intensify.

572
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:55,650
But agricultural value can't compare to industrial and commercial value.

573
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,350
But you have the tungsten ore mines.

574
00:27:57,350 --> 00:27:58,610
That's hard currency.

575
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,040
Jiangxi is rich in resources

576
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:02,920
and the water and land transportation is very advanced too.

577
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:05,800
In the long-term, it's suitable for industry and commerce.

578
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:06,950
It can be said that you chose

579
00:28:06,950 --> 00:28:08,030
a very good base.

580
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,850
Are you interested

581
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:11,630
in working in Jiangxi Soviet?

582
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,430
I...

583
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,900
After the press conference,

584
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:19,310
the Investigation and Arrest Unit was held accountable.

585
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:21,500
They'll definitely look to the Central Bank

586
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
for the leak of the transaction list.

587
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,580
Shen Tunan

588
00:28:24,610 --> 00:28:25,810
might not protect you

589
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,290
due to political pressure.

590
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,260
He won't.

591
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,180
Mr. Shen and I

592
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,620
are no longer mentor and mentee.

593
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,850
Shanghai is no longer safe for you.

594
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,110
Jiangxi Soviet

595
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,460
is your future.

596
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:49,730
After the counterfeit coins and the construction treasury bill incidents,

597
00:28:49,730 --> 00:28:50,400
I believe

598
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,140
you've seen

599
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,800
the darkness and corruption of the Kuomintang.

600
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:57,990
Working under such a political power

601
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,580
is akin to aiding the monster.

602
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,510
The Kuomintang is indeed bad.

603
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:05,860
But...

604
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:09,310
I don't know much about your party either,

605
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,500
so I can't make a decision now.

606
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,770
It's okay.

607
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,340
I'll give you time.

608
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,260
Whether you return to Jiangxi or not,

609
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,330
you can't stay in Shanghai anymore.

610
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,520
You have to leave as soon as possible.

611
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,610
Tomorrow,

612
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:27,130
I want to give this report to Mr. Shen

613
00:29:28,230 --> 00:29:29,760
as my last farewell.

614
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,190
Can you

615
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,300
do me a favor?

616
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:37,340
What is it?

617
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,810
Make us seem weaker

618
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:43,460
as if we'll go bankrupt anytime.

619
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,510
For them to underestimate you?

620
00:29:48,550 --> 00:29:49,280
Is that okay?

621
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:52,350
The revised report

622
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,830
will buy us more time to develop.

623
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,380
After all, we just started.

624
00:29:58,210 --> 00:29:59,970
Please give us a chance

625
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:02,550
and give your hometown a chance too.

626
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:05,870
Thank you.

627
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:12,250
I'll arrange for the special line to send you away as soon as possible.

628
00:30:13,410 --> 00:30:14,760
I sincerely hope

629
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,390
that we'll still have the chance

630
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,960
to fight together in the future.

631
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:24,550
How's the report I mentioned yesterday?

632
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:25,180
It's done.

633
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:26,510
Give it to Wang Shanbin

634
00:30:26,510 --> 00:30:27,380
to bring to my office.

635
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:28,380
Okay, no problem.

636
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,150
Why are you back?

637
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,070
Secretary Huang.

638
00:30:34,770 --> 00:30:35,250
This is

639
00:30:35,430 --> 00:30:36,970
the report that Mr. Shen asked me to write.

640
00:30:36,970 --> 00:30:37,670
I've completed it.

641
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,200
Please give it to him for me.

642
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,390
You're no longer an employee of the Central Bank.

643
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,090
From now on,

644
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:53,380
you will no longer be welcomed in the Central Bank either.

645
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,910
Please leave immediately.

646
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,730
Sir.

647
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:03,900
Sir.

648
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:04,850
Sir.

649
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,830
You can't enter the Central Bank if you're not an employee.

650
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,850
Which rule says that?

651
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:18,110
What is it?

652
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:27,180
Report on the workers and farmers banks in the communist region.

653
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,670
Detailed evidence.

654
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,940
What's the conclusion?

655
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,750
There's nothing to be afraid of.

656
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:34,950
Of course.

657
00:31:35,070 --> 00:31:37,060
They're just a group of people who can't afford to eat

658
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
and can't read.

659
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:40,490
Where do they get the guts to run a bank like us?

660
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:41,640
Exactly.

661
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,020
The Communist Party being weak

662
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:45,220
doesn't mean the Kuomintang is strong.

663
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,020
Wei Ruolai,

664
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:47,970
enough.

665
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:48,720
Let him talk.

666
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:52,460
Sir,

667
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,720
I don't know much about the Communist Party.

668
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,960
I don't know what step

669
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:57,510
their financial situation will reach,

670
00:31:57,510 --> 00:31:59,710
but I'm sure they won't harm the people.

671
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:02,720
They won't hold back the people who genuinely want to work

672
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,420
and they won't turn the people into enemies

673
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:05,950
for their family's benefit

674
00:32:06,290 --> 00:32:08,350
and their personal hunger for power.

675
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:11,340
So?

676
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,760
Are you joining the Communist Party?

677
00:32:18,550 --> 00:32:19,160
No,

678
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:23,090
but even more, I won't join the Kuomintang.

679
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:28,730
Even if you wanted to join,

680
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,150
who would want you?

681
00:32:30,770 --> 00:32:31,770
Secretary Huang,

682
00:32:32,710 --> 00:32:33,900
I saw many bloodstains

683
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,290
on my way here.

684
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,990
They said that the people who marched

685
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:39,940
to protest against the manipulation of the treasury bills

686
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:42,000
were violently suppressed by the police.

687
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,040
Don't you feel any guilt

688
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,800
when the police do this?

689
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:58,700
Sir,

690
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,060
you've changed.

691
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,620
In the past,

692
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:05,380
-you wouldn’t let us suppress marches.
-I would.

693
00:33:05,380 --> 00:33:07,040
They are not ordinary people.

694
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:11,570
At least, the people leading the chants are not.

695
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:14,790
They're an organized group

696
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,360
of thugs

697
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:19,030
with a plan to create turmoil for society.

698
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:19,550
Really?

699
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:20,400
They must be!

700
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,010
Otherwise, your guilt

701
00:33:27,390 --> 00:33:29,190
will defeat you sooner or later.

702
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:33,780
Ruolai,

703
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:36,200
I know you feel wronged.

704
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,230
I'm just like you,

705
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:41,030
but unlike you, I care for the big picture.

706
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,010
Yes, sir.

707
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:45,680
You endure humiliation

708
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:48,480
to negotiate with the predator.

709
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:53,830
How dare you mock Mr. Shen like this?

710
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:56,440
Who do you think you are?

711
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,650
If it weren't for Mr. Shen,

712
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,240
you would be a ruffian on the street.

713
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,480
Congyun.

714
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:01,380
Congyun.

715
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,990
Let him go.

716
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,380
There's a fire in your heart.

717
00:34:18,030 --> 00:34:19,360
Don't let the fire go out

718
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,230
and don't turn into the kind of person you hate the most.

719
00:34:32,530 --> 00:34:33,300
Move.

720
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,900
Get out of the Investigation and Arrest Unit's way.

721
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:35,550
Move.

722
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,270
Mr. Shen,

723
00:34:38,770 --> 00:34:40,699
we need your cooperation in a case.

724
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:42,989
This way, please.

725
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:44,199
Captain Lin,

726
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,949
am I a suspect

727
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:46,980
or an informant?

728
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:47,659
Is there any difference?

729
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:48,380
Yes.

730
00:34:48,699 --> 00:34:49,850
If I'm a suspect, then you need

731
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:50,710
a warrant to arrest me.

732
00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:51,620
If you don't

733
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,610
and just want me to cooperate with the investigation,

734
00:34:54,610 --> 00:34:56,199
you should ask my secretary

735
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,110
if I have time

736
00:34:57,139 --> 00:34:57,980
and if it's convenient.

737
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:58,820
Is it convenient for you now?

738
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,610
No.

739
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,460
I'm busy recently.

740
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,340
I have no time to cooperate with the investigation.

741
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,940
I'll save time and ask here.

742
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,470
Go ahead.

743
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:11,340
You were the one who conducted the investigation on the construction treasury bill.

744
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:11,900
Yes.

745
00:35:12,450 --> 00:35:14,370
The investigation results have been released, right?

746
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:15,170
All the losses

747
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:17,630
from the treasury bills were caused by a Japanese speculator.

748
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:18,970
As for what the newspapers said

749
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:19,810
about it being related

750
00:35:19,810 --> 00:35:21,130
to the Kong family or Yu Shiqing,

751
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:22,340
that's their theory.

752
00:35:22,630 --> 00:35:24,290
What does it have to do with me?

753
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,040
How did the transaction list get leaked?

754
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,370
Ask the stock exchange.

755
00:35:27,510 --> 00:35:29,220
This is the Central Bank.

756
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,100
Looks like we're unable to communicate.

757
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:32,830
Mr. Shen,

758
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,860
I'm sorry.

759
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,170
I have an order from the Garrison Command

760
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,400
to bring relevant personnel back for investigation.

761
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,000
Go!

762
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,020
The Investigation and Arrest Unit is working.

763
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:46,950
Anyone who gets in the way will die.

764
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,200
Captain Lin,

765
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,580
I did all this.

766
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:55,360
It has nothing to do with Mr. Shen.

767
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,140
You've already resigned.

768
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:56,950
This is none of your business.

769
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,750
I also got the transaction list from the stock exchange.

770
00:35:58,750 --> 00:35:59,690
I asked him to get it.

771
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:00,600
He was just the messenger.

772
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,400
I'll take full responsibility.

773
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:08,390
You two can come together.

774
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:09,580
Let's go.

775
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:10,840
Lin Qiaosong!

776
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:13,850
I did this.

777
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:15,180
I gave the transaction list

778
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,890
to Mr. Shen at the Central Bank's meeting,

779
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:17,850
but he didn't use it.

780
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,580
I also handed out the record.

781
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,350
It has nothing to do with Mr. Shen.

782
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:20,850
Wei Ruolai!

783
00:36:20,850 --> 00:36:22,110
I was the one who did it!

784
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,740
Sir,

785
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:29,510
I'm not your student anymore.

786
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,680
I will never forget

787
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:33,530
all of your kindness.

788
00:36:36,870 --> 00:36:38,040
Please take care.

789
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,000
Sir, are you alright?

790
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,440
Sir.

791
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:45,630
Are you okay, sir?

792
00:36:45,650 --> 00:36:46,210
I'm fine.

793
00:36:46,230 --> 00:36:47,430
Everyone, disperse.

794
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,380
Go back to work.

795
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:53,610
Wei Ruolai, no one can save you this time.

796
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:54,600
When you get to the execution ground,

797
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,000
I'll kill you myself.

798
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:23,850
Sir.

799
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:28,540
Sir, where are you going?

800
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
The Yu Residence.

801
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:54,370
[Shanghai Arsenal of the Military Administration Department]

802
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:50,800
Miss Shen.

803
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,110
Chunmiao?

804
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,380
What's wrong?

805
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,130
Doggie was taken by the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

806
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:58,980
When did that happen?

807
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,710
Just now.

808
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:01,070
It was led by Lin Qiaosong.

809
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:02,710
Calm down. Take your time.

810
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,320
What is this?

811
00:38:05,350 --> 00:38:06,690
This is all the money I have.

812
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,770
Your brother is a big official.

813
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:09,310
Ask him to find a way to save him.

814
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:10,980
If the money isn't enough, please cover for me

815
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:12,490
and I'll pay you back later.

816
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,610
It's not about money.

817
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:14,230
Let me ask you first.

818
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:15,430
When they left,

819
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,110
which way did they drive in?

820
00:38:17,110 --> 00:38:18,190
I don't know.

821
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:20,010
I'm not familiar with Shanghai.

822
00:38:20,630 --> 00:38:22,040
When they left,

823
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,090
did they turn right or left?

824
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:27,540
Left.

825
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:28,300
Are you sure?

826
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:31,770
Oh no.

827
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:33,180
Left...

828
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,870
That means they went straight to the execution ground.

829
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,740
You can't go in. You can't go in.

830
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:50,440
What are you doing?

831
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:51,470
I'm Shen Tunan from the Central Bank.

832
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:52,960
I have something urgent to ask Mr. Yu.

833
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:53,820
You can’t go in.

834
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:56,030
-Mr. Yu.
-Master.

835
00:38:56,070 --> 00:38:56,950
You may leave.

836
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,610
Mr. Yu.

837
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:05,150
Advisor Shen,

838
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:06,410
what brings you here today?

839
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,180
Have a seat.

840
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,140
No need.

841
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:09,760
Mr. Yu, I'll make it short.

842
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,380
Lin Qiaosong

843
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,690
came to the Central Bank

844
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:14,820
and arrested my assistant Wei Ruolai.

845
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,230
You should ask Mr. Kang about these things.

846
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,260
Why are you here?

847
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:25,950
What does it have to do with me?

848
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,480
He was arrested for leaking the transaction list.

849
00:39:33,150 --> 00:39:34,550
He's in trouble.

850
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:37,220
No one can help you about this.

851
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,500
He's going to be executed.

852
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,270
It's non-negotiable.

853
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:40,950
I know.

854
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:42,490
So I’m here today

855
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,260
to ask you, Mr. Yu.

856
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,520
Please talk to Big Sister.

857
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:50,660
It's really hard for me to help.

858
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,370
Shanghai has been a mess these days.

859
00:39:54,220 --> 00:39:56,740
Big Sister hasn't slept well for days.

860
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,230
Please call Big Sister

861
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,490
and ask her.

862
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:02,820
I will

863
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:05,770
definitely repay this favor.

864
00:40:07,750 --> 00:40:09,150
Don’t worry. Take a seat.

865
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:10,570
It's very urgent.

866
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:11,590
Please, Mr. Yu.

867
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,610
This matter

868
00:40:17,270 --> 00:40:19,750
really puts me in a difficult position.

869
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:22,420
How about this?

870
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:23,730
Wait for me.

871
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:36,960
Sir,

872
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,810
you're negotiating with the predator.

873
00:40:38,810 --> 00:40:40,120
It's a matter of life and death.

874
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:41,200
I'll do anything

875
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,290
to save Wei Ruolai.

876
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,180
If he dies, it's his own fault.

877
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:00,550
How is it, Mr. Yu?

878
00:41:00,610 --> 00:41:01,400
Tunan,

879
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,030
I just asked.

880
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:04,770
Big Sister

881
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:06,110
is still angry.

882
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:07,700
However,

883
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,180
she also said

884
00:41:09,610 --> 00:41:11,610
she's willing to make more friends.

885
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:12,770
Advisor Shen,

886
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,680
do you understand what I mean?

887
00:41:17,610 --> 00:41:18,270
Yes.

888
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,570
If Big Sister needs me in the future,

889
00:41:20,570 --> 00:41:21,570
just let me know.

890
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:22,490
Sir.

891
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:23,220
Shut up.

892
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:27,660
I accept this friendship.

893
00:41:30,190 --> 00:41:30,990
That kid

894
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:34,030
will never be able to repay this favor.

895
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:54,720
Hello?

896
00:41:55,270 --> 00:41:55,910
Hello?

897
00:41:56,660 --> 00:41:59,300
Did you arrest Wei Ruolai?

898
00:41:59,650 --> 00:42:01,620
I sent Lin Qiaosong to the Central Bank

899
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,980
to arrest Shen Tunan.

900
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,390
Arresting Wei Ruolai was a misunderstanding.

901
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,120
I've asked Big Sister already.

902
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,520
Release him now.

903
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,530
Please wait a moment. I’ll ask.

904
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,030
Mr. Yu,

905
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:24,140
there's indeed such a thing.

906
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
Wei Ruolai pleaded guilty on the spot

907
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:27,690
and was taken directly to the execution ground.

908
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,340
What?

909
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:30,830
Listen.

910
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,990
Inform them immediately.

911
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:34,190
Do not execute him.

912
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:35,020
Do you hear me?

913
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:36,350
Thanks, Mr. Yu.

914
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:38,140
I’m afraid it’s too late.

915
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:38,930
How about this?

916
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,260
I'll send someone over.

917
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:40,910
But...
