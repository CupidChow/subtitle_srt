[Episode 14]

4
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:34,650
You're beating him too much.

5
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,509
What if he didn't kill him?

6
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,930
How will we answer

7
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,390
to Shen Tunan then?

8
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,670
Of course he killed him.

9
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:44,970
He's definitely the one.

10
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,630
That doesn't matter anymore.

11
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,830
Mr. Kang wants to use Wei Ruolai as a breakthrough

12
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:51,470
to deal with Shen Tunan.

13
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,220
I'll use Wei Ruolai

14
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,220
to find clues about the Communist Party.

15
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:57,610
There is no conflict.

16
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,310
You're quite stubborn.

17
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:09,060
You've been trained, right?

18
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,710
Your brother is part of the Communist Party.

19
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:15,300
He should have taught you this before.

20
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,190
I know what you're waiting for.

21
00:03:21,070 --> 00:03:23,590
You're waiting for Shen Tunan to save you.

22
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,579
It was possible before.

23
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:30,370
But recently,

24
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:32,290
the operation in Jiangxi failed.

25
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,460
Nanjing is furious.

26
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:36,340
So no one can save a convict

27
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,200
related to the Communist Party.

28
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:43,850
I'm not part of the Communist Party.

29
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:52,390
Let’s talk.

30
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,870
Why did you assassinate Li Shengda?

31
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:59,310
I didn’t kill him.

32
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,250
Then why did you take the gun?

33
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:03,940
To protect myself.

34
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,570
You're Shen Tunan's assistant.

35
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,410
You could have applied for a gun.

36
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:11,990
I did.

37
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:14,820
He didn't approve of it.

38
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,170
That means

39
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,140
Shen Tunan knew

40
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,320
you wanted a gun.

41
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,330
Right?

42
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,730
Mr. Shen was worried

43
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,840
I would be in danger.

44
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:39,250
Shen Tunan knew your family member was in the Communist Party.

45
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,890
But instead of firing you,

46
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:42,870
he gave you a raise.

47
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:44,460
Isn't it strange?

48
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,070
Lin Qiaosong.

49
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:47,710
What do you want?

50
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,600
Calm down.

51
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,680
Calm down.

52
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:53,350
Shen Tunan's political stance

53
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,860
will be personally questioned by the higher-ups

54
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:55,890
in the future.

55
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,760
But before that,

56
00:05:59,050 --> 00:06:00,450
you have to make it clear.

57
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:02,500
To what extent was Shen Tunan

58
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,850
involved in the gold bar transfer case

59
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:07,990
this time?

60
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:11,490
He took such a big risk

61
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,340
to protect you.

62
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,680
-Was it an order from the Communist party?
-Lin Qiaosong.

63
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,560
If you want to use me to deal with Mr. Shen,

64
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,000
you can keep dreaming.

65
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:27,070
You're still too young.

66
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,920
You don't understand the definition of loyalty.

67
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:35,120
You'd give your life to someone

68
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,430
for some small act of kindness?

69
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,280
Childish.

70
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,540
You guys take it easy, too.

71
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:19,680
His statement is very important.

72
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:24,170
Okay.

73

74
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:33,970
Mr. Kang.

75
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,420
Did Wei Ruolai confess in prison?

76
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:39,290
He's tough.

77
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:40,670
He's still holding on.

78
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,490
Mr. Kang, hurry up.

79
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,320
The longer it drags, the riskier it gets.

80
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:45,650
He's just an assistant.

81
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:47,850
Shen Tunan won't protect him.

82
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,640
Even if he wants to, he can't.

83
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,290
Big Sister had already

84
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:54,670
asked Mr. Kong to pressure Mr. Song

85
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:56,220
into granting us

86
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,590
the military judiciary rights

87
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,190
to investigate this matter.

88
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:02,400
Anyone who has a good relationship with Shen Tunan

89
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,220
must be investigated.

90
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,870
This way,

91
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,540
everyone will steer clear of Shen Tunan.

92
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,830

93

96
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,250
Shen Tunan can't handle it.

97
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,990
It's a major taboo

98
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,580
to collude with the Communist Party.

99
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:24,620
No one can protect Shen Tunan this time.

100
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:25,530
He deserves it.

101
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,740
He stole my Imperial Bank

102
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,550
and took over Mr. Yu's Xingxia Bank.

103
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:30,870
We must use

104
00:08:30,890 --> 00:08:32,169

105
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,929

109
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:41,370
of Shen Tunan

110
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:46,040
and link all his doings to the Communist Party,

111
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:48,800
how will they handle the tariff reform?

112
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:51,170
They can't proceed with it anymore.

113
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:53,100
They will have to cease the reform.

114
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,010
Not only that,

115
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:57,540
his years of hard work and the Central Bank

116
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,900
will all be for nothing.

117

and prove that he colluded with the Communist Party.

127

the young man who gave you a blood transfusion

147
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,470
should come for a check-up too.

00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,250
Listen up, everyone.

193
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,870
We are ordered by the higher-ups

194
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:37,330
to close down the Central Bank.

195
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,390
No one is allowed to enter or leave without permission.

196
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,760
Hurry up.

197
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,030
Line up.

198
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,180
What are you doing?

199
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,320
He's here.

200
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,750
You, come in.

201
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:01,230
Line up.

202
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,740
Be quiet.

203
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:09,900
Chief Deng.

204
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,610
It's all part of the procedure.

205
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,610
This way, please.

206
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,900
He's just an assistant.

207
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,070
Did you have to do this?

208
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,050
You even set up an investigation team

209
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:20,450
to disrupt the Central Bank's operations.

210
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,980
I'm sorry. It's the order of the higher-ups.

211
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,630
Brother Tunan, don't blame me.

212
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,960
After all, the Central Bank is the keystone

213
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,000
of Chairman Chiang's financial strategy.

214
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,720
There must be no mistake.

215
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:32,860
Yes.

216
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:33,760
But Mr. Kang,

217
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,490
you're too efficient.

218
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,540
In two days, you set up an investigation team and took over my bank.

219
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,540
I have a question.

220
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,210
Who exactly is this

221
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,020
higher-up of yours?

222
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,390
No need to fish for answers.

223
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,440
In politics, there's no shame in

224
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:51,420
praising the high and trampling the low.

225
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,210
I forgot.

226
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:54,250
From now on,

227
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,350
you will be suspended.

228
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,250
You can

229
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,070
spend the Spring Festival with your family.

230
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:01,510
Alright.

231
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,760
I'll excuse myself now.

232
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,430
See you, Chief Kang.

233
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:08,920
Okay.

234
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,330
Thank you.

235
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,310
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

236
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,850
Mr. Xu.

237
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:02,420
Happy New Year.

238
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:03,280
Happy New Year.

239
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,860
Why aren't you resting during the Spring Festival?

240
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:05,820
You work so hard.

241
00:14:06,350 --> 00:14:07,510
I gave my employees a break.

242
00:14:07,510 --> 00:14:08,170
I'm on duty.

243
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:08,860
It's the Spring Festival,

244
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,370
so I brought you something.

245
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:10,950
Okay.

246
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,830
Steamed cakes.

247
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:12,710
Great!

248
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,020
Okay, thank you.

249
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:15,150
Also,

250
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,930
my friend brought me some special medicine

251
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,980
from Germany for treating shoulder periarthritis.

252
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,070
-Really?
-Remember to take them.

253
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:22,730
You even thought about my shoulder periarthritis

254
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,900
and got me something from Germany.

255
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:24,900
Thank you so much.

256
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:25,860
Thank you.

257
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:27,330
Look at this.

258
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,100
Don't work so hard.

259
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,550
Mind your old habits.

260
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,180
There are some new jewelry imports.

261
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,910
Look at this.

262
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,650
It was our mission to get rid of the spies,

263
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,980
but we got Wei Ruolai involved.

264
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,200
His brother sacrificed himself for the revolution.

265
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,660
The organization wants us

266
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,590
to rescue him.

267
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:52,210
The Investigation and Arrest Unit arrested him.

268
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,340
It's a big case, too.

269
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,210
Lin Qiaosong will be very cautious

270
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:57,140
and keep an eye on him 24 hours a day.

271
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,180
What's your brother's stance?

272
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,870
I'm not sure yet.

273
00:15:01,270 --> 00:15:02,110
But

274
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:04,620
Wei Ruolai is my brother's assistant.

275
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,120
If something happens to him,

276
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:07,830
my brother will be implicated.

277
00:15:07,830 --> 00:15:09,430
Even if it's to save himself,

278
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,310
he will likely do something.

279
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,350
I hope so.

280
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:14,850
Mr. Song,

281
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:16,320
are you in Shanghai?

282
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,050
If you are,

283
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,530
I want to visit you

284
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,090
to wish you a happy Spring Festival.

285
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,300
There's no need for that at a time like this.

286
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:23,500
Just speak your mind.

287
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:26,310
The investigation team

288
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:27,750
has been stationed in the Central Bank.

289
00:15:27,750 --> 00:15:30,080
You know who wants to mess with you, right?

290
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:31,420
Who else?

291
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,960
The compradors who have suffered losses

292
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,690
due to the tariff reform.

293
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,750
They can't wait

294
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,430
to drag me out into the street

295
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,540
and shoot me dead.

296
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:41,510
A small mistake can lead to a massive disaster.

297
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,380
Your assistant is really

298
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:44,760
part of the Communist Party.

299
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,460
Mr. Song, this is slander.

300
00:15:47,010 --> 00:15:47,840
I've checked before.

301
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,010
Wei Ruolai is fine.

302
00:15:49,770 --> 00:15:51,570
An assistant is insignificant.

303
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,060
Even if he's not from the Communist Party,

304
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,720
you can't let him become their bargaining chip.

305
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,100
You should

306
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,580
sever your connection with him as soon as possible.

307
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,340
Mr. Song,

308
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:02,270
I think it's too late

309
00:16:02,270 --> 00:16:03,330
for that now.

310
00:16:03,910 --> 00:16:05,580
They will definitely prove

311
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,340
that Wei Ruolai is part of the Communist Party.

312
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,800
And then, they will continue

313
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,030
to blame everything on me.

314
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:12,140
Then the Imperial Bank and Xingxia Bank we took over

315
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,130
and the tariff reform

316
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:14,520
will all be linked to the Communist Party.

317
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,480
In that case,

318
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:17,740
they will overturn everything.

319
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:22,250
Chairman Chiang hates collusion with the Communist Party.

320
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,590
They made an effective and harsh move this time.

321
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:25,650
You can't avoid it.

322
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:26,710
I know.

323
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,150
But let me say it again.

324
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,060
Wei Ruolai is not part of the Communist Party.

325
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,750
Besides, he snatched the gun

326
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:33,880
to protect me.

327
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:35,790
Objectively and personally,

328
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:37,830
I cannot abandon him at this moment.

329
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:38,680
Besides,

330
00:16:39,030 --> 00:16:40,430
even if I abandon him now,

331
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:41,760
they won't let me go.

332
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:43,500
They will turn around and chase after me.

333
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,220
So,

334
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:47,280
I'm going to fight back.

335
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,230
Nine Circles.

336
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:11,869
Pong.

337
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:15,720
Four Bamboos.

338
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:20,819
Mrs. Shen, you're usually a good player.

339
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,180
How many Pongs have you played

340
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,339
this afternoon?

341
00:17:24,130 --> 00:17:25,470
It's precisely because I'm not good at this.

342
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:26,930
I keep losing to all of you.

343
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:28,940
If I kept losing like you,

344
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:30,310
I'd have to think of ways

345
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,640
to cheer Kang up at home.

346
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:32,540
It's terrible.

347
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,310
Tunan doesn't care about money.

348
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,350
He doesn't ask about it either.

349
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:36,860
Let's

350
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,240
have fun.

351
00:17:38,550 --> 00:17:39,550
Mrs. Shen,

352
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,100
you're so lucky.

353
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:44,390
Making money and working

354
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,550
is a man's business.

355
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,330
I don't understand any of it.

356
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:48,870
But I know

357
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,860
Tunan has a lot of dealings with your husbands.

358
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:52,810
So,

359
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,440
if we offended you,

360
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:55,910
please

361
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,070
forgive us, ladies.

362
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,370
I didn't hear about anything.

363
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:02,020
Men

364
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,840
are like kids.

365
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,750
They like to fight for their pride.

366
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:06,950
Unlike us women

367
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,730
who are sensible

368
00:18:07,730 --> 00:18:09,050
and always looking out for the big picture.

369
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:11,290
I just hope that

370
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,730
we're still friends no matter what.

371
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:20,620
I'll tell you the truth today.

372
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,250
I'm here

373
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:24,190
for the sake of Mrs. Wu.

374
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,900
What happened to your husband

375
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,300
is a big deal.

376
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:30,150
Forget about

377
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,210
the past scores.

378
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:33,200
I'm sure we all know it by heart.

379
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,380
Mrs. Yu,

380
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:38,350
it's all small matters.

381
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,710
We're gathered today to enjoy ourselves.

382
00:18:40,710 --> 00:18:41,580
No need to mention those things.

383
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,970
I'm afraid you've lost your mind after winning.

384
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:46,420
Colluding with the Communist Party is not a small matter.

385
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:47,710
Ridiculous.

386
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,560
Let's go.

387
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,560
Mrs. Yu,

388
00:18:52,150 --> 00:18:53,720
I think you misunderstood.

389
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,460
I'm not here

390
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,170
to plead for mercy.

391
00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,820
I'm here to advise you.

392
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,520
It's dirty to frame and slander others.

393
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,600
If you overdo it,

394
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:05,230
there will be consequences.

395
00:19:05,680 --> 00:19:07,480
You are all from noble families.

396
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,390
You should understand that.

397
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,400
Sir.

398
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:24,160
Stand still.

399
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,710
You, stand up.

400
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:26,710
Sir.

401
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,870
Sir.

402
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:28,790
Shut up!

403
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,450
Stop talking.

404
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,110
Don't worry.

405
00:19:30,110 --> 00:19:31,090
Everything will be fine soon.

406
00:19:31,090 --> 00:19:32,290
It'll be fine soon.

407
00:19:32,310 --> 00:19:33,300
We're not criminals.

408
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,830
Why are you doing this to us?

409
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:37,950
Let go!

410
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,700
Sir!

411
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,530
Let go!

412
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:40,330
Let go!

413
00:19:41,710 --> 00:19:42,520
These...

414
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,330
These

415
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:46,400
are all my employees.

416
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,450
They're not criminals.

417
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,680
Be nice.

418
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,790
Why are there so many people here today?

419
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:55,400
To welcome me?

420
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:55,840
Sir.

421
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:56,460
It's fine.

422
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,120
Mr. Yu.

423
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,740
Advisor Shen.

424
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:05,520
What a coincidence.

425
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,400
Aren't you suspended?

426
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,390
You still have time to come today?

427
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,110
Mr. Yu,

428
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:12,980
why are you here

429
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,150
at a time like this?

430
00:20:15,970 --> 00:20:17,700
Didn't something happen here?

431
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,860
The bank's council of directors

432
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,470
insisted on making me the special advisor.

433
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:24,240
I have no choice.

434
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,570
For the benefit of the country,

435
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:26,930
I have to come and help.

436
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,420
From now on, we are colleagues.

437
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:32,300
I look forward to working with you,

438
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:33,220
Advisor Shen.

439
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,740
Thank you. I'll get going.

440
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,810
Okay.

441
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:40,390
Let's go.

442
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:43,830
Hello.

443
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:44,620
Hello.

444
00:20:45,070 --> 00:20:46,240
Can you be nicer?

445
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:46,860
Be nice.

446
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,670
Thank you for your hard work.

447
00:20:47,670 --> 00:20:48,430
Shut up.

448
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:50,160
What's your name?

449
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,350
I told you already.

450
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,310
Why do you keep asking?

451
00:20:52,310 --> 00:20:53,350
Why do you keep repeating yourself?

452
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:54,070
Shut up!

453
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:56,390
Lower your voice.

454
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,300
Talk nicely.

455
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,060
Okay.

456
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:01,870
Thank you.

457
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:03,290
You, get in.

458
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:05,980
Next.

459
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,190
Sir,

460
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:10,010
why are they doing this?

461
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:11,110
The battle hasn't even started

462
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,440
and they are already defecting?

463
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,790
Be calm. It's okay.

464
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,140
Who did it?

465
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,470
Who?

466
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:22,640
What's wrong?

467
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,090
Chief Deng, look.

468
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:30,670
Drive my car.

469
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,740
No need.

470
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:32,810
Best you avoid suspicion.

471
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,050
I don't want to get you involved.

472
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,980
I don't believe you colluded with the Communist Party.

473
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,220
Let alone a car,

474
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,400
even if you want my gauze, I'll give it to you.

475
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,200
I'm not afraid.

476
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,810
Drive it.

477
00:21:41,270 --> 00:21:42,530
Thank you, Chief Deng.

478
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:48,780
Thank you.

479
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:07,490
[Shanghai Garrison Command]

480
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,690
Can I help you?

481
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,830
I'm a senior staff officer of the Military Committee.

482
00:22:19,830 --> 00:22:20,490
Shen Tunan.

483
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,300
What brings you here?

484
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,910
I'm here to visit Wei Ruolai.

485
00:22:25,950 --> 00:22:27,080
I'm sorry, Mr. Shen.

486
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:28,600
We need Chief Kang's written order

487
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,510
to open the door.

488
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,570
Please forgive me.

489
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,280
Can I use your phone?

490
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:36,730
Please.

491
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,190
Is Chief Wu here?

492
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:50,130
I'm Shen Tunan.

493
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,370
I have an appointment with him at noon.

494
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,290
Advisor Shen,

495
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,510
I'm really sorry.

496
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:56,050
The chief went out for something.

497
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:57,510
Why don't you visit later?

498
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,430
A bunch of unreliable fence-sitters.

499
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,340
Shen Tunan

500
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,070
is either extremely careful

501
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:16,830
or just really law-abiding.

502
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:20,550
The investigation team has investigated the Central Bank thoroughly.

503
00:23:20,550 --> 00:23:22,250
But it found nothing we could use

504
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,420
against him.

505
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,640
He has a strong foundation.

506
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,520
Then, we should pick on the weakest link.

507
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:30,570
Wei Ruolai has been

508
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:32,300
in jail for days.

509
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,660
But even now,

510
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:36,340
he hasn't provided a proper statement.

511
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,180
Did you arrest him here to treat him to a meal?

512
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:45,710
We've used all the torture tools.

513
00:23:46,350 --> 00:23:48,470
But he is way too stubborn.

514
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,040
He didn't say a word.

515
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,460
He's just an assistant.

516
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,300
Before he worked for the Central Bank,

517
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,430
he couldn't even afford proper meals.

518
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,980
Maybe that's why

519
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,330
he's particularly grateful and is willing

520
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:04,460
to risk his life to protect Shen Tunan.

521
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,410
Have you heard of an imported product

522
00:24:09,670 --> 00:24:11,830
called the barbiturate injection?

523
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,360
This is a good thing.

524
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:28,230
A barbiturate injection from Germany.

525
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,480
After the injection,

526
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:32,480
you'll feel comfortable.

527
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:10,110
Don't be nervous. Relax.

528
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:13,560
Tell me everything you know.

529
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,460
You can go home soon.

530
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:20,550
You can take a comfortable bath

531
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,340
and have a good sleep.

532
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,540
Mr. Shen and Wen

533
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,220
are waiting for you to go back for the Spring Festival.

534
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:37,320
Yes.

535
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,950
As long as you say it,

536
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:42,860
you can go back for the Spring Festival.

537
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:44,470
Answer me.

538
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:49,340
Was your brother working for the Communist Party?

539
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,140
Yes.

540
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,500
Why did he come to you?

541
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,750
To meet me.

542
00:25:55,340 --> 00:25:56,570
Where?

543
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,560
Central Bank.

544
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:00,710
When you met him at the Central Bank,

545
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:03,150
did the Communist Party show up?

546
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:05,020
No.

547
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:07,940
No.

548
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,370
Answer me.

549
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:16,580
Why did you take Zhang Mingquan's gun?

550
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,990
To protect Mr. Shen.

551
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,170
You got it wrong.

552
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:28,560
You took the gun

553
00:26:29,110 --> 00:26:31,040
because Shen Tunan ordered you to.

554
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,640
He told you to assassinate Li Shengda

555
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:41,210
so that you can get

556
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:42,660
the gold bars back.

557
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:44,490
Kill Li Shengda.

558
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:46,070
Get the gold bars back.

559
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,770
Mr. Shen is not that kind of person.

560
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:51,340
He won't let me do that.

561
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:52,950
You got it wrong.

562
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:54,650
Think again.

563
00:26:59,470 --> 00:27:00,270
Good job.

564
00:27:00,310 --> 00:27:02,220
Follow me from now on

565
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,770
and enjoy a luxurious life.

566
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:05,000
At that time, I made up my mind

567
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,200
that I would come back to China

568
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,700
and make our country stronger,

569
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,470
so that our children won't leave our hometown,

570
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:11,770
so that our warships can sail

571
00:27:11,770 --> 00:27:12,850
further away.

572
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:14,700
Mr. Shen is not like that.

573
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,390
Mr. Shen is not like that.

574
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:18,130
Shen Tunan sent you there.

575
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:20,720
Shen Tunan asked you to assassinate Li Shengda.

576
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,580
You killed him.

577
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,080
He ordered you to kill him.

578
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,510
He ordered you to kill Li Shengda

579
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,970
and rob that batch of gold bars.

580
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,050
He ordered you to kill him.

581
00:27:27,050 --> 00:27:27,960
Think again.

582
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:28,740
Think again.

583
00:27:29,270 --> 00:27:31,150
Think again.

584
00:27:31,230 --> 00:27:32,500
Think again.

585
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,500
Shen Tunan ordered you to kill Li Shengda!

586
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,990
Think about it!

587
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,450
Use water to wake him up

588
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:48,950
and electrocute him.

589
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,710
Wake him up

590
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:52,940
and electrocute him!

591
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,110
Sir.

592
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:55,840
He can't take it anymore.

593
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:56,700
If this goes on,

594
00:27:56,970 --> 00:27:58,230
he might actually die.

595
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,050
All the dishes are here.

596
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:29,320
Let's eat.

597
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,520
Mom, where's Dad?

598
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,820
He hasn't come down for dinner yet?

599
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:40,090
He locked himself in the study as soon as he came back

600
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,780
and told no one to disturb him.

601
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,990
Is he still working overtime?

602
00:28:46,450 --> 00:28:47,780
It's because of Ruolai.

603
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:53,750
I'll go take a look.

604
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,630
Let's eat first.

605
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:04,150
Okay?

606
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,120
Brother, time to eat.

607
00:29:32,990 --> 00:29:34,000
I'm not hungry.

608
00:29:35,710 --> 00:29:37,750
Are you still worried about Ruolai?

609
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:38,970
How is he?

610
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:41,950
How good can he be in Lin Qiaosong's hands?

611
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,720
When can he be released?

612
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:45,620
Released?

613
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,700
Either the truth gets out that

614
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:49,380
he didn't kill anyone,

615
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,780
or he gets convicted of murder

616
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,380
and gets shot to death.

617
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:55,910
Is it possible that

618
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:58,600
Wei Ruolai didn't kill anyone,

619
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:00,880
but he was beaten into confessing?

620
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,310
It's highly possible.

621
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:06,630
What's your plan?

622
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:09,620
Mr. Song told me

623
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:10,970
he was a nobody.

624
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,800
He asked me to cut ties with him as soon as possible.

625
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,290
What do you think?

626
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,600
About this matter,

627
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,150
in the end,

628
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,390
it is targeting me

629
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,290
and the new policy of the Central Bank.

630
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:26,350
If I give in now,

631
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,340
all my efforts

632
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:29,710
will be ruined.

633
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:43,890
You want to help him,

634
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:46,870
but you need a lot of determination to do so.

635
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,660
It'll be a lot of trouble too.

636
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:49,810
Ruolai snatched the gun

637
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:50,860
to protect me.

638
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:52,590
And when I was shot,

639
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:54,930
he risked his life to give me so much blood.

640
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:56,200
He saved my life.

641
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,660
Do you think

642
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,380
I can abandon him at a time like this?

643
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,170
But I'm worried that

644
00:31:03,790 --> 00:31:04,920
he did kill someone.

645
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,710
The fact that Lin Qiaosong and the others are torturing him

646
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:09,700
to confess means that

647
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,180
there is no hard evidence.

648
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,260
I've read up on cases about

649
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,680
the Communist Party's underground party.

650
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:18,200
They have specialists to deal with

651
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,800
traitors like Li Shengda.

652
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,440
They wouldn't need Wei Ruolai to do it.

653
00:31:24,280 --> 00:31:25,940
You know Wei Ruolai very well.

654
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,400
He blushes at the slightest teasing.

655
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,750
How could he possibly have killed

656
00:31:29,750 --> 00:31:31,970
such a bloodthirsty outlaw?

657
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:35,800
In other words, we just need to prove that

658
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,790
someone else

659
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:37,870
killed Li Shengda.

660
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:40,200
Too many people wanted to kill Li Shengda.

661
00:31:40,470 --> 00:31:43,320
The Communist Party, the mafia, even his enemies.

662
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:45,790
Wei Ruolai would have had to get in line.

663
00:31:48,790 --> 00:31:49,720
This is gambling.

664
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:50,920
This is not gambling.

665
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,610
This is based on my judgment

666
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,410
of Wei Ruolai's day-to-day behavior.

667
00:31:54,410 --> 00:31:55,240
I’m sure that

668
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,340
regarding Li Shengda's case,

669
00:31:57,390 --> 00:31:59,180
Wei Ruolai must be innocent.

670
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,750
The Central Bank has the power and responsibility to find out the truth.

671
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,150
You can't let those scums muddle the truth.

672
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,600
I hate to say this,

673
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,820
but you shouldn't have

674
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,660
kept him by your side back then.

675
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:20,210
I don't regret what I've done.

676
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,180
For the reputation of our bank,

677
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,660
we can't let them confirm that

678
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,520
Wei Ruolai is colluding with the Communist Party.

679
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,920
Otherwise, all our efforts will be in vain.

680
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,830
Are you sure

681
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,870
Wei Ruolai is not part of the Communist Party?

682
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:32,070
I swear on my name that

683
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,720
he's not part of the Community Party.

684
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,680
Chief Deng.

685
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:39,420
I'm suspended right now.

686
00:32:39,530 --> 00:32:40,680
I cannot represent the bank.

687
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,740
I trust you the most

688
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:43,200
in the Central Bank.

689
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:44,460
Only you

690
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,510
can take care of this on behalf of the Central Bank.

691
00:32:47,510 --> 00:32:48,170
Please.

692
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,000
I am also

693
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,490
responsible for this.

694
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,540
Back then,

695
00:33:02,910 --> 00:33:04,570
you insisted on using him.

696
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:06,890
I should have persisted as well.

697
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:07,800
Chief Deng.

698
00:33:08,470 --> 00:33:09,610
I know you have difficulties.

699
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:10,820
But just tell me.

700
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,530
Can you help me or not?

701
00:33:14,310 --> 00:33:16,170
It's not that I don't want to help.

702
00:33:16,290 --> 00:33:17,930
I'm not capable enough.

703
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,870
In terms of courage,

704
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:20,790
I don't lack it.

705
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,680
In the end, this is just a brawl to the death.

706
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,430
But in terms of strength,

707
00:33:25,850 --> 00:33:28,780
I'm too weak compared to those experienced players.

708
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:33,480
You should know who's behind Yu Shiqing.

709
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,340
Not to mention Shanghai,

710
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,640
even a call

711
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:38,250
from Nanjing

712
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,830
is too much for me to handle.

713
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,060
What if people from Nanjing also help?

714
00:33:46,870 --> 00:33:47,790
Mr. Song

715
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,200
has invited the attendant of Chairman Chiang.

716
00:33:59,280 --> 00:33:59,830
Sir.

717
00:34:00,530 --> 00:34:02,030
If it doesn’t work, we can use opium.

718
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:02,970
We even dealt with Li Shengda.

719
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:05,030
How can a bumpkin be a challenge to us?

720
00:34:17,150 --> 00:34:17,830
Hello?

721
00:34:20,670 --> 00:34:21,670
Miss Shen.

722
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:25,960
Go ahead.

723
00:34:28,670 --> 00:34:30,270
You want to treat me to a meal?

724
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:37,540
Okay.

725
00:34:38,270 --> 00:34:39,260
Tell me the time.

726
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:40,929
No problem.

727
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:42,400
See you then.

728
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:44,440
Bye.

729
00:35:03,550 --> 00:35:04,280
I'm leaving.

730
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,620
When will Lin Qiaosong arrive?

731
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:07,330
1:30.

732
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,290
Try to stall him.

733
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,600
Don't worry.

734
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:23,020
Hello, Miss.

735
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:26,650
Hello, Miss Shen.

736
00:35:27,190 --> 00:35:28,190
Please follow me.

737
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:31,100
This way, please.

738
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:33,290
This way.

739
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,000
Miss Shen, have a seat.

740
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:37,790
Thank you.

741
00:35:38,870 --> 00:35:40,600
Miss Shen, what would you like?

742
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,110
A glass of water, please.

743
00:35:43,110 --> 00:35:43,710
Okay.

744
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,110
Please wait a moment.

745
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,570
The chief asked me to pick you up.

746
00:36:21,570 --> 00:36:22,700
Please come with me.

747
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:37,480
Miss Shen.

748
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,470
You're here. Have a seat.

749
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,440
What would you like to drink?

750
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,110
Did you invite me here

751
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:48,870
to ask about Wei Ruolai?

752
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:50,800
Is it convenient?

753
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:51,560
No.

754
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:55,270
This case is delegated by the higher-ups.

755
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:56,310
It is a major case.

756
00:36:56,690 --> 00:36:57,840
Please forgive me for not telling you

757
00:36:57,840 --> 00:36:59,640
any details related to the case.

758
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:02,570
Forget it, then.

759
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,350
Let's have a good meal.

760
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,000
However,

761
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,940
it's your treat this time.

762
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:07,830
Of course.

763
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,790
Men should pay for dinner.

764
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:11,710
Then I won't stand on ceremony.

765
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:12,740
I'm picking something expensive.

766
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,600
Miss Shen, please help yourself.

767
00:37:17,550 --> 00:37:19,480
Miss, what would you like to order?

768
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:22,790
Okay.

769
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:23,960
Thank you.

770
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:28,620
Actually,

771
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,120
I didn't want to come.

772
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,530
It's all because of my brother.

773
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,600
Wei Ruolai is his assistant.

774
00:37:34,670 --> 00:37:35,750
Now that he's in trouble,

775
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,550
my brother is very troubled too.

776
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:39,680
He thinks we're close,

777
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,080
so he asked me to inquire.

778
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,330
Do you think Wei Ruolai

779
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:45,280
is problematic?

780
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:45,980
Of course.

781
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:46,980
Why?

782
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:48,580
People like Wei Ruolai

783
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,910
were commoners in ancient times.

784
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,100
He came from a small family.

785
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:54,980
He hasn't seen much of the world.

786
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,400
Then he was suddenly chosen by my brother

787
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,430
and involved in the financial circle.

788
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:00,330
He's a typical case of becoming rich overnight.

789
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:01,650
He had never experienced such a life.

790
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,180
He had no ability to resist temptation at all.

791
00:38:04,410 --> 00:38:06,870
He was a ticking timebomb beside my brother.

792
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:09,530
Something bad would happen sooner or later.

793
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:11,460
Excuse me, your baguettes.

794
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,430
Thank you.

795
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:13,930
You're welcome, Miss Shen.

796
00:38:13,930 --> 00:38:14,730
Please enjoy.

797
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:17,070
Miss Shen, do you know

798
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,350
why your brother trusts and admires

799
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,700
Wei Ruolai so much?

800
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:22,910
Captain Lin,

801
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:25,410
are you trying to get information out of me?

802
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:26,630
I wouldn't dare.

803
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:29,890
Aren't we just having a friendly chat?

804
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:31,190
I'm just curious.

805
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,320
I just don't understand.

806
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:38,200
Mr. Kang and his men are plotting against my brother

807
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,930
with actual interests in mind.

808
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,150
Captain Lin, what about you?

809
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,910
What do you want?

810
00:38:45,750 --> 00:38:47,210
Am I plotting against him?

811
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,390
Aren't you?

812
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:50,930
It's not accurate.

813
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:55,650
Wei Ruolai is indeed suspected of colluding with the Communist Party.

814
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:58,910
And it's most likely that he's part of the Communist Party.

815
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,970
I also don't understand why

816
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:04,470
your brother is so protective of him.

817
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,300
Captain Lin.

818
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:09,940
I heard that

819
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:13,900
you had a sergeant who was a member of the Communist Party.

820
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:16,300
But you always said he was your benefactor.

821
00:39:17,710 --> 00:39:18,280
Yes.

822
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:21,350
Then, aren't you also suspected of colluding with the Communist Party?

823
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:22,350
At the very least,

824
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,760
there's a possibility of defection.

825
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,320
So I killed him myself

826
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,080
and arrested his whole family.

827
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,500
Otherwise, I would have lost my job long ago.

828
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:36,720
When Jing Ke tried to assassinate the Qin Emperor,

829
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:38,540
he presented the head of Fan Wuji to lower the emperor's guard.

830
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,090
If you intend to convict me, you'll always find excuses.

831
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,930
Didn't you do the same to my brother?

832
00:39:41,930 --> 00:39:42,700
Miss Shen...

833
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:45,730
Don't do unto others what you don't want done unto you.

834
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:52,100
The higher-ups have sent the order.

835
00:39:52,310 --> 00:39:54,320
Wei Ruolai's fate is sealed.

836
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:55,620
He won't be released.

837
00:39:57,310 --> 00:39:59,510
So you're beating him into submission.

838
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,410
I can't tell you the details.

839
00:40:01,610 --> 00:40:02,940
But I can guarantee that

840
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:06,610
someone who has snatched a gun,

841
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:08,540
is being suspected of colluding with the Communist Party,

842
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:12,000
and has been undercover in an important position in the party,

843
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:13,500
will not be released.

844
00:40:56,090 --> 00:40:56,770
Sir.

845
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:00,470
Sir.

846
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:01,780
I'm sorry.

847
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,110
I was...

848
00:41:03,110 --> 00:41:04,570
Let's not talk about this.

849
00:41:07,410 --> 00:41:08,670
I'll only ask you once.

850
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:11,400
You have to tell me the truth.

851
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,550
Did you

852
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,550
kill Li Shengda?

853
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:17,790
No.

854
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:21,560
I did take Zhang Mingquan's gun.

855
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:23,710
But I did it for...

856
00:41:26,190 --> 00:41:26,990
For what?

857
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,040
Say something.

858
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,290
Sir.

859
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:41,330
I plead guilty to robbery.

860
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:42,990
But

861
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:45,210
I really didn't kill him.

862
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:51,160
Can I trust you?

863
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:06,900
Sir.

864
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:10,190
I'm a reckless person.

865
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,810
This was bound to happen.

866
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,550
Please take care of yourself.

867
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:16,880
But please believe that

868
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:22,840
even if they want to kill me,

869
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:24,550
I won't say a word about you.
