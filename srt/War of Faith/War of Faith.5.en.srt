No. I just haven't got a good rest lately.

You're not at liberty to do so.

119

The organization not only worries about the Lonely Star's safety,

120
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,980
but also concerns if the gold bars he has

121

It's a large area.

143
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:48,960
To be honest,

144
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,150
I'm not having high hopes for it.

145
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:05,710
Well,

146
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:08,650
he came all the way from Jiangxi.

147
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,360
He must be very good,

148
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:13,650
or he would've failed on the halfway.

149
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,590
It's fine if you can't find him.

150
00:13:16,590 --> 00:13:19,050
It's a common practice among the communists

151
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:21,110
for the agents who can't get in touch with their handlers

152
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:23,580
to initiate emergency action to contact each other

153
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:25,830
by putting announcements on newspapers.

154
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:26,930
Split our people into two teams,

155
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,190
and have them check every newspaper publishing house in Shanghai.

156
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:32,720
I need them to make a copy of each announcement

157
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,110
that has been paid to be published.

158
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,640
Okay.

159
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:50,280
Where do you think he is hiding?

160
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:58,090
I think he's still in Shanghai.

161
00:13:58,590 --> 00:13:59,650
He hasn't left yet.

162
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,370
And then?

163
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,350
Then...

164
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,540
Then...

165
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:10,990
By the way, Captain Lin,

166
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,860
well...

167
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:15,230
There's something I didn't tell you last time.

168
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:17,030
When he dropped by last time

169
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:18,310
and drove me out of the room,

170
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,350
I felt like

171
00:14:19,350 --> 00:14:21,610
there's something he wanted in my place.

172
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:23,710
After I returned, I checked around.

173
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,650
I found some books missing,

174
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,310
including the Classical Chinese Prose Anthology,

175
00:14:28,310 --> 00:14:30,350
and the Collection of Zhuangzi's Works with Annotations.

176
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:31,080
Would you say

177
00:14:31,420 --> 00:14:33,420
this is a helpful lead?

178
00:14:44,210 --> 00:14:46,370
The first communist I caught on my own

179
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:48,990
was a classmate of mine in the Huangpu Military Academy.

180
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,590
I shared a dorm room with him.

181
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:53,100
Before I tortured him,

182
00:14:53,670 --> 00:14:55,160
I treated him to a meal.

183
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:58,310
At that time, I felt a bit guilty,

184
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,000
and my heart ached.

185
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,320
Do you know what he said to me?

186
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,520
He said the deaths of some people

187
00:15:07,530 --> 00:15:09,740
were as awe-inspiring as a majestic mountain,

188
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,820
but some

189
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:13,940
were as meaningless as a light feather.

190
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,840
He said he'd sacrifice his life for the great cause

191
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,400
of saving the country without regrets.

192
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,680
I was shocked.

193
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:21,810
I meant to shoot him dead.

194
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,720
But hearing what he said,

195
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,140
I had a change of mind.

196
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,790
I had him flayed

197
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:33,590
when he was alive.

198
00:15:35,670 --> 00:15:36,870
He screamed in agony.

199
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,740
He howled for a long time before he died.

200
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:40,900
Such a long time.

201
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,910
As he went into his death throes,

202
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,910
I said one last sentence to him.

203
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:47,400
That is, the real savior of the country

204
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,790
should be the Three Principles of the People,

205
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:51,310
instead of those

206
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:53,510
poor and deranged freeloaders

207
00:15:53,530 --> 00:15:56,990
who think about nothing but carving up other people's wealth!

208
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:11,990
The use of telegraph

209
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,620
is necessary for modern banks.

210
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,180
The working mechanism of telegraph is based on long and short pulses.

211
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,380
Long pulses are translated into lines.

212
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:22,210
Short pulses are translated into dots.

213
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,890
When these parts combine, different numbers are formed,

214
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,480
and can be interpreted into Chinese characters.

215
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,920
Today, our study will start from

216
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,030
the globally universal Moss code.

217
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:32,910
Ahead of Assistant Manager Lin, there is an electric telegraph.

218
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,470
In front of each of you,

219
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:35,490
there is a button.

220
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,290
When I speak of different codes,

221
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:38,710
I hope each of you

222
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:40,390
will listen and memorize carefully,

223
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:42,710
as you watch Assistant Manager Lin's moves

224
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:44,110
and practise on your own.

225
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:46,950
A.

226
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,910
A short pulse, plus a long one.

227
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:51,450
B.

228
00:16:52,790 --> 00:16:54,650
A long pulse and three short ones.

229
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,460
C.

230
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:00,210
A long pulse plus a short one, and repeat.

231
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:07,589
Ruochuan, have you thought it through?

232
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,960
What are we gonna do in Shanghai?

233
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:11,630
I'll get a job,

234
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,240
so I can make money.

235
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:15,119
You'll enroll in a good school

236
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,380
to receive education.

237
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:18,839
Again?

238
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,310
I don't wanna go to school.

239
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,770
I wanna go to work with you.

240
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,490
Then we'll buy a big house in Shanghai,

241
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:25,619
and settle down there with our family.

242
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,690
No school?

243
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,480
No school.

244
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,700
I'm gonna beat you up!

245
00:17:30,170 --> 00:17:31,440
You're very smart.

246
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,720
If you get into a good school and study hard,

247
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,270
I'm sure you'll turn out better than me.

248
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:36,880
The whole family's counting on you.

249
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,990
Shanghai

250
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,170
is a big city.

251
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:41,310
There must be tons of opportunities.

252
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,400
If we both go to work,

253
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,860
we'll rake in money quickly!

254
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:44,590
You think so?

255
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:45,950
Other than learning,

256
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,490
what else are you capable of?

257
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,460
Look what you're doing with that sickle.

258
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,470
You're good at nothing but learning.

259
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,270
About all that money stuff, I'll take care of it.

260
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:55,500
All you need to do is study.

261
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:04,780
E.

262
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,280
A short pulse.

263
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:11,110
F.

264
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,700
Two short pulses followed by a long and short one.

265
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,110
G.

266
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,270
A long pulse.

267
00:18:32,290 --> 00:18:33,050
Go on, guys.

268
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:34,350
Go on.

269
00:18:39,870 --> 00:18:41,000
Alright, everyone.

270
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:42,600
Let's keep it going.

271
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,480
Here's a reminder for you.

272
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:46,880
I hope each of you

273
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:49,170
will cherish this opportunity to learn.

274
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:55,840
Well done!

275
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,270
In the head area,

276
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,510
you scored the 10-point ring twice and the 9-point ring once.

277
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:06,510
In the chest area,

278
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:08,900
two shots are in the 10-point ring and two in the 9-point ring.

279
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,550
The speed was a bit slow though.

280
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:11,610
That's my problem,

281
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:13,210
not the gun's.

282
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,670
No, no, Miss Shen.

283
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:15,850
That's not what I meant.

284
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,450
The gun's is really nice. I like it a lot.

285
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:18,300
The 38-caliber Colt revolver

286
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,280
is way better than the 32-caliber model.

287
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,090
This time,

288
00:19:21,310 --> 00:19:22,590
I'm really grateful for you

289
00:19:22,590 --> 00:19:24,210
to share some of these imported guns

290
00:19:24,210 --> 00:19:25,180
with us.

291
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:25,850
Now,

292
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,880
we'll have enough guns for the tax and police officers.

293
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,470
I have nothing to do with this matter.

294
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:32,470
It's Mr. Weng who made the approval.

295
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:34,870
You offered a high price after all, right?

296
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:35,630
Captain Lin,

297
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,630
why don't you

298
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,040
check it out again?

299
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,350
It's well structured with even weight in each part.

300
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,210
What a nice gun!

301
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:49,100
Bullets shot from a Colt M1903 38-caliber revolver

302
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,500
can go as far as 50 meters.

303
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:52,810
The initial speed is 320 meters per second.

304
00:19:52,810 --> 00:19:54,460
It's overwhelming, but also safe.

305
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,560
Plus, there are three safety catches near the grip panel.

306
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:57,890
The manufacturer says it's not equipped with a hammer,

307
00:19:57,890 --> 00:19:59,230
but obviously that's a lie.

308
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:00,510
Actually, the hammer's hidden inside,

309
00:20:00,510 --> 00:20:02,050
with two swivels in the lower end,

310
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,550
consisting of a simple but reliable structure.

311
00:20:03,550 --> 00:20:04,550
The gun is

312
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,100
only made up of 37 parts.

313
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,280
It can be easily dismantled,

314
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,680
and the maintenance doesn't require much.

315
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:13,360
It's fair to say

316
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,210
such a gun is a piece of art.

317
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:20,600
Captain Lin,

318
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,780
are you okay?

319
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:25,830
Perfect.

320
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:28,560
This is a work of art.

321
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:33,540
Thank you for what you did that day.

322
00:20:33,590 --> 00:20:35,330
If you hadn't let us leave first...

323
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:35,920
Miss Shen,

324
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,520
it's water under the bridge.

325
00:20:37,590 --> 00:20:38,190
From now on,

326
00:20:38,190 --> 00:20:40,390
do not mention about it again, alright?

327
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,540
How about this?

328
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,820
Captain Lin,

329
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,900
let me treat you to dinner.

330
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,460
It's a token of gratitude.

331
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,790
Okay.

332
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,350
I wanna post a notice about a missing item.

333
00:21:03,350 --> 00:21:04,350
Again?

334
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:07,350
How come people keep losing stuff lately?

335
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:09,550
Will it be on tomorrow's newspaper?

336
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:10,230
Yes.

337
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:12,080
But if you had come a bit later,

338
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,540
there wouldn't be room for that on this page.

339
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,870
Sorry.

340
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:19,730
I'm sorry. I've caught a cold.

341
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,090
Captain Lin?

342
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:41,910
Captain Lin?

343
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:44,770
Listening intently, aren't you?

344
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
Miss Shen, I'm sorry.

345
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:49,040
Last time at the party held by Mr. Shen,

346
00:21:49,630 --> 00:21:51,070
I had to leave early for an emergency,

347
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:52,850
so I didn't get to see the end of your performance.

348
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:53,780
It's such a pity.

349
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:55,710
But I didn't expect today

350
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,600
I could sit here

351
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,040
face-to-face with you

352
00:21:58,310 --> 00:21:59,350
for a nice dinner.

353
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:01,350
Plus, there's a piano too.

354
00:22:01,350 --> 00:22:01,790
I...

355
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,820
Sorry for being rude.

356
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:06,270
Maybe I can

357
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:08,170
play for you next time.

358
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,540
It'll be a great honor for me.

359
00:22:12,070 --> 00:22:12,830
Miss Shen,

360
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,160
did you start learning piano when you were little?

361
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:16,990
Yes.

362
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:18,230
Captain Lin,

363
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,450
what kind of music do you usually enjoy?

364
00:22:22,750 --> 00:22:23,880
The expensive kind.

365
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:26,470
We don't really have a chance to go to concerts.

366
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,860
Vinyl records are our only choice for music.

367
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,100
Well, in terms of records,

368
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:31,660
the expansive ones are of higher quality.

369
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,520
That must sound like a joke to you.

370
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:35,490
Not at all.

371
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:37,610
You strike me as an honest man,

372
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:38,860
unlike those

373
00:22:39,010 --> 00:22:40,290
who know nothing

374
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,040
but pretend to be elegant.

375
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,790
After memorizing a few musicians' names,

376
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:44,760
they come around and try to chat me up,

377
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,220
only to be busted before a conversation goes deeper.

378
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,130
Even I feel embarrassed for those people.

379
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:50,930
I know who you're talking about.

380
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,570
That person

381
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:58,150
is not giving you a hard time, is he?

382
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,620
I'm just doing my job.

383
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,870
I can get over the rough patches.

384
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:03,830
Do you need

385
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:05,530
my brother to send him a message?

386
00:23:05,530 --> 00:23:06,750
Please don't. Don't.

387
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,050
If your brother gives him a warning,

388
00:23:09,050 --> 00:23:10,510
he'll think of me as a backstabber,

389
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,500
throwing my weight around.

390
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,920
In this line of business I'm in,

391
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,720
it's a taboo.

392
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,200
It's never occurred to me

393
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,470
that you actually have a strong ego.

394
00:23:21,630 --> 00:23:22,430
Miss Shen,

395
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,740
I appreciate your intention to help.

396
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:27,710
When you hold a concert again,

397
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,910
can you spare two tickets for me?

398
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,640
I'll give you ten tickets.

399
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:32,770
Will that be enough?

400
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:35,970
Sure.

401
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:38,480
I can even bring my friends to the concert.

402
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,350
But when that happens,

403
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,190
I'm afraid the audience will be scared.

404
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,530
That's not true.

405
00:23:46,190 --> 00:23:47,920
You're the elites of the party.

406
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,350
If they are scared,

407
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:50,680
it can only prove

408
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,680
that they're hiding dirty secrets.

409
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,440
Miss Shen,

410
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,040
I can't agree more

411
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,500
with what you've said.

412
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,750
The party does need

413
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,710
elite members like your brother in the top brass,

414
00:23:59,710 --> 00:24:01,440
but it also needs us errand boys

415
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,470
in the lower levels like the imperial guards in the Ming Dynasty.

416
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:05,730
We stay in dark places,

417
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:06,880
do the ugly and tiring stuff,

418
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,280
clean up trash, and so on.

419
00:24:09,570 --> 00:24:10,370
That's right.

420
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,320
Such tedious work

421
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:14,230
has to be shouldered by someone.

422
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:15,510
However,

423
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:18,950
these people are usually underappreciated.

424
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:19,800
Captain Lin,

425
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:22,200
you're upset about it, aren't you?

426
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:36,810
Sometimes.

427
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:39,330
But every time I finish a mission,

428
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:42,000
the sense of achievement provides huge relief.

429
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,320
The party is very lucky to have

430
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:46,470
a competent member like you.

431
00:24:48,590 --> 00:24:49,920
Did the mission that day

432
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,070
give you

433
00:24:51,410 --> 00:24:52,740
a sense of achievement?

434
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,800
Was it completed?

435
00:24:55,910 --> 00:24:56,710
Not yet.

436
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,650
But I've cast a net.

437
00:24:59,150 --> 00:25:00,600
I believe in several days,

438
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,860
there will be a result.

439
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:09,390
Then I hope you'll finish

440
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:11,840
your mission successfully and early.

441
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:13,930
Thank you.

442
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:30,370
[The Crystal Newspaper Publishing House, Shanghai]

443
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:35,960
Hello?

444
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,360
What?

445
00:25:46,870 --> 00:25:47,650
I got it.

446
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:52,670
Sir,

447
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:53,720
are you going home?

448
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,520
No. I need to meet the president.

449
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:56,870
Ruolai,

450
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:00,030
go to the security office now,

451
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:01,630
and tell all the guards on duty

452
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,350
to go the Avenue Petain in the French Concession.

453
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,470
I need them to stop Zhang Mingquan

454
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:06,640
from emptying the vault of the Imperial Bank of China.

455
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:07,110
Okay.

456
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,710
But the security guards aren't law enforcers, are they?

457
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,150
They have to be there anyway.

458
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:11,630
Got it.

459
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:12,880
Try to avoid head-on confrontations.

460
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,880
Don't worry, Sir.

461
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,990
Be careful!

462
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:16,750
Okay!

463
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:21,440
Hurry up! Hurry!

464
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,640
Move the stuff! Move!

465
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:24,480
Mr. Zhang,

466
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:25,470
don't rush into a decision.

467
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:26,640
Emptying the vault

468
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,200
is destructive to our bank.

469
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,150
Don't say that!

470
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,130
It's not our bank anymore.

471
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,470
The Imperial Bank of China has a new owner now.

472
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,120
Hurry!

473
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:36,880
Hurry up!

474
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,810
Zhang Mingquan!

475
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:39,200
Put everything down!

476
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:39,870
Leave the boxes right here!

477
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:40,730
Drop them down!

478
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:43,010
Move! Keep moving!

479
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,320
Zhang Mingquan, this is a warning.

480
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,590
Don't you violate the law. You know it's a crime.

481
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:50,650
Put the boxes back.

482
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:55,930
Keep moving, guys!

483
00:26:56,470 --> 00:26:57,750
Put them down!

484
00:26:58,270 --> 00:27:00,640
The Imperial Bank of China now belongs to the Central Bank.

485
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,960
All the assets should be under the control of the Central Bank.

486
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,360
You're violating the law. Do you know that?

487
00:27:07,230 --> 00:27:08,290
What are you doing?

488
00:27:09,550 --> 00:27:10,830
Zhang Mingquan, I'm warning you.

489
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:11,370
You...

490
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:13,990
You'd better not knowingly break the law.

491
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,990
Now it's not too late for you to stop.

492
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,310
What are you waiting for?

493
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,040
Fight!

494
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,230
Screw you!

495
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,000
I was kind enough to you!

496
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,350
Who do you think you are?

497
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,510
You punk!

498
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,680
You...

499
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,520
You wanna die or what?

500
00:27:43,270 --> 00:27:46,470
It's the Central Bank's property. You can't take it away.

501
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:49,190
Do you believe that I'll shoot you dead?

502
00:27:49,190 --> 00:27:49,950
I won't let you take anything away!

503
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:50,800
On the count of three!

504
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,730
Zhang Mingquan!

505
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:52,120
One!

506
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:53,030
You can't take anything away!

507
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:53,680
Zhang Mingquan!

508
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,320
Two!

509
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,290
Zhang Mingquan!

510
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,240
Zhang...

511
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:57,640
Zhang Mingquan, you can't take...

512
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:58,150
Three!

513
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:11,680
Zhang Mingquan!

514
00:28:13,750 --> 00:28:14,630
Shen Tunan?

515
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:16,980
You're not a law enforcer!

516
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:18,950
This...

517
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:19,960
This is the French Concession!

518
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:20,910
How dare you mess around!

519
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,670
So what?

520
00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:23,720
If you wanna bring this up to the French president,

521
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,480
be my guest!

522
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,030
I'm protecting the legal property of the Central Bank.

523
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:29,120
If things get out of hand,

524
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,710
I won't mind going down with you.

525
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:31,220
You...

526
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,610
Are you out of your mind?

527
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:34,160
There are two options for you.

528
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:34,720
One,

529
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:35,920
you'll resign.

530
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:38,190
I promise the rest of your life will be secured.

531
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:40,120
About this ridiculous theft,

532
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:42,590
I'll pretend that it didn't happen.

533
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:44,160
What's the other option?

534
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,690
A severe punishment where blood will be shed!

535
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:17,920
Shen Tunan,

536
00:29:22,450 --> 00:29:24,510
remember what happened to Deng Tong?

537
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:26,230
He had a tragic ending.

538
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:31,280
In the Han Dynasty, Sanghong Yang competed with the commoners for profits

539
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,590
on the emperor's behalf by violent means.

540
00:29:33,590 --> 00:29:34,590
How did he wind up?

541
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:36,710
He was killed in a pot!

542
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:38,630
Fine.

543
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:42,670
I'll let you have the satisfaction now.

544
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:45,150
Guys,

545
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:48,250
let's go!

546
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,650
Go! Go!

547
00:29:56,870 --> 00:29:57,470
Mr. Zhang,

548
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:58,290
are you alright?

549
00:29:58,290 --> 00:30:00,010
I'm fine. Just some scratches.

550
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:00,740
Let's go.

551
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,400
Get up.

552
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:15,440
Wipe the blood.

553
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:21,990
Do you know what you did wrong?

554
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:27,050
You need to make sound judgments regarding the circumstances.

555
00:30:27,050 --> 00:30:29,480
A wise man wouldn't stand near a collapsing wall.

556
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,070
He held you at gun point,

557
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:33,350
and was counting down to three. Why didn't you quit?

558
00:30:33,350 --> 00:30:35,810
That's not a meaningful way to end your life.

559
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,190
Sir, I was protecting the interests of the Central Bank.

Then your death would be in vain.

563

You need to keep alive first,

585
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,870
I sincerely hope that you will

586
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:44,310

602
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,120
I had dinner with a friend.

603

A friend?

604
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:51,000
Lin Qiaosong from the Shanghai Garrison Command.

605
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,070
When did you become friends with him?

606

What's wrong?

607

Is there a problem with him being my friend?

Are you dating him?

610
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,450
It's just an innocent dinner.

611
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,710
Do you have to make a fuss about it?

612
00:33:01,710 --> 00:33:03,230
Why would you dine with him if you're not dating him?

613

Do you know what kind of person he is?

614
00:33:05,310 --> 00:33:06,480
Like an imperial guardian in the Ming Dynasty.

Newspapers! The Shen Bao Newspaper!

748
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:35,360
I want a copy of the Shen Bao Newspaper.

749
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:37,880
Thank you.

750
00:40:38,190 --> 00:40:40,550
Newspapers! The Shen Bao Newspaper and The Crystal!

751
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:42,840
Newspapers! The Shen Bao Newspaper and The Crystal!

752
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:45,090
Newspapers! The Shen Bao Newspaper and The Crystal!

753
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:47,470
Newspapers! The Shen Bao Newspaper and The Crystal!

754
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,110
The Lonely Star has sent a message on newspapers.

755
00:40:48,290 --> 00:40:51,230
[Hong Fang Clothing Shop]

756
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:53,320
I've talked to Lin Qiaosong.

757
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,280
But so far there isn't any news yet.

758
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:57,970
It means the Lonely Star is still alive.

759
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,760
He has been chased after before.

760
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,830
It must have something to do with Rixin Bookstore.

761
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,110
I've made an urgent report to the organization.

762
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:07,840
They'll get to the bottom of it.

763
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:10,560
The most important thing now

764
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:12,120
is tomorrow's meeting.

765
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:14,740
I'll go!

766
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,440
The location is the lobby of the Central Bank.

767
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,950
I know that place very well,

768
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,810
so I can get prepared beforehand.

769
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,470
His identity has been exposed.

770
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:25,810
He could be caught.

771
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,850
The worse is,

772
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,880
he might have been caught already.

773
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:31,240
In that case, the message

774
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:32,570
and tomorrow's meeting

775
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:36,120
would be a hoax designed by the Investigation and Arrest Unit.

776
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:37,440
It's too dangerous.

777
00:41:38,230 --> 00:41:39,630
Then you can't go either.

778
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:43,260
You're in charge of the Shanghai communication center.

779
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:45,720
What should we do if anything happens to you?

780
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,610
Mister!

781
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:49,090
Chief Xu,

782
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:50,980
let's stop the argument.

783
00:41:50,980 --> 00:41:53,310
No one's more suited than me for this task.

784
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:55,750
My brother works in the Central Bank, remember?

785
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,070
Should there be danger,

786
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,470
I can turn to him for help.

787
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:10,230
You must be cautious.

788
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,630
As soon as you smell something fishy,

789
00:42:12,630 --> 00:42:14,230
stop the meeting right away.

790
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,430
The biggest part of your task

791
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
is to come back alive.

792
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,310
Sir! Sir!

793
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,680
We cracked the coded message!

794
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,230
This is our finding.

795
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,890
That Classical Chinese Prose Anthology is the code book.

796
00:42:45,890 --> 00:42:47,490
At 3 p.m. on 26th.

797
00:42:47,550 --> 00:42:48,770
The Central Bank lobby.

798
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,370
Hold the Shen Bao Newspaper that published on 25th.

799
00:42:51,370 --> 00:42:52,570
What date is it today?

800
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,470
25th.

801
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,690
It means they'll meet up tomorrow.
