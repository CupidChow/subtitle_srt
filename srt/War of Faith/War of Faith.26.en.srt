they are not optimistic about the treasury bills.

107

00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,290
You're the best. Tell me, please.

188
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,600
Don't worry.

189
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,480
When I make a lot of money,

190
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,240
you...

191
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,160
this old man,

192
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,020
and all of them,

193
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll give all of you

194
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,610
20% off the rent. Are you happy?

195
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:28,360
Really?

196
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,660
That would make me very happy.

197
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,540
Today,

198
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,880
at the stock exchange,

199
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,720
I heard news from Nanjing.

200
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,560
It is said that the Treasury Department

201
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,710
wants to recall the treasury bills early.

202
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:41,640
What do you mean?

203
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,370
What does that mean?

204
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,700
It means the price will rise, and rise drastically.

205
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,080
If this news is true,

206
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:51,050
it will at least rise to 80.

207
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,520
Did you hear that?

208
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,120
What if it's fake news?

209
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
How is that possible?

210
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,730
A relative of my cousin's mother-in-law

211
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,400
works at the Treasury Department.

212
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,630
He said that people from the Treasury Department have all bought.

213
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:04,160
Not only that,

214
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,820
they even mortgaged the house.

215
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,760
If staff from the Treasury Department are buying themselves,

216
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:08,890
what does that mean?

217
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,480
In my opinion,

218
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,060
it's better to stop when things are good.

219
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,080
Don't be greedy.

220
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,640
Greed won't end well.

221
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:18,080
Back then,

222
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:19,610
if it weren't for greed,

223
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,040
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

224
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
You were not greedy.

225
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,730
You're not destined to have a life of fortune.

226
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:27,810
I've thought about it.

227
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,680
What if I mortgage the house too,

228
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:30,610
and keep buying?

229
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,000
That won't do, Ms. Zhou.

230
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,200
Wei have already said

231
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,120
we should only buy within our means.

232
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,360
Wei is just a small employee in the bank.

233
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,200
He wouldn't know how much more will the price of the treasury bills rise to.

234
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,450
That's decided by the Treasury Department, isn't it?

235
00:10:42,450 --> 00:10:44,250
It's better to ask Ruolai first.

236
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:45,420
Don't take the risk.

237
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,890
The old man is right.

238
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:47,880
I should ask him.

239
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,800
But he won't tell me even if I asked.

240
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,290
How about I give it a try?

241
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,640
We go back a long way.

242
00:10:57,570 --> 00:10:59,370
I think he will tell me the truth.

243
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,390
But even if you ask him directly,

244
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
he won't tell you.

245
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,890
If you ask him,

246
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:06,600
"Wei,

247
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,420
when will you dump your treasury bills?"

248
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,920
If Wei replies,

249
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,180
"When will I dump my treasury bills?"

250
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:14,600
It means the price will rise.

251
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,630
That makes sense.

252
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:19,040
This time, Central Bank is in charge of the distribution of the treasury bills.

253
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,040
All of them will come across first-hand information.

254
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,480
Any conclusions made

255
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,740
will be very accurate.

256
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,690
You won't go wrong listening to Ruolai.

257
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,620
I'll go and ask.

258
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,210
Okay. I'll wait for your news.

259
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:30,650
Okay.

260
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,400
He's here. He's here.

261
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,610
Wei, it's me.

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,760
Why are you here?

263
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,460
I'm here to bring you some snacks.

264
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,890
Ms. Zhou made some chicken soup. Try it.

265
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:54,280
Thank you.

266
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,340
Careful, it's hot.

267
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:57,620
Go to bed early.

268
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:58,400
Wait.

269
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,950
I have something to ask you.

270
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,360
Come, let's talk outside. Chunmiao's already asleep.

271
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,120
Okay.

272
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:18,880
Sit.

273
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:23,230
Wei,

274
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:26,270
I want to buy some more treasury bills.

275
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,770
Ms. Zhou has earned a lot recently.

276
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,590
Do you think it's still profitable to buy now?

277
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:36,120
I know it's hard for you to tell me. But it's okay.

278
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,980
Just tell me if I can should buy it.

279
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,010
I'll figure out how much I will buy.

280
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,540
Looking at the current trend,

281
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,810
there should be no problem hitting 80.

282
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,550
But I can't foresee how the trend will go afterwards.

283
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:58,060
But what I am sure is that

284
00:12:58,690 --> 00:13:00,890
many people will go bankrupt this time.

285
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:04,710
80. Are you sure?

286
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,690
But you must remember,

287
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,320
don't ever borrow money.

288
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:16,890
You must...

289
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,150
Buy within your means.

290
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,880
Don't worry.

291
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,540
You know me.

292
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm never greedy.

293
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,010
I'll get going then.

294
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:30,710
Are you done?

295
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,320
How much?

296
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,160
80.

297
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,000
80.

298
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:34,240
That's great.

299
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,880
It means the news from the Treasury Department is true.

300
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,890
When it hits 80, be sure to sell it quickly.

301
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,040
Yeah, Wei said that

302
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,730
if this matter goes awry,

303
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,540
many people will go bankrupt.

304
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:49,060
He's talking about other people, not us.

305
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,830
When I become rich,

306
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:53,320
I'll take care of all your lunches.

307
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,580
Three dishes and one soup.

308
00:13:54,580 --> 00:13:56,910
One meat and two vegetable dishes. Happy?

309
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,880
Yes. Are you for real?

310
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,640
When did I ever lie to you?

311
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,080
80.

312
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:18,440
With just this bit of money,

313
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,570
I still can't buy a rickshaw even if it rises to 80.

314
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,400
How much do you want?

315
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,600
How much can I borrow?

316
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,090
If you have no mortgage,

317
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,000
you can only get a few silver dollars at most.

318
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,930
Who says I don't?

319
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,190
Can't I mortgage myself?

320
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:47,920
You?

321
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:54,710
Look at you.

322
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,380
I don't even want it for free.

323
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:56,940
Sir.

324
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,240
I pull a rickshaw.

325
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,690
I have a fixed income every month.

326
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:02,890
So what?

327
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:07,950
How much can I borrow

328
00:16:08,450 --> 00:16:10,710
against my income for the next ten years?

329
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:22,350
Ms. Zhou, why don't we dump it now?

330
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,440
Dump it now!

331
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,200
Dump it?

332
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,270
Damn you! What for?

333
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,940
It's all about chasing after the market.

334
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,300
It's not too late for us to sell when it falls.

335
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,040
But Wei said...

336
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:37,560
Everything is about Wei.

337
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,560
Well then, if Wei asks you to die,

338
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,690
you shall go to hell.

339
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,680
It's not easy

340
00:16:42,830 --> 00:16:44,730
to come across this kind of market conditions.

341
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:45,800
Let me ask you.

342
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:49,160
Have you made enough to replace your rickshaw?

343
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:49,960
No.

344
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:50,760
That's right.

345
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,640
I've mortgaged my house.

346
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:53,760
There's nothing I'm afraid of.

347
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:55,160
So what are you afraid of?

348
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,240
When the price rises to 90,

349
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:03,710
I'll put flushing toilets

350
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,000
in all your rooms.

351
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,400
Okay, I'll change my rickshaw when it's 90.

352
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
It will have German tires,

353
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,670
Italian bearings,

354
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:12,640
and French cushions.

355
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,280
It's now at 88!

356
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:18,150
You are already making money, and you are still thinking about changing your rickshaw?

357
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:25,160
90! 90! 90!

358
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,850
Zhang Mingquan, didn't you say that you will

359
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,050
inform us as soon as there is news from Nanjing?

360
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,360
There was nothing I could do. Everybody, calm down.

361
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,880
Liar! You are a big liar!

362
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,080
It happened so suddenly.

363
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,390
I didn’t expect Mr. Kong to be like this either.

364
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:39,490
This is a trap.

365
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,870
Liar!

366
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:44,490
The Treasury Department has been trying to trick us from the beginning.

367
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,070
We've already been screwed over.

368
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,830
Stop arguing.

369
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,090
It's not necessary.

370
00:17:49,090 --> 00:17:50,480
It's really not necessary.

371
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,540
How could it not be?

372
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,560
Nanjing knew from the outset that

373
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,720
we would break the rules to dump our treasury bills.

374
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,320
If we can't close the accounts

375
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,480
according to the stipulated amount,

376
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,320
each of us will be charged with

377
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,070
criminal breach of trust.

378
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,760
That's punishable by the military law.

379
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,290
They've been waiting for us

380
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,360
from the very beginning.

381
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:07,880
Yes.

382
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,520
Enough.

383
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:09,880
Stop arguing.

384
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,950
At this point,

385
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:13,850
we can only go back to the stock exchange,

386
00:18:13,850 --> 00:18:15,570
and buy back the treasury bills at the higher prices.

387
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:17,120
Look at how much the price has gone up to.

388
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,160
How could we buy it back?

389
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,130
How could we?

390
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,900
Do you know how much we lost? Have you done the math?

391
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,300
Then we won't buy it back.

392
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,810
We can just face the gallows instead.

393
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,420
Let's all get shot, one by one.

394
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,320
Do you want your money or your life?

395
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,680
Think about it.

396
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,500
What's the use of arguing?

397
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,360
Use your brain and think of a solution instead.

398
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,840
Actually,

399
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,760
it's not impossible to buy back

400
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,610
the treasury bills at an off-market rate.

401
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,200
How?

402
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:50,000
I do know someone.

403
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,940
He has a lot of treasury bills,

404
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:53,680
and the price is negotiable.

405
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,190
First...

406
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,690
Let's start with a ballpark figure first.

407
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,400
90.

408
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,160
What? 90?

409
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,190
Why don't you just go and rob instead?

410
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,200
What's the current market like?

411
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:06,560
What's the market value?

412
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,160
Yeah.

413
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,340
Everyone.

414
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,250
Be quiet.

415
00:19:09,270 --> 00:19:10,510
At this rate,

416
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,320
it will rise to 100 sooner or later.

417
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,640
And when all of you enter the market, it will rise even more.

418
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,080
90 is already very cheap.

419
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:21,180
And I have sufficient quantity to cover all of you.

420
00:19:21,550 --> 00:19:22,900
Use your brains

421
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:26,500
and cherish this last chance to survive.

422
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:34,450
Instead of being held accountable,

423
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,120
and be punished with your assets confiscated,

424
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,340
why don't you admit defeat now?

425
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:42,970
At least you can save your life,

426
00:19:43,650 --> 00:19:45,650
and have some money for retirement.

427
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,880
Everyone,

428
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:51,700
please cherish

429
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,110
this opportunity

430
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:57,020
for the sake of your loved ones.

431
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:00,660
Come in.

432
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:02,640
Sir.

433
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,490
Something bad is about to happen to the treasury bills, Sir.

434
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:06,320
Why so?

435
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,140
The treasury bills were set up to help with the country's construction.

436
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:09,940
But now, it has gone against the original intention.

437
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:11,280
Those banks dumped their treasury bills illegally,

438
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,750
which needs to then be bought back as soon as possible.

439
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,210
They're already doing so.

440
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,750
Are they redeeming it at the stock exchange?

441
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:17,800
Whoever they sold it to previously,

442
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,400
they now have to bite the bullet

443
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,830
and buy it back from them.

444
00:20:20,950 --> 00:20:23,090
But, the price is up to others to decide.

445
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,360
Within just one transaction,

446
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,820
they'll lose everything.

447
00:20:26,210 --> 00:20:28,760
Sir, you knew about this long ago, right?

448
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:32,740
Yes, I knew.

449
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:34,510
I'm angry too.

450
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:36,450
But for some people, there's nothing I can do.

451
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:37,770
They are too greedy.

452
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:39,640
If we don't teach them a lesson,

453
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,900
they will never learn.

454
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,160
If the banks go bankrupt,

455
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,430
what will happen to the smaller investors?

456
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,260
They have real estate.

457
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,250
If we liquidate their real estate,

458
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,770
we should be able to fill their accounts.

459
00:20:47,770 --> 00:20:49,900
Then what about the retail investors?

460
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:54,270
Ruolai, this time,

461
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,610
some are opportunists, while others are vermin.

462
00:20:56,610 --> 00:20:58,810
Don't use your kindness on them.

463
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,590
But for some people,

464
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
they want to contribute

465
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,560
to the construction of Shanghai.

466
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,640
For them,

467
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:07,470
there's no other way.

468
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,160
They're on their own.

469
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,320
The first one is mine.

470
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,920
Take a look, Ms. Zhou.

471
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,010
This is so annoying.

472
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:29,480
If you haven't sold them yet,

473
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,030
you wouldn't know how much you've earned.

474
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,920
That's right. Keep your voice down.

475
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,080
We must keep an eye on it this time.

476
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,870
We won't sell it if it's anything less than 100.

477
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,220
Yes.

478
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,000
When we're all rich,

479
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:40,750
all of you

480
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:43,150
will get a new rickshaw each.

481
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,630
Great!

482
00:21:44,630 --> 00:21:45,240
Ling.

483
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,150
Go make two cheongsams.

484
00:21:47,150 --> 00:21:47,560
Okay.

485
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,040
I haven't worn one before.

486
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,530
As for me...

487
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:51,640
I'm going to

488
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,850
renovate this room slightly.

489
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
It's our façade.

490
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,950
That's right.

491
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,800
I shouldn't be making this fortune alone.

492
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,250
We should all reap our own dividends, right?

493
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,640
Thank you, Ms. Zhou.

494
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:06,100
Sell it while you can.

495
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:07,940
You must not be too greedy.

496
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:08,790
How annoying.

497
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:10,950
You've all earned enough.

498
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:11,800
So annoying.

499
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:13,200
Sell, sell, and sell.

500
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,640
When Wei comes back later

501
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:16,810
and asks about this,

502
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,800
we will all say that we have sold.

503
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:20,080
Why?

504
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:20,720
Yeah.

505
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,400
Wei's a nag. He's always asking when he sees me,

506
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,770
"Have you sold it? Have you sold it?"

507
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:26,760
He's doing it for your own good.

508
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,320
Old man,

509
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,520
I know he's doing this for our own good.

510
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,080
But this time,

511
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,000
didn't Wei ask us to sell it at 80?

512
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:36,380
But now it has risen up to 90.

513
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,800
If I had sold it at 80,

514
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:40,530
can you imagine how much less I would have earned?

515
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:45,030
Ruolai is back. Wei is back.

516
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,150
Wei, you're back.

517
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:46,960
You guys...

518
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,400
We've dumped them all.

519
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,660
Yeah, dumped them all.

520
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,470
Wen?

521
00:22:51,490 --> 00:22:53,150
Yes, I've dumped them all too.

522
00:22:53,930 --> 00:22:54,650
You guys...

523
00:22:54,670 --> 00:22:56,230
We've also dumped them all.

524
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,280
Any insider information?

525
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,880
There's too much hype around

526
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,190
the treasury bills now.

527
00:23:07,190 --> 00:23:08,520
The risks are mounting.

528
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,370
Don't be the last one

529
00:23:10,730 --> 00:23:12,060
in this game of pass the parcel.

530
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:12,790
No, we won't.

531
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:14,500
We're not fools. Don't worry.

532
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,450
Are you sure all of you have sold?

533
00:23:21,450 --> 00:23:22,540
Yes, we did.

534
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:23,230
Yes, we've really dumped them all.

535
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,620
Yes.

536
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:25,800
Okay.

537
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,320
Ms. Zhou, why don't you quickly help us dump them?

538
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:40,280
We've earned enough.

539
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:40,960
That's right.

540
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,850
Don't worry.

541
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,760
I've already asked my friends.

542
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,650
It's all ready.

543
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,640
I'll dump it away when it hits 100, okay?

544
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:47,560
Okay, fine.

545
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,530
Okay, that's it.

546
00:23:48,530 --> 00:23:49,720
Let's all go to bed.

547
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,280
The papers these days

548
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,540
are all about the construction treasury bills.

549
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
It's everywhere.

550
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,920
I know.

551
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:04,680
Even the head of the government bonds division,

552
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,630
and the Minister of the Treasury Department,

553
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,790
have rolled up their sleeves to promote the treasury bills.

554
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,330
And my brother and Wei Ruolai

555
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:11,280
have been so busy every day.

556
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,380
I'm not so sure this time.

557
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:17,970
On the surface, it's about revitalizing the industry and post-war construction.

558
00:24:17,970 --> 00:24:20,700
Could there be something more behind the scenes?

559
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,230
Jiang is just a warlord

560
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,590
by nature.

561
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,220
He's a dictator.

562
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,270
It's not the people he cares about,

563
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:29,570
it's the subsidiaries that are in his hands,

564
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:31,200
whether big or small.

565
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,180
That's why in the past few years,

566
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,980
he instigated them to spread their wealth around.

567
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,240
That's how he rules over them.

568
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,520
It's ridiculous and pathetic.

569
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,560
I don't think it's

570
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:46,540
going to be easy to recover

571
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,440
people's trust once it's lost.

572
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,290
People will be disappointed in Nanjing eventually.

573
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:52,200
By that time,

574
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:54,390
they will have a better choice.

575
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,900
Just like Wei Ruolai.

576
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:57,790
The case of counterfeit coins have disappointed him once.

577
00:24:57,790 --> 00:24:59,830
He'll be even more disappointed this time.

578
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:02,030
This process is very painful.

579
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:03,630
We all have feelings.

580
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,950
Only by personally experiencing,

581
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,390
reflecting,

582
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,600
and thinking,

583
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,310
can we climb out of the ruins of so-called faith,

584
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,650
and better cherish the light

585
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,240
in the darkness.

586
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,510
[One month later]

587
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,640
Sir.

588
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,220
We need to start taking precautions.

589
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,610
If someone starts to sell short,

590
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,310
it's bound to cause a panic sell-off.

591
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:35,310
They dare not.

592
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:36,930
Why would they not?

593
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:39,210
They've made a lot of money in this round.

594
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:41,470
That's precisely why there's no need for them to sell short.

595
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,470
They've earned money from the bank.

596
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:45,130
Why would there be a need to hurt the people again?

597
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,180
Besides, ruining the treasury securities

598
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,880
will affect the overall situation.

599
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,400
Nanjing will not agree.

600
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,120
Don't worry.

601
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,160
I won't give them a chance to sell short.

602
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,860
We're the Central Bank. Besides money,

603
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,920
we are also protected by law and guns.

604
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,220
Trust me.

605
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:34,000
That's all for today.

606
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,260
The market is closed. Come again tomorrow.

607
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,520
Don't worry, Mr. Song.

608
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,640
I know you're worried about the market overheating.

609
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:40,400
But today,

610
00:26:40,510 --> 00:26:41,280
I've gathered

611
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,080
all the banks,

612
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,920
and asked them to lock the warehouse

613
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,830
immediately after closing.

614
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:46,310
They are not allowed to sell for the next five years.

615
00:26:46,310 --> 00:26:47,620
This will stabilize the price of the treasury bills

616
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:49,460
within a reasonable range.

617
00:26:49,310 --> 00:26:52,290
[Locking up the warehouse to control prices]

618
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,230
I know.

619
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,720
Locking up the warehouse to control prices.

620
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,810
Locking up the warehouse to control prices?

621
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:58,170
He's too naive.

622
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:01,430
The Treasury Department has officially issued a statement today

623
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:02,630
to clarify the rumor.

624
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:06,180
They have no plans to recall the treasury bills in advance.

625
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,910
Once this news gets out,

626
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,170
the price of the treasury bills...

627
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,680
With this undertaking, the banks

628
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,750
will be spitting out all the money

629
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:18,710
they've earned in the past few years,

630
00:27:18,710 --> 00:27:20,570
and may have to even make up for it.

631
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,730
After you finish profiteering off the banks, the next should be the retail investors, right?

632
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,190
We've already made almost twice the profit.

633
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,310
In my opinion, the time has come.

634
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,700
When trading begins tomorrow,

635
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,030
let's use the money we've earn to short it,

636
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,980
and make twice as much of what we already have.

637
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,980
What do you think?

638
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:38,450
Sure.

639
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,430
Of course.

00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:03,370
Get rid of all your treasury bills.

643
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,680
I don't think that's right.

644
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,320
We agreed to lock the warehouse today.

645
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,120

649

The movement of the construction treasury bill is very odd today.

00:28:50,710 --> 00:28:51,990
Dump all the treasury bills.

652
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:53,780
Dump as many as you can.

653
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,150
Shouldn't we be locking the warehouse instead?

654
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:56,890
If I tell you to dump it, just do as I say.

You want to sell them all?

Don't panic. Listen to me.

669
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,280
The issuance of this construction treasury bill was led by Central Bank.

But the truth behind it

689
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,550
must not be known to the public.

690
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:01,340

We ask that the public take a rational view of all investments.

715

The construction treasury bills do not involve backroom deals,

716
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,449
and any transaction is completely personal.

717
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,300
I believe the people of the Republic of China are responsible.

718
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:23,000

719
00:34:23,389 --> 00:34:26,230
I urge the public

720

They were recruited from the military at the last minute.

Jiang took the people's hard-earned money,

731

Our greatest enemy, the Japanese, is at our doors but he's not concerned.

Those words are still ringing in my ears.

741
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,460
They've become huge moths themselves.

742
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,950
I'm a little worried about Wei Ruolai.

743
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:16,870
This time,

744
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,300
Nanjing will definitely force the Central Bank to take the blame.

745
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:21,180
My brother can't bear the pressure.

746
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:22,240
Being next in line,

747
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:24,400
it means Wei Ruolai will have to execute the details.

748
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,320
If he does so,

749
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,510
his hands will be stained with blood,

750
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:29,460
and become a flaw in his resume.

751
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,560
As long as we can get

752
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:39,470
the list of transactions involving malicious manipulation of securities,

753
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:41,600
we can then reveal the truth.

754
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:45,120
It's just that the stock exchange has been seized.

755
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:49,620
Seized?

756
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,270
This is the building structural plan of the stock exchange.

757
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,000
Find a chance to sneak in,

758
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:04,260
and find the list containing the larger-volume transactions.

759
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,050
Okay.

760
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,390
Congyun.

761
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:23,460
Sir.

762
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,760
Write a report,

763
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,680
recording every detail of

764
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,570
the issuance of the treasury bills,

765
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:30,290
and hand it over to the Treasury Department.

766
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,170
Central Bank

767
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:34,960
will not take the blame.

768
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:36,190
Yes, Sir.

769
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,200
Go back to work.

770
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,200
Sir.

771
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,740
I suggest we compile a list of all the transactions immediately,

772
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,340
and track down the mastermind.

773
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:55,360
We should do it as soon as possible.

774
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:57,890
Otherwise, they might destroy the evidence.

775
00:36:58,850 --> 00:36:59,760
Sir.

776
00:36:59,830 --> 00:37:00,790
Stop hesitating.

777
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:04,320
The list of large transactions is kept strictly confidential.

778
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,660
They may not be willing to provide.

779
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:08,220
There are exemptions in the case of malicious financial incidents.

780
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,200
We can force the stock exchange to break their confidentiality, Sir.

781
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:11,930
Let it go, Ruolai.

782
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,730
There's too much at stake,

783
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,370
and we can't rush it either.

784
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:16,770
Sir.

785
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:17,650
Right now,

786
00:37:18,190 --> 00:37:20,250
what matters most is public opinion.

787
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:22,400
We need to give the public

788
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,890
a reasonable explanation as soon as possible.

789
00:37:23,890 --> 00:37:26,270
If we don't pacify the anger of the people, there will be chaos.

790
00:37:26,270 --> 00:37:27,950
The public will be pacified

791
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:29,900
if the culprits are caught and punished,

792
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:30,460
Sir.

793
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,950
I am guessing that this time, it's still the work of

794
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:33,680
Zhang Mingquan and Yu Shiqing.

795
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,260
I wish it was just them.

796
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,460
Then who is it, Sir?

797
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:46,100
Revealing the truth will incite even greater public outrage.

798
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:49,120
If it gets out of control, the consequences will be unimaginable.

799
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:49,920
Is it Nanjing?

800
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:02,610
It seems that Mr. Song already knew about it.

801
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:04,340
Mr. Song is still trustworthy.

802
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,200
Then is it someone even higher up, Sir?

803
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:07,840
Who is it?

804
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,320
Stop guessing, Wei Ruolai.

805
00:38:09,320 --> 00:38:10,520
Stop guessing.

806
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:11,880
If we reveal the truth,

807
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,970
it's not just a few minions who are in trouble this time.

808
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,340
Our people will be completely disappointed

809
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,220
in our country.

810
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:18,150
The international community will also lose confidence in us.

811
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:20,050
Our party-state has just established a form of unification.

812
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:21,510
All the more reason to...

813
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,880
We're working on constructing infrastructure.

814
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,040
All the more reason to get rid of the old and bring in the new.

815
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,200
You can get sepsis if

816
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,640
you don't pick out an abscess.

817
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,680
If we don't fight now, the Central Bank's credibility

818
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,520
will be completely crushed.

819
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:30,920
What I am doing now is to protect the credibility of Central Bank.

820
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,240
Are we defending our credibility with lies, Sir?

821
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,280
At least we leave ourselves a lifeline.

822
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,400
This mountain has tigers and wolves who will devour our people's flesh and blood.

823
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,000
What's the use of keeping it?

824
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:46,840
I'm really ashamed to be part of this mountain.

825
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,550
What did you say?

826
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:51,820
You want to quit?

827
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,680
Sir, I thought about resigning

828
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,490
during the case of the counterfeit coins.

829
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,890
But I'd listened to you, and I have endured.

830
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:09,270
I can't take it anymore this time.

831
00:39:10,060 --> 00:39:11,020
I'm sorry, Sir.

832
00:39:11,350 --> 00:39:12,880
I, Ruolai, hereby resigns.

833
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:13,710
I'm sorry.

834
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,260
Wei Ruolai.

835
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:18,220
Wei Ruolai!

836
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,560
Liar!

837
00:40:44,830 --> 00:40:45,950
You're all liars!

838
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:46,900
Wen!

839
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:48,230
Wen!

840
00:40:48,250 --> 00:40:50,040
Give me back my money!

841
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,590
You stay right there!

842
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:52,430
Wen!

843
00:41:00,790 --> 00:41:01,650
Give me back my money!

844
00:41:01,650 --> 00:41:03,250
Wen!

845
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:04,630
Liar!

846
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:06,230
-Wen!
-Give me back my money!

847
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:06,990
Don't come over!

848
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:07,880
Don't come over!

849
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,280
Back off!

850
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:08,720
Don't move!

851
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:09,250
Back off!

852
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,280
I'll jump if you come any closer!

853
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,030
Okay, I won't move.

854
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:11,710
I won't move.

855
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,310
You said we could make money.

856
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,480
Where is the money?

857
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:15,590
Why did you lie to me?

858
00:41:15,590 --> 00:41:16,220
I'm not lying.

859
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,130
Wen, come down.

860
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:18,880
You said I could buy!

861
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:19,540
Yes, I did.

862
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,180
But I told you not to borrow money.

863
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,670
-You said we could make money.
-Come down.

864
00:41:22,670 --> 00:41:23,670
The radio said so,

865
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,680
the newspaper also said so,

866
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,040
you said so, Ms. Zhou said so too.

867
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,760
Everyone said we could make money.

868
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,840
Why did you lie to me?

869
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,120
We can pay back your debts slowly.

870
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:30,690
Come down first.

871
00:41:30,690 --> 00:41:31,680
There's no future.

872
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,340
The debt collectors are here.

873
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:35,640
Not only did I lose all the money I earned,

874
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:38,170
I also owe them hundreds of silver dollars.

875
00:41:38,170 --> 00:41:39,530
A few hundreds!

876
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,520
How could I ever pay them back?

877
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:42,600
I couldn't pay it back even if I worked so hard that my legs broke.

878
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,310
I can't even pay the interest.

879
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,560
I'll pay it back for you.

880
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:47,010
I'll pay them back for you.

881
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,800
I'll catch all those bastards,

882
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,710
and I'll pay them back for you.

883
00:41:49,710 --> 00:41:51,030
Come down, Man.

884
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,440
I'll do you justice.

885
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,080
You can't fight them at all.

886
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:56,390
Look at what happened to the case of counterfeit coins.

887
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:58,790
So many brothers died in vain.

888
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:01,800
What's going to happen even if you hold it in?

889
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:03,710
We can't do anything

890
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:05,940
but watch them cheat us

891
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,950
out of all our hard-earned money.

892
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,960
Those bastards...

893
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:15,540
They didn't plan to spare us at all.

894
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:16,080
Man.

895
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:19,100
Get down first, Man.

896
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:19,990
Wei.

897
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,300
You are a sheep, not a wolf.

898
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,540
Just quit early.

899
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,180
Otherwise, you'll be eaten by them sooner or later.

900
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:41,960
Wen!

901
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,570
Wen!

902
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:44,670
Wen!
