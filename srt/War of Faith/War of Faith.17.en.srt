00:01:38,150 --> 00:01:39,080
Shoulder width.

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,410
One foot one.

7
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,310
One foot one.

8
00:01:44,830 --> 00:01:45,400
Welcome.

9
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,430
Take a look.

10
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,150
The sleeves... One foot and a half.

11
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,229
One foot and a half.

12
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,590
Waist...

13
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,270
Two feet one.

14
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,070
Two feet one... Can you make it tighter?

15
00:01:58,070 --> 00:01:59,789
Mr. Xu. I want to accentuate my waist.

16
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,950
You have long legs. A looser cut

17
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,640
will look good and feel good.

18
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:06,250
Okay, I'll listen to you. Mr. Xu.

19
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:06,920
That's right.

20
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,960
Take it in three days.

21
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:08,740
Okay.

22
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,580
What would you like?

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,550
Mr. Xu.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,000
Long time no see.

25
00:02:24,590 --> 00:02:25,310
Come on.

26
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:26,860
Have a seat.

27
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,270
I finally arrived safely.

28
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,130
I was worried

29
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:39,980
you wouldn't recognize me.

30
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,660
Indeed.

31
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:42,280
How many years has it been?

32
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:44,870
Even your hair has turned white.

33
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:45,860
You too.

34
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,470
When we went our separate ways,

35
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,070
you didn't have forehead wrinkles.

36
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:50,730
I don't have them now, either.

37
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,660
How have you been?

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,870
Are you used to living in Shanghai?

39
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,270
No.

40
00:02:56,270 --> 00:02:59,040
Especially the food. They put sugar in everything.

41
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,700
I couldn't get used to Jiangxi food either.

42
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,360
They put chili in everything.

43
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,670
I wish we could switch.

44
00:03:04,710 --> 00:03:06,640
You're wanted by the authorities.

45
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:08,390
Your photos are everywhere.

46
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:11,190
So, after talking with the German,

47
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,680
I have to hurry back to Jiangxi Soviet.

48
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:19,260
Did it have to be you?

49
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,840
It's too risky.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,490
We had no choice.

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,910
Only I can speak German.

52
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:26,130
I know about trade too.

53
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,590
The tungsten ore business

54
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:29,040
is our economic lifeline.

55
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,370
If it were someone else,

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
the organization might be worried.

57
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:33,470
Wait.

58
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:40,780
The representative of Rhine Metal, Hans.

59
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:43,829
Jinzhen met him before when she was studying abroad.

60
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:45,360
She wrote the details here.

61
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,270
Study it.

62
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,350
Try to understand the other party's personality

63
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,750
and win him over in one go.

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:52,100
This is great.

65
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:55,110
What do you want for dinner?

66
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:59,110
Your twice-cooked pork, of course.

67
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,670
I've been craving it for years.

68
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,190
Okay.

69
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:02,350
Twice-cooked pork it is.

70
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:02,910
Okay.

71
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:23,870
What is it?

72
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:25,270
Mr. Hans.

73
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,210
A Chinese person wants to see you.

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,350
A Chinese?

75
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,080
His name is Lei Ming.

76
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,430
Bring him up.

77
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,510
Wait for me in the mini-meeting room.

78
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,190
Okay.

79
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:48,159
Mr. Hans.

80
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,900
Long time no see.

81
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:50,350
Shen...

82
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,420
Why are you here?

83
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:54,230
My business partner is in Shanghai.

84
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:55,430
I'm here to say hello.

85
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,600
Please have a seat.

86
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:08,620
You know I hate surprises.

87
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,900
Maybe it's because you feel guilty.

88
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:12,460
I'm here today

89
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,850
on behalf of the Kuomintang government.

90
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:16,760
I heard

91
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,030
you were going to negotiate the

92
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,100
tungsten ore business with our enemy.

93
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,940
You are well informed.

94
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:22,890
Yes.

95
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,080
I've been in contact with

96
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,240
a very capable seller recently.

97
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,440
What do you mean by capable?

98
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,860
How much tungsten ore

99
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,640
can you provide us?

100
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,300
At what price? When can you deliver it?

101
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:38,730
Mr. Hans.

102
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:41,510
Business takes time.

103
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:42,780
You can't rush it.

104
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:44,170
I'm sorry.

105
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:47,470
We really don't have the time.

106
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,450
Actually, I'm here

107
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,270
to tell you to terminate our cooperation.

108
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:57,150
All our previous contracts are void.

109
00:05:57,880 --> 00:05:58,960
I remember that

110
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,670
Germans value the spirit of contract the most.

111
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:02,300
Right?

112
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:05,160
You broke the contract first

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:07,980
and couldn't deliver the goods on time.

114
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:09,490
This time, I'm not just

115
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:12,150
representing Rhine Metal,

116
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:16,720
but also acting on behalf of the German Ambassador to China.

117
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,190
As the Chinese party

118
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,550
has not been able to deliver tungsten ore on time,

119
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:38,800
the German party will terminate all military cooperation

120
00:06:35,430 --> 00:06:37,260
[Sino-German Treaty on Exchange of Raw Materials and Agricultural Products with Industrial and Other Products]

121
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,960
with the Chinese party.

122
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:45,330
It's boring to find excuses.

123
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:48,870
Aren't you doing all of this

124
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,070
to recover the loss you made

125
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,750
due to the tariff reform?

126
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:53,590
We understand that.

127
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,600
At the same time,

128
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,710
we are also trying

129
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,190
to increase the export of agricultural and mineral products.

130
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:58,350
We're doing a lot of things

131
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:00,030
and we're doing our best.

132
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:01,620
I'm not interested in that.

133
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,760
Germany could live without peanut oil

134
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,310
and cotton.

135
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:09,480
But we cannot live without tungsten.

136
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,910
You keep talking about tungsten.

137
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,370
But where is the tungsten?

138
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,950
Two-thirds of the world's tungsten ore reserve

139
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,680
is in China.

140
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:16,270
Two-thirds of China's tungsten ore reserve

141
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,150
is in Gannan.

142
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,670
Most mines in Gannan

143
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,390
are not in our hands

144
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:22,070
but with the Communist Party.

145
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,710
Yes, that's why I plan to talk to them.

146
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,190
Shen, our conditions for you are very simple.

147
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,350
The Chinese party must either restore the supply

148
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:36,400
or pay the penalty for breaking the contract.

149
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,070
1.3 million German Marks.

150
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:43,420
The German party will use that money

151
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:48,320
to purchase tungsten ore from Gannan.

152
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,500
I don't think you can do it.

153
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,190
We'll know if we try.

154
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:55,790
If so, I don't mind telling you

155
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,350
some top secrets.

156
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,120
Our Chairman Chiang

157
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,990
has taken the commander-in-chief seat.

158
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,590
This month, we have mobilized all the elite troops

159
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:06,200
and a total of 300,000 troops in the periphery to fight.

160
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,720
At the same time, several squadrons of the Air Force

161
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,550
are also being deployed

162
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:11,810
to the airport near Zhangshu, Nanchang.

163
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,390
The military force is unprecedented.

164
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:15,390
It's definitely not

165
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,830
like the last two tentative attacks.

166
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,070
In this case,

167
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,660
can you guarantee that the Communist Party

168
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,710
can provide you with the promised quantity and quality

169
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,510
on time?

170
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,830
It's a one-sided narrative.

171
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:26,740
Okay.

172
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,990
You don't have to believe me,

173
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,790
but I hope you can come to your senses.

174
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,670
No one else

175
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,760
can sell tungsten ore to you.

176
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,610
No one else can provide a stable supply.

177
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:35,799
Especially not the Communist Party.

178
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,470
Gun barrels, cannon barrels, and armored vehicles.

179
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:39,220
Without tungsten, they wouldn't be hard anymore.

180
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,220
Dare I ask

181
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,630
where your confidence comes from?

182
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:43,070
Are you threatening me?

183
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:44,770
I'm not threatening you, Mr. Hans.

184
00:08:44,770 --> 00:08:46,210
I'm just telling the truth.

185
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:47,480
We understand your difficulties.

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,880
But our difficulties...

187
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:49,830
Mr. Hans.

188
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:52,110
I hope you can understand as well.

189
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:54,030
But if you insist on

190
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,980
tearing up the contract...

191
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:56,760
I'm sorry.

192
00:08:57,150 --> 00:08:58,300
We will also immediately seek

193
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,270
collaboration with Britain and France.

194
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,070
From that moment on,

195
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:00,830
Germany

196
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:03,670
can never get any tungsten ore from us anymore.

197
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,590
You two go back and wait for me.

198
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,090
We'll discuss the details later.

199
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,120
I was representing Rhine Metal just now.

200
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:50,020
I know my attitude was bad.

201
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,110
Please forgive me.

202
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,230
Right back at you.

203
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,690
How can we talk in front of others?

204
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,690
Let's find a place to drink and talk.

205
00:09:56,510 --> 00:09:57,150
Okay.

206
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,450
Come, let's drink.

207
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:12,450
Shen, I told you.

208
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,300
In business,

209
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:18,240
you can't make friends if you don't drink.

210
00:10:18,790 --> 00:10:20,860
Are we not friends anymore if I don't drink?

211
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,290
It depends on your definition of friends.

212
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,300
In the past,

213
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,060
every time I needed you

214
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,120
when I couldn't pay rent,

215
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,660
you would help me.

216
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:31,620
When I failed my thesis,

217
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,990
you argued with the mentors for me.

218
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,390
I really feel that

219
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:37,990
without you,

220
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,030
I might not even have graduated.

221
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,580
You helped me too.

222
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,490
You taught Jinzhen and me German.

223
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,350
You also taught me Chinese.

224
00:10:47,510 --> 00:10:48,450
Without you,

225
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,770
I would not have

226
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:51,750
been able to marry a Chinese wife.

227
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:53,870
Ruolai.

228
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:55,970
Give Hans a toast in my stead.

229
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,410
Okay.

230
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,360
Okay.

231
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,840
No, you need two glasses.

232
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,990
One for you

233
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,560
and

234
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:05,230
one for him.

235
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,280
No problem.

236
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,150
Bro.

237
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:24,430
Nice!

238
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,800
Your mentor

239
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:36,440
is good at everything.

240
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:38,950
His only imperfection

241
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:41,390
is that he never drinks.

242
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,420
He's not like Jinzhen.

243
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:50,880
She drank at bars every day.

244
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:54,330
It was always so lively with her around.

245
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:55,650
Don't mention it.

246
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,780
She's just a drunkard.

247
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:58,840
She doesn't behave like a girl at all.

248
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,420
She's so charming.

249
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,270
If I hadn't been too old,

250
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,570
I would have pursued her.

251
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,370
By the way,

252
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,470
is she still single?

253
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,130
Of course.

254
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,550
With her personality,

255
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,830
do you think she can get married in China?

256
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:16,050
What about you?

257
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,770
What do you think of Jinzhen?

258
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:25,420
Very good.

259
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:26,790
Very good.

260
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:29,220
If you have the chance,

261
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,630
will you pursue her?

262
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:38,690
Well...

263
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:42,680
Don't worry, it's just a what-if scenario.

264
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,510
Don't be afraid of making mistakes.

265
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,620
Shen won't blame you.

266
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:47,940
Tell me.

267
00:12:51,870 --> 00:12:52,470
I...

268
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:56,830
Say it.

269
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:58,080
I might not.

270
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:02,830
Why not? Is she not pretty enough for you?

271
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:04,970
She's pretty. She's very pretty.

272
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,070
She's ambitious too.

273
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:06,950
But I think

274
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,140
girls like her

275
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:12,270
can't be bothered by worldly affairs.

276
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,040
So

277
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,080
she should remain single

278
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,470
and make explosives in the arsenal all day long,

279
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:19,120
right?

280
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:19,990
No, no.

281
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:20,470
Right?

282
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,840
No, Sir.

283
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,460
I didn't mean that.

284
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,780
Cheers.

285
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:42,460
Shen, we're almost

286
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,630
done drinking.

287
00:13:45,070 --> 00:13:47,100
While I'm still sober,

288
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,950
say whatever

289
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:50,800
you want to say.

290
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,950
Otherwise, I might wake up

291
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,090
with no memory of what you said.

292
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,520
Just one line.

293
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,870
For the sake of our friendship,

294
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:02,130
delay the delivery date of tungsten ore.

295
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,190
Our friendship

296
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,770
doesn't bear enough weight for that.

297
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:09,710
Tell me.

298
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:11,500
If Nanjing

299
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:14,340
fights with full force,

300
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:15,680
how long do you think

301
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:17,910
the Communist Party can last?

302
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:18,950
Do you really believe

303
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:21,070
an outlaw regime with a few mortars

304
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:23,110
can get a foothold

305
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:23,930
under our noses?

306
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:26,540
The German party can give you time.

307
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,660
I promise

308
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,900
I won't buy tungsten ore from the Communist Party for now.

309
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,440
But

310
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:41,030
you have to pay the penalty.

311
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,230
1.3 million German Marks.

312
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:51,290
The government can only offer 300,000 at most.

313
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,630
That's too little.

314
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,030
It's not even 30%.

315
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:56,660
Hans.

316
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,070
This is the highest amount

317
00:14:58,070 --> 00:14:59,060
I can get.

318
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:00,710
Now the government is in a dire state.

319
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:01,730
On one hand, we need to suppress the Communist Party,

320
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,590
on the other hand, we need to focus on development.

321
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:04,120
We're already at our limit.

322
00:15:05,430 --> 00:15:06,640
Napoleon once said that

323
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,320
China

324
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,820
is a sleeping lion.

325
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,470
The lion is awake now.

326
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,830
It just opened its eyes.

327
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,720
Give it more time.

328
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,480
China will become very powerful.

329
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,960
Your patience

330
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
will surely reward you handsomely.

331
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,600
Well,

332
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:27,330
I will negotiate with Rhine Metal

333
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,090
and the German ambassador.

334
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,910
I will try my best to buy you time.

335
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:33,740
But

336
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:37,150
I have a small condition.

337
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:37,830
Go ahead.

338
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:39,390
Win me again

339
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,550
in a drinking competition.

340
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,460
Come on.

341
00:15:47,510 --> 00:15:49,310
Sir can't drink anymore.

342
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,270
If you don't mind,

343
00:15:52,610 --> 00:15:54,020
I can drink with you.

344
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:37,190
Who allowed you to set off firecrackers here?

345
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:37,950
Go home.

346
00:16:38,810 --> 00:16:39,570
Go back.

347
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:40,670
Keep an eye on them.

348
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:41,020
Yes.

349
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:41,540
Yes.

350
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,850
Drink. Drink.

351
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:52,050
Nice!

352
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,340
Go on! Go on!

353
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,760
You might have to go to the hospital if you continue drinking.

354
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,980
They're drinking to their hearts' content.

355
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:17,810
Sir.

356
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:22,020
Sir, what's wrong?

357
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,000
Nothing.

358
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,099
I recalled some past.

359
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,180
When you were in Huangpu?

360
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,510
Back then, I drank with my closest classmates.

361
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:36,150
Just like that.

362
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,220
There's an old Chinese saying.

363
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:39,910
Life.

364
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:40,850
Life...

365
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,780
Life...

366
00:17:41,970 --> 00:17:44,530
Life should be enjoyed to the fullest.

367
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:46,420
Don't let your

368
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:47,860
wine glasses be empty!

369
00:17:51,810 --> 00:17:52,870
When we were tipsy,

370
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:55,160
the instructor recited a poem.

371
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,910
The students, at the peak of their youth,

372
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:00,240
are proud and spirited.

373
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,670
They are ambitious

374
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:03,950
and bold.

375
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,030
When commenting on state affairs,

376
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,280
they write with great passion and clarity,

377
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,080
treating those warlords and bureaucrats as dirt.

378
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:15,910
I thought those were such great words.

379
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,560
Such impactful words.

380
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,100
We must catch the Communist Party member

381
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,580
meeting the German this time.

382

Look at the back of my head if you don't believe me.

572
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:19,370
I have a big bump there.

573
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:39,580
Comrade Jinzhen is not bad.

574
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,050
She's a great help.

575
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,200
Go back and thank her for me.

576
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,970
Go back and say hi to Xiuying for me.

577
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,540
I don't know if we can

578
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:50,710
meet again in this lifetime.

579
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:53,190
We can.

580
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,300
We will.

581
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:57,660
The revolution will succeed someday.

582
00:31:58,550 --> 00:31:59,190
By then,

583
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,720
I want to eat your home-cooked

584
00:32:01,850 --> 00:32:03,200
twice-cooked pork again.

585
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,150
As for the alcohol money...

586
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:06,680
-We'll split it 50-50.
-We'll split it 50-50.

587
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:09,510
Take care.

588
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,260
Good luck.

589
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
After the tariff reform,

590
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:56,430
[The world is one]

591
00:32:53,850 --> 00:32:56,850
the government's financial income has increased greatly.

592
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:59,340
We've also achieved great results regarding our

593
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,330
tungsten ore negotiation with the German party.

594
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,340
We also acquired beneficial conditions.

595
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,740
Mr. Song is very satisfied with it.

596
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:06,920
He entrusted me

597
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:08,950
to praise your work.

598
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:09,830
Everyone,

599
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,560
thanks for the good job.

600
00:33:15,150 --> 00:33:15,900
However...

601
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,280
However,

602
00:33:17,870 --> 00:33:19,370
we can’t avoid the tungsten ore

603
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,810
supply problem.

604
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:22,680
As the only hard currency

605
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:24,520
that can be bargained internationally,

606
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,310
our Central Bank is responsible

607
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:27,540
for the delivery of tungsten ore.

608
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,060
I've called Manager He

609
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,730
to ask the informants at the front line

610
00:33:30,730 --> 00:33:32,180
to continue collecting information

611
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,430
for us to study.

612
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:34,900
We must find an alternative

613
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:36,960
other than military confrontation.

614
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,100
Ruolai.

615
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:39,270
Sir.

616
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,400
You lead the team to prepare for this.

617
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:43,220
I need an effective report.

618
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:43,820
Yes, Sir.

619
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,420
Congyun.

620
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,260
Congyun.

621
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,240
You are my secretary.

622
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,440
You're more familiar

623
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,920
with our bank's resources.

624
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,800
If Ruolai needs

625
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:54,510
any information or staff,

626
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,780
please support him.

627
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:56,940
Yes.

628
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,640
I have to go to Nanjing in a few days

629
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,790
to attend a special meeting

630
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:01,940
about the economic situation in Gannan.

631
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,400
We will definitely talk about tungsten ore.

632
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:05,590
Ruolai,

633
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,720
come with me.

634
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,650
Okay.

635
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:09,830
Okay, let's move on to the next topic.

636
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:11,100
You are still young. Eat more.

637
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,540
Okay, Assistant Manager.

638
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:13,699
By the way, Assistant Manager.

639
00:34:13,699 --> 00:34:15,550
Do you have any intel on

640
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:16,920
the meeting in Nanjing?

641
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,520
I heard that Chairman Chiang

642
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:21,320
will be attending that meeting.

643
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:24,580
He'll also shake hands and take photos with the attendees.

644
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:26,900
Secretary Huang,

645
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,340
haven't you always wanted to meet Chairman Chiang?

646
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,900
Yes.

647
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,120
We have plenty of opportunities.

648
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:34,360
Advisor Shen used to

649
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:35,830
take you everywhere he went.

650
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,630
But now,

651
00:34:37,090 --> 00:34:38,489
a country bumpkin

652
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,760
has replaced you.

653
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:41,230
It's not up to you

654
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:43,340
to criticize Sir's decisions.

655
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:45,429
Wei.

656
00:34:46,370 --> 00:34:47,350
Assistant Manager Liu.

657
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,239
Assistant Manager Lin.

658
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:48,969
You're here.

659
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,350
The seat's taken.

660
00:34:54,130 --> 00:34:54,770
Okay.

661
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,670
Enjoy your meal.

662
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,900
Let's eat.

663
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:01,110
Let's eat.

664
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,430
You two are young.

665
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:11,240
Eat more.

666
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:11,690
Okay, Assistant Manager.

667
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:13,270
Our work is taxing on the brain.

668
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:14,470
Eat more eggs.

669
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,420
Eat up.

670
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,360
People must eat to survive.

671
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:27,420
[Transportation system protest march creates a scene.
City public transportation paralysis results in travel difficulties]

672
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:35,980
Come in.

673
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:40,600
Sir.

674
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,630
I just read the newspaper.

675
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,960
The staff and workers of the Traffic Department

676
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,020
are on strike.

677
00:35:49,530 --> 00:35:50,090
Yes.

678
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,500
Recently,

679
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,560
the Traffic Department has been a bit unreasonable.

680
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:54,360
What about it?

681
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:56,400
Does Miss Shen own a car?

682
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,830
Why do you ask?

683
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,600
I'm worried that Miss Shen will encounter

684
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:03,490
the strike march when she returns from the arsenal.

685
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:04,730
You are so busy every day,

686
00:36:04,730 --> 00:36:07,060
yet you still have time to worry about her?

687
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:09,040
No, I just wanted to remind you.

688
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:14,000
Take the driver to pick her up

689
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,240
and send her home.

690
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,180
I'll go back too.

691
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,630
Yes.

692
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,630
We're against the car rental increase!

693
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:28,830
We want to live!

694
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:31,460
We're against the car rental increase!

695
00:36:31,460 --> 00:36:32,660
We want to live!

696
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,010
We're against the car rental increase!

697
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,290
We want to live!

698
00:36:54,890 --> 00:36:55,690
Stop!

699
00:36:56,350 --> 00:36:57,110
Stop!

700
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,390
Stop!

701
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:00,740
Are you okay?

702
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:03,450
Why did you hit him?

703
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:05,730
They just want to live

704
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,110
and fight for their rights.

705
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:08,150
Miss, go!

706
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:09,020
It's too chaotic here, Miss.

707
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:09,970
You can leave by yourself.

708
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:10,830
I have something to do.

709
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,090
It's too chaotic here.

710
00:37:12,670 --> 00:37:13,470
Let's go.

711
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,260
Go!

712
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:14,940
Wei Ruolai!

713
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,820
Let's go, Miss.

714
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:17,290
Wei Ruolai! I'm not done here!

715
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:18,050
Let me go!

716
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:20,810
Wei Ruolai!

717
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:42,970
I'm sorry, Miss Shen.

718
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:45,510
It was too chaotic just now.

719
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,440
I think it's too serious this time.

720
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:54,180
There might be a lot of casualties.

721
00:37:55,970 --> 00:37:58,100
You think they shouldn't go on strike?

722
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,500
I think they could have sent representatives

723
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,630
to the government for a petition and negotiation.

724
00:38:03,630 --> 00:38:04,880
If they could, they would have done that long ago.

725
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,730
They wouldn't have had to resort to this.

726
00:38:06,730 --> 00:38:07,990
When a tiger approaches you

727
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,630
to eat your flesh and drink your blood,

728
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,340
how will you negotiate with it?

729
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,020
What?

730
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,700
You can't answer it?

731
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,770
I just think they are civilians,

732
00:38:17,770 --> 00:38:18,500
not bandits.

733
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,030
We shouldn't use such extreme means

734
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:22,230
to solve the problem.

735
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,030
Those who gain benefits

736
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,520
should be loyal and patriotic.

737
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,180
You're finally back.

738
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,560
You scared me.

739
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:40,940
I heard it was dangerous out there.

740
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,010
Are you okay?

741
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:42,780
I'm fine.

742
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:44,920
The traffic system in Shanghai has collapsed.

743
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,470
The road was full of rickshaw pullers.

744
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:47,110
I know.

745
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,160
Let's talk inside.

746
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:48,820
Come with me.

747
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,790
No, thanks.

748
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,160
Mr. Shen has been waiting for you.

749
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:51,720
Hurry.

750
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,620
Come in.

751
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:52,970
Yes.

752
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,560
If it weren't for Ruolai,

753
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,340
I wouldn't know how to come back.

754
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,780
It's outrageous.

755
00:38:58,810 --> 00:39:00,550
The police were beating people.

756
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:01,650
If Ruolai hadn't stopped me,

757
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,870
I would have fought with them.

758
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:04,550
Fight for what?

759
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,240
Are you fighting with the police again?

760
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:09,510
If Ruolai hadn't picked you up,

761
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:10,670
I'd have to go to the police station

762
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:11,470
tomorrow to bail you out.

763
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,830
Mind your own business.

764
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,070
I can handle it myself.

765
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:15,470
Handle what?

766
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,460
It's a mess outside.

767
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:19,650
When will it end?

768
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,830
Yu didn't even dare to go to school today.

769
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,230
This matter can only pass if they arrest

770
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:24,890
a few people to scare the rest.

771
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,360
You only know how to arrest people.

772
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,630
Why can't you face

773
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,580
the public's demands?

774
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,600
Why do you have to arrest them?

775
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:31,350
Is this how the government

776
00:39:31,350 --> 00:39:32,340
solves problems?

777
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,330
Do you think a few rickshaw pullers

778
00:39:33,330 --> 00:39:34,760
could make such a scene?

779
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,710
There must be someone behind this.

780
00:39:36,710 --> 00:39:38,030
Then why do you have to arrest them?

781
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:38,730
Why can't you just nicely...

782
00:39:38,730 --> 00:39:39,950
Tell me what I'm supposed to do.

783
00:39:39,950 --> 00:39:41,270
Anything but this!

784
00:39:41,270 --> 00:39:43,030
All right, what are you two doing?

785
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:44,830
We're at home, not in the office.

786
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:45,760
Can we eat now?

787
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:46,580
-No.
-No.

788
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:50,390
I'm fed-up.

789
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,200
I'm not eating because I'm going to Nanjing.

790
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,730
Why are you being stubborn?

791
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,630
You're going to Nanjing?

792
00:39:55,750 --> 00:39:56,590
Now?

793
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,650
It was supposed to be tomorrow morning.

794
00:39:57,650 --> 00:40:00,250
Mr. Song called and asked me to go there overnight.

795
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:01,900
-Why are you going to Nanjing?
-Are you done?

796
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,160
Come with me upstairs.

797
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,130
Why are you going to Nanjing?

798
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:05,230
-Go upstairs with me.
-Are you done?

799
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,590
Go pack up.

800
00:40:06,630 --> 00:40:06,990
Don't you know

801
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,300
you are working for the bad guys?

802
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:09,430
You're not solving problems.

803
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:10,480
Instead of solving problems,

804
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:11,820
you waste your time on these stupid things.

805
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,730
Stop talking. Hurry up.

806
00:40:12,730 --> 00:40:13,810
I'm so mad.

807
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:14,420
Hurry.

808
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,520
I'm so mad.

809
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:20,420
I'm sorry you had to see that.

810
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:21,410
No worries, Sir.

811
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:22,970
Go home and pack up.

812
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:24,570
See you at the train station.

813
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,230
Sir,

814
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:26,380
could you

815
00:40:26,850 --> 00:40:29,140
let Secretary Huang go with you this time?

816
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,980
Are you busy?

817
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,290
Last time, you asked me to lead

818
00:40:33,430 --> 00:40:35,500
the settlement report on the Communist bank.

819
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,580
I want to get it done as soon as possible.

820
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:38,020
There's no rush.

821
00:40:38,250 --> 00:40:40,080
We're going to Nanjing this time.

822
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:42,140
You can show your ability in front of the higher-ups.

823
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,670
It's beneficial to your future development.

824
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:45,990
I understand.

825
00:40:46,580 --> 00:40:48,310
But I think the report is more urgent.

826
00:40:48,310 --> 00:40:49,570
As for connections...

827
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,870
Tell me the truth.

828
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:57,250
I heard from Secretary Huang this morning that

829
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:59,090
he wanted to see Chairman Chiang more.

830
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,050
So I...

831
00:41:00,670 --> 00:41:01,930
So you want to help him?

832
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:02,600
Yes.

833
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:04,960
I want to meet John Keynes the most.

834
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,560
-I'm not interested in politicians.
-Enough.

835
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,140
Stay here.

836
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:21,950
Wen.

837
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,680
Wei.

838
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,730
Why are you here?

839
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,930
What took you so long?

840
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:25,880
Let's go.

841
00:41:25,890 --> 00:41:27,470
Hao has been waiting for you.

842
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,070
Hao?

843
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:28,600
Hao.

844
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:29,630
Come on.

845
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:31,330
Come on.

846
00:41:31,370 --> 00:41:31,860
Wei.

847
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:32,310
Come on.

848
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:33,470
Get the bowls and chopsticks.

849
00:41:33,470 --> 00:41:34,030
Sit down.

850
00:41:34,150 --> 00:41:34,870
Get the utensils.

851
00:41:34,870 --> 00:41:36,350
Hurry up.

852
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:38,280
When were you released?

853
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,190
This morning.

854
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:40,560
He was released this morning.

855
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:40,860
Here.

856
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:41,270
Okay.

857
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,050
Here. My first toast

858
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:44,250
goes to Ruolai!

859
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,040
Come on.

860
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:45,980
Hao.

861
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,470
Thank you for taking care of me in jail, Hao.

862
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:49,640
No, we should thank you.

863
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:50,130
Right?

864
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,910
Yes, thank you, Wei.

865
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,440
If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have earned my money back.

866
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,810
Hu, tell me.

867
00:41:54,830 --> 00:41:56,080
What happened when you were in jail?

868
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,210
In jail, thanks to Ruolai's guidance,

869
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,550
we got our hard-earned money

870
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:00,750
back from the stocks.

871
00:42:00,890 --> 00:42:01,620
We'll listen to you.

872
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,740
We'll sell all our stocks tomorrow.

873
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,070
Then we'll quit, right?

874
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,020
Yes, we quit!

875
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,350
The stock market is risky.

876
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:08,430
You must quit it.

877
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,560
To be honest, we are not greedy.

878
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:13,290
It's enough that we can get our money back.

879
00:42:13,290 --> 00:42:14,330
Thank you.

880
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:15,750
I will

881
00:42:16,490 --> 00:42:17,690
remember this favor.

882
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,330
In the future,

883
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,760
if you need our help in Shanghai,

884
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:21,710
just let me know.

885
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,680
Wei's business is our business,

886
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:25,080
Right?

887
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:25,840
Yes! Come on.

888
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,630
Come on, Wei.

889
00:42:27,650 --> 00:42:28,810
Thank you, everyone.

890
00:42:28,810 --> 00:42:29,350
Thank you, Wei.

891
00:42:29,350 --> 00:42:29,950
Thank you.

892
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:31,280
Cheers.

893
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,320
By the way,

894
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,170
recently,

895
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,300
all the rickshaw pullers in Zhabei are on strike.

896
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:37,640
Did you also participate?

897
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:38,860
We are all poor buddies.

898
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:40,060
We must support them.

899
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,270
We just came back from the protest.

900
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:42,730
We had a fight with those dogs

901
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,860
in police uniforms.

902
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,590
Here! Buddies seated outside!

903
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:46,350
Come on.

904
00:42:46,890 --> 00:42:48,120
Brothers!

905
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,550
Hao is making a toast.

906
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:50,880
We're all here.

907
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:54,200
Brothers, have a good meal,

908
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,320
replenish your energy,

909
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:56,880
and keep fighting them!
